<i>Episode 2</i>

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,430
Please.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please wait a moment.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,150
I’ll go to inform Young Master.

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,360
Ban Heng.

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
Pay attention to your appearance.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Pay attention to your appearance.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,750
Why did Your Grace
come to my mansion today?

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
This man is annoying,

44
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,280
but he is indeed good-looking.

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,590
Sorry about my abrupt visit.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,590
Greetings, Count Cheng’an.

47
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,560
Greetings.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
May I ask,

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
what brings you here?

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,360
Thank you

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
for exonerating my family

52
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,750
in court earlier.

53
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,120
This is a little something

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,960
to show our gratitude.

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,030
I appreciate that,

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
but your gift is...

57
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,150
Take it.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
It... It means a lot to me,

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
but I want you to have it.

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,360
Alright then.

61
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,030
That’s too generous of you.

62
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,360
Don’t mention it.

63
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,240
Come here.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,400
Look.

65
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,870
King

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,470
and Flame.

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
Both crickets have swept the board

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,430
in all six sites in the city.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,430
They’re invincible!

70
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,870
Enough. Stop embarrassing yourself.

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,000
Let Young Master Ban continue.

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,870
I can’t wait to hear more.

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,430
I know you have a good taste.

74
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,430
King

75
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,750
is highbred and beautiful

76
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,000
with a perfect body and a sharp mouth.

77
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,040
No one

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,070
can survive under his attack.

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,070
He’s won 40 times in a row
in the East Division.

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,830
Flame

81
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,430
was born a fighter

82
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,560
with a lot of potential.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,750
He’s a steady winner,

84
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,950
a legend with 38 victories

85
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,000
in the South Division.

86
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,600
When those two are together,

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,750
the war is on. Only one can win.

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,190
Bite him. Why are you so quiet?

89
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,750
Weren’t you two

90
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,040
eager to kill each other last time?

91
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,830
Why are you all polite now?

92
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,830
Maybe King feels sorry

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,750
about hurting the other

94
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,720
last time

95
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,510
and he’s thinking of a way to apologize.

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,830
The other cricket

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,630
reeks of old books.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
That’s why King is avoiding him.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
Bite him!

100
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,040
Flame is innocent

101
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,800
but being blamed for no reason

102
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,270
by someone with no sense of guilt.

103
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,560
Poor thing!

104
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,430
That stinky cricket

105
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,680
assumes he’s so hot

106
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,830
that the whole world loves him.

107
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
That’s right.

108
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,240
He’s one of a kind.

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,270
Or he wouldn’t be so expensive.

110
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,870
Shut up!

111
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,160
You must apologize!

112
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,040
King bit the other first.

113
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,920
So he should apologize to Flame.

114
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,950
Go on! They’re battling.

115
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,920
I don’t have all day

116
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,360
to bicker with you.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Calm down, Baroness.

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Alright.

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,750
Do you dare play?

120
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,430
The loser must apologize.

121
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,390
Have a try, Count Cheng’an.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,560
Fine.

123
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,750
Please do it for me, Young Master Ban.

124
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,430
I won’t let you down.

125
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,390
Watch out, sister!

126
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,240
Whose side are you on?

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,430
The war concerns no kinship. Bite him!

128
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,070
Bite him!

129
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,600
Go on. Do it!

130
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Bite him!

131
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,920
Yes, good boy!

132
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
Go ahead!

133
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,190
Bite again!

134
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,680
You cheated!

135
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,000
Whatever. Anything to win.

136
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,800
Bite him!

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,980
<i>Butler Rong</i>
Go, go, go!

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,390
Do it. Come on! Go ahead.

139
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Bite him!

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,430
I won!

141
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,720
I won.

142
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,510
Admit it.

143
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
Useless!

144
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,630
I apologize.

145
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,830
-Apology accepted.
-You’re good as always.

146
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,360
Let’s go, Ban Heng.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,560
We can play again next time.

148
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,630
Crickets are surprisingly fun.

149
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,830
I hate Count Cheng’an. I hate him!

150
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,480
Don’t be mad, Baroness.

151
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,270
Calm down.

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,190
Let me burn some soothing incense.

153
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,060
<i>Celebratory Bedding and Clothing</i>

154
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,190
Him again?

155
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
What kind of person is he?

156
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,310
He doesn’t deserve such a good look.

157
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,870
I’m so pissed!

158
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,310
If Count Cheng’an
is there to buy fabrics,

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,870
Mother will believe my words,

160
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,120
won’t she?

161
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,240
Mother!

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,820
<i>Celebratory Bedding and Clothing</i>

163
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
-Look at this color.
-Sure.

164
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,670
How could he come

165
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,870
to pick up fabrics himself?

166
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,120
I’m curious, too.

167
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,080
You know, a dream

168
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
isn’t reality.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
Mother, just be patient.

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
This isn’t too bad, though.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
If you and Xie Qilin

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
got married,

173
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,480
you couldn’t even afford new fabrics.

174
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I’ll take them all.

175
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,910
Deliver them to
Marquis Jingting’s Mansion.

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,030
Yes. You’ll receive them later today.

177
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,000
I’m needed elsewhere

178
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,360
and I have to go.

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,120
Mother...

180
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,550
Go home once you’re done shopping.

181
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Don’t drain yourself.

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Good day, Madam.

183
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,980
<i>Celebratory Bedding and Clothing</i>

184
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,600
Is that a coincidence?

185
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,910
Count Cheng’an!

186
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,910
What are the odds, Baroness?

187
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,910
You’re here!

188
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,630
Baroness, please let him go.

189
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,550
Please

190
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,510
don’t hurt him.

191
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,480
You’re mistaken, Baroness.

192
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,750
I’m on my way to pick up brushes and ink

193
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,000
and simply passing by.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
Stay here. Don’t go anywhere.

195
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,790
I’ll go get my mother.

196
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,150
I’ll be right back.

197
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,550
Why does she want her mother to see me?

198
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,440
Young Master, let’s go,
or we’ll be late.

199
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,000
Please.

200
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,840
How come Baroness Ban

201
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,200
is wherever we are?

202
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,960
Was she stalking you?

203
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,630
Isn’t that what I wish for?

204
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,000
I know.

205
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,960
Still, I think

206
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
she’s a threat.

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,000
What if you’re too close
to the Ban family

208
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,080
to get rid of them later?

209
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,840
I need to be on better terms with them

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,550
to find out the truth.

211
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,630
That’s our carriage.

212
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,360
Baroness.

213
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,600
Have a seat.

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,750
Where’s Mother?

215
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,000
Look,

216
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
last night, I dreamed about

217
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,390
seeing Count Cheng’an
at the fabric store

218
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
and it came true.

219
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Hua,

220
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,480
are you obsessed with him?

221
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
She means

222
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,720
her dream came true again.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,750
It did?

224
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,960
So is Xie Qilin going to be blind?

225
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,840
Are you an idiot?

226
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,840
If so,

227
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,870
our family will be doomed, you know?

228
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,870
How about this?

229
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,750
You two go home. I’ll go find Mother.

230
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,840
Sure.

231
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,270
Father, I heard Xie Qilin is back.

232
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
He is?

233
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,480
Is he blind?

234
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
They didn’t say.

235
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,200
Your sister’s dream...

236
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,840
Father, are you saying...?

237
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,630
Let’s go find out at the Xie’s Mansion.

238
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,150
Is he blind?

239
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Not yet.

240
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,030
He’s with a girl.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
A girl?

242
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
It must be that harlot.

243
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,200
No. Doesn’t seem like one.

244
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
Is it Xie Wanyu?

245
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,440
That’s not her dressing style.

246
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
How do you know

247
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,360
what she dresses?

248
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,870
That brat.

249
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,960
He eloped a few days ago

250
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,080
and came back seeing someone so quickly.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
How come she left?

252
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,030
He isn’t blind.

253
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,790
“Nature draws without ink.

254
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,480
-Rain plays songs with bamboos”.
-He’s fine.

255
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,600
What a shame!

256
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,030
Beautiful lines.

257
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
Young Master! Are you alright?

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,910
Did you get hurt, Young Master?

259
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,320
Let’s go. Come on.

260
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,550
Jump together on my count.

261
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,960
One, two, three.

262
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,750
Who are you?

263
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
Who are you? What are you doing here?

264
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,150
Darling, I’m sorry.

265
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,440
I shouldn’t have brought Heng to peek

266
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,200
at the Xie’s Mansion.

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,120
I’ll deal with you

268
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,630
once I get Heng out.

269
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,960
Darling. I won’t get up

270
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,750
until you forgive me.

271
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,790
I know I made a mistake.

272
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,870
I shouldn’t have acted on my own,

273
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,840
darling.

274
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,600
Kneel

275
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,440
all you want.

276
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,670
Darling! Darling!

277
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,870
I’m in serious trouble!

278
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,270
Count Xie will definitely make a fuss

279
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,790
after his son being injured by Ban Heng.

280
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,750
He’ll take action tomorrow in court.

281
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
Are you saying...?

282
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,120
Pass my order.

283
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,200
Stay away from it.

284
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,550
Check the Xie family in secret.

285
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes.

286
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,340
<i>Moonlight through the Cloud</i>

287
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,060
<i>Sky-holding Gate</i>

288
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,440
Your Majesty, the Bans are lawless.

289
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,000
My son’s blind in one eye
because of Ban Heng.

290
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please bring the assailant to justice,

291
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,750
Your Majesty!

292
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,300

294

Mother.

295
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,390
The court

296
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,360
is divided by
the Shis, Xies and Yans.

297
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,360
Heng’s case must be handled carefully.

298
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,030
Don’t act rashly.

299
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,000
Mother, this is between us and the Xies.

300
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
The other two families
won’t interfere, will they?

301
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,080
We don’t know for sure.

302
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,910
Be extra careful

303
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,480
in case we’re attacked from all sides.

304
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,350
The Bans and the Xies are equally
rich and powerful,

305
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,920
more so than others.

306
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,030
If the wrong one tries this case,

307
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,880
Heng will

308
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,310
definitely be in trouble.

309
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,510
But Count Cheng’an

310
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,200
can turn things around.

311
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,070
That guy again!

312
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,750
He’s the sole heir to the Rongs

313
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,030
and close to His Majesty

314
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,200
instead of the big three families.

315
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,920
He won’t take sides.

316
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
And he’s a role model for all scholars.

317
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I’m sure he won’t risk his reputation.

318
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
Only he

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,110
can uphold justice

320
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,110
and prove Heng innocent.

321
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,960
What’s wrong?

322
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,790
You’re on it.

323
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,270
No, no, no. I can’t do it.

324
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,510
We’re enemies. I don’t want to see him.

325
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,240
Open it.

326
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,110
Look at you, Ban Heng.

327
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,270
Are you in custody or on vacation?

328
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,920
The prison guard is kind.

329
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,550
Act like a prisoner.

330
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,400
If Mr. Shi

331
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,160
sees you having a feast in jail,

332
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,070
will he help with your case?

333
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,310
Relax. Once he’s here,

334
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,480
I’ll look miserable.

335
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,680
By the way, Hua,

336
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,640
did you bring me my crickets?

337
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,550
You’re the best!

338
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,590

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,030
and she had me bring him some food.

345
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,920
What are these?

346
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,350
Is there meat?

347
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,200
I haven’t had any for days.

348
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,960
This place is hell.

349
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,110
I don’t even have clean clothes to wear.

350
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
Hua, catch it!

351
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,310
Baron... Baroness.

352
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,480
This is an accident.

353
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,550
I’m sorry.

354
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,680
It’s... It’s fine.

355
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,550
I’m ordered to investigate this case.

356
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,030
Baroness Ban,

357
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,830
could you give us a minute?

358
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,440
Sure. My brother is innocent.

359
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,680
We’ll know the truth

360
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,640
if he and Xie Qilin tell us everything.

361
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,030
I’ll leave you two alone

362
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,030
and wait outside.

363
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,960
My back hurts!

364
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
It’s been a while
since I last saw Shi Jin.

365
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,110
He’s become even more handsome.

366
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,790
Baroness.

367
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,590
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

368
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,440
I’m sorry for troubling you
with Heng’s case.

369
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,640
That’s part of my job.

370
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,790
I assure you

371
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,270
that the truth will come out.

372
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,200
That’s great.

373
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,270
They all say

374
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,510
you’re inflexible,

375
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,030
but in my eyes,

376
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,200
you’re

377
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,270
as real as me

378
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,400
and easygoing.

379
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,440
What’s wrong?

380
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Thank you, Baroness.

381
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
No need.

382
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,750
Listen. You can

383
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,960
be yourself in front of me.

384
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,590
Don’t be restrained.

385
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,110
Thank you in advance

386
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,680
for dealing with Heng’s case.

387
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,640
Sure.

388
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,110
Young Master,

389
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,920
here’s the book Xie Qilin sleeps with.

390
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,920
I see.

391
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,260
<i>Collection of Poems</i>

392
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,100
<i>Nature draws without ink.
Rain plays songs with bamboos.</i>

393
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,440
“Nature draws without ink”.

394
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,830
The view here is extraordinary.

395
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Such beautiful scenery

396
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,200
deserves well-written couplets.

397
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,480
You first, Count Cheng’an.

398
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,110
Nature draws without ink.

399
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,550
Anyone?

400
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,510
Count Cheng’an,

401
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,680
that one is too difficult

402
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,640
for us.

403
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,030
Rain plays songs with bamboos.

404
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,550
Your Grace.

405
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,920
Feixian and Count Cheng’an

406
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,440
are talented.

407
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,920
<i>Nature draws without ink...</i>
Well-matched in poems.

408
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,550
That day, I saw

409
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,350
Xie Qilin and a woman doing couplets.

410
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,680
I’m nowhere near Count Cheng’an’s level.

411
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,350
You’re too modest, Miss Shi.

412
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,350
I’m lucky enough

413
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,880
to have met you here, Your Grace.

414
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,400
Whoever

415
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,880
marries Miss Shi

416
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,640
must be the real lucky one.

417
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,920
Unlike the one who takes that Baroness,

418
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,030
he must be cursed.

419
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
He is cursed.

420
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,480
Or Xie Qilin wouldn’t have eloped

421
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,310
and suffered a huge loss.

422
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,550
He’s a blind fool!

423
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,350
Ban Hua!

424
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,720
I thought

425
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,550
you wouldn’t come to such gatherings.

426
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,110
I wouldn’t,

427
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,310
but Miss Li wouldn’t leave me out of it.

428
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,830
You’re wrong about one thing, though.

429
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,920
He’s too blind to choose wisely,

430
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,160
but that has nothing to do with me.

431
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,510
Things didn’t go well between you two,

432
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,510
but he’s already blind.

433
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,880
I don’t think it’s appropriate

434
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,240
to rub it in.

435
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,400
Who are you to judge?

436
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,830
We’re here to do poems

437
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,160
as entertainment.

438
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,200
No need to be so hostile.

439
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,000
The investigation into Mr. Xie’s injury

440
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,350
is still ongoing.

441
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,480
Justice will be served eventually.

442
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,310
Let’s focus on poems now.

443
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,350
I agree with Count Cheng’an.

444
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,270
Why would a fine young man

445
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,510
fall for Shi Feixian?

446
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,720
I don’t get it.

447
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,480
It beats me.

448
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,830
Focus.

449
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,030
Hit on what he likes.

450
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,270
Ban Heng’s case is the priority.

451
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,160
I’m really in need of help.

452
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,720
May I have a word with you

453
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,270
if it’s not too much trouble?

454
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,750
We can

455
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,830
talk here, Baroness.

456
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,000
I’m afraid we can’t.

457
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,070
I’d really appreciate it

458
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,750
if we can talk in private.

459
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,790
I wonder...

460
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
If we…

461
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,720
Can find...

462
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,790
Let’s talk somewhere else.

463
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
Why is she suddenly so polite?

464
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,510
What’s gotten into her?

465
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,680
Goodness!

466
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,110
Feel free to speak your mind.

467
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,720
You’re making me uncomfortable.

468
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,440
If you don’t go with me,

469
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,790
I’ll continue talking like this.

470
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,070
It’s my pleasure

471
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,680
to speak to you, Count.

472
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,350
Please excuse me.

473
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,550
I’m sorry.

474
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,350
Thank you, Count.

475
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,160
Please follow me.

476
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,200
Baroness,

477
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,070
where are you taking me?

478
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,200
If it’s not too much trouble...

479
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,000
Drop your act.

480
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,160
What is this about?

481
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,030
Uh...

482
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,680
Oh, right.

483
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,270
Listen,

484
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,920
gentlemen value justice

485
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,480
while the crooked men cling on benefits.

486
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,640
Gentlemen know right and wrong.

487
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,790
They’re selfless and considerate.

488
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,750
I believe

489
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,590
you, Count Cheng’an,

490
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,920
are a gentleman.

491
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,680
Gentlemen are aboveboard

492
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,200
while the crooked men...

493
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,750
The... The crooked men...

494
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,310
The crooked men...

495
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,640
Gentlemen are aboveboard,
while the crooked men...

496
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Rocky!

497
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,550
The crooked men are rocky.

498
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,720
What do you want?

499
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,960
Just cut to the chase.

500
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,640
Or are you really picking a fight?

501
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,790
If there’s nothing else, I’m off.

502
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,790
Wait.

503
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,350
Forget it. Read it yourself.

504
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,110
I can save my breath.

505
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,980
<i>Gentlemen value justice...
The crooked men are sneaky.</i>

506
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
Young Master.

507
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,030
I understand why you’re here.

508
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
But I’m needed elsewhere.

509
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,310
Please excuse me.

510
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,510
Will you help me or not?

511
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,790
Sorry.

512
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,720
He didn’t give me an answer.

513
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,960
I’m so sick of his tone.

514
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,830
Sir,

515
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,160
I learned you have
valuable books in stock.

516
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Is Collection of Poems in them?

517
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,440
Collection of Poems.

518
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,960
I remember that one.

519
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,510
There’s only one copy.

520
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,790
Someone paid a fortune
for it months ago.

521
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,590
Only one copy? What a shame!

522
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,420
<i>Collection of Poems</i>

523
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,620
<i>Purity Teahouse</i>

524
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,550
<i>Purity Teahouse</i>
Welcome.

525
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Count Cheng’an, what a coincidence!

526
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,220
<i>Purity Teahouse</i>

527
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
<i>Purity Teahouse</i>
Are you also here for tea?

528
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,240
No.

529
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,920
I’m here for you.

530
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,400
I demand an answer.

531
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,720
Will you help

532
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,510
with my brother’s case or not?

533
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,350
If I interfere

534
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,350
and stick my nose into others’ business,

535
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,590
that won’t benefit any of us.

536
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,640
I’m sorry.

537
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,310
I think you don’t know
what you’re doing.

538
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,270
Let me give you a hand.

539
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,030
Baroness,

540
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,110
please stop.

541
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,550
Why should I?

542
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,030
This road isn’t yours.

543
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,310
Why can’t I take it?

544
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,200
It’s fine.

545
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,030
You’re right.

546
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,480
Everyone can take this road,

547
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,070
but better not

548
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,350
go in the wrong direction.

549
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,000
Sir, how much is this weasel hair brush?

550
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,680
I need this brush.

551
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,550
I’ll take it.

552
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
I’ll take it and pay you double.

553
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,750
I’ll take it and pay you double.

554
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,880
These, too.

555
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,310
I’ll pay you double.

556
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,350
I’ll take it and pay you double.

557
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,000
Gentlemen are selfless and considerate.

558
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,110
If you’re interested in calligraphy,

559
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,350
I can give them to you.

560
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,030
Your Grace,

561
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,270
if you want them back,

562
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,750
just say the word.

563
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,200
I’ll give them all to you.

564
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,720
Sir, bag it.

565
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,960
I’ll pay you tenfold.

566
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,350
Young Master,

567
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,270
aren’t you only going to buy a brush?

568
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,140
<i>Li’s Stationer</i>

569
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,440
You...

570
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,500
You tricked me!

571
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,220
<i>Xie’s Mansion</i>

572
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,640
Mr. Shi, greetings.

573
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,160
Were there visitors
when Mr. Xie was injured?

574
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,480
No.

575
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,480
Miss Xie,

576
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,550
where were you that day?

577
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,070
At home working on a recipe

578
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,070
without going out.

579
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,070
Was there a witness?

580
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,880
My maid Yun was with me all day.

581
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,240
She can testify for me.

582
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,400
That day,

583
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,400
Miss Xie was studying how to cook...

584
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,960
the mixed stew.

585
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,110
She didn’t leave the house.

586
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
This way, please.

587
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,480
Are books

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,240
more attractive than me?

589
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,790
What a nerd!

590
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Actually,

591
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,680
he’s a hot nerd.

592
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,680
Still nothing?

593
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,270
Let me show you what I’ve got.

594
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,030
You may leave.

595
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,640
Your Grace,

596
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,960
how could you say no to me?

597
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,070
Baroness, you...

598
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,880
You’re wearing

599
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,200
too much makeup.

600
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,240
Honestly,

601
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,350
it’s too strong for you.

602
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,590
Wanyu,

603
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,720
go talk to Shi Feixian.

604
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,830
Father,

605
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,750
must she hide the truth?

606
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,550
Qilin already said

607
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,000
it has nothing to do with her.

608
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,310
Better leave her out of it

609
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,920
in case of more trouble.

610
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,830
I understand.

611
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,960
Feixian.

612
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
What brings you here?

613
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,550
I need a favor.

614
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,800
Please don’t tell others

615
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
that you went to see Qilin that day.

616
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,440
Where is he?

617
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,360
Crap!

618
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,230
Stop!

619
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,590
How was your nap?

620
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,550
None of your business.

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,280
Can you

622
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,280
focus on what’s important?

623
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,280
You dozed off

624
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,710
because you were worried too much

625
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
about your family
to sleep at night, right?

626
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,070
Your help can make me sleep better.

627
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,400
Your Grace, here’s the thing.

628
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,000
Only if you help me

629
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,360
will I let you go.

630
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,110
Please behave yourself in public.

631
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,230
Reputation matters to good people.

632
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,920
Mine is too bad

633
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,440
to be saved.

634
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,030
But you’re different.

635
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,710
Do you want to be like me?

636
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,190
What are you doing?

637
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,400
I’ve finished it and I’m going home.

638
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
You can’t!

639
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,760
Young Master!

640
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,320
Please go back and wait for the news.

641
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,920
What do you mean?

642
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,280
If you keep badgering me,

643
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,800
I can’t help you even if I want to.

644
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,840
Am I right?

645
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,150
So is that a yes?

646
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,190
His answer is too ambiguous

647
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,030
to relieve any stress.

648
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,110
Will he help me or not?

649
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,030
Guess I can only

650
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,510
rely on myself.

651
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,060
<i>Xie’s Mansion</i>

652
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,320
Check over there.

653
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,670
You again!

654
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,480
Your family must have a thing

655
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,070
with walls.

656
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,030
You think I don’t want to use the door?

657
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,030
What are you doing here?

658
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:05,800
Has Xie Qilin

659
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,710
bought you over?

660
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,510
I caught you red-handed!

661
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,110
Calm down, Baroness.

662
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,550
I’m here this late for the case.

663
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,110
In the middle of the night?

664
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,150
You’d only come at this hour

665
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,880
for some dirty dealing.

666
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,230
Aren’t you also here?

667
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,150
I’ve given you my promise

668
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
and I’ll certainly

669
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,320
do my best to give you an answer.

670
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,880
Have you found anything?

671
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,960
Not yet.

672
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Why did I believe you?

673
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,880
Goodbye.

674
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,110
You’re going to see Xie Qilin, right?

675
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,710
The easiest way

676
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,320
is to make him correct himself.

677
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,550
Don’t stand in my way

678
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,590
unless you have other ideas.

679
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,960
I’m not stopping you,

680
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,070
but are you sure

681
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,550
this will work?

682
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,920
I’ll have to try it first.

683
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,710
Here’s a friendly reminder.

684
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,920
Don’t try any rough stuff

685
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,320
with him.

686
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,400
Rough stuff?

687
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,760
Am I that kind of person?

688
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,150
Baroness Ban!

689
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,030
Be quiet!

690
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,710
They say

691
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
a wrong marriage begets misfortune.

692
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,670
Both of us are victims.

693
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
I admit that I hurt you.

694
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,110
I deserve this.

695
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,190
Relax. Bastards always live long.

696
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,030
I’m not here to kill you

697
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,960
but to ask you for a favor.

698
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,440
By... Holding a dagger against my neck?

699
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,590
That’s unique.

700
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,280
Or would you listen to me?

701
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,320
What do you want?

702
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,000
It’s time for me to rest.

703
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,710
Please let Ban Heng go.

704
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,800
Mr. Shi has taken this case.

705
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,190
You’ve come to the wrong person.

706
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,400
We grew up together.

707
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,510
You all think he’s an underachiever

708
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,400
and a troublemaker,

709
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,630
but I know

710
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,320
he’s good for one thing.

711
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,550
That is, he never lies.

712
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,400
If he injured your eye,

713
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,550
he’d admit it.

714
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,000
Are you accusing me

715
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,880
of lying then?

716
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,400
You tell me.

717
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,960
I’m here

718
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,670
to ask you

719
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,070
to tell the truth.

720
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,360
If my brother is to blame,

721
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,150
we won’t cover for him.

722
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,400
But if you’re venting your anger on him

723
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,070
for smashing your place,

724
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,440
then come to me.

725
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,190
I started the whole thing

726
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,550
and I’ll take full responsibility.

727
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,710
How?

728
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
Can you give me another eye?

729
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,190
Sure, if that’s what you want.

730
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,480
Take it yourself.

731
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,880
Are you done?

732
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,280
You should go.

733
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,840
I need to rest.

734
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,800
Xie Qilin.

735
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,510
Don’t.

736
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,760
Leave, or I’ll shout.

737
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
I’ll say you harass me.

738
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,400
Please don’t.

739
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,760
I’m not that desperate.

740
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,800
This is Count Cheng’an’s letter to you.

741
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,510
He said to read it
and you’ll know what to do.

742
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,110
Go west. Guards are fewer there.

743
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,000
“I have Collection of Poems.

744
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,360
Can we meet, Mr. Xie?”

745
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,230
Send Shi Jin in.

746
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

747
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,070
Long live, Your Majesty!

748
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,760
You may rise.

749
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

750
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,150
Shi Jin, how’s the investigation going?

751
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,480
Tell us everything.

752
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,480
After three days of investigation,

753
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,320
I’ve found more to the case.

754
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,630
What is it?

755
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,710
To be fair,

756
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,280
I want the victim Xie Qilin

757
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,030
to repeat what happened that day.

758
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,030
Say it. Go ahead.

759
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,510
Mr. Shi,

760
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,230
I’m afraid

761
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,110
I don’t remember.

762
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,710
You don’t remember?

763
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,760
