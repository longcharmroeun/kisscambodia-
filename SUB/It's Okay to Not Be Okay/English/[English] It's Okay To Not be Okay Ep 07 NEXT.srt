Ko Mun-yeong.

4
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,527
Ko Mun-yeong.

5
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,118
Run.

6
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:10,661
Run.

7
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,955
-It's okay, Ko Mun-yeong.
-Run...

8
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:14,582
-Please run. Go!
-It was just a dream.

9
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,083
Please run. Go!

10
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,502
Get out at once!

11
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:22,757
Get lost.

12
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:27,511
Leave at once.

13
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,939
Okay, I won't leave.

14
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,499
Why are you here?

15
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,379
-You were burning up all night.
-So?

16
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:44,964
You laid me down and played doctor?

17
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,636
Just stay in bed.

18
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,222
I'll drop Sang-tae off at his work
and pick up medicine.

19
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:54,807
I didn't do anything wrong.

20
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,853
That woman kept acting
as if she were my mom,

21
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,105
so I told her that my mom died.
That's all.

22
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,942
Right, okay.

23
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:26,380
CHAPTER 7
THE CHEERFUL DOG

24
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:29,008
Seongjin, Seongjin... Seongjin Plaza.

25
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:31,051
Michuri Public Health Center.

26
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,595
Seongjin, Seongjin... Seongjin Plaza.

27
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:34,138
Michuri Public Health Center.

28
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:38,100
Hiking... Hiking Trail Entrance.
Oeryong Bridge.

29
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,935
Stop memorizing that.
Go wash up, Sang-tae.

30
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:46,066
I'll take you to Jae-su's restaurant.
Let's head out together.

31
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,569
I can go on my own. On my own.

32
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:50,237
I know.

33
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,697
But I have to go downtown too.

34
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,659
You don't have to go
to the hospital today?

35
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,079
I'm going to

36
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:01,790
skip work today.

37
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,838
-<i>You can't leave like this.</i>
-Rewind a little.

38
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,173
Okay.

39
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:35,324
The patient may go through conversion
and stop deluding herself,

40
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:39,662
so let's keep an eye on her
and see what happens.

41
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,830
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

42
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:42,665
Sir.

43
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:46,252
I think you have to take this up
with Ms. Ko Mun-yeong as well.

44
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,922
First, let's find out
what she said to the patient.

45
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:53,259
I bet she said something like,
"Your daughter is dead."

46
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,052
So she fainted from the emotional shock.

47
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,554
How would Ms. Ko know about that?

48
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:59,974
Maybe Mr. Moon told her.

49
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,561
-They're close, you know.
-No, they're not.

50
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:11,068
You all know that he'd never disclose
any patient information.

51
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:18,117
Anyway, we've been having problems nonstop

52
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,452
ever since Ms. Ko started coming
to our hospital.

53
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,246
We need to do something about this.

54
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,747
Yes.

55
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:25,207
I agree.

56
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,792
Me too.

57
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,801
Could you please stop scraping off
your dandruff and make a decision?

58
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,513
Let's put her fairy tale class on pause

59
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,600
until we find out what really happened.

60
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,351
-Okay.
-Okay.

61
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:45,936
Would that be all?

62
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,606
Tell Mr. Moon
that I'd like to speak with him.

63
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,399
He didn't come in today.

64
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,860
He called earlier and said
that something came up at home.

65
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:54,653
Oh, really?

66
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,876
Sang-tae, how do you feel
about quitting the job

67
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,378
at Jae-su's restaurant?

68
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,758
You've been doing so many things
ever since we moved here.

69
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,511
Drawing the mural at the hospital

70
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,180
and selling pizza at Jae-su's restaurant.

71
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:23,057
When you start
working on the illustrations...

72
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,435
You'll be too busy.

73
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,562
Being busy isn't a bad thing.

74
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,607
Right, it's not a bad thing.

75
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,526
But if you're too busy,
you might fall ill.

76
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,738
-You may ache all over--
-Like a dog.

77
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:39,657
What?

78
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,159
You whimper like a dog at night
when you're ill.

79
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:46,038
I don't do that, but you always
whimper like a dog when you sleep.

80
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,793
Hello.

81
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,006
What? I do that?

82
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:58,676
That's odd.

83
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,345
I'm not ill.

84
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,430
I no longer work multiple jobs,

85
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:06,266
so I feel perfectly fine.

86
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,727
It's because your heart is aching.

87
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,106
"Your body is honest.

88
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,817
When you're in physical pain, you cry.

89
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,614
But the heart is a liar.
It stays quiet even when it's hurting.

90
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,367
Then when you're asleep,

91
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,162
you finally weep and whimper like a dog."

92
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,134
You like this book that much?

93
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:44,138
Yes, <i>The Cheerful Dog</i> by Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

94
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,639
"Written by Ko Mun-yeong.

95
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,100
Once upon a time..."

96
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,398
Oh, we're not open yet...

97
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,821
You jerk! You moved in with her
without discussing it with me.

98
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:02,281
Did you think I'd be happy to--

99
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,243
Hello?

100
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:08,370
Yes.

101
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:10,456
Let's talk later.

102
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,167
-Right.
-Later? When?

103
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,669
Hey! I'll be waiting, okay? Hey!

104
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:18,005
-Hi, Jae-su.
-Goodness!

105
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,716
Jeez. Hi, Sang-tae.

106
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,886
She's not feeling well.

107
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:28,182
<i>Come on. When did she start
feeling unwell? And what are the symptoms?</i>

108
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,143
<i>I need details!</i>

109
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,271
<i>She's not answering my calls.
I'm getting a bad feeling.</i>

110
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:36,774
-<i>I was worried all night--</i>
-I'll tell her to give you a call.

111
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:38,650
I have to go.

112
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,195
GEUKJIN PHARMACY

113
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:47,367
I can't believe
he hung up on me like that.

114
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:51,038
Gosh, that heartless prick.

115
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:52,498
Right?

116
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:56,960
He would be way more attractive
if he was more relaxed.

117
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,004
He's too uptight. What a shame.

118
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,173
But physically, he's totally my type.

119
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:07,679
You have to tiptoe around me
every single day,

120
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,932
yet you're still so dull-witted.
How's that possible?

121
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,604
Right? Had I been quick-witted,

122
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,398
I wouldn't have trusted you
and come all the way here.

123
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,192
Sorry about that.

124
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,486
It's all my fault.

125
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,491
I have to go check in on Mun-yeong.

126
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,577
Settle up with this

127
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:35,082
and get a latte or something
at a cafe somewhere.

128
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,254
See you later, sir!

129
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,888
That son of a bitch.

130
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,852
Maybe I should side with Ko Mun-young.

131
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,354
He that would eat the fruit
must climb the tree.

132
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,782
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

133
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:23,922
MR. LEE

134
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:36,393
Long hair suits you
because you take after me.

135
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,271
Never cut your hair short.

136
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:41,064
But I'm tired of it.

137
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,736
You have to listen to Mom, right?

138
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,071
Answer me.

139
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:53,869
Answer me!

140
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,997
Yes,

141
00:10:58,874 --> 00:10:59,958
Mom.

142
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,686
<i>Please...</i>

143
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:22,564
<i>Save me!</i>

144
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,004
Mun-yeong.

145
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:48,799
Are you okay?

146
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,093
I want to cut it,

147
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,554
but I just can't.

148
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:57,015
Cut what?

149
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,434
My mom.

150
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,692
Did you get sleep paralysis again

151
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,444
because of that hallucination?

152
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,614
Since when?

153
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:16,034
When did you start
experiencing them again?

154
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:22,791
The first day back here.

155
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,590
You can't stay here.
I'm taking you back to Seoul now.

156
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:33,844
I'm warning you.
Do not touch any of my stuff.

157
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,263
Then let me warn you as well!

158
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,557
I'm going to knock you out if I must,

159
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,100
so don't stop me.

160
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:43,020
I know that you'll be destroyed

161
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:45,188
if those hallucinations
start haunting you again.

162
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:47,524
So I absolutely cannot let you stay here.

163
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:49,067
I've had a bad feeling ever since

164
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,696
you talked about those red shoes
and moved here with that caregiver guy.

165
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:55,365
You two should've never gotten involved--

166
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,121
I've known you for ten years.

167
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:03,874
I at least know this much.

168
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,214
-Follow me.
-Let go!

169
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:12,549
Come with me!

170
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:13,925
-Let go!
-Come on.

171
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,219
Let go of my hand.
Do you have a death wish?

172
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,305
Sure, I'll die so you can live.

173
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,182
And you must leave this house to live.

174
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,726
Come on. Let's go.

175
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,439
-Jeez.
-I'm not leaving.

176
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,775
-Let go.
-I'm not leaving.

177
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:31,068
-Let go.
-I won't even budge.

178
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,487
You have to leave. Let go already.

179
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,615
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,161
You stay out of this.

181
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:42,913
Mun-yeong and I...

182
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,037
Will you get off me?

183
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:28,500
Well...

184
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:30,669
I'm taking her.

185
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,463
You should pack up
and get out of this place too. Hurry!

186
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,006
Let's go, Mun-yeong.

187
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,218
Did you just hit me?

188
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:39,719
-Kick him out at once.
-Hey.

189
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,013
Why are you acting all weak?

190
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,141
Dragging her against her will
is considered violence.

191
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,058
What?

192
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:46,601
You used it first,
so I can use it too, right?

193
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Hey, that hurts!

194
00:14:58,488 --> 00:14:59,906
Hey, wait!

195
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:01,867
Mun-yeong.

196
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,370
Hey, that guy doesn't know much about you!

197
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,915
I'm the only one who can
protect and look after you.

198
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:09,833
Mun-yeong?

199
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,594
Damn it!

200
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:30,437
Keep the door locked
when you're here alone.

201
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,064
-If anyone can--
-Do you think someone will harm me?

202
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:36,568
Come on. Me?
It'll probably be the other way around.

203
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:44,951
Still, keep it locked.

204
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,579
You said scary things can happen

205
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,123
when you let your guard down.

206
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:54,628
Take this fever reducer.

207
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,672
If I took crap like this
every single time I need to cool down,

208
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,925
I'd already be a junkie.

209
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,135
This won't cool me down.

210
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:06,139
Then get some fresh air.

211
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,256
I like what you prescribed me.

212
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:41,675
-Where do you want to go?
-A motel.

213
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,972
What do you want to eat?

214
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,181
You.

215
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,439
Are you going to keep this up?

216
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:00,277
Okay, fine. I'll follow
my doctor's instructions today.

217
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,112
What will you feed me?

218
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,072
Thank you. Enjoy.

219
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:06,616
This looks good.

220
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:08,660
Sang-tae.

221
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,962
No, don't say that. You have to say
"come on" to call me over.

222
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:24,426
When someone says "later,"
what does it actually mean?

223
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:25,760
Sometime before you die.

224
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,513
What? Before you die?

225
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,639
Yes.

226
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:31,808
No way.

227
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,687
We've known each other for so long.
He'd never do that to me.

228
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,023
For how long? How much?
1,000 won? 2,000 won?

229
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:39,983
I met you and Gang-tae

230
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,985
when I was only 16.

231
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,111
At Jae-su's Fried Chicken.

232
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,488
That's right.
My parents had a fried chicken place,

233
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:47,616
and Gang-tae worked there part-time
and lived with us.

234
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:51,077
I'm a year older than him,
but he never treated me as such.

235
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,913
And he always gave you all the drumsticks.

236
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,207
I only eat drumsticks.

237
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,459
I envied you.

238
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,378
I wished I'd also had
a little brother like Gang-tae.

239
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:04,132
So one day, I said to him, "Think of me
as your brother, you little prick."

240
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:07,761
Then he said,
"I don't need another brother."

241
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,764
-I'm his real brother.
-That was when I realized this.

242
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,186
"He needs a friend, not another brother."

243
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,688
I need a friend too.

244
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:30,450
It's good.

245
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,660
I guess what I needed was food,
not medicine.

246
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,748
This is awakening my ferociousness.
I feel much better now.

247
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,585
-It's not cooked yet.
-It's okay.

248
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:42,045
I have a lot of internal heat.

249
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:47,217
I can't control myself around food.

250
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:49,344
I'm hungry no matter how much I eat.

251
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,013
Is it because I'm an empty can?

252
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,147
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:04,317
I was just

254
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:06,611
talking nonsense then.

255
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,197
-It's true though.
-No.

256
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:13,368
You're not an empty can.

257
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,704
Then what am I?

258
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:19,541
Well...

259
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:22,710
A thug?

260
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:26,548
Eat up. It'll burn.

261
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,678
<i>As you may already know,</i>

262
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,055
I only sold chicken after that.

263
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,724
Fried, steamed, sweet and sour,
drumsticks, and even chicken feet.

264
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,476
-Why do you think I did that?
-Chicken head.

265
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,605
That's the only part you didn't sell.
The chicken head.

266
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,190
That's right.

267
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,360
-The chicken head isn't sellable.
-That's right.

268
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:52,282
You know, I didn't want to sell chicken.
I was even sick of the smell.

269
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:55,160
But it was the only kind of business
I could open and close quickly.

270
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:57,495
Because I didn't know
when my friend had to move again,

271
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,205
I kept selling chicken.

272
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:01,332
But this time, it felt different.

273
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,294
I felt that he might settle down
in Seongjin City.

274
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:07,756
So I put together all the money I had
and even took out a loan

275
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,092
to finally open a different kind
of business. No more chicken.

276
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,260
But he...

277
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,513
He left me.

278
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:16,973
Why?

279
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,976
Because he likes

280
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,480
that lunatic Ko Mun-yeong
more than me, his friend of 15 years.

281
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,149
-No, that's not why.
-That is why!

282
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:27,066
It was because of me.

283
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,236
Gang-tae followed me
because of my contract with her.

284
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,322
It's like a BOGO deal.

285
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:37,786
Don't trust Gang-tae too much.

286
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:39,412
You might end up like me.

287
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:40,872
Like you?

288
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,250
Like the dog that chased the chicken.

289
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:45,668
A dog?

290
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,426
A dog!

291
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,978
That was loud. I'm sorry. That was loud.

292
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:08,691
-Hello, Mr. Moon.
-Hello!

293
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,287
By the way, why aren't you eating?
You're just feeding me.

294
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:23,873
I'm not really hungry.

295
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:25,291
Have you ever slept with a woman?

296
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:31,005
-Never?
-Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

297
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,924
You seem to have no desires whatsoever.

298
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,469
You don't want to eat, have,
or do anything.

299
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:37,428
You always look apathetic.

300
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,264
-I'm not apathetic.
-Then what?

301
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,478
I'm just suppressing myself.

302
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:46,938
Why?

303
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,859
You do everything you want to do,
but that's not the case for most people.

304
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,029
Don't suppress yourself.
It shouldn't be that hard.

305
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,248
Your safety pin...

306
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,417
Shall I pull it for you?

307
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:11,546
I'm curious

308
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,549
to see what will happen
if you don't suppress yourself.

309
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,264
Hey, Byeol.

310
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:24,726
Patient Park Ji-hwan
falls from his bed easily,

311
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,645
so make sure you help him if he needs
to go to the bathroom at night.

312
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,732
I've already told Mr. O Cha-yong
everything he needs to know.

313
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,900
Both of you should check on him
when doing your rounds.

314
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,235
Okay, got it.

315
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,113
And as for patient Kim Jeong-mi's
depression...

316
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,740
Just a second.

317
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,745
<i>What's up? Sang-tae is here.</i>

318
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:47,624
<i>He's chatting with the employee
from Ko Mun-yeong's publishing company.</i>

319
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:48,625
<i>It's pissing me off.</i>

320
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,881
Who is it?

321
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,716
It's nothing.

322
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,720
-Where were we?
-Patient Kim Jeong-mi.

323
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:04,641
That was a lengthy explanation.

324
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,851
Let me sum it up for you.

325
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:10,521
If Mr. Lee Sang-in's muse is
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong,

326
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,691
then as the art director,
I get inspiration from you.

327
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:16,736
You're my muse.
That was what I was trying to say.

328
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:19,489
I see.

329
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,369
That's why

330
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,247
I brought some illustrations
you can refer to

331
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:30,792
while working on Ms. Ko's next book--

332
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:36,422
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving for the day.

333
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,634
It's rude to talk about irrelevant work

334
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:41,594
at someone else's workplace.
Complete nonsense.

335
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:46,265
Let's... Let's talk about it later.

336
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:48,142
"Later" means sometime before you die.

337
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,812
Jae-su, this is for you.

338
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:54,607
-Bye, Sang-tae.
-Bye!

339
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,572
What did he draw?

340
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:08,579
The dog that chased the chicken.

341
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:13,960
Why are we walking?

342
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,294
What?

343
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:18,464
It's nice to walk and enjoy the scenery.

344
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:22,009
It helps you clear your mind
and lifts your spirits.

345
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,763
Really? All I can think is that
my legs hurt and it's a waste of time.

346
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,099
-Then shall we--
-Will you carry me?

347
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:29,767
What?

348
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,272
I wonder if Sang-tae is on his way home.

349
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,233
I guess he's fine on his own.

350
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,278
No! Jeez.

351
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,701
So you should just focus on me.

352
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:49,704
Okay, give it back.

353
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:53,583
Come on. Give it back.

354
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,335
Stop it.

355
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:07,972
Are you

356
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:10,266
holding me in your arms now?

357
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,108
-Hey, Ju-ri.
-Hey.

358
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:23,196
Ko Mun-yeong?

359
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,865
My daring roommate
is in an awkward situation now,

360
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:27,992
so I'm answering his phone. What's up?

361
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,790
Well, he didn't come into work today.

362
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:40,421
He took the day off to hang out with me.

363
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:41,756
Bye.

364
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,928
You didn't go to work
because you were worried about me?

365
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,182
And you took me out on a date
to help me cool off?

366
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,144
Who said this was a date?

367
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:12,312
What was this, then?

368
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:15,315
Are you flirting with me?
Or are you feeling it out?

369
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:18,193
Are you just testing the waters?
Or are you playing me?

370
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:23,198
Fine.

371
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:25,492
Let's date.

372
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:31,373
"Get lost."

373
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,002
-What?
-"Get lost."

374
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,422
Do you know how many times
you've said that to me?

375
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:41,717
Even last night. And that day too.

376
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,136
So what?

377
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:46,388
But last night, it sounded like

378
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:49,349
you were begging me not to leave.

379
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:52,728
Last time, I ran away.

380
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:55,981
But today,

381
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,860
I thought I should stay with you.

382
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:06,283
That's all it meant.

383
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,589
Ko Mun-yeong, you heartless woman.

384
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,008
All my organs are rotting

385
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,053
because of the stress from
looking after you for the past ten years.

386
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:29,014
How could you gang up on me
with that caregiver you just met

387
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:31,308
and kick me out? Just how?

388
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:35,687
Fine, you two heartless jerks
can live happily ever after.

389
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:41,735
I'm going to find the kindest

390
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,862
and sweetest woman on earth and--

391
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,447
Shit!

392
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,951
You're so loud. Damn it!

393
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:01,630
Unrequited love is so hard. I give up!

394
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,268
I guess you've never seen a woman

395
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:16,979
who's heartbroken by unrequited love.

396
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:20,482
Hey, Jae-su.

397
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:29,908
Why

398
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:32,619
can't it be me?

399
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,998
Why that bitch?

400
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:39,960
I can

401
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,505
swear too.

402
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,008
And I can also

403
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:52,556
throw temper tantrums and smash things.

404
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:54,683
I can

405
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:59,021
stop acting nice all the time.

406
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,981
And I can

407
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,152
be a bitch too.

408
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:09,990
Gosh, no. Not everyone can be a bitch.

409
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,461
Who are you?

410
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:25,255
Why cut me off?

411
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:28,383
I'm not a weirdo.

412
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,886
I'm...

413
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:35,432
the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers.

414
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:37,351
My name is Lee Sang-in.

415
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,311
CEO LEE SANG-IN

416
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:01,083
So it's all your fault.

417
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,292
Don't cry.

418
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,920
Do you know me?

419
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:10,467
You should've talked Ko Mun-yeong
out of it.

420
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,470
Then she wouldn't have moved here,

421
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:16,682
and those two would've never met.

422
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,476
Then I wouldn't have ended up like this.

423
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,521
This is all on you.

424
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:26,358
CEO Lee Sang-in.

425
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:28,360
It's all your fault.

426
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,328
Hold on, this voice...

427
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:40,372
Are you...

428
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:42,165
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:43,250
My tears.

430
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:47,045
<i>Mr. Lee. I'm Nam Ju-ri,
a nurse at OK Psychiatric Hospital.</i>

431
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,631
Nurse Nam Ju-ri?

432
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,061
<i>Last time, I ran away.</i>

433
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:06,565
<i>But today,
I thought I should stay with you.</i>

434
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:11,737
What is it?

435
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,363
Nothing.

436
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,042
I had a nightmare last night.

437
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,547
My nightmares are always about my mom.

438
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:34,426
And when I wake up from the dream,

439
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:38,263
I always feel like shit.

440
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:41,933
But today,

441
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:45,437
I don't feel so shitty.

442
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,660
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

443
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,579
But why? Just why?

444
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:04,164
Why are they getting rid of the class?

445
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,958
I liked her class because it was always
like a big smack in the head.

446
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,127
I knew they'd get rid of it.

447
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:11,046
I always questioned her state of mind,

448
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,506
and she had a bad attitude.

449
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:15,258
-Are you a school superintendent?
-I'm just a super old man, you punk!

450
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:16,927
Stop hitting me in the head, will you?

451
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:18,804
You said you like a big smack in the head.

452
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:23,308
I did all the homework.
They can't get rid of this class.

453
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,812
I was confident
that she'd compliment me this time.

454
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,065
Are you possessed by a spirit
who wants to brag about doing homework?

455
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,110
Why cry so early in the morning?
You're ruining my day.

456
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:35,904
Why must you say such mean things
to A-reum so early in the morning?

457
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,322
You two...

458
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:39,366
Are you seeing each other or something?

459
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:41,827
Let's go, A-reum. Just ignore her.

460
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,999
I think they'll cause trouble
sooner or later.

461
00:32:58,093 --> 00:32:58,969
Did you eat?

462
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:02,347
<i>I had a fried egg, cubed radish kimchi,
three sausages, and soybean paste stew.</i>

463
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:04,975
What are you doing right now?

464
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,893
<i>I'm just sitting down.</i>

465
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:09,271
What about Ms. Ko?

466
00:33:09,646 --> 00:33:10,772
<i>She's just sitting down.</i>

467
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:11,898
What?

468
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:30,876
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

469
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,837
-Let's just have fun today.
-Okay.

470
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:46,349
Come in.

471
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,688
I heard you asked for me yesterday.

472
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:54,566
Yes, there's something I want to ask you.

473
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,405
Does Ms. Ko have a boyfriend?

474
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,620
Well, I'm not sure.

475
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:09,497
I have a son. I had him pretty late.

476
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,417
Anyway, I'd like to introduce him to her.

477
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:16,338
Don't worry. He takes after his mom,
so he looks nothing like me.

478
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:20,592
What do you say? Should I do it or not?

479
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,055
Why are you asking me?

480
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:26,389
Because you live with her.

481
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,531
Let's come separately next time.
People will get the wrong idea.

482
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,617
When are you done?
Let's go home together. I'll wait.

483
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,619
Does your car run on gasoline or diesel?

484
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:53,041
I've been psychoanalyzing people
for so long

485
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:57,629
that I can tell what their stories are
just by looking in their eyes.

486
00:34:58,213 --> 00:34:59,214
Why didn't you come in yesterday?

487
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:02,300
I wasn't feeling well.

488
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:03,885
You mean, Ms. Ko wasn't feeling well?

489
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:07,055
Yes.

490
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,516
Ms. Sun Byeol said

491
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,561
Ms. Kang Eun-ja acted like she was her mom
and bugged her. Is that why?

492
00:35:17,023 --> 00:35:18,358
It seemed like Ms. Ko

493
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:23,363
thought she was actually her mother
for a moment.

494
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:29,035
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>
WRITTEN BY DO HUI-JAE

495
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,580
<i>Ms. Ko's mother </i>

496
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,791
<i>is the writer, Do Hui-jae.</i>

497
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,463
<i>The day she finished the last book
of her fiction series,</i>

498
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:43,091
<i>she vanished without a trace.</i>

499
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:48,179
<i>Then she was registered as deceased
five years after she disappeared.</i>

500
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:52,308
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>

501
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:56,938
You're always one step late.

502
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,486
<i>Some believed that she was still alive.</i>

503
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:06,281
There were a lot of rumors back then.

504
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:11,119
Could she be alive?

505
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,123
Then she wouldn't have kept
her readers waiting for almost 20 years,

506
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,708
knowing how much they want

507
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:20,045
to find out what ends up happening
to the Witch of the West.

508
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,843
My nightmares are always about my mom.

509
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:31,931
It must've been a big shock to Ms. Ko.
And I'm sure she misses her a lot.

510
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:37,228
Maybe that's why she mistook
someone else for her mother.

511
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:40,148
But what if she doesn't miss her?

512
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:42,734
What if she fears her?

513
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,742
COUNSELLING NOTE
PATIENT NAME KO DAE-HWAN

514
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:53,286
HE GAVE SHORT, SIMPLE ANSWERS BUT DIDN'T
TRY TO AVOID ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS

515
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:07,801
My wife?

516
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:12,847
She was incredibly intelligent
and elegant.

517
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,185
She loved our daughter very much.

518
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:19,979
Maybe too much.

519
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:23,900
Every night, she sang

520
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,945
<i>Oh My Darling, Clementine</i> as a lullaby.

521
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:30,990
I wonder

522
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:36,955
if she knew
the true meaning behind the song.

523
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,346
KO MUN-YEONG'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
PUT ON PAUSE TEMPORARILY

524
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,650
-Ms. Park.
-What's the matter?

525
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:07,777
Are you sad
that her class is put on pause?

526
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:10,822
No.

527
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,452
I think the patients are sad about it.

528
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:18,538
They found the class
different and interesting.

529
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:20,999
It is interesting.

530
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:26,004
You should check out her books
when you have some time.

531
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,506
No, I wouldn't be able
to relate to those stories.

532
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:32,135
I like cruel and foolish love stories
or horror novels.

533
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,722
I'll take some water to the padded room.

534
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:38,224
All right. Thanks.
Take good care of the patient.

535
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:55,742
Would you like some water?

536
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:03,958
Well...

537
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:05,877
About your daughter.

538
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:09,547
You said you'd like me to meet her.

539
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,508
Next time she visits you, I will--

540
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:13,635
My daughter...

541
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,765
is dead.

542
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:22,852
Mom.

543
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:27,815
How are you going to meet a dead girl?

544
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:36,032
Even I can't meet her.

545
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:42,497
Dr. Kwon!

546
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:44,749
Darn it.

547
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,795
Dr. Kwon, Ms. Kang Eun-ja is showing
conversion symptoms.

548
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:50,755
What? Is she in the padded room?

549
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,048
-Yes.
-Let's go.

550
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:56,844
This shawl...

551
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,391
It's very expensive.

552
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:06,771
It's worth more than
hundreds of millions of won.

553
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,819
I had never received

554
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:17,156
something so expensive in my entire life.

555
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:21,411
We barely managed to afford a living.

556
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:25,331
But she spent her entire paycheck

557
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:28,167
to buy me

558
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,671
this shawl

559
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,756
for my birthday.

560
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,843
How much is this?

561
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,137
How many zeros are there?

562
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,266
Goodness! Go and get a refund right now!

563
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,978
I got so furious and angry.

564
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:52,442
So I slapped her really hard on her back.

565
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,697
Do you think somebody like me
deserves something this expensive?

566
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,532
I'm so sick

567
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:03,578
and tired of you being like this.

568
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,419
I don't remember much.

569
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:15,590
But I remember saying this.

570
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:19,218
<i>I don't need
an immature daughter like you!</i>

571
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,513
I ended up telling her that I don't need

572
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,518
a daughter like her.

573
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,998
<i>If I had known
she was going to die like that,</i>

574
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,167
<i>I never would've</i>

575
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:56,214
said something so harsh.

576
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:00,760
Never.

577
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,767
<i>-Gang-tae.
-Yes?</i>

578
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,270
You need to stay by your brother's side
until the day you die.

579
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:13,356
That's why

580
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,026
I gave birth to you.

581
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:30,415
Why in the world did I say that to her?

582
00:42:35,837 --> 00:42:37,004
I'm such an idiot.

583
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:21,299
Why do you look so sad?

584
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:24,635
You're making it hard for me to get angry.

585
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:27,138
You should also lie down.

586
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:40,943
Jae-su.

587
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:42,528
Yes?

588
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,698
Do you think

589
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:49,660
my mom also feels sorry

590
00:43:51,954 --> 00:43:53,456
for how she treated me?

591
00:43:57,293 --> 00:43:58,544
Do you think

592
00:44:01,923 --> 00:44:03,299
she regrets it?

593
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,595
Is that what you want?

594
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,017
Yes.

595
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:19,232
No.

596
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:33,037
Ma'am, why were you so mean to Gang-tae?

597
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:36,040
Sang-tae wasn't your only son!

598
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:37,625
I know he's sick, but still!

599
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,753
Why did you discriminate Gang-tae
and prevent him from growing up properly?

600
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:44,423
You're crazy.

601
00:44:48,594 --> 00:44:50,805
You just wait 60 years.

602
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:54,100
Once I meet you up there, I'm going to--

603
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:55,685
What are you going to do?

604
00:44:57,436 --> 00:44:58,271
My goodness.

605
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:02,316
All mothers are sinners.

606
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:08,155
But even so, cut your mother some slack.

607
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:14,412
Do you think it was easy for a woman
to raise kids without a husband back then?

608
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,038
My goodness.

609
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:20,626
I only have a daughter,
but even I wanted to run away at times.

610
00:45:22,295 --> 00:45:25,381
But your mother
successfully raised two boys.

611
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,050
On top of that, Sang-tae is one of a kind.

612
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:38,769
You've been taking care of your brother,
so I'm sure you know

613
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,897
how hard it must've been for her.

614
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:47,945
Cheers to us. This is for you up there.

615
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,013
My goodness, you're unbelievable.

616
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:16,140
Do you feel better now?

617
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:21,562
-Gang-tae came by and left just now.
-Why? Was he alone? What did he say?

618
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:25,441
If you like him so much,

619
00:46:25,524 --> 00:46:28,861
why did you come home
on some other guy's back last night?

620
00:46:28,944 --> 00:46:31,697
Someone carried me home? Really?

621
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:35,409
You know what? It's better not to know.

622
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:37,870
Just don't bother remembering anything.
That'd be best.

623
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:47,421
CEO LEE SANG-IN

624
00:46:47,546 --> 00:46:49,340
I'm the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers.

625
00:46:56,472 --> 00:46:58,557
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

626
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:01,602
I want you to fix this!

627
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:10,152
I must've lost my mind.

628
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:28,003
<i>Where are you? When are you coming?</i>

629
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,673
<i>Hurry up and come home. I'm bored.</i>

630
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:32,633
<i>Why are you ignoring me?
Are you kidding me?</i>

631
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:37,471
WATE.

632
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:42,101
WIAT.

633
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:47,815
WAIT.

634
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:25,256
Why are you so late?

635
00:48:26,382 --> 00:48:28,801
-Why were you sleeping here?
-You told me to wait. Damn it.

636
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:32,346
Did you drink?

637
00:48:33,806 --> 00:48:34,807
With whom?

638
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:36,475
That two-faced bitch?

639
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,103
No, not her.

640
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:42,023
I drank with Jo Jae-su,
a chicken farm owner's son,

641
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:44,358
and a live-in cook
who's over 60 years old.

642
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:46,986
Did you meet people from online?

643
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:48,404
"Meet people from online"?

644
00:48:50,823 --> 00:48:51,866
You're drunk.

645
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,244
I was drunk,

646
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:59,498
but the cab driver told me
he doesn't come here at night

647
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:02,793
because this place is scary
and brings bad luck,

648
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:04,545
and he told me to get out of the cab.

649
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:08,257
So I walked all the way here,
and I'm almost sober now.

650
00:49:12,803 --> 00:49:13,929
Then let's drink some more.

651
00:49:14,013 --> 00:49:16,557
No, forget it. This is
just the right amount of tipsiness.

652
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:18,893
I want to drink.

653
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:20,728
No, you can't.

654
00:49:21,562 --> 00:49:23,064
You never do things in moderation.

655
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,026
If both of us end up getting drunk,

656
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,696
it'll be bad.

657
00:49:32,073 --> 00:49:32,907
Why?

658
00:49:33,532 --> 00:49:35,034
Are you scared I might come onto you?

659
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,413
-Stop acting up.
-Did you just hit me?

660
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:41,499
You hurt me with a knife.

661
00:49:45,002 --> 00:49:46,629
You have good comebacks when you're drunk.

662
00:49:54,387 --> 00:49:56,263
I want to pull out your safety pin.

663
00:49:58,224 --> 00:49:59,141
Close your eyes.

664
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:01,394
Why?

665
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:02,895
Just close your eyes.

666
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,773
You're so cliché.

667
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:16,951
Here. Open your eyes.

668
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,373
What is this piece of crap?

669
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:23,749
A nightmare catcher.

670
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:29,505
If you sleep with this in your hand,

671
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:33,134
it collects your nightmares in its basket

672
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:34,885
and eats it up overnight.

673
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:38,848
Then you'll be able to sleep comfortably.

674
00:50:41,058 --> 00:50:42,309
How childish.

675
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:45,062
I brought it from home today.

676
00:50:46,355 --> 00:50:49,275
-It used to be my brother's.
-What? It's used?

677
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:52,820
I made it myself.

678
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,368
If it's handmade, I guess it's worth it.

679
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:02,747
This guy's name is Mang-tae.

680
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:08,669
Don't tell me you named it Mang-tae
because you're Gang-tae,

681
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:10,588
and your brother is Sang-tae.

682
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:15,593
The three of us

683
00:51:16,886 --> 00:51:17,970
are brothers.

684
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:22,016
Unbelievable.

685
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:26,520
To be honest,

686
00:51:28,481 --> 00:51:31,358
my brother also has nightmares
just like you.

687
00:51:34,487 --> 00:51:35,946
He's been having nightmares

688
00:51:37,698 --> 00:51:38,908
ever since our mom passed away.

689
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:49,710
My brother felt tormented,

690
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:53,631
but there was nothing I could do.

691
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,803
All I could do

692
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,847
was make him this silly doll.

693
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:09,772
Well, it's kind of cute
now that I take a close look at it.

694
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:15,027
-Do you want it?
-Yes, I want it.

695
00:52:17,029 --> 00:52:18,113
Okay.

696
00:52:19,323 --> 00:52:20,366
Good night.

697
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:37,883
Mang-tae.

698
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:57,736
Sang-tae.

699
00:52:58,487 --> 00:52:59,530
Are you sleeping?

700
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,700
Are you really sleeping?

701
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:10,416
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.
I'm... I'm so upset.

702
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:13,502
My gosh, you... You stink.
You reek of alcohol.

703
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:19,592
Sang-tae, let's have <i>jjamppong</i> someday

704
00:53:20,134 --> 00:53:21,927
at that place we used to go with Mom.

705
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:24,680
-It's at the entrance of the market.
-Yes.

706
00:53:26,682 --> 00:53:29,935
You used to love the <i>jjamppong</i> there.

707
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:34,023
No, you... You were the one who loved it.

708
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,110
No, you always--

709
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:41,322
"It has chili pepper and mussels inside.
The broth tastes amazing.

710
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:43,407
I want to have it every day, Mom."
You told her that.

711
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,744
That's why she bought us that<i> jjamppong</i>

712
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:48,829
every time the market opened.

713
00:53:49,413 --> 00:53:52,041
"It's spicy but tasty."

714
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:55,419
Sang-tae, <i>jjamppong</i> is spicy but tasty.

715
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:57,421
It makes me want to eat it again.

716
00:53:57,504 --> 00:53:58,589
HARIMGAK

717
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:01,050
The <i>jjamppong </i>is here.

718
00:54:02,718 --> 00:54:03,761
-Thank you.
-Sure.

719
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:05,763
Here. Eat up.

720
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:08,682
What about you, Mom?

721
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:10,017
I'm not hungry.

722
00:54:11,477 --> 00:54:12,311
Eat up.

723
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:14,688
It's... It's spicy.

724
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:17,441
-Is it spicy? Drink some water.
-It's spicy.

725
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:21,487
It's spicy.

726
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:24,281
My gosh, it's pouring.

727
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:30,287
You'll catch a cold. Are you okay?

728
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:44,259
Gang-tae, what are you doing?

729
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:49,348
-Gang-tae, get over here. It's raining.
-Gang-tae, get over here.

730
00:54:49,431 --> 00:54:50,265
Come on.

731
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,067
<i>Look at you. You're all wet.</i>

732
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:02,778
<i>Let's go home and get you changed.</i>

733
00:55:03,779 --> 00:55:04,863
<i>Be careful.</i>

734
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:08,575
<i>Gang-tae, should we
eat </i>jjamppong<i> again tomorrow?</i>

735
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:09,660
"Jjamppong"?

736
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,915
It's hard to lose five kilograms.
But I tried so hard.

737
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,543
I didn't drink Coke or eat rice,
and I lost five kilograms.

738
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:19,795
I lost five kilograms. It was amazing.

739
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:30,097
We... We need to listen to our mom.

740
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,182
We need to listen to our mom.

741
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:35,060
We need to listen to our mom
in order to be a good person.

742
00:55:35,686 --> 00:55:38,564
Our mom knows everything.

743
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:42,276
Our mom knows... She knows everything.

744
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:45,195
Don't catch a cold. Don't drink Coke.

745
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:16,477
My adorable son.

746
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:21,190
I'm so sorry for everything.

747
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:35,704
Sang-tae.

748
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:37,915
Yes?

749
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:47,424
I miss Mom.

750
00:56:49,259 --> 00:56:50,177
Yes.

751
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:54,890
I want<i> jjamppong</i>, too.

752
00:56:57,601 --> 00:57:00,729
I want <i>jjamppong</i> every single day.

753
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:38,475
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

754
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:39,977
<i>Everyone badmouths you</i>

755
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,771
saying you made Ms. Kang Eun-ja collapse.

756
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:44,314
But I never badmouthed you.

757
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:47,359
To be honest, that woman isn't sane.

758
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,653
She always wears the shawl she got
from her late daughter

759
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:51,405
and pretends like she's rich.

760
00:57:51,488 --> 00:57:53,907
-That darn geezer. Move.
-I really don't think--

761
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,034
Ms. Ko.

762
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,413
-She hit me again.
-Darn it.

763
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:03,750
Oh, gosh.

764
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,336
Emergency.

765
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:09,798
We have a situation. What should we do?

766
00:58:09,882 --> 00:58:11,300
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

767
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:14,511
Will you please be quiet?

768
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:15,929
Be silent.

769
00:58:17,055 --> 00:58:18,849
Are you trying to agitate the patients?

770
00:58:19,474 --> 00:58:21,226
Be careful when you use
the word "emergency."

771
00:58:21,518 --> 00:58:24,563
Ms. Ko is here. I think she came
not knowing her class got canceled.

772
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:28,609
She had this look on her face
and went to find the director.

773
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:31,278
-Didn't you call her?
-Didn't you?

774
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:33,155
Why didn't you?

775
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:35,741
-What?
-You guys are close.

776
00:58:35,824 --> 00:58:36,658
No, they're not!

777
00:58:37,242 --> 00:58:40,037
Wait. Wait a minute.

778
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,500
Does that mean
no one called and told Ms. Ko

779
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,627
that her fairy tale class got canceled?

780
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:48,378
What's wrong with you?

781
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:51,298
She found out through the notice board.
She must be furious right now.

782
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:52,549
I'll go find her.

783
00:58:54,051 --> 00:58:56,845
I used to run marathons when I was young.

784
00:58:57,387 --> 00:58:59,223
But one day, my knees got infected.

785
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:03,894
I should've gotten some rest,
but I just ran a marathon again.

786
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:09,191
In the end, my cartilage got ruined,
and I ended up with metal pins.

787
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:11,235
Now, it's hard for me
to even walk properly.

788
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:17,157
Don't make the same mistake I did
and try to run when you can't even walk.

789
00:59:23,288 --> 00:59:25,999
When you're tired, get some rest.
When you're sad, go ahead and cry.

790
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:30,087
It's okay to take a break.

791
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:31,755
Then one day,

792
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:36,051
there will surely come a day
when you'll be able to run again.

793
00:59:37,302 --> 00:59:39,721
I bet your daughter is cheering you on.

794
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:45,644
That darn geezer. How dare he cancel
my class without telling me?

795
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,105
There he is.

796
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:52,067
Darn, did he take drugs or something?
Why is he so fast?

797
00:59:58,991 --> 00:59:59,825
Ms. Ko!

798
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:08,458
Wait here for a second.

799
01:00:10,544 --> 01:00:11,878
Let me take you back to your room.

800
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:16,133
I'm sorry.

801
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,054
I'm guessing I put you
in a difficult position.

802
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:23,932
You didn't just put me
in a difficult position.

803
01:00:24,349 --> 01:00:25,475
I got fired.

804
01:00:26,268 --> 01:00:27,269
Hey.

805
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:29,146
How will you compensate for this?

806
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,074
This is expensive.

807
01:00:42,993 --> 01:00:45,746
-I want it.
-But that's...

808
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:46,913
Let me have this.

809
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:52,836
You told me you're sorry.
Then you should compensate for the damage.

810
01:00:53,378 --> 01:00:54,880
That's what you call a sincere apology.

811
01:01:05,098 --> 01:01:05,932
Give it back.

812
01:01:09,728 --> 01:01:11,021
Take it.

813
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,693
I've had it for more than enough.

814
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:29,915
Mr. Moon.

815
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:32,167
Yes?

816
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,003
The burden is finally gone.

817
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:50,769
Isn't it hot?

818
01:01:51,395 --> 01:01:52,896
I bet your neck is sweating.

819
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:56,942
If you want to be fashionable,
you must be uncomfortable and stubborn.

820
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:02,364
My brother is immersed
in one of your books these days.

821
01:02:03,323 --> 01:02:04,366
I know.

822
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:06,076
<i>The Cheerful Dog.</i>

823
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,543
<i>"Once upon a time,</i>

824
01:02:14,626 --> 01:02:19,631
there lived a dog that was
very good at hiding his emotions.

825
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:23,301
<i>The dog was tied beneath a shade tree.</i>

826
01:02:23,385 --> 01:02:25,804
<i>He always wagged his tail and acted cute.</i>

827
01:02:25,887 --> 01:02:29,266
<i>So he got the name, "The Cheerful Dog,"
because he was as cheerful as springtime.</i>

828
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:33,812
<i>The dog always had lots of fun
with the village kids during the day.</i>

829
01:02:34,062 --> 01:02:35,188
<i>But every night,</i>

830
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:40,402
<i>he'd moan and whine
when no one was around.</i>

831
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:45,574
<i>That's because
he wanted to cut off the leash</i>

832
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:49,953
<i>and freely run around
out in the spring field.</i>

833
01:02:50,454 --> 01:02:52,789
<i>However, he couldn't.</i>

834
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:55,667
<i>And that's why he cried every night.</i>

835
01:02:56,126 --> 01:02:58,920
<i>Every single night.</i>

836
01:02:59,754 --> 01:03:00,672
<i>One day,</i>

837
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:05,218
<i>a voice inside him asked the Cheerful Dog.</i>

838
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:10,974
<i>'Hey, why don't you just cut off the leash
and run away?'</i>

839
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:13,685
<i>And this is what the Cheerful Dog said..."</i>

840
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:18,607
"I've been tied up for way too long.

841
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,402
So I forgot how to cut myself free."

842
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,083
You did great, Mun-yeong.

843
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:40,253
What did I do?

844
01:03:41,505 --> 01:03:43,298
You helped her cut herself free.

845
01:04:13,537 --> 01:04:14,579
You will

846
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:20,836
end up like your mother.

847
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:26,091
You won't be able to escape.

848
01:04:28,802 --> 01:04:29,636
No.

849
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:32,514
I'm different.

850
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,964
Your...

851
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:51,593
-Your hair--
-I...

852
01:05:52,427 --> 01:05:53,887
cut off my leash.

853
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:12,948
PATIENT ROOM 201-208

854
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,604
It's all done.

855
01:08:34,047 --> 01:08:35,006
How do I look?

856
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:39,511
You look pretty.

857
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,378

<i>I'm just like your brother.</i>

Longer hair suits you better.

863
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:58,381
Why did she cut it? Why?

864
01:09:58,464 --> 01:09:59,549
<i>Chew on this.</i>

865
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:01,885
<i>Why do you think she lied?</i>

866
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:04,596
<i>It seems like something strange
is happening at our hospital.</i>

867
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:06,681
That woman

868
01:10:07,724 --> 01:10:08,725
is dead.

869
01:10:09,475 --> 01:10:11,311
<i>But she's here.</i>

<i>Safety pin and bomb.</i>

<i>Could you take a photo of us?</i>

873
01:10:19,694 --> 01:10:23,072
According to Mr. Lee, I sell one more book
every time I smile at a fan.

874
01:10:23,156 --> 01:10:24,782
An author only needs to write well.

875
01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:26,492
She's not a celebrity.

876
01:10:26,576 --> 01:10:28,578
-Are you jealous?
-Jealous, my ass.

877

<i>"Offer"?</i>
