Don't vote for candidate number one,
Kwon Man-su!

6
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,876
He's a complete hypocrite,

Don't you agree?

12
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,119
Should I just

13
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:03,497
have fun with you?

14
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:09,878

Where are you going?
You said you wanted to have fun.

41
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:35,923
When did I say that?

42
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:38,300
Are you a mythomaniac?

43
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,512
What I said earlier...

44
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,306
I was just talking to myself.

45
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,267
Compliment me for doing the right thing.

46
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,977
-And what exactly is that?
-Kidnapping him.

47
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,022
You didn't stop him earlier.
You just let him be.

48
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,565
That's because I did the right thing.

49
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:55,692
Am I wrong?

50
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,486
Then why didn't you stop him?

51
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,908
How could I stop him
from dancing and singing

52
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:04,535

Hey!

Who are you people?
Are you from the hospital?

55
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,632
No, I'm a writer. And he's my safety pin.

56
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,887
If anything happens to Assemblyman Kwon
because of what happened today...

00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:24,930
Yes?

58
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,141
You'd better brace yourselves.

59
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,186
My goodness, really? You're so scary.

60
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,564
-I'm so frightened. What am I going to do?
-You little...

61
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:37,651
Watch yourself.

62
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,240
Both of you just crossed the line.

63
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,700
Brace yourselves.

64
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:50,289
Why does that idiot keep telling us
to brace ourselves?

65
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:00,507
Gang-tae, Gi-do wishes to talk to you.

66
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,262
I see you're working very hard.

67
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,059
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

68
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,190
Let's go.

69
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,277
Anyway, thank you for helping us
despite your busy schedule.

71

All my wishes came true today.

72

Today was the best day of my life.

73
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:39,963
So don't get angry at her
for driving me here.

74
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:43,592
Okay?

75
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,934
-Mom, he'll be fine.
-Good gracious.

76
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,393
-Mom.
-He'll be okay.

77
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,898
I'm sorry, but we need a family member
to come with us to the hospital.

78
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,358
Are you crazy?

79
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,735
Why would we go to a psychiatric hospital?

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,448
Go ahead with your father.
I'll catch up with you later.

81
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:08,033
Mom.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,744
Mom!

83
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:14,206
Gi-do.

84
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,418
Mom, I feel a lot better...

85
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,965
Are you happy now that you've humiliated
our entire family?

86
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:28,345
Are you satisfied
now that you've disgraced your father

87
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,056
who you have hated for all those years?

88
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,725
Mom, I just--

89
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,728
Why did you have to be born so dumb

90
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,233
and get treated that way?

91
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,944
Why do you always act out

92
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,321
only to make my heart ache so much?

93
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,699
Why couldn't you just stay quiet?

94
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,867
Why did you have to cross the line

95
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,038
and cause such a big a fuss, you fool?

96
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,416
Why?

97
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,611
My mom knows how to slap really hard.

98
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,284
She never cared about me

99
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,703
because she was always busy
taking care of my other siblings.

100
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,626
But I just realized something
after I got slapped by her.

101
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:43,754
Gang-tae.

102
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,466
My mom doesn't hate me.

103
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,718
She loves me like crazy.

104
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,972
How do you know?

105
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,975
You can tell
when you're the one getting hit.

106
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,521
For some reason, when someone
hits you with affection it strangely...

107
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,733
doesn't make you feel upset.

108
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,655
<i>Gang-tae!</i>

109
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:15,243
Why did you do that?
Why did you send your brother home first?

110
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:17,662
You should've stayed with him all day!

111
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,624
What were you doing
when he was getting beaten up?

112
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:23,585
I let you learn martial arts
so you could protect your brother.

113
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,587
How could you let him come home
looking like that?

114
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:28,632
Are you serious?

115
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,635
My gosh, it's pouring.

116
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:36,556
You'll catch a cold. Are you okay?

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,404
You see, honey,

118
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:54,616
I won't die early like you did.

119
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm going to live a long life.

120
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,792
I'm going to watch Sang-tae
grow old and die.

121
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,130
And then, I'll die the next day.

122
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,016
Mom?

123
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:26,690
My goodness, did you wake up?

124
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,739
-Gang-tae.
-Yes?

125
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,993
You need to stay by your brother's side
until the day you die.

126
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,540
I'll raise him.

127
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,794
Your job is to look after your brother
and keep him safe.

128
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:49,504
Okay?

129
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:57,554
That's why

130
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,266
I gave birth to you.

131
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:19,951
<font color="#ffff80">OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</font>

132
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,374

133
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:30,378
Ju-ri.

134
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:38,637
-We should also get going.
-Are we going to have fun?

135
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,680
We're going to the hospital.

136
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,849
Don't speed.

137
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,493
Ju-ri. You can go without me.

138
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,912
I'll go with her.

139
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,043
Why?

140
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,795
It's just that...

141
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:17,884
I don't think she should drive alone.

142
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,488
If you didn't get in my car,

143
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,783
I was going to kidnap you.

144
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,370
Is that your hobby?

145
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,581
I know you were jealous of him
when he was having a blast.

146
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,169
"I want to put everything down
and have fun just like him."

147
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,714
I could tell from the look on your face.

148
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,092
Let me know when you're ready.

149
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:02,303
I'll kidnap you
and let you have the time of your life.

150
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,972
It will be magnificent.

151
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,978
Forget it.

152
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:14,190
Okay, fine.
When it looks like you want to run away,

153
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:17,235
I'll run away with you
right there and then.

154
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,112
Look forward to it.

155
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,183
Damn.

156
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:51,644
I hate flowers that fall petal by petal.

157
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,278
I like magnolias.

158
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:03,114
The whole flower falls at once
without hesitation.

159
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,365
I like that about them.

160
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,872
You really have a way of comparing things.

161
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:12,665
Beautiful comparison, isn't it?

162
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,756
Yes, magnolias sound like
the perfect flower for you.

163
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,841
What's your favorite flower?

164
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,553
I don't like them.

165
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,307
I don't like it when spring comes.

166
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:31,726
Why not?

167
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:38,399
Because that's when I need to leave again.

168
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,985
What?

169
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,363
Mr. Lee.

170
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:26,948
Yes, how did it go?

171
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,326
The injunction that was filed
against<i> Zombie Kid</i>

172
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,703
got approved, sir.

173
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:36,708
Oh, I see.

174
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,754
Okay then. I guess we'll just
have to return everything. Right?

175
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,714
Yes.

176
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:44,549
Is this funny to you?

177
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,843
How could you be smiling?

178
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,596
The company is about to go bankrupt,
and you're smiling?

179
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,558
Then should I cry?

180
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:54,559
No.

181
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,394
Just leave.

182
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,147
Just write a resignation letter and leave.

183
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:14,496
<i>I have</i>

184
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,249
<i>finally found my red shoes.</i>

185
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:28,426
<font color="#ffff80">INFORMATION ON MOON GANG-TAE</font>

186
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,225
Mr. Lee, would you like some coffee?

187
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,227
Where are you going?

188
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,437
I'm going on a business trip.

189
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:41,814
Bye, sir.

190
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,196
Nice.

191
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,168
You wanted to eat,
and this is what you're buying me?

192
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,670
I'm in a hurry. My shift starts soon.

193
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,382
-Do you want a rice ball?
-Forget it.

194
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:13,888
Hello?

195
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,474
Just a second.

196
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:18,810
Go ahead and eat.

197
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:28,027
Darn, he didn't even buy any kimchi.

198
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:29,654
He really doesn't spend money.

199
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,990
I don't care if he's poor,
but I hate scrooges.

200
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:33,366
What brings you to call me?

201
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,493
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

202
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:36,411
What?

203
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm relieved.

204
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:41,457
What is he saying?

205
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:44,377
Darn it.

206
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,005
<i>Mr. Moon, let me ask you something.</i>

207
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,966
Did Mun-yeong ever happen to tell you

208
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:54,762
that you're pretty
and that she wants to have you?

209
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,266
-<i>Why me?</i>
-Because I can't stop wanting you.

210
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:00,768
-But why?
-Because you're so pretty.

211
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,732
I guess she did. I'm sure of it.

212
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,859
What if she did?

213
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:11,029
Okay, listen to me carefully.

214
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:13,281
When she says she wants something,

215
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:15,742
she practically means she's hungry for it.

216
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:20,955
<i>So in other words,
she's saying she's going to eat you alive.</i>

217
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,710
What's your point?

218
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:30,214
My point is that you and I are both
in a state of emergency.

219
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,051
<i>Her new book got banned from being sold,</i>

220
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:36,471
<i>so she can't afford to be
spending time with you right now.</i>

221
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:38,139
<i>She needs to start writing her next book.</i>

222
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,019
His shoulders are so broad.

223
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,027
<i>Anyway, I'll go there
and do everything I can to take her back.</i>

224
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,571
<i>So please stay alive... I mean...</i>

225
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:56,491
Please hang in there until then.

226
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,618
Good luck.

227
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:11,756
Who was it?

228
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,259
-The hospital.
-Did they tell you to hurry?

229
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,387
Are they going to fire me?

230
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:21,557
You're very good at ignoring people.

231
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:22,934
Good for you.

232
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:29,399
I heard your new book

233
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,318
got banned from being sold.

234
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,070
<i>Zombie Kid</i>?

235
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:38,825
Is it because of what you did last time
for my brother?

236
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,203
They wouldn't do that just because
I cursed and pulled at a man's hair.

237
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,872
They think the illustration and storyline
are too grotesque.

238
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,001
Those idiots can't read the actual message
that's hidden behind the letters.

239
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:50,044
Darn them.

240
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:54,424
What's the message?

241
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,720
You should read it.
I want to hear what you think about it.

242
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm too old for fairy tales.

243
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:03,224
Oh, come on.
I think you're just the right age for it.

244
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,186
How old are you?

245
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:09,230
Me?

246
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,942
I'm just a little kid.

247
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,364
But you're more like a kid than I am.

248
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,492
Why am I like a kid?

249
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,750
Because I can see that

250
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:31,794
you want to be loved.

251
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:22,386
<font color="#ffff80">OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</font>

252
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:45,034
Mom.

253
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,670
<font color="#ffff80">UNDER SEDATION

254
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,868
About Assemblyman Kwon...

255
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,246
Judging by his personality,

256
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,790
he'll throw a fit
if he ends up having to resign.

257
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,959
Shouldn't we do something about it?

258
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,294
Get ready to get sued.

259
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,295
Again?

260
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,674
Oh, okay, sir.

261
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,344
Why don't you fire Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

262
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,720
She kidnapped the patient.

263
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,807
Let's be honest. She didn't kidnap him.

264
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,559
He willingly got in her car.

265
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,145
But still, we need to fire her.

266
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,148
She never takes her father out for a walk.

267
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,652
She told me she never promised
to do such a thing.

268
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,861
Right, Ju-ri?

269
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,030
Yes.

270
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,700
You guys are acquainted, aren't you?

271
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,577
Yes.

272
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,413
What? Are you serious?

273
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,873
-What? How?
-Since when?

274
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,168
We knew each other for a while
when we were young.

275
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,920
Then you guys are practically friends.

276
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,925
What do you think
we should do about her, Ms. Nam?

277
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,428
I think

278
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,931
we should fire her.

279
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,224
Ms. Ko

280
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,436
doesn't belong here.

281
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,941
What are you going to do, sir?

282
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,486
We're not in a rush.

283
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,781
So let's check the patient's condition
and then decide.

284
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,450
Okay.

285
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,098
Don't turn it on.

286
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,683
I don't want to listen
to other people talking.

287
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,396
I want to hear you talk.
Just go ahead and say anything.

288
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,691
Well...

289
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,946
Do you have nothing to say to me?

290
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,619
Why don't you take
your father outside for walks?

291
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,204
You promised the hospital director.

292
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,623
"Promise"?

293
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,876
That stuff is useless like trash.

294
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,212
I got what I want,
so I don't need it anymore.

295
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,922
He has dementia.

296
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,883
His soul is dead.
His body is just an empty shell.

297
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,010
Why would I waste my time
on something like that?

298
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,597
It would be better if he just died.

299
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,018
Why did your parents pass away?

300
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,648
How do you know that?

301
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,109
I did my research.

302
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,572
It was just a simple background check.

303
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,992
It's just like how we check the origin
and expiration date of the stuff we buy.

304
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,495
So it's no big deal.

305
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,205
"Stuff"?

306
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,833
Are people like products to you?

307
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,251
What's the difference?

308
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,419
Children abandon their parents

309
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,338
when their parents become old and feeble.

310
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,258
Parents favor the child
that makes them happy

311
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,176
and abandon the child
that's dumb and useless.

312
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,804
Isn't that what happened to Teeny-weeny?

313
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,309
Stop the car.

314
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,811
What? Why?

315
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,437
I said, stop the car.

316
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,606
Why? Do you need to pee?

317
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,994
What's with you all of a sudden?

318
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,036
Why are you angry?

319
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,830
Just tell me why.

320
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,874
Hey!

321
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,794
What are you so angry about?

322
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,506
<font color="#ffff80">I...</font>

323
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,134
forgot.

324
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,052
What?

325
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,722
That you're different from others.

326
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,724
I forgot that for a while.

327
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,313
I must've unknowingly

328
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,774
expected something from you.

329
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,986
What did you expect from me?

330
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,451
What is it that you expected?

331
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,955
It's gone now.

332
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,669
I love you.

333
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,724
I love you, Gang-tae.

334
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,442
I love you!

335
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,361
I said, I love you!

336
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,488
I love you so much!

337
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,366
You're running away again?

338
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,034
I said I love you! Why are you leaving?

339
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,119
Why? I love you! Hey!

340
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,497
I love you! I really love you! Hey!

341
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,481
He's unbelievable.

342
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,402
We were getting along just fine.
Why did he explode all of a sudden?

343
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,612
Is he not right in his mind?

344
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,032
What in the world made him angry?

345
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,667
<font color="#ffff80">SEONGJIN VOCATIONAL SCHOOL</font>

346
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,629
Gosh, that was hard.

347
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,007
Yes, I had a hard time.

348
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,258
Sang-tae.

349
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,391
What did you learn today?

350
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,643
How to make jam.

351
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,021
It sounds like fun. Strawberry jam?

352
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,731
It was boring.

353
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,734
I was bored to death.

354
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,406
I'm sorry, Sang-tae.

355
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,409
I couldn't find any schools
that teaches art in this neighborhood.

356
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,536
-Instead, I'll--
-I'm going to draw on the wall.

357
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,121
I'm going to draw on the hospital wall.

358
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,623
I'll draw, make money,
sweep the garden, and find coins.

359
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,834
That's what you call
"killing two birds with one stone."

360
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,172
Then are you going to provide for me now?
I should quit and have fun.

361
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,591
Don't... Don't worry. Just trust me.

362
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,925
I'm your older brother.

363
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,761
I'm the older brother,
so you can count on me.

364
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,015
Then should we buy the necessary tools?

365
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,561
-Is there an art supply store nearby?
-I'm your older brother, not your uncle.

366
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,918
Gosh, this place is so gloomy.

367
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,544
Why are you here?

368
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,798
How could anyone
live in a house like this,

369
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,384
let alone come up with ideas
to write anything?

370
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,305
Mun-yeong, let's go back to Seoul.

371
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,559
Go back to the luxurious hotel
and start writing your next book.

372
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,813
It's only been a few days
since we said I disappeared.

373
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,233
I forgot that you're not just a writer
but also a famous celebrity.

374
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,277
If you don't show your face to the public,
they'll easily forget about you.

375
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,279
You have no idea how quick
they forget things.

376
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,864
Things just disappear from their heads.

377
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,908
No, I don't want to go.
I'm going to have fun here.

378
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,578
Mun-yeong, can't you have fun in Seoul?

379
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,622
You... You shouldn't be here.

380
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,708
You know why. This is where your mother...

381
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,464
Then

382
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,552
why don't you move in with me?

383
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,011
What?

384
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,474
My gosh, you seem very tired.

385
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,644
You should get some good rest.
I'll call you again tomorrow.

386
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,562
I'll be off now.

387
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,792
<i>That you're different from others.</i>

388
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,461
I forgot that for a while.

389
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,521
You're different from others.

390
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,234
You're extremely special.

391
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,618
You're my greatest creation.

392
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,954
You are my other self.

393
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,708
I love you, my daughter.

394
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,642
-Here's your pizza.
-Excuse me.

395
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,228
-Yes?
-I read that you get a free caricature

396
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,771
when you order a full-size pizza.

397
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,941
Right, but it's only offered
during the daytime. I'm sorry.

398
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,568
Gosh, I've been baited.

399
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,529
I've totally been baited.

400
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,784
What kind of bait can I use to persuade
Mun-yeong to go back to Seoul with me?

401
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,580
Hey, Jae-su.

402
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,152
I'll get some wings

403
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,613
and a beer.

404
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,616
What's gotten into you? You never drink.

405
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,409
I'm just going to have one beer.

406
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,204
What? Something must've happened
at the hospital today.

407
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,164
No.

408
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,251
Gosh, whatever. I'll drink with you.

409
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,546
No, you should work. I'll just drink solo.

410
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,633
All right, then.

411
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,720
I'm here alone too.

412
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,476
Would you like to join me?

413
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,853
This pizza is way too big for one person.

414
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,315
I see, but no thanks.

415
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,817
Sorry about that.

416
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,421
What do you think
we should do about her, Ms. Nam?

417
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,506
I think

418
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,716
we should fire her.

419
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,972
Gosh. You're so petty, Nam Ju-ri.

420
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,100
What can you do though?

421
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,562
I have no choice but to suck up to her
to earn a living.

422
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,191
Still, she shouldn't be here.

423
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,609
She absolutely shouldn't.

424
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,029
She shouldn't be there. Never.

425
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,575
I'll take her back to Seoul with me
no matter what.

426
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,827
I have to.

427
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,292
Are they echoing each other?

428
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,714
It sounds like
they're talking about the same thing.

429
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,885
Put them in here.

430
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,305
Size 8, 12...

431
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,312
Where's size six? There it is.

432
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,106
Size seven...

433
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,925
I love you, Gang-tae.

434
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,886
<i>I love you!</i>

435
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,637
<i>I said, I love you!</i>

436
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,650
-So pretty.
-<i>Because you're so pretty.</i>

437
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,196
I want it.

438
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,865
<i>Moon Gang-tae, what I want is you.
Because I can't stop wanting you.</i>

439
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,575
When I see something pretty, I want it.

440
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,868
And I need to have what I want.

441
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,039
I want this.

442
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,165
I'm getting this.

443
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,669
Hello, I'm ready to pay.

444
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,879
My gosh, so many!

445
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,966
I'm taking all this.
Everything here except for the basket.

446
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,802
I'm getting so many things.

447
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,934
So many things.

448
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,438
-So many things.
-What's the total?

449
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,815
It's 53,000 won.

450
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,483
So many things.

451
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,652
Thank you.

452
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,071
Pteranodon. They have...

453
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,449
They have a throat sac
where they can store fish.

454
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,037
Flight muscles... Because of the weak
flight muscles, they can't really fly...

455
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,705
<font color="#ffff80">OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</font>

456
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,714
Let's get--

457
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,591
-Step aside.
-What is this?

458
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,051
Jeez, what's going on?

459
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,720
-A-reum, are you all right?
-They're scary.

460
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,638
They look like thugs.

461
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,851
All right!
Go back to your rooms and have some food!

462
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,144
-Let's go upstairs.
-Step aside.

463
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,898
Hey, who are those guys in suits?

464
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:09,816
Kwon Man-su's people.

465
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,697
Watching a fire is most entertaining,
but watching a fight comes in second.

466
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,656
Let's go.

467
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,741
No, I don't like it when people fight.

468
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,370
A bloody storm awaits.

469
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:27,083
Sir, there must've been
some misunderstanding.

470
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,377
Let me explain.

471
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,213
Please allow me to explain what happened!

472
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,091
Gosh.

473
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,264
Yes, what?

474
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,643
-Check.
-Let's just say that I lost this round.

475
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,895
I have a guest coming.

476
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,063
I was going to win anyway.

477
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,232
Issue me a pass to leave the hospital
as you promised.

478
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,285
The crazy bitch who kidnapped that lunatic

479
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,204
and brought him to my campaign rally,

480
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,081
the caregiver who helped that bitch,

481
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,585
and the hospital director who failed
to keep them under control

482
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,546
and ruined my reputation should all
get down on their knees in front of me.

483
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,506
Bring them to me now!

484
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,426
Oh, the horse was here.

486
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,181
Gang-tae!

487
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,851
You're in deep trouble.

488
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,228
You're fucking screwed.

489
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,688
What do we do?

490
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,982
Should I really call Ms. Ko?

491
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,609
What if she refuses to come?

492
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,985
She will, 100 percent.

493
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,403
I'll call her.

494
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,907
<font color="#ffff80">INSTRUCTOR CONTACTS</font>

495
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,496
Don't call her.

496
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,207
Why not?

497
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,792
I'll just go in there alone.

498
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,961
Still, I should...

499
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,463
Don't. Seriously, don't.

500
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,639
What do we do?
Are we really not going to call her?

501
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,601
He told us not to call her, Byeol.

502
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,603
I'm sure he'll handle it.

503
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,649
Why is she taking it out on me?

504
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,779
"He told us not to call her."

505
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,494
Thank you! Thank you so much.

506
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,663
Thank you.

507
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,045
My gosh.

508
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,881
<font color="#ffff80">OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</font>

509
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,725
See? I clearly warned you.

510
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,699
Why did you come alone?

511
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,868
Where's that bitch, your accomplice?

512
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,122
She's not coming.
She doesn't need to be here.

513
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,250
She's the culprit.
Who said she doesn't need to be here?

514
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,129
Your son escaped the hospital
of his own accord.

515
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,548
-No one took him there against his will.
-Hey.

516
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,759
That idiot is not well.

517
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,721
He strips off his clothes out of the blue
and pees regardless of where he is.

518
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,475
And he spends tens of millions of won
in one night. He's insane!

519
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,811
I locked him away here so that
he wouldn't be able to wander around.

520
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,356
I can't believe you let him go
at my campaign rally of all places.

521
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,109
I bet you people did it on purpose.

522
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,362
Because I said
I'd shut this hospital down,

523
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,697
you folks egged that idiot on

524
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,741
to deliberately screw me over.

525
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,120
It may have screwed you over,

526
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,582
but your son's condition has improved
significantly thanks to that incident.

527
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,417
He's well enough to be discharged soon.

528
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,877
Are you out of your mind?

529
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,963
Who's going to keep an eye
on that moron if you discharge him?

530
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,508
It's kind of like how psychodrama works.

531
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,178
If you release your pent-up emotions
while having the spotlight on you--

532
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,096
Whatever.

533
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,934
There are thousands of
psychiatric hospitals in the country.

534
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,730
If I keep transferring him,
I can have him locked away forever!

535
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,067
Gosh, you can't do that to your own son.

536
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,612
I don't need a son
who is completely useless!

537
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,743
He's useless?

538
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:32,870
What?

539
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,084
Do children

540
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,629
have to be useful to their parents?

541
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,759
Hey.

542
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,221
We all

543
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,015
came into this world
because our parents needed us.

544
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,519
Go ask your parents.

545
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,398
Whether or not they will need you

546
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,400
if you're completely useless!

547
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,610
Then you shouldn't have had him!

548
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,945
You punk!

549
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,323
You're a mere caregiver. How dare you!

550
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,617
Jeez!

551
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,514
<font color="#ffff80">SMILING CAN REALLY MAKE YOU HAPPY</font>

552
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,535
My gosh, you're adorable.

553
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,954
Okay, here. Smile.

554
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,629
How beautiful.

555
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,925
A fountain!

556
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,638
All right. One, two, three.

557
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,350
Nice. Let's go.

558
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,691
One, two, three.

559
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,242
One, two, three.

560
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,163
One,

561
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,415
two, three.

562
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,595
-Hey.
-Hello!

563
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,972
Can you take a photo of me?

564
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,056
Sure.

565
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,686
What a beautiful day.
The weather is so nice today.

566
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,522
Photos turn out great
when the weather is this nice. One...

567
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,483
No! Go away, butterfly!

568
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,318
A butterfly!

569
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,946
Gosh, that was a butterfly!

570
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,863
What's with him?

571
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,367
Did he not like my pose?

572
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,210
Goodness gracious. Can't you knock?

573
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,130
I did. You're not going to let
Assemblyman Kwon do what he wants, right?

574
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:30,965
I will.

575
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,301
Sir, please.

576
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,052
Come and have a look.

577
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,515
Gosh.

578
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,205
Then you shouldn't have had him!

579
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,540
You punk!

580
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,126
How dare you!

581
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,419
You're a mere caregiver.

582
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,339
I'm thinking of blackmailing him

583
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,468
with this footage,
saying that I'll send this to the media.

584
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,137
I'll also see if I can get him
to donate some money as well.

585
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,889
Are you serious?

586
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,515
Sure, why not?

587
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,602
As for Kwon Gi-do,
I'm sure the kidnapping incident

588
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,355
will actually help him get better.

589
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,814
Then all I need to do

590
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,194
is punish the jerk
who slapped our caregiver.

591
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,699
I've done nothing
to get on your wrong side, right?

592
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,374
The sky over on this side.
The sky is up here.

593
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,959
And the waves. The sea.

594
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,754
The sea should be here. Hello!

595
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,050
Then... The hospital should be
in the middle. After that, the sea...

596
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,176
The sea...

597
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,970
The swing. The swing is under it.

598
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,723
What is this? Is it something
only good people can see?

599
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,350
It's the sea.

600
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,528
Finally, we meet.

601
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,696
My dear Sang-tae.

602
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,078
Oh, my. What should I do?

603
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,746
Hello.

604
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,832
My gosh.

605
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,084
Go on in first.

606
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,378
Sang-tae!

607
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,755
-Look at the camera.
-One.

608
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,259
Look up here. One, two, three.

609
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,433
My gosh! There, it's done.

610
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,940
Are you here
because you got a call from us?

611
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,859
What? You told me to pretend
not to know you.

612
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,112
What call?

613
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,866
Well, I was just wondering
because you don't have class today.

614
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,579
I'm here to take Ko Dae-hwan
out for a walk.

615
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,375
Someone got fuming mad at me
for not keeping my promise,

616
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,628
so I came here to cool him off.

617
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,131
Now, I'm just doing a service for a fan.

618
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,425
Yes, "service."
I know what "service" means.

619
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,886
You get a free caricature
when you order a full-size pizza.

620
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,931
Gosh, what's he saying?
This guy is so funny.

621
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,600
Girls like funny guys.

622
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,978
My gosh, I'm with writer Ko Mun-yeong.

623
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,830
Where are you, Sang-tae?

624
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,044
This is pretty. I like it.

625
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,261
It's 10,000 won.

626
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,639
You said earlier that it's free.

627
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,767
Did you order pizza?
You didn't have any pizza.

628
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,731
My gosh, what do I do with you?
You're so cute.

629
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,191
You have a dinosaur.

630
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,194
Come on.
TWICE is much cuter. Let's be real.

631
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,403
Don't touch his hair.

632
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,866
Are you still mad at me?

633
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,994
Look. I'm here
to take my father out for a walk.

634
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,205
You're mad
because I didn't keep my word, right?

635
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,210
Sang-tae, can you go wait in the lobby?

636
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,588
No, I don't want to.
I'm going to stay here with Ms. Ko.

637
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,840
-I'll stay here with Ms. Ko--
-Do as I say, please!

638
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,974
Just wait in the lobby.

639
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,476
I'll be right there.

640
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,398
-Sang-tae.
-Hey, did someone slap you?

641
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,530
Who slapped you in the face?

642
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,407
What happened to your face?

643
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,911
Who's the jerk that did this to you?
Who hit you?

644
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,496
I'll teach them a lesson. Tell me who.

645
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,958
I bet you just put up with it again.

646
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,210
You got hit and just put up with it
like a loser, right?

647
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,506
I asked you who did this to you.

648
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,675
Why are you getting angry?

649
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,260
What?

650
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,262
Why are you getting so worked up?

651
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,513
Because someone slapped you.

652
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,015
So what?

653
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,101
Does that break your heart?

654
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,648
Or does it make you sad?

655
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,614
What exactly are you feeling right now?

656
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,784
You

657
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,661
don't know

658
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,957
what kind of emotion is getting you
so worked up.

659
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,877
Even you have no clue.

660
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,964
You're all empty inside.

661
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,050
You're just loud.

662
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,219
Like an empty can.

663
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,223
So you'd better not

664
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,477
act like you know and understand
everything about me

665
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,853
when you know nothing.

666
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,190
Don't be delusional.

667
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,112
You won't understand me

668
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,908
until the day you die.

Gosh, I don't want to. Why not?

hates his brother.

679
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:40,769
He hates me. No, no. Gosh, what do I do?

680

Why...

681

Oh, it's a bunny.

Come out.
If you come out, I'll give you this.

Come on. I'll also make a turtle
with a radish for you.

684
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,038
Gosh.

685
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,169
Gang-tae is waiting for you outside.

686
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,212
Are you going to stay here
by yourself all night?

687

Sang-tae.

Come on. Let's go home. Come out.

690
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,311
-Gosh, this way. Goodness.
-No, I don't want to go.

Oh, no. My back...

No, not this.

Gosh, my back.

00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,957
-Where's Sang-tae?
-I'll bring him home later.

696
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,210
Don't worry about him
and just get going. Here.

697
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,923
I'm sorry to make you do this.

698

Don't eat dinner and wait for me.

702
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,934
I'll make delicious beef stir-fry
when I get home.

703
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,063
I'll tag along the first few times

704
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,324
Are you sure
all your memories got wiped out?

705
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,744
You're not just pretending?

706
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,080
Stop provoking him.

707
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,514
Did you

708
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,852
really forget what kind of person I am?

709
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,771
Dad.

You...

Why...

712
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,289
are you

713
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,667
still alive?

714
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,475
Die.

715
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,896
Die, you...

716
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:11,980
Go quickly.

717
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,399
You monster!

718
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:19,154
-Stop, Mr. Ko!
-Die, you... You monster.

719
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,366

721
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,954
Calm him down.

722
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,623
You're a monster.

Ms. Ko, <i>The Little Mermaid</i>
from last class...

725
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,316
She ignored me.

726
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,068
I think she hates me.

727
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,737
No, she doesn't.

728
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,115
"If you talk to me, I'll kill you."
It's written on her forehead.

729
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,492
I didn't see that.

730
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,370
Oh, your medication must be wearing off.

731
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,330
Come on. You should take your pills.

732

So you'd better not act like you know

Don't be delusional.

735

You won't understand me
until the day you die.

736
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,113
<i>You don't know what kind of emotion

737

00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,575
You're all empty inside.

739
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,410
You're just loud.

740
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,163
Like an empty can.

741
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,917
You also won't be able to understand me

742
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,586
until the day you die.

743
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,914
<i>ZOMBIE KID</i>

744
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,473
<i>"A baby boy was born in a small village.</i>

745
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,518
<i>He had pale skin</i>

746
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,562
<i>and large eyes.</i>

747
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,315
<i>While raising the boy,</i>

748
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,776
<i>his mother
naturally came to the realization</i>

749
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,157
<i>that he had no feelings whatsoever.</i>

750
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,120
<i>All he had was the desire to eat,
like a zombie.</i>

751
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,504
<i>So his mother locked him up
in the basement</i>

752
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,965
<i>so that the villagers wouldn't see him.</i>

753
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,759
<i>And every night, she stole livestock
from her neighbors to feed him.</i>

754
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,596
<i>That's how she raised him in secret.</i>

755
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,849
<i>One night, she'd steal a chicken.</i>

756
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,059
<i>The next day, she'd steal a pig.</i>

757
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,688
<i>A number of years passed like that.</i>

758
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:31,318
<i>Then one day, an epidemic broke out.
It left the remaining animals dead,</i>

759
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,321
<i>and it also killed many people.</i>

760
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,866
<i>Those who survived the epidemic</i>

761
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,535
<i>left the village.</i>

762
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,998
<i>But the mother
couldn't leave her son all alone.</i>

763
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,792
<i>And to appease her son crying of hunger,</i>

764
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,920
<i>she cut off one leg of hers
and gave it to him.</i>

765
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,798
<i>After that, it was her arm.</i>

766
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,301
<i>She gave him all her limbs.</i>

767
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,720
<i>When she was left
with nothing but her torso,</i>

768
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,890
<i>she embraced her son for the last time</i>

769
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,559
-<i>to let him devour what was left of her."</i>
-Come here.

770
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,853
-It's cold.
-Gosh, it's raining. Come here.

771
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,563
-Here, come here.
-Mom, wait.

01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,234
Gang-tae, come on.

<i>"With his both arms,</i>

776
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,840
<i>the boy tightly held his mother's torso</i>

777
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,176
<i>and spoke for the first time in his life.</i>

01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,472
<i>-'Mom.</i>
-"Mom.

<i>so warm.'"</i>

781
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,021
so warm."

782
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,480
<i>You're different from others.</i>

783
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,273
You're extremely special.

784
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,069
You're my greatest creation.

785
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,283
Why are you still alive?

786
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,871
<i>What did the boy really want?</i>

787
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,499
<i>Satiating his hunger?</i>

788
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,377
<i>Or feeling his mother's warmth?</i>

789
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,599
Oh, boy. Hey, it's pouring outside.

790
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,775
Hey, are you all right?

791
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,320
Ju-ri called.

792
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,072
She asked me to check in on you.

793
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,160
I heard you got slapped again.

794
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,664
Enough, seriously.
Things like this really upset me.

795
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,418
Are you doing this on purpose or what?

796
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:07,051
By the way, I heard Ko Mun-yeong's father
choked her and caused a huge scene.

797
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,678
What?

798
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,347
When? Who said that?

799
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,517
I overheard some patients talking about it
when I went there to deliver an order.

800
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,729
It sounded like a lot of people saw it.

801
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,484
He must hate his daughter so much
for him to choke her like that.

802
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,236
Her father is obviously not sane.

803
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,821
-Jae-su.
-Yes?

804
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,658
-I need to borrow your motorcycle.
-Hey, what? It's raining now.

805
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,369
Hey, Gang-tae! Wait!

806
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:35,997
