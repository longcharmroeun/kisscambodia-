I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,278
<i>Isn't it just too cruel?</i>

5
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,949
<i>Because of that damn butterfly,</i>

6
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,452
<i>I've had to</i>

7
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:50,998
<i>crawl and suffer all these years.</i>

8
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:04,887
<i>But how could that butterfly be</i>

9
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,808
<i>her mother?</i>

10
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:20,444
<i>So I hope</i>

11
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:25,199
<i>she never finds out about this.</i>

12
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:29,787
<i>I don't want Mun-yeong
to suffer like this...</i>

13
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:33,249
<i>I don't want her to be hurt.</i>

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,797
<i>I don't want her to ever care
about other people's feelings.</i>

15
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:44,051
<i>I hope she can just live without emotions</i>

16
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,138
<i>like an empty can.</i>

17
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,269
<i>I feel so guilty when I think</i>

18
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:58,107
<i>about my mom and my brother. What do I do?</i>

19
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:28,763
We're heading out.

20
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:32,141
You can join us later
if you change your mind.

PHOTO STUDIO ADDRESS

23
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,185
<i>Thanks to Mang-tae, which you gave me,</i>

24
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,521
<i>I no longer have nightmares.</i>

25
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,608
<i>You, Sang-tae, and Mang-tae.</i>

26
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,697
<i>I'm so happy that I now have this family.</i>

27
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,043
<i>I want Mang-tae back.</i>

28
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:24,462
<i>He's mine.</i>

29
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,319
The lady can sit on the chair.

30
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:32,112
Sir, please stand next to her.

31
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:35,908
Great. Sir, could you stand
a little closer to her?

32
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:38,077
-Sure.
-Nice. That's perfect.

33
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:40,871
Now, look at the camera
and give me a big smile.

34
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:44,250
A big smile, please.
Eyes on the camera. Here we go!

35
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,710
-One, two--
-Oh, look!

36
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,379
Wait. Just a second, please.

37
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,841
My brother... My little brother is here.

38
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:57,763
My gosh, my brother...
That's my real brother.

39
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:37,803
I'm not

40
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:40,681
too late, right?

41
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:57,615
I was going to photoshop you
into the photo if you didn't come.

42
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,784
That's why I came.

43
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:03,662
You look dashing. So dashing.

44
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,664
How... How much was this suit?
Was it 100,000 won?

45
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,251
-You look dashing too.
-Yes, I know.

46
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,545
My gosh, you styled your hair with wax.

47
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,297
Did you... Did you use mine?

48
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,382
If all three of you
are going to be in the photo,

49
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,092
stand side by side and look at the camera.

50
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:19,887
Okay. The three of us
are taking the photo together.

51
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,349
This is our family portrait.
A family portrait.

52
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,351
Both of you,
please stand closer to the lady.

53
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:40,115
Since it's for a family portrait,
please give me a big smile.

54
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,325
Here we go.

55
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:42,910
Please smile.

56
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:44,370
Okay, here we go.

57
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,623
One, two, three!

58
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:58,300
CHAPTER 13
THE FATHER OF THE TWO SISTERS

59
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:07,017
I'm back.

60
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:14,400
-Mr. Lee, you're back.
-Oh, Seung-jae.

61
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,152
Hey, where are you going?

62
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,279
I texted you.

63
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:22,157
I'm going to the art library with Ms. Ko
and Mr. Moon Sang-tae

64
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:23,158
to do some research.

65
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:25,119
Hey, I obviously didn't see your text

66
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:26,829
because you told me to keep my phone off.

67
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:27,830
Gosh, that hurt.

68
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:29,873
Ju-ri is in her room!

69
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:38,006
I think our strategy is working.

70
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,091
Oh, really?

71
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:44,346
So until she asks you
about how the blind date went,

72
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,224
do not bring it up first. Never, okay?

73
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:48,475
Why not?

74
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:51,145
You said you lied to her
that I went on a blind date with someone

75
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,396
who looks like Song Hye-kyo.

76
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,314
Gosh, just keep your mouth shut
and do as I say.

77
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,650
-I have to head out. See you later.
-Okay.

78
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:57,818
Hey, be safe.

79
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,200
Good.

80
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,329
Ju-ri.

81
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,582
May I come in?

82
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:14,835
Yes.

83
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:25,304
I wanted to let you know
I'm back safe and sound.

84
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:28,766
You must be tired. Get some rest.

85
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,938
I guess today is your off day.

86
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:36,064
Yes.

87
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:42,529
My mother packed
some seasoned mulberry leaves

88
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:45,324
and <i>godeulppaegi</i> kimchi for me,
so I brought them.

89
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,242
If you haven't eaten yet, why don't we--

90
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:49,203
I've eaten. You go ahead.

91
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,955
Okay.

92
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:01,799
I had a blind date.

93
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:03,926
Yes, I know.

94
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:06,637
My gosh.
She looks so much like Song Hye-kyo,

95
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,763
who's my ideal type.

96
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,557
So we totally hit it off right away--

97
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:11,475
Mr. Lee.

98
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,185
I have training tomorrow,

99
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:14,812
so I have to study all of this today.

100
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:19,650
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

101
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,778
Study hard. You can do it!

102
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,465
Darn it. Me and my mouth.

103
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,680
Gosh, I'm screwed.

104
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:02,860
SERIOUSLY? SONG HYE-KYO?
ARE YOU THAT EXCITED?

105
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,084
Darn it.

106
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,170
Does Ko Mun-yeong think
that she can blow people off all the time?

107
00:11:28,594 --> 00:11:29,469
It's okay.

108
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:31,889
You should talk behind people's backs
to relieve your stress.

109
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:34,266
I hope you live a long, healthy life,
Seung-jae.

110
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,184
Thank you.

111
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:40,272
Hello, our art director,
Ms. Yoo Seung-jae.

112
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,526
You're wearing a suit today.
You look so dashing!

113
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,616
-So you wanted to come here?
-Yes, it's an art library.

114
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,743
There are so many picture books here.

115
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,369
-Come with me.
-Okay.

116
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:55,329
It's this way.

117
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:57,581
-Let's go.
-Hey.

118
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,876
-Don't wear this from now on.
-Why not?

119
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,919
It doesn't look good.

120
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,922
You look so much better
in your caregiver uniform.

121
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,173
Oh, really?

122
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,425
I was thinking of buying a few more.

123
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,844
These suits are quite comfy.

124
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,554
It looks very uncomfortable.
Don't wear it.

125
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:13,555
Okay, I won't.

126
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:15,599
Then you shouldn't wear that either.

127
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,143
It looks very uncomfortable.

128
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:20,437
Darn it.

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,648
Hey! Just listen to me and don't wear it,

130
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,983
or I'll shred it to pieces! You hear me?

131
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:25,984
Don't wear it!

132
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:30,864
She had a dollhouse,

133
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,242
a very pretty one."

134
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:39,039
This artist is a very famous illustrator.

135
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:41,041
I heard children these days

136
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:42,876
-love this kind of illustration--
-Keep...

137
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,795
Keep the noise down
when you're at the library.

138
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,713
It's basic library etiquette, okay?

139
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:48,799
<i>THE GOLDEN PLATE</i>

140
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:52,469
As you know,

141
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:56,139
the stories that Ms. Ko writes
tend to be very cruel and intense.

142
00:12:56,515 --> 00:13:00,185
So I think it'd be great
if you could counteract that

143
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:03,105
with your warmth and innocence.

144
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:08,193
Like the hazy sunlight on a spring day,
for example.

145
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:09,653
And... Oh, right.

146
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:13,657
Something that gives you warm fuzzies.
I'm thinking mainly pastel shades,

147
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,119
so you can neutralize
Ms. Ko's intense stories--

148
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:18,036
I refuse.

149
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:20,580
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-What?

150
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:21,999
Why not?

151
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,961
If it's neutralized, it will be bland.
You won't taste anything.

152
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,046
Who'd eat that?

153
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:29,715
Even dogs wouldn't eat it.

154
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:32,384
He's so freaking cool.

155
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:34,761
<i>THE CHEERFUL DOG</i>

156
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,604
ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE LIVED A DOG...

157
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,152
I heard you're like the Cheerful Dog.

158
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:53,947
Me? Why?

159
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,867
That friend of yours.
Was his name Jae-su or Jae-mi?

160
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,577
He told me

161
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:02,664
that you never really open up to anyone

162
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,458
and that you keep everything inside.

163
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:07,753
That's how the Cheerful Dog is.

164
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,174
You two met up?

165
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:15,010
I called him over to ask him

166
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,762
if he knew why you were so upset.

167
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,475
I ordered ten boxes of pizza,
and he came in no time.

168
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,270
And?

169
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:27,189
What did he say?

170
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,358
He told me not to pry

171
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,862
because finding out what you're thinking
won't do me any good.

172
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:38,366
So I've decided to give up.

173
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:40,827
I'm not curious at all anymore.

174
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,583
Ko Mun-yeong.

175
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:55,342
I'm...

176
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:00,347
so sick and tired

177
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:03,183
of protecting

178
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:05,519
and looking after others.

179
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:09,022
I was born to look after my brother,

180
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:11,191
and I also needed to earn a living,

181
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,195
so I've been forcing myself to do it.

182
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:18,990
And?

183
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:23,870
I will no longer

184
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,249
think of it as work.

185
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:32,379
It'll be my goal going forward.

186
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,175
Putting my life on the line
to protect my family...

187
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:40,095
Come to think of it,

188
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,348
it's actually pretty cool.

189
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,311
I don't care who it is. I will not forgive

190
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:50,647
anyone who messes with my family.

191
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,650
If it's taken away from me,

192
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,778
I'll chase them down until I get it back.

193
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,409
I will protect my family, no matter what.

194
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:10,584
Am I

195
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:17,966
part of that family?

196
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,511
We've taken a family portrait together,

197
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:31,688
so we're a family now.

198
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,790
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

199
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,460
Don't call me ever again.

200
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:57,923
What makes you think you can come here?

201
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:00,800
Fine, then come.

202
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:02,886
I'll just take my own life, then.

203
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,604
If he calls again,

204
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:15,190
just tell him that Yoo Seon-hae died.

205
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,740
Ms. Yoo, wait.

206
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,742
Would you like to go out for a walk?

207
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,077
Who was that on the phone?

208
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,996
That man again. Ms. Yoo Seon-hae's father.

209
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,374
He has no shame.

210
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:35,669
I heard he sent her to a shaman when
she was a kid, saying she was possessed.

211
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,338
Even I wouldn't want to see my dad
if he did that to me.

212
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,382
They've been estranged for years.
Why care now?

213
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:43,051
-Ms. Sun Byeol.
-Yes, ma'am.

214
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:45,178
You don't know her family's full story,

215
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,471
so don't be so quick to judge.

216
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:49,849
Don't you think you only know
one side of the story?

217
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,519
Her parents must've had a reason.

218
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:54,521
Right.

219
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,657
Fine, it's all my fault.

220
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,368
<i>STICKLEY MAKES A MISTAKE!
A FROG'S GUIDE TO TRYING AGAIN</i>

221
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:10,704
Come in.

222
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,333
-Oh, Ms. Kang.
-Hi.

223
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,168
Oh, boy.

224
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,588
Why did you skip dinner?

225
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:21,631
-Oh, well...
-Why?

226
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:24,384
-Please have a seat over here.
-Thanks.

227
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,721
-Oh, boy.
-I had to take care of something.

228
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,181
I see.

229
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,934
Gosh, don't worry about it.

230
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,646
You can't fall asleep
on an empty stomach. Have some.

231
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:38,565
Thank you.

232
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:46,823
You're an adult,
but you read children's books.

233
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,118
It makes you look
so pure-hearted and cool.

234
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,913
No. It's just my job, you know.

235
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:56,207
-Thank you for this.
-All right, eat up.

236
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,173
My gosh, it's so good.

237
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:09,095
To tell you the truth, I was starving.

238
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:12,349
But I skipped dinner
as I was too embarrassed.

239
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,018
Embarrassed of what?

240
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:23,151
Gosh, Song Hye-kyo?

241
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:26,488
Oh, dear. Why tell such a lie?

242
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:28,907
Exactly.

243
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,577
I wanted to stitch my lips together.

244
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:35,914
My goodness.

245
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,543
Shall I give you a hint?

246
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,004
"A hint"?

247
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,424
You see, Ju-ri

248
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,720
liked her dad a lot more than me.

249
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,305
He was like her pillar.

250
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,601
But her dad passed away
when she was young,

251
00:19:57,352 --> 00:20:01,439
so she's had to be
my daughter, son, and husband.

252
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:04,526
That's why she doesn't know
how to lean on others.

253
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:09,531
If her dad were still alive,

254
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:12,617
she'd think that someone's got her back

255
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:15,495
and say whatever she wants to say.

256
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,872
She could've dealt with less heartaches,
for sure.

257
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,669
Someone who she can

258
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,339
just lean on when the going gets rough.

259
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,676
Wouldn't that be enough?

260
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:34,722
Oh, right. Of course.

261
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,351
Yes, sure.

262
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,064
We're home!

263
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,484
Dooly... I want to watch Dooly.

264
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:49,154
-I'll leave the book in the study.
-Okay!

265
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,281
-Don't forget to hang your clothes.
-All right!

266
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,842
When we pick up our family portrait,
we should hang it over there.

267
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:13,553
It'll totally brighten up the room.

268
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:16,681
Actually,
shall I completely redecorate the house?

269
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:21,644
Your room too.
It's way too small for two guys.

270
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,482
So what? Are you saying
we should switch rooms?

271
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:26,816
No, that's not necessary.

272
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,319
You can sleep in my room.

273
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:31,404
-Move into my room.
-No, I don't want to.

274
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:32,363
Why not?

275
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:35,742
Because it used to be your parents' room.

276
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:37,952
So what?

277
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,044
-Ko Mun-yeong.
-Yes?

278
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:52,008
If I ask you
to live somewhere else with me,

279
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,384
will you come with me?

280
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,720
But why?

281
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:59,307
-Will you come with me?
-Do you have to run away again?

282
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,893
Will Sang-tae start having
those dreams again?

283
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,688
If that's the case, don't worry.

284
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:08,316
I'll tear that butterfly to shreds
and kill it for you.

285
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:11,569
You know that I have a knack
for catching butterflies.

286
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:21,663
That's not the reason.

287
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:29,462
Even if

288
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,173
the butterfly shows up,

289
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:37,804
do not kill it.

290
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:43,268
You shouldn't.

291
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:49,232
Why not?

292
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:56,739
What if

293
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,867
I get scared and run away again?

294
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,202
I'll have to chase you down.

295
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:03,538
I'll catch you and break your legs.

296
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,419
Fine. You have my word.

297
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:10,670
Let's make a pinky promise.

298
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,216
And let's seal it.

299
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,469
Not that.

300
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,944
-<i>Jeez! Who do you think you are?</i>
-"Jeez! Who do you think you are?

301
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:36,654
-<i>Why are you all angry?</i>
-Why are you all angry?

302
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,281
-<i>Your teeth are worse.</i>
-Your teeth are worse.

303
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,074
-<i>Did I ask you to look at my teeth?</i>
-Did I ask you to look at my teeth?

304
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:41,909
-<i>Don't splash foam on me!</i>
-Don't splash foam on me!"

305
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:02,722
Why are your cheeks all red?

306
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:03,973
What?

307
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,477
Oh, maybe it's because
I took a hot shower.

308
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:09,103
Are you feeling shy?

309
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:13,941
Your cheeks are red,
and your pupils are quivering.

310
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,444
You're avoiding my eyes
and making an awkward smile.

311
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:18,237
You do that when you're feeling shy.

312
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,741
You feel shy about something you did?

313
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:23,201
No.

314
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:28,331
Well, I guess.

315
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:29,874
Did you kiss her?

316
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,462
Yes, just a peck on the lips.

317
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,219
A kiss is better than a fight.

318
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:43,805
Don't fight. I'll scold you.

319
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,107
Then let me ask you this.

320
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:57,235
Who do you like more
between me and Mun-yeong?

321
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,784
I...

322
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:10,665
I like Ko Gil-dong.

How am I supposed to eat this?</i>

324
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:17,088
<i>No more food for you
if you keep complaining!</i>

325
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:18,798
Why are they fighting?

326
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,969
Don't talk to me when I'm watching Dooly.
It's basic etiquette.

327
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:27,955
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

328
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,048
-You'll finish this mural soon.
-Yes.

329
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:39,758
Hello.

330
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:44,013
Are you... Are you okay now?
Are your ears okay?

331
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:47,558
Yes. I'm much better now, thanks to you.

332
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:50,936
Here. I'm returning this book to you.

333
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:55,441
This book... Isn't it good?

334
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:59,820
Yes, I liked it so much
that I memorized the entire story.

335
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:02,615
Which part... What's your favorite part?

336
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,076
"So don't forget any of it.

337
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:08,204
Remember it all and overcome it.

338
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,455
If you don't overcome it,

339
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:12,833
you'll always be a kid
whose soul never grows."

340
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,251
-My gosh.
-That part.

341
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:16,712
That's my favorite part.

342
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:17,630
"Overcome it.

343
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,757
Remember it all and overcome it."

344
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,051
"Overcome it."
That's my favorite line from the book.

345
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,179
Well...

346
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:28,140
Are you still practicing
how to draw butterflies?

347
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:29,558
Yes.

348
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:35,898
On my sketchbook. Little by little.

349
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:37,524
Oh, I see.

350
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:40,694
Then,

351
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:45,115
what do you think will happen first?
Butterflies flying around in your mural?

352
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,200
Or

353
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,411
me leaving this hospital?

354
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:51,622
The door.

355
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:55,042
That will depend on which one of us
finds the door first.

356
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,628
-Oh, that's right.
-Yes.

357
00:26:58,337 --> 00:27:01,173
Let's find that door soon
so that we can leave together.

358
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,841
Okay.

359
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:09,765
Ms. Yoo.

360
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,187
Ms. Yoo Seon-hae?

361
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:25,197
Ms. Yoo Seon-hae is acting a bit strange.

362
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:26,865
She wouldn't wake up.

363
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,909
When was the last time you spoke with her?

364
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,619
Yesterday afternoon.

365
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,124
Don't tell me...

366
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,752
We should probably get ready
for that visitor soon.

367
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:41,964
What? Who's coming?

368
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:45,134
Mr. Kan Pil-ong had a hard time
because of that visitor last year.

369
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:50,055
I know. That visitor always picks a person
and follows him or her around.

370
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:52,016
Gosh, who is this visitor?

371
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:54,393
Don't tell me...

372
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:56,687
Is it a ghost?

373
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,734
"I"?

374
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:04,153
"I."

375
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,782
The "I" in this sentence
is probably Do Hui-jae.

376
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,912
So this note

377
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,749
is like the butterfly's warning.

378
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,002
Right.

379
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,380
I wonder what was written
on all these notes.

380
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:26,550
I didn't find a blank notepad
with the same design anywhere,

381
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:28,886
which means

382
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,930
she didn't write these.

383
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,684
She probably received them from someone.

384
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:39,938
I've always thought something's
fishy here. Was this the reason?

385
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:46,612
Then first of all,
don't trust anyone at this hospital.

386
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:48,697
Don't even trust me.

387
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:53,535
And don't leave Sang-tae
alone at the hospital for the time being.

388
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,464
Sang-tae.

389
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:09,218
Don't wait here until my shift is over.

390
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:11,804
-Go straight home, okay?
-Okay.

391
00:29:14,264 --> 00:29:15,599
And always keep your phone on you.

392
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,226
If a stranger talks to you--

393
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,021
I'm not a baby.
Why are you suddenly treating me like one?

394
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,441
No reason. I was just worried--

395
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,152
I'm not a coward, okay?

396
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,947
Look... Look at this.

397
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:36,370
I've been practicing hard
to draw butterflies.

398
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:39,456
And I'll find the door
before Mr. Kan Pil-ong does.

399
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,418
I won't run away anymore. No more.

400
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,050
Then you'll protect us now?

401
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:54,430
Of course. I...
I have two younger siblings now.

402
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:56,348
I'm a big brother to you and Mun-yeong,

403
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:58,684
so I must protect you guys.
I must keep you safe.

404
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:13,532
Hi.

405
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:17,077
-Did you eat lunch?
<i>-Yes, just now. What about you?</i>

406
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,413
I ate with Sang-tae.

407
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:23,792
Hey, when you're working,

408
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,044
can you ask either Seung-jae or Mr. Lee
to come over

409
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,379
<i>and stay with you?</i>

410
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:30,924
I don't like having distractions
when I'm writing.

411
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,051
<i>You locked the door, right?</i>

412
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,554
<i>Don't let strangers in.</i>

413
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:39,141
This is nice.

414
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:42,728
-What's nice?
<i>-Having someone who worries about me.</i>

415
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:46,440
I should only do things
that will make you worry.

416
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,237
Hi, sweetie.

417
00:30:52,696 --> 00:30:53,822
<i>"Sweetie"?</i>

418
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,116
Who's that bitch?

419
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:59,077
<i>No one. Don't worry about it.
Just focus on your writing.</i>

420
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:02,456
Damn it.

421
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,334
It sounded like a young girl.

422
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:08,545
Where am I?

423
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:15,511
This is OK Psychiatric Hospital,
as you know.

424
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:18,305
I'm at the hospital again.

425
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:21,058
Did I come here in an ambulance
after being beaten up again?

426
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:27,481
You look like someone I know.

427
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:34,363
I'm caregiver Moon Gang-tae.

428
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:40,160
I go to Seongjin Elementary School.
Grade 1, class 2, student number 13.

429
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:41,453
My name is Yoo Seon-hae.

430
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,706
If you're a first grader...
Are you eight years old?

431
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:48,126
Yes. By the way, where's the bathroom?

432
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:50,212
There you are.
I looked everywhere for you.

433
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,422
I have to pee.
I need to go to the bathroom.

434
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:54,675
I'll show you where it is. Let's go.

435
00:31:57,678 --> 00:31:58,846
Oh, I know who he looks like!

436
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:00,889
He looks like Park Nam-jung.
Park Nam-jung!

437
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:02,641
He's handsome.

438
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,772
She has dissociative identity disorder.

439
00:32:08,856 --> 00:32:10,315
A MENTAL DISORDER IN WHICH
A PERSON HAS MULTIPLE IDENTITIES

440
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,817
The one where you have
multiple personalities?

441
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,818
Yes.

442
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:15,779
She developed the disorder
after experiencing childhood abuse.

443
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,744
It hurts.

444
00:32:24,204 --> 00:32:25,455
It hurts.

445
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:35,424
<i>Back then, even when parents
hit their children,</i>

446
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:37,175
<i>everyone thought it was okay</i>

447
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,386
<i>because it was considered
as a way of disciplining kids.</i>

448
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:41,096
<i>But that's child abuse.</i>

449
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:43,765
What shall we do now?

450
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:45,392
-What shall we do?
<i>-So she developed</i>

451
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,352
<i>multiple personalities
as a defense mechanism,</i>

452
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:50,022
<i>but her parents believed
that she was possessed</i>

453
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,566
<i>and sold her off to a shaman
in their neighborhood.</i>

454
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:54,526
Then,

455
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:57,279
she's not an actual shaman?

456
00:32:57,863 --> 00:33:00,657
She's not psychic or possessed,
so her readings were never accurate.

457
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:05,078
Director O ended up giving her counseling
when he went to see her for a reading

458
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:07,039
and admitted her to the hospital.

459
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,805
-Byeol, please call Director O.
-Okay.

460
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,352
Sir, Mr. Ko Dae-hwan in room 203...

461
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:46,578
There are other patients in this room,

462
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:49,581
so we should move him to the padded room.

463
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:50,791
Yes, sir.

464
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:16,149
I'm home!

465
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,610
Sang-tae, come here for a second.

466
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:19,986
Okay.

467
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:26,243
Ko Mun-yeong, you should ask me

468
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:27,494
if I had a good day.

469
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:29,037
Don't forget that I'm your boss.

470
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,623
Oh, those are my sketches.

471
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:36,461
Is this the boy who has no sense of self?

472
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:37,629
Yes.

473
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:41,633
And this is the emotionless princess
who is like an empty can?

474
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:42,592
Right.

475
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:45,846
And that's the man
who's trapped inside a box.

476
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,056
What do you think? Do you like them?

477
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,392
No, not at all. Draw them again.

478
00:34:51,476 --> 00:34:52,310
Why?

479
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:56,022
-Why must I draw them again?
-I don't like the way they look.

480
00:34:57,232 --> 00:34:59,151
Look at them.
Their necks are twisted 180 degrees.

481
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:00,402
This is the back of their heads.

482
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:03,196
No, it's not.
You're looking at their faces.

483
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,073
These blue circles are their faces?

484
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:07,325
What about their facial features?
Are they stick figures?

485
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,994
There are no expressions on their faces.

486
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:12,873
The message and the characters
are the two most important elements.

487
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:15,250
Will you ruin my inspiring story
with these ugly faces--

488
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,168
It's hard.

489
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,174
Drawing facial expressions

490
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,551
is too hard for me.

491
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:27,220
I find it difficult.

492
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:31,433
You have the facial expression cards.

493
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:34,227
"Angry, irritated, happy."

494
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:36,897
Can't you just look at those cards
and copy them?

495
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,526
If I copy those,
I won't be able to call them my drawings.

496
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,238
I can't call them my work.

497
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,246
Then study again.

498
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:55,707
You're observant.

499
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:59,169
Don't just stare at your brother's face.

500
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,630
Try to observe and study
other people's faces.

501
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:05,759
Then you can make
your own facial expression cards.

502
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,971
Figure it out by next week.

503
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,778
-Are you done for the day?
-Yes.

504
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:26,696
Can we have a quick chat?

505
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:35,914
It's about Mr. Ko Dae-hwan.

506
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,709
It's likely that he'll pass away
in a few days or so.

507
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm sure Director O will contact Ms. Ko,

508
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,716
but you're closer to her.

509
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:51,680
You should give her a heads-up
so that she can prepare herself mentally.

510
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:54,015
Okay, I will.

511
00:36:57,227 --> 00:37:00,230
I thought he'd be able to hold out
for a bit longer. I feel so bad for him.

512
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:04,025
I'm just a nurse, and even I'm this sad.
It must be devastating for Ms. Ko.

513
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:06,111
Try to comfort her.

514
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:09,781
Yes, ma'am.

515
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,003
Wait, Ju-ri!

516
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,473
I noticed that you didn't take your car,

517
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:39,603
so I figured you'd be back around
this time and waited at the bus stop.

518
00:37:40,103 --> 00:37:42,522
Did you need to
talk to me about something?

519
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,107
No.

520
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:46,526
Then why wait at the bus stop?

521
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,779
Well...

522
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:51,281
It's getting late.

523
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:55,994
And I noticed that a few streetlights
in front of the house are out.

524
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,914
Also, there are no neighborhood guards
in this area, you know.

525
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:01,124
And I just thought of you.

526
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:07,422
Well, the blind date was a lie.

527
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:11,426
But it's true that I have to go

528
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:13,720
on a blind date every month
because of my father.

529
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:17,641
My father had me late, so he's 90... No.

530
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:20,602
Is he 91 or 92 this year?

531
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,481
Anyway, he had me
when he was very old and--

532
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:27,943
Is Song Hye-kyo really your ideal type?

533
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,403
No, not at all.

534
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,698
Well, my ideal type is...

535
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:36,201
How shall I put this?

536
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:41,790
Someone who she can
just lean on when the going gets rough.

537
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:46,336
Someone who can just lean on me
when the going gets rough.

538
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:48,296
She can whine to me all she wants.

539
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:52,634
But even that will look really lovely...

540
00:38:52,717 --> 00:38:55,095
If her dad were still alive...

541
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:56,930
...so I'll think of her as my daughter...

542
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:58,556
"Daughter"?

543
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,060
Are you a pervert?

544
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,231
No. Hear me out, Ju-ri.

545
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:10,485
I want to be there for you
like your father would have been.

546
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:12,862
I want to be that man...

547
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,031
Ju-ri!

548
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:27,252
Are you busy?

549
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:30,088
I always have time to play with you
even when I'm busy.

550
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:35,260
-Do you have the storyline now?
-Yes, roughly.

551
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:50,233
So do those three people

552
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,986
eventually find what they've lost?

553
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,700
Are you asking me
to reveal how the story ends?

554
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,578
No, I'm just curious.

555
00:40:03,538 --> 00:40:04,497
I'm curious too.

556
00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:09,669
The girl who called you "sweetie" earlier.

557
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:10,837
Who was that?

558
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,633
A patient who's 13 years older than you.

559
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:22,348
I see. She has such a young voice.

560
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,893
She could recite at a fairy tale reading.

561
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:33,360
-Ko Mun-yeong.
-Yes?

562
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:38,406
Your father...

563
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,743
-It looks like--
-I know.

564
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:44,079
Director O called me.

565
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,625
He said I should come and see him
while he's still conscious.

566
00:40:51,628 --> 00:40:52,587
It's ridiculous.

567
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,091
Are all parents automatically forgiven

568
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:58,343
for all the bad things they did
before they die?

569
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:01,930
"Your sins are forgiven."

570
00:41:04,182 --> 00:41:07,352
Can they not take their last breath
until hearing that from their children?

571
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:10,688
Are you sure

572
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:14,776
you won't regret it later on?

573
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:20,990
<i>King Donkey Ears.</i>

574
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,286
You said one must let out what's inside
to avoid heartaches.

575
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:28,248
You won't get a chance

576
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,334
to talk to your father again.

577
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,879
Will you really be okay?

578
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:37,882
I don't care.

579
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:41,553
I have nothing to regret or say to him.

580
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:56,067
<i>There was a story</i>

581
00:41:57,193 --> 00:41:59,154
<i>I absolutely hated when I was little.</i>

582
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:04,951
<i>A Tale of Two Sisters.</i>

583
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,038
<i>I hated the father in the story.</i>

584
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:32,770
<i>Even though his daughters
were abused by their stepmother</i>

585
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:35,773
<i>and were on the verge of death,</i>

586
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:39,152
<i>he turned a blind eye to all of it.</i>

587
00:42:43,114 --> 00:42:44,741
The one who neglects

588
00:42:46,534 --> 00:42:49,871
and turns a blind eye to the abuse
is worse than the abuser.

589
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:57,462
<i>Those two sisters</i>

590
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,548
<i>were practically killed by their father.</i>

591
00:43:16,314 --> 00:43:17,357
<i>-No. I hate you, Dad.
-Gosh.</i>

592
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:20,235
-Seon-hae!
-Sir, please calm down.

593
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:21,152
Please!

594
00:43:21,653 --> 00:43:23,154
-I hate you, Dad.
-Seon-hae.

595
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:25,782
-I hate you.
-Please! Help me out just once, okay?

596
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:29,827
Please, Seon-hae! Please...

597
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:32,080
What the heck is going on?

598
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:42,966
Your daughter clearly said no.

599
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:45,718
If you continue to force her
to donate her liver to you,

600
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,096
we'll have no choice
but to call the police.

601
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:53,268
I'm Seon-hae's father.

602
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,853
I'm her biological father.

603
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:59,440
So what? She's not
obligated to donate her liver to you!

604
00:43:59,524 --> 00:44:00,483
Jeez.

605
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:02,777
Sir, please help me out just this once.

606
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,031
I may actually die
if I don't get a liver transplant.

607
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:10,118
What were you doing when your wife
nearly beat your daughter to death?

608
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:12,078
You just turned a blind eye to it.

609
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:14,455
Your daughter needed help,
but you said she was possessed

610
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:16,749
and sold her off to a shaman.
You abandoned her!

611
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,795
That was because she kept talking
complete nonsense back then--

612
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:24,132
You treated her like a total stranger
for 30 years. And now this?

613
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:27,051
If you really want to live,

614
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:29,387
go kneel before your daughter, not me!

615
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:38,438
This hurts.

616
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,610
It hurts.

617
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,076
My stomach hurts too.

618
00:44:53,286 --> 00:44:54,787
My back too.

619
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:56,998
I'm in so much pain that I can't sleep.

620
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,919
Have you ever asked your dad for help?

621
00:45:02,587 --> 00:45:04,005
He never helped me.

622
00:45:04,756 --> 00:45:06,466
He always pretends to know nothing.

623
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:18,269
Seon-hae.

624
00:45:25,777 --> 00:45:29,280
Shall I kick him out
and make sure he never comes back?

625
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:31,282
Or shall I

626
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:34,494
stay by your side
and keep you safe while you say

627
00:45:35,286 --> 00:45:37,038
everything you wanted to say to him?

628
00:45:42,543 --> 00:45:43,795
Please keep me safe.

629
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,010
Seon-hae.

630
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:55,306
I hate you, Dad.

631
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:01,229
You just left

632
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:05,483
whenever Mom abused me.

633
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:11,072
I kept calling you for help.

634
00:46:12,323 --> 00:46:14,826
But you just left.

635
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:18,413
You didn't protect me.

636
00:46:20,248 --> 00:46:22,667
Mom may have been the person who hit me,

637
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,420
but I hate you even more.

638
00:46:27,547 --> 00:46:29,966
I wasn't possessed.

639
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:33,261
But you sold me off to a shaman.

640
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:37,640
I kept waiting for you.

641
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:43,354
I waited for you to come back for me.

642
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,568
I hate you, Dad.

643
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:53,322
I hate you so much, Dad.

644
00:47:40,495 --> 00:47:43,372
<i>You won't get a chance
to talk to your father again.</i>

645
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,210
<i>Are you sure</i>

646
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:49,879
<i>you won't regret it later on?</i>

647
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:55,744
You're annoyed.

648
00:47:56,996 --> 00:47:58,956
"Darn, I'm so annoyed."

649
00:48:07,923 --> 00:48:09,216
"Damn it."

650
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:12,177
Then how about

651
00:48:12,386 --> 00:48:14,471
when you don't like someone?

652
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,182
"I really don't like that guy. Damn it."

653
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:35,117
Then... Then how about when you're angry?

654
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:37,786
"I'm so angry! Damn it."

655
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:45,419
Why... Why are they all the same?

656
00:48:45,628 --> 00:48:47,004
All you do is shout.

657
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:50,382
I think I'll have facial paralysis

658
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:51,967
while helping you with your homework.

659
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:54,011
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

660
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:55,262
Come in.

661
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:02,728
Mr. Moon, I heard you asked for me.

662
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,146
Yes. Hello.

663
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:09,360
I... I have homework that's due next week.

664
00:49:09,443 --> 00:49:11,820
I need to study facial expressions
so I can draw them.

665
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:14,406
You're the art director,

666
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,116
-so can you help me a little?
-Don't do it.

667
00:49:18,077 --> 00:49:21,163
Sure. I'd love to. What can I do for you?

668
00:49:21,246 --> 00:49:23,248
-Come sit here.
-Okay.

669
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:24,750
Thank you.

670
00:49:30,005 --> 00:49:34,718
Can you put on
an adorable expression for me?

671
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:37,054
-"An adorable expression"?
-Yes.

672
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:43,727
She's so cute.

673
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:46,730
This is so hard. It's weird.

674
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,526
Please... Please put on
an adorable expression for me.

675
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:56,824
Let's... Let's take a break.

676
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:58,867
-This is so hard.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Moon.

677
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:06,500
Goodbye.

678
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:07,459
Bye.

679
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:13,632
Hey.

680
00:50:15,968 --> 00:50:16,802
Right now?

681
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:28,689
I didn't know you'd ask me
to drink with you.

682
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,151
Gang-tae is on duty tonight.

683
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:34,194
So I called you instead.

684
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:42,745
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

685
00:50:42,995 --> 00:50:44,329
Is it because of your dad--

686
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:46,749
The king has donkey ears!

687
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:52,755
I called you to do this.

688
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:54,131
I didn't want to hold it in.

689
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:58,761
Then I shouldn't get drunk today.

690
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:01,805
Ju-ri.

691
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:03,557
Yes?

692
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,767
If

693
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:08,145
I were born as your mom's daughter

694
00:51:08,353 --> 00:51:10,314
and you were born as my dad's daughter,

695
00:51:10,397 --> 00:51:11,815
what do you think would've happened?

696
00:51:14,026 --> 00:51:16,487
Then I bet...

697
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:20,908
My mom would beat you up to death
for being rude.

698
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:25,579
You're right.

699
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:25,514
Ju-ri called earlier
saying she's going to be late.

700
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:26,640
She's drinking tonight.

701
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:28,684
She's drinking?

702
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,229
I don't think she should be out drinking.

703
00:52:32,312 --> 00:52:33,188
With whom?

704
00:52:33,772 --> 00:52:34,815
-Mun-yeong.
-My gosh.

705
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:36,275
They shouldn't be together.

706
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:37,818
Leave them be.

707
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:40,112
They're friends.
Let them handle it on their own.

708
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:50,831
Back when I used to cook
for construction workers,

709
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:54,835
Ju-ri brought over a friend
for the first time in her life,

710
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:56,253
and that was Mun-yeong.

711
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:00,048
She was so skinny and small.

712
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:02,384
But she finished a huge bowl of rice.

713
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:07,931
It felt as if it was her first time
eating a warm bowl of rice.

714
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:14,271
I'm guessing something happened
between her and her family.

715
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,609
I'm not quite sure.

716
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:20,444
All I know

717
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:25,991
is that she had a tough childhood.

718
00:53:44,384 --> 00:53:45,469
Are you awake?

719
00:53:46,345 --> 00:53:47,846
Should I get you a cup of water?

720
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,352
I...

721
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:58,440
did something very terrible.

722
00:54:01,026 --> 00:54:01,944
But there's no one

723
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,280
I can ask for forgiveness.

724
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,385
I...

725
00:54:28,804 --> 00:54:30,806
killed my wife.

726
00:54:33,517 --> 00:54:34,935
You killed whom?

727
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,604
That woman

728
00:54:39,314 --> 00:54:40,816
hummed a song

729
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,112
even after she killed someone.

730
00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:18,395
<i>You have glioblastoma.</i>

731
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,940
<i>It's a malignant brain tumor
which means you have</i>

732
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:23,567
<i>a low chance of survival.</i>

733
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,320
<i>As the tumor grows in size,</i>

734
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:29,197
<i>you will start having cognitive
and memory disorders.</i>

735
00:55:43,503 --> 00:55:46,673
Gosh, you seem to be in a good mood today.

736
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,093
Yes, I'm in a very good mood.

737
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:01,563
<i>Last night at around 8 p.m.,
a woman in her 40s</i>

738
00:56:01,646 --> 00:56:03,940
<i>was stabbed to death in the neck
in Oji-gun, Seongjin City,</i>

739
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:07,319
<i>and the police have started
investigating the case.</i>

740
00:56:07,694 --> 00:56:11,323
<i>At the time of the incident,
the victim’s son was with her,</i>

741
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:14,326
<i>but due to his unstable
psychological state,</i>

742
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:18,121
<i>the police are finding it hard to secure
an accurate statement.</i>

743
00:56:18,497 --> 00:56:21,416
<i>The police in Seongjin City
are assuming that the victim was murdered.</i>

744
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,919
-<i>But they haven't found any evidence...</i>
-The new housekeeper.

745
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:25,962
Why isn't she here today?

746
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:28,298
She can't come anymore.

747
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:35,889
She shouldn't have crossed the line.

748
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:04,835
It was you, wasn't it?

749
00:57:06,545 --> 00:57:07,879
You did it, didn't you?

750
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:11,550
Did you kill that woman?

751
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:15,137
Don't worry. No one knows.

752
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:23,645
If

753
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:26,398
I die,

754
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:28,692
Mun-yeong,

755
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:30,861
my daughter,

756
00:57:32,779 --> 00:57:34,823
will become a monster like you.

757
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,868
So please...

758
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,269
Die, you monster!

759
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:12,444
I'm sure

760
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:17,115
I killed her that day.

761
00:58:47,229 --> 00:58:49,564
Ms. Park, is there something--

762
00:58:49,648 --> 00:58:51,191
No, everything's fine.

763
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:54,110
Mun-yeong...

764
00:58:57,364 --> 00:58:58,490
Mun-yeong

765
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:00,784
saw

766
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,620
everything.

767
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:08,542
She was there...

768
00:59:15,507 --> 00:59:17,008
when I killed that woman.

769
00:59:18,927 --> 00:59:20,011
She was just a little girl,

770
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,640
but she saw everything.

771
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:51,686
Dad.

772
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,355
Where were you?

773
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:54,773
Oh, I...

774
01:00:56,816 --> 01:00:57,942
I couldn't sleep.

775
01:00:59,194 --> 01:01:01,613
So I went fishing at the reservoir.

776
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:29,432
<i>Mun-yeong</i>

777
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:32,143
<i>knows everything.</i>

778
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:41,277
Is that why

779
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:46,574
you also tried to kill your daughter?

780
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:48,660
No.

781
01:01:51,162 --> 01:01:52,414
I was just scared

782
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:55,917
that Mun-yeong

783
01:01:57,502 --> 01:02:00,463
might also turn out to be a monster
like her mother.

784
01:02:01,506 --> 01:02:03,508
That's why I did that.

785
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,136
My daughter

786
01:02:07,887 --> 01:02:09,055
did nothing wrong.

787
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:14,519
I'm the one to blame.

788
01:02:35,415 --> 01:02:36,416
I was

789
01:02:37,959 --> 01:02:39,419
really scared of my mom.

790
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:44,132
So I always tried to be a good daughter.

791
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:47,802
I didn't want my mom to hate me.

792
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:53,808
No one came to rescue me.

793
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:00,732
Except for one person.

794
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:06,029
<i>I wanted to run away with him.</i>

795
01:03:09,324 --> 01:03:11,076
<i>But I couldn't because of my mom.</i>

796
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:16,623
What about your dad?

797
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:19,167
Wasn't he there for you?

798
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,005
While my mom raised me her own way,

799
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:28,635
the only thing my dad did for me

800
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:32,055
was read me

801
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:38,019
a fairy tale book just once.

802
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:42,524
"A fairy tale book"?

803
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:50,865
But Ju-ri.

804
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:57,789
He may have only done it just once,

805
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,252
but I can't ever forget that.

806
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:32,615
I have to say,
with all the stuff she's been through,

807
01:04:34,325 --> 01:04:35,451
Ms. Ko grew up pretty well.

808
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,735
PADDED ROOM

809
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:54,549
KO DAE-HWAN

810
01:07:07,395 --> 01:07:08,980
Stop staring at me.

811
01:07:10,481 --> 01:07:12,817
Is that your sad face?

812
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:14,360
No.

813
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:16,404
It's my pretty face.

814
01:07:18,197 --> 01:07:20,575
You shouldn't be embarrassed
about being sad.

815
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:22,160
I'm not sad.

816
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:24,537
No, I think you're lying.

817
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:25,955
Sang-tae.

818
01:07:27,832 --> 01:07:29,417
I can tell she's lying.

819
01:07:36,049 --> 01:07:36,883
Shall we go?

820
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:04,243
KO DAE-HWAN

821
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:09,832
I'm hungry.

822
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,127
-Should we eat something?
-I want <i>jjamppong</i>.

823
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:14,545
No.

824
01:08:14,629 --> 01:08:17,131
I want rice with Gang-tae's homemade
soy sauce braised quail eggs.

825
01:08:18,382 --> 01:08:19,801
Ms. Kang made them.

826
01:08:19,884 --> 01:08:22,011
Ms. Kang makes the best
soy sauce braised quail eggs.

827
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:24,222
And Gang-tae makes really good stew.

828
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:26,224
But his side dishes...

829
01:08:27,225 --> 01:08:28,309
They don't taste good.

830
01:08:37,777 --> 01:08:39,779
"In a castle deep inside the forest,

831
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:42,365
a beautiful princess was born.

832
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:46,244
The king loved his daughter very much,

833
01:08:46,327 --> 01:08:50,164
so he held a party
to celebrate the birth of his daughter

834
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:52,959
and invited 12 wizards."

835
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:56,170
That means I'm also a princess.

836
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:59,757
I live in a castle deep inside the forest.

837
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:01,134
Of course.

838
01:09:01,926 --> 01:09:03,594
I built this huge castle

839
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:07,390
so my daughter could be a princess.

840
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:23,531
Let's see.

841
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:29,078
"The entire country was busy celebrating
the birth of the princess.

842
01:09:29,954 --> 01:09:32,039
But the evil wizard who didn't get invited

843
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,294
<i>got extremely angry,
so she went straight to the castle</i>

844
01:09:37,044 --> 01:09:39,130
<i>to ruin the birthday party."</i>

845
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:55,605
Well,

846
01:09:57,231 --> 01:09:59,025
I know he died due to an illness,

847
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,152
but he still lived a long life.

848
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:04,864
So it's not that bad, right?

849
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:07,450
That's nonsense.

850
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:10,536
Every person's death is sad.

851
01:10:11,037 --> 01:10:11,871
Goodness.

852
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:13,623
But I have to say,

853
01:10:14,498 --> 01:10:17,001
I'm relieved to know that Mun-yeong

854
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,712
has those two brothers to rely on.

855
01:10:20,338 --> 01:10:21,339
My goodness.

856
01:10:22,048 --> 01:10:25,176
Everyone at the hospital
is going to be a bit down for a while.

857
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,512
Since he's been a patient there
for the longest,

858
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,890
so I'm sure people are a bit depressed.

859
01:10:38,064 --> 01:10:39,232
Hey, Gang-tae.

860
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,736
Yes, sure. You can come and take some.

861
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:53,454
I know I shouldn't say this to someone
who just came back from a funeral.

862
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:57,959
But you're like an annoying daughter
who's here to take food for your husband

863
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,752
from your mother's house.

864
01:11:03,422 --> 01:11:04,507
There we go.

865
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:07,176
Are you okay?

866
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:10,680
-Me?
-Yes.

867
01:11:11,722 --> 01:11:12,932
For some strange reason,

868
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:15,893
I keep wanting to ask you that
every time I see you.

869
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:18,854
I'm okay.

870
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:23,067
I'll be okay.

871
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:25,987
But I don't know

872
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,407
if my mom is okay with the fact
that I'm trying so hard

873
01:11:30,491 --> 01:11:32,159
to be happy.

874
01:11:32,243 --> 01:11:34,662
What kind of nonsense is that?

875
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:38,499
The most horrible thing you can do
to a parent is to give up on being happy

876
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,668
just because you feel bad about it.

877
01:11:42,086 --> 01:11:43,754
If you want to make your mother happy,

878
01:11:44,422 --> 01:11:47,508
do your best to live
a happy life from now on. There.

879
01:11:48,384 --> 01:11:49,302
Here you go.

880
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:51,929
Thank you.

881
01:11:52,805 --> 01:11:53,889
We'll enjoy your food.

882
01:11:57,518 --> 01:11:58,769
Didn't it come out nicely?

883
01:12:03,941 --> 01:12:04,942
Yes.

884
01:12:05,693 --> 01:12:06,694
I like it.

885
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:08,487
Should I

886
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:11,073
sell this house?

887
01:12:12,283 --> 01:12:13,117
Why?

888
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:14,952
I just

889
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:18,706
want to start all over again.

890
01:12:22,793 --> 01:12:23,794
That sounds like an idea.

891
01:12:25,796 --> 01:12:27,048
I'll sell this house

892
01:12:27,548 --> 01:12:29,508
and help Mr. Lee open up
a publishing company.

893
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:31,677
And with the money that's left,
I'll buy a camping car.

894
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,598
Sang-tae will be done
once he draws a butterfly on that mural.

895
01:12:36,349 --> 01:12:38,893
So you should also quit
working at the hospital.

896
01:12:39,352 --> 01:12:42,271
Then the three of us can go on a trip

897
01:12:42,521 --> 01:12:43,397
without a destination.

898
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,903
Okay, let's do that.

899
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:57,995
Since you're going to spend some money,

900
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,624
can you buy me some nice suits,

901
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:04,126
pay for my trip to Serengeti,

902
01:13:05,252 --> 01:13:07,755
and let me stay in a hotel suite?

903
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:12,385
How about you take care of me
for the rest of my life?

904
01:13:14,845 --> 01:13:17,056
Don't try to be a gigolo.
It doesn't suit you.

905
01:13:21,894 --> 01:13:22,728
Hey.

906
01:13:24,063 --> 01:13:25,439
Be honest with me.

907
01:13:26,065 --> 01:13:26,899
About what?

908
01:13:28,275 --> 01:13:30,736
What do you really want to do?

909
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:34,824
What's your dream?

910
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:47,795
No, never mind.

911
01:13:48,295 --> 01:13:50,965
Why? Do you not have one,
or do you just not want to tell me?

912
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:53,843
I...

913
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:58,556
want to go to school.

914
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:02,268
Even a night school will do.

915
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:04,562
You want to go to school?

916
01:14:06,021 --> 01:14:06,939
A school...

917
01:14:08,524 --> 01:14:10,234
-No.
-Why not?

918
01:14:10,317 --> 01:14:13,070
Girls in your school will be all over you,
so I can't let you do that.

919
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:16,574
If you must go to a school,
just take online courses.

920
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,081
Then what about you?
Why did you become a fairy tale writer?

921
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:27,334
Me?

922
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:32,047
Because I know that world best.

923
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:36,177
I really grew up like a princess

924
01:14:37,428 --> 01:14:38,971
in this castle that my dad built.

925
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:43,851
The life of a princess

926
01:14:44,477 --> 01:14:47,104
is more difficult
than you can ever imagine.

927
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:51,484
The ending is the only happy part.

928
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:53,027
Darn it.

929
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:00,993
You see,

930
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,538
a happy ending

931
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:06,499
is what matters most.

932
01:15:23,974 --> 01:15:25,518
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

933
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:28,103
I'm going to draw a butterfly today.

934
01:15:28,187 --> 01:15:29,563
I can do it.

935
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,398
-I'll look forward to it.
-Okay.

936
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:33,025
I'll wait for you guys after class.

937
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:34,193
Let's all go home together.

938
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:36,195
Okay.

939
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:38,447
He finally drew it.

940
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,244
Hello.

941
01:15:44,161 --> 01:15:45,079
Sang-tae.

942
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,873
You finally found your door.
Congratulations.

943
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:49,333
-My door?
-Yes.

944
01:15:51,043 --> 01:15:53,337
-Your drawing.
-My drawing?

945
01:15:58,175 --> 01:15:59,510
Hello.

946
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:05,140
What...

947
01:16:07,768 --> 01:16:08,894
No... That's...

948
01:16:10,688 --> 01:16:11,981
That's...

949
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:15,067
I... I didn't...

950
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:17,194
I didn't paint that.

951
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:19,113
That...

952
01:16:20,906 --> 01:16:24,076
That's... Oh, gosh. No...

953
01:16:24,577 --> 01:16:26,745
My... My mom...

954
01:16:28,956 --> 01:16:33,294
That butterfly was on the lady
who killed my mom.

955
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:36,338
Butterfly! That butterfly!

956
01:16:39,091 --> 01:16:40,050
That...

957
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:43,178
That butterfly...

958
01:16:45,931 --> 01:16:47,725
In ancient Greek,

959
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:51,478
the word butterfly is <i>psyche</i>.

960
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:57,776
Do you know what word comes from <i>psyche</i>?

961
01:17:03,741 --> 01:17:05,618
Psycho.

962
01:17:16,045 --> 01:17:17,004
What do you think?

963
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,674
This butterfly is one of a kind.

964
01:17:25,054 --> 01:17:26,221
Do I look pretty?

965
01:17:34,021 --> 01:17:35,397
Why...

966
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:40,194
Why is that butterfly there?

967
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:44,073
That butterfly...

968
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:47,993
That butterfly killed my mom.

969
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:51,080
That butterfly killed my mom.

970
01:17:57,294 --> 01:17:58,379
No.

971
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:04,760
That butterfly killed my mom.

972
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:07,471
-I didn't draw that.
-Mun-yeong.

973
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:08,931
-That butterfly killed my mom.
