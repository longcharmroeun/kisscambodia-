3
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:18,520
You're so warm.

4
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm hungry.

5
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:02,523
BATES MOTEL
PARKING LOT

6
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:14,618
Nice move.

7
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:16,495
You're cold, so go inside and warm up.

8
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:19,039
-Okay, let's do that.
-By yourself.

9
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:34,638
Hello.

10
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:37,016
My gosh.

11
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,853
You're both soaked.

12
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,814
For one night or just for a few hours?

13
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,694
-Well--
-Which room would you like?

14
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:50,738
The mirror room? The themed room?

15
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,822
-Or costumes?
-No.

16
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:53,490
Well...

17
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:56,577
Come here.

18
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,830
Come here. Come on.

19
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,375
-Do you want any add-ons?
-Sorry?

20
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,336
A love chair? A vibrating bed?

21
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,671
How about handcuffs or a whip?

22
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,717
I'll give you ten percent off
if you pay cash.

23
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,427
Let's go.

24
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,263
How about a room with a whirlpool tub?
No extra charge. Don't tell anyone.

25
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:17,681
-Come on. Let's go.
-No.

26
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:18,932
I like this place.

27
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,561
Come on. I'll take you home.

28
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:25,314
-I don't want to freeze to death.
-Our rooms are steamy hot.

29
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,027
-Do you live far from here?
-That's not the point.

30
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,155
What were you thinking? Why bring
your motorcycle in this torrential rain?

31
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,575
-Then just take a taxi home from here.
-Give me money for the taxi ride.

32
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,161
Hey, don't tell me--

33
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:42,164
That's right. I didn't bring anything.
Not even my wallet and phone.

34
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:44,249
Then if I hadn't picked you up--

35
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,336
I would've walked all night in the rain,
like a crazy woman.

36
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:51,674
Can you please think before you act?
Don't be so impulsive and reckless.

37
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:55,010
What if something happened to you
on that dark, remote road?

38
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:57,888
How could you just keep walking
all by yourself? You're fearless.

39
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,099
If something bad happened...

40
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:06,939
Why are you getting angry?

41
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:10,943
Who cares if I walk all night
or put on a strip show in the rain?

42
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:12,861
Why are you getting upset?

43
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:15,531
Were you worried about me?

44
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,575
Are you upset?

45
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:21,745
Does your heart ache?

46
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,919
Do you...

47
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:31,797
like me?

48
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,264
Well, I'm asking
because I really have no clue.

49
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:41,765
You know that.

50
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,726
So you'd better not act like you know
and understand everything about me

51
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,563
when you know nothing.
Don't be delusional.

52
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,065
<i>You're all empty inside.</i>

53
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,401
You're just loud.

54
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:54,445
Like an empty can.

55
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm an empty can who won't understand
how you feel until the day I die.

56
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:03,871
What do you feel now?

57
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,789
Tell me.

58
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:09,877
Why are you all quiet?

59
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:11,962
Are you an empty can too?

60
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,217
I...

61
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:20,846
I...

62
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:22,973
Just say it.

63
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,022
Tell her that you love her.

64
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:32,649
We'll... We'll get a room.

65
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:37,154
Just...

66
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,740
Just any clean and warm room would do.

67
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,116
It's 50,000 won.

68
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,376
What? You have no money on you?

69
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,213
What about your phone?

70
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,840
Even my mom has to pay on the spot.

71
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,925
Bye.

72
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,057
I guess you ran out of the house
in a hurry.

73
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,143
In such a hurry that you couldn't think
before you acted.

74
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:12,981
It's okay.

75
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:15,484
It's natural for men to act instinctively.

76
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,152
Go start your motorcycle.

77
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,828
Hey.

78
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:32,334
There's a cheap motel down the street.

79
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,127
They let you pay later. Go there.

80
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,131
-Thank you.
-Sure.

81
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:49,643
CHAPTER 5 RAPUNZEL AND THE CURSED CASTLE

82
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:10,789
Get off.

83
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,550
His taste is so...

84
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:30,601
Dry yourself with that first.

85
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,396
Give me your clothes.
I don't like dinosaurs.

86
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:39,860
This is fascinating.

87
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,154
You can take care of all your needs
in this space,

88
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,031
from eating and sleeping
to relieving yourself?

89
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,241
This reminds me of an animal stall.

90
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,037
Don't you feel like
you're a domesticated animal living here?

91
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,542
What? Was that rude?

92
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,586
Go get changed.

93
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,381
-Where's your brother?
-Downstairs.

94
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,800
-Don't call him over.
-I won't.

95
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,763
-I don't want you around him.
-Are you jealous?

96
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:10,515
Don't go near my brother, ever.

97
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,684
-Is this a warning?
-I don't care what you think.

98
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:14,519
Just leave him alone.

99
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,521
Will he want the same thing?

100
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:19,900
I should ask him directly.

101
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,237
What? What's the matter?

102
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,448
What's with that gaze?

103
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,286
-What does my face tell you?
-You're handsome.

104
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,373
-No, my facial expression.
-You look obnoxious.

105
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:37,334
What does it tell you about my mood,
emotions, and the state I'm in?

106
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,335
Not interested.

107
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:44,966
Take a good look at their faces
and try to read their emotions.

108
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,718
Learn, even if you're not interested.

109
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,263
If you don't like to feel the emotions,
just memorize them.

110
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:53,392
At least make an effort
unless you'll live by yourself forever.

111
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,644
I don't want to. Why should I?

112
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:56,978
Do it even if you don't want to.

113
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,817
I'm not autistic.

114
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,236
-I'm just a little--
-You're not the zombie kid either.

115
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,445
<i>ZOMBIE KID</i>

116
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,906
The kid who had no emotions.
All he had was the desire to eat.

117
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,326
But what do you think he really wanted?
Satiating his hunger?

118
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,955
Or feeling someone's warmth?

119
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,709
What do you think the answer is?

120
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,753
Food? Was satisfying his desire to eat
all that mattered?

121
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,187
Warmth.

122
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,734
This is what he truly wanted.
He didn't want to be just fed.

123
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,986
You wanted to impart that message.

124
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,904
-You're wrong.
-I'm wrong?

125
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,323
That's right. You're wrong.
Food was all that mattered.

126
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,367
He's a zombie, so he has no emotions.

127
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:55,036
He wanted to fill himself up
even if it was with his mom's limbs.

128
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,748
"Warmth"? Bullshit.

129
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,042
That's just the sickening pity
of sentimentalists like yourself.

130
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,544
Don't put words in my mouth.

131
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:06,131
I'm hungry. Give me something to eat.

132
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,716
Before I start chewing off your limbs.

133
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,654
Who's pitying whom?

134
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:41,625
WHEN USING THE SHAMPOO, PUMP THREE TIMES

135
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,003
SANG-TAE

136
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,926
WHEN BRUSHING TEETH,
DON'T GO OVER THREE MINUTES

137
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,845
Hypocrite.

138
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,396
Why... Why does he hate me?

139
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,564
Sang-tae.

140
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:06,983
<i>Do as I say, please!</i>

141
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:20,205
Sang-tae.

142
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,541
Are you still mad at me?

143
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,214
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.

144
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,842
I'll never do that again.

145
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,511
Forgive me.

146
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,143
Sang-tae, please.

147
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,689
That must hurt.

148
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:48,441
You're hurting yourself.

149
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,070
Someone slapped me in the face today.

150
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,535
I was slapped so hard

151
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,538
that my gums bled,

152
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,166
and I can't even hear well.

153
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:10,380
My face is all swollen,
so I look like Mr. Lumpy now.

154
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,009
-What do I do?
-"Mr. Lumpy"?

155
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:23,184
Where's Mr. Lumpy? Mr. Lumpy.

156
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,771
My lumps are all gone.

157
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:29,983
Gosh, I can't believe it.

158
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,367
Lying is bad.

159
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,369
It's deception.
The cops will come and arrest you.

160
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:44,289
Pinocchio is bad.
The shepherd boy is also bad.

161
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,499
Since you lied to me,
you deserve a scolding.

162
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,544
You need a good spanking.
Will you keep doing it knowing it's bad?

163
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,671
Answer me. Why are you all quiet?

164
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,965
It's because you know
what you did is wrong. Does it hurt?

165
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,894
Have you... You haven't eaten yet, right?

166
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:07,395
Come have a seat.

167
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,316
Are you happy you got spanked?

168
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,401
Why do you keep asking for it?

169
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,779
Are you doing this on purpose?

170
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,906
I got what I deserved.

171
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:19,115
Jeez.

172
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:22,118
All right. Come and eat.

173
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,411
Come on.

174
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:25,038
No.

175
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,374
What? What is it?

176
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,335
Well, would you mind...

177
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,634
Are you hiding your wife
somewhere in the house?

178
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:40,470
No, it's my landlady who's over 60.

179
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,139
I could tell.
It looks like she's a seasoned cook.

180
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,391
Just eat.

181
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:06,162
I want to live with this lady.
She's a great cook.

182
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:10,292
-What do you eat at home?
-I don't eat anything.

183
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:14,754
I don't have a mom
who'd give me her limbs.

184
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,173
Not even a live-in cook, unlike you.

185
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,052
Damn it.

186
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:51,416
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

187
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,727
Why are you standing here?

188
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:55,396
Didn't you hear that sound just now?

189
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,190
No.

190
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:00,235
The power is back on.

191
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,240
I heard someone humming a song
from over there.

192
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,492
Oh, that.

193
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,161
What exactly is "that"?

194
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,872
Didn't Ms. Yoo Seon-hae tell you?

195
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:17,001
Sometime after midnight,
you can hear a ghost humming a song

196
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,755
at the end of the hallway
on the second floor.

197
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,054
I clearly heard it.

198
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:29,389
What? A ghost?

199
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,183
She was probably talking nonsense, right?

200
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:33,768
Well, I'm not sure.

201
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,895
Ms. Yoo Seon-hae...

202
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,444
has been making a living
communicating with ghosts.

203
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,113
What?

204
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,201
She was a shaman.

205
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:57,208
Wait up!

206
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:01,504
I should make some coffee.

207
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:06,217
I saw nothing out of the ordinary
while making rounds.

208
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:07,218
Okay, thanks.

209
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,014
-Where's--
-He's washing his face to wake himself up.

210
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,390
Are you sure?

211
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:17,562
-Do you want some coffee?
-Sure, thank you.

212
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,189
How are Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's vitals?

213
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,608
His blood pressure is still
on the high side,

214
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,401
and he's experiencing
some sleep disorders.

215
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,031
Well, by the way...

216
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,076
Earlier in the garden...

217
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,994
Yes?

218
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,955
Why do you think he did that
to his daughter?

219
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,337
Some post-surgical complications

220
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,714
can result in sudden aggressive outbursts,
you know.

221
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,673
Here.

222
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:49,010
What if that wasn't the cause?

223
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,682
Then what? Are you saying
he attacked her to kill her?

224
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:00,605
No.

225
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:02,732
To live.

226
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:07,070
I mean, because he didn't want to die.

227
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:10,490
<i>If he became aggressive like that
to protect himself...</i>

228
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,075
Die!

229
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:14,827
Ms. Nam.

230
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:16,913
Yes?

231
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,292
You said you and Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
know each other.

232
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:22,919
<i>Shall we</i>

233
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,381
become friends?

234
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,716
But you tried to hide it,

235
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,052
which means you two
aren't really on good terms.

236
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,097
Go away, please!

237
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:37,308
Then now,

238
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,019
ask yourself this.

239
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:43,773
Are you not able to keep your personal
feelings aside when it comes to those two?

240
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,401
You shouldn't let countertransference
get in your way.

241
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,319
You're a professional, you know?

242
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,613
COUNTERTRANSFERENCE: A THERAPIST'S
EMOTIONAL ENTANGLEMENT WITH A CLIENT

243
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,312
Finish it quickly and lie down here.

244
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,524
You must've been
a servant in your past life.

245
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:27,942
And I must've been a mistress.

246
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,279
Look at you working so hard.
You look scrumptious from behind.

247
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,243
I mean, you look stunning,
not "scrumptious."

248
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,121
-My bad. That was a slip of the tongue.
-Get up.

249
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,081
I'll give you money for a taxi,
so go home.

250
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:43,916
No, I'll sleep here tonight.

251
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:48,087
-Who says you can sleep here?
-I can do as I please.

252
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:50,298
-Come on. Get up.
-No, I'll sleep here.

253
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,050
-I'll drag you out.
-You brought me here.

254
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,511
I never said you could sleep here.
Come on. Get up.

255
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,597
You clothed me and fed me,
so let me sleep now.

256
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,516
-I'm not raising a newborn. Let go.
-Let go of me, or I'll scream.

257
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,269
-Get out!
-Sang-tae!

258
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,526
Hey, buddy! Let's have dinner together!

259
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:17,617
Hey, why... Gosh, why did you come out?

260
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,285
-Sorry, Jae-su.
-Jeez.

261
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:22,955
Hey, why are you covered in sweat?

262
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,209
Oh, my room is very hot.

263
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,670
Gosh, it's so hot. You don't feel hot?

264
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,130
Hey, are you having hot flashes or what?

265
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,384
You're acting so weird today.

266
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:37,637
What do you mean?

267
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,017
I thought you'd probably be
eating all alone looking sad,

268
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,519
so I came to keep you company.

269
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:47,438
-Oh, I've already eaten.
-What? Already?

270
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:50,650
Yes. Your food will get cold.
Go downstairs and eat first.

271
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:54,070
-Go on.
-Hey, something's fishy here.

272
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,531
You even left Sang-tae downstairs.

273
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:57,865
Because you were with him.

274
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,493
-You prick, what are you up to all alone?
-Hey!

275
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,830
Gosh, Jae-su.

276
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,001
-You're using force?
-No.

277
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,503
-You're pretty strong.
-No.

278
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,297
-You know who I am, right?
-Yes, of course.

279
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,799
-You do, right?
-Yes, I sure do.

280
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,384
-You'd better watch out.
-Okay.

281
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:20,930
-I'll be downstairs. Call me if need be.
-All right, will do.

282
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:33,860
Open up.

283
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:35,695
Let me in.

284
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,825
Can you let me in?

285
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,871
Sure, if you let me sleep here tonight.

286
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,918
-Open the door first. Then--
-Then you'll drag me out.

287
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,756
No, I won't do that.

288
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,300
For real?

289
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:01,179
Yes, for real. Open the door first.

290
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,431
Okay.

291
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,438
Here, this is open.

292
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:21,157
We look like Romeo and Juliet,
staring at each other like this.

293
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,036
You're right. The ill-fated mortal enemies

294
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,247
who should've never crossed paths.

295
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,374
No, they were meant to be. It was fate.

296
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,544
Their tragic fate killed both of them.

297
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,171
Do you know why they both died?

298
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,049
Because only Juliet drank
the sleeping potion.

299
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:41,344
If they drank the sleeping potion
together, they wouldn't have died.

300
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,055
So let's fall asleep together,
side by side.

301
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:49,227
What the... Your logic makes no sense.

302
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,895
-Let me in.
-I'll sleep here tonight.

303
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,688
-Open the door.
-Sleep beside me.

304
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,190
Open up before I break the door.

305
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,775
How about your brother joins us?

306
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,109
Sang-tae!

307
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,361
<i>What? It burst?</i>

308
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,738
Why would the pipe burst out of the blue?

309
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,698
Shall I come up and take a look--

310
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,575
<i>No, no need. Don't come up.</i>

311
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:05,535
Jeez, you startled me.

312
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:08,829
-<i>I guess it's because the pipe is old.</i>
-It's dirty.

313
00:23:08,913 --> 00:23:11,958
-<i>I should call a plumber tomorrow.</i>
-You often get a cold?

314
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:12,875
All the time.

315
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:16,087
There's water everywhere.

316
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,588
I should stay up all night to clean.

317
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,552
No, it's okay.
Just take care of Sang-tae for me.

318
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,429
Right. Thanks, Jae-su.

319
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:28,474
Yes. Today, you're my favorite.

320
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:37,608
Open the door.

321
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,610
<i>You're a good actor.</i>

322
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,989
Why did you become a caregiver,
not an actor?

323
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,625
Your lies carry a sense of sincerity.

324
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:57,545
It makes me want to believe them.

325
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,174
My brother...

326
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,554
Sang-tae

327
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,309
is always looking at my face.

328
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,523
<i>My eyes,</i>

329
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,234
<i>the shape of my brows,</i>

330
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:22,695
<i>the corners of my mouth,</i>

331
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,823
<i>-and every single wrinkle on my face.</i>
-He's angry.

332
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,784
He studies my face

333
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,163
to figure out my mood.

334
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,334
Even when I'm in unbearable pain

335
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:38,836
and extremely devastated,

336
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,798
my brother believes

337
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,053
that I'm happy

338
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,223
if I force myself to smile.

339
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,238
<i>All I care about
is what my brother thinks.</i>

340
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:12,703
It's fine even if it's fake.

341
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,291
Putting on a smile

342
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:22,672
isn't hard to do.

343
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,344
-"You have no common sense.
-<i>You have no common sense.</i>

344
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,554
-Are you that jealous?
-<i>Are you that jealous?</i>

345
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:32,056
-What's with you?
-<i>What's with you?</i>

346
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,267
-This isn't good.
-<i>This isn't good.</i>

347
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:37,019
-I know how he is.
-<i>I know how he is.</i>

348
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,729
-He's usually nice,
-<i>He's usually nice,</i>

349
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,357
-but he loses it when he's mad.
-<i>but he loses it when he's mad.</i>

350
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,694
-I'm getting a bad feeling about today."
-<i>I'm getting a bad feeling about today.</i>

351
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,237
<i>You jerk!</i>

352
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,576
Then smile at me.

353
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:56,288
You said it's not hard to do. Smile.

354
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:03,129
Just sleep. It's getting late.

355
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:05,798
Were you like this even as a boy?

356
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:12,096
I saw your photo.

357
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:18,728
Did you put on a fake smile
even when you were little?

358
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,150
I don't know.

359
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,986
I don't remember.

360
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,738
Then what about that woman?

361
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,074
The woman you liked.

362
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,869
You said my eyes reminded you of her.

363
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:37,955
Do you still think about her?

364
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,419
-Do you miss her?
-No.

365
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,381
I want to forget her.

366
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,137
She must've been a total bitch.

367
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,472
No, quite the contrary.

368
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:57,641
I was a jerk to her.

369
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:02,146
<i>She saved my life,</i>

370
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,445
<i>but I ran.</i>

371
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:12,281
Like a coward.

372
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:16,744
And I've been running away

373
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,747
since then.

374
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,794
Then why did you pick me up earlier?

375
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:29,215
You ran to me instead of running away.

376
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,258
Right, I'm regretting it now.

377
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:35,679
But I have to say,

378
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,140
I was quite smitten.

379
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:22,101
What is...

380
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,062
Hey, Jeong-tae!

381
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:27,189
What? What's up? What's this sound?

382
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,567
-Call the nurse. The nurse!
-What?

383
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,402
-Darn it.
-Hurry!

384
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,487
What's wrong? Professor Ko!

385
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:35,406
What's the matter?

386
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:37,116
Can you hear me?

387
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,581
Gosh, he's so loud.

388
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:30,002
Jae-su, you're snoring so loudly.

389
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:32,880
Jae-su, are you that tired?

390
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:35,674
You're tired
because you're healthy, right?

391
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,427
Are you okay, Jae-su?
Gosh, you're too loud.

392
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,470
Way too loud.

393
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:09,875
Oh, boy.

394
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:17,249
My dear daughter, you must be exhausted.

395
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,543
Your butt has shrunken to half its size.

396
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,675
-All right.
-I'll take this upstairs.

397
00:30:30,637 --> 00:30:31,763
Goodness.

398
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:44,860
Hey.

399
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:48,447
What are you doing here?

400
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:55,078
I'm obviously here so early
because I slept here.

401
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,246
What about you?

402
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:00,542
Do you deliver milk as a side job?

403
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:01,960
No, I live here.

404
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,087
This is my place.

405
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:08,884
So,

406
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,347
you're the one who suggested that

407
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:15,474
he should move into this house?

408
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:19,394
That's right. I recommended
that he should live here

409
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,271
and also told him about the hospital.

410
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,482
He made the choice though.

411
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,693
It sounds like you're saying he returned
to Seongjin City because of you.

412
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,655
Do you like him?

413
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:33,784
You do. Have you told him?

414
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,744
-It's none of your business.
-I have.

415
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:40,958
"I love you.

416
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:43,544
I love you!

417
00:31:45,462 --> 00:31:46,713
I said, I love you!"

418
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,717
Like that. With all my passion.

419
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,845
-Don't lie.
-I really did.

420
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:58,684
He kept clinging to me
looking like he wanted something from me,

421
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:00,519
so I gave him what he wanted.

422
00:32:04,815 --> 00:32:06,358
Are you giving alms or what?

423
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:09,027
You thief.

424
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,822
-What?
-Don't drool over him.

425
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,532
He was always mine.

426
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,661
Is everything yours
once you set your eyes on it?

427
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:21,999
If you can't make it yours, you would even
destroy it to get your hands on it.

428
00:32:22,582 --> 00:32:25,419
Then you'd play with it a little
and toss it out when you get tired of it.

429
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:28,714
You call that "love"?

430
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:30,882
That's just obsession

431
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:32,843
and greed.

432
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:36,722
Two-faced bitch.

433
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,183
You bad-mouth people like crazy
but act all coy to their faces.

434
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:44,146
You always act nice, weak, and innocent.

435
00:32:44,938 --> 00:32:48,567
That's why you never had any friends
in school. Do you get it now?

436
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,653
You crazy...

437
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,282
You evil witch.

438
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,911
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,707
-Gosh, go to hell!
-Hey, are you on something?

440
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,001
-What the... You need to be on something!
-You...

441
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,003
-Hey, let go!
-You!

442
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,212
Seriously, are you high?

443
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:10,547
-Hey!
-Why you little...

444
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,632
This is why you'll always fail.

445
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,885
-Damn you!
-Have you lost your mind?

446
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:15,802
Ko Mun-yeong!

447
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,476
Let her go.

448
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:26,605
Let go.

449
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,109
-What's going on?
-What's all this noise?

450
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,486
What's happening?

451
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:51,880
Wait, that bitch hit me first!

452
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:53,882
Enough.

453
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:57,386
What? Why am I getting crap for this?

454
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,887
That two-faced bitch hit me first.

455
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,348
I don't care who started it.

456
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:03,600
-Then why are you only taking her side?
-Take her side?

457
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:04,893
"Ko Mun-yeong!"

458
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,145
You only shouted my name earlier.

459
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:10,440
Don't be so childish. Just go home.

460
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,779
Come with me. You need to move out
of this shabby house at once.

461
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:18,156
-I can't leave you here.
-Mind your own business.

462
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,700
I decide where I live.

463
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:20,617
And one more thing.

464
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:24,496
You don't own me.

465
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:28,834
How much did you hear?

466
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:36,550
"I love you.

467
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:40,178
I said I love you." From that point on.

468
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:46,059
Here.

469
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:47,894
I'm paying you back with money

470
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,604
for the love you showed me
out of sympathy.

471
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,001
Damn it.

472
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,004
That two-faced bitch.

473
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:32,147
Sang-tae, wait! Sang-tae!

474
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:34,733
Sang-tae.

475
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:40,947
Sang-tae, I...

476
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,623
The pipes are fine. Nothing burst.
Everything works fine.

477
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,502
Nothing burst. Everything's working fine.

478
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:57,631
Nothing burst.

479
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,258
Nothing burst...

480
00:36:00,884 --> 00:36:01,760
Sang-tae.

481
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,678
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,097
I lied.

483
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:09,559
Lying is bad. If you lie,
the cops will come and get you.

484
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:11,394
You promised me you'd never lie again.

485
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,065
Sang-tae, I'm sorry.

486
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,192
I promise I'll never lie again.

487
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,194
Forgive me just this once.

488
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:24,115
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong...

489
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:28,036
Why was she wearing those clothes?

490
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:31,373
-What?
-That denim shirt and that T-shirt.

491
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,375
"It goes with anything."
You got it on sale

492
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,877
at Bomul Mart.
It was 9,900 won, the BOGO deal.

493
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,964
They're yours.
I know they're your clothes.

494
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:44,302
I let her borrow them.
It rained last night, you know.

495
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,097
Her clothes got soaked,
so I let her borrow mine.

496
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,392
-What about my clothes?
-What?

497
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:57,065
I also have nice...
I have a lot of nice clothes too.

498
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:03,196
I'll let her borrow yours next time
she comes over. The one with dinosaurs.

499
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:05,532
The one with the ultrasaurus.
It was 27,000 won.

500
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:08,201
That's more expensive than 9,900 won.

501
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:10,579
Although higher prices
don't always mean better quality.

502
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,040
Okay, I'll make sure she wears that one.

503
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:15,709
I promise.

504
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:20,046
Okay?

505
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:22,465
Come on, Sang-tae.

506
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,308
Get up and have some food.

507
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:40,233
You need energy
to cry as much as you want.

508
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,154
Get up!

509
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,197
I don't want to eat anything.

510
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,535
She's that girl, right?

511
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:54,247
The friend you brought
back when I used to run that diner.

512
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:55,916
She was never my "friend."

513
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,795
Did she pull out a lot of your hair?

514
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:03,632
Did you lose?

515
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:05,550
Is that why you're crying?

516
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,098
Ko Mun-yeong...

517
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,601
He shouted only her name.

518
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:18,647
He glared at her
without even glancing at me.

519
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:23,276
He always talks so politely to me,

520
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,111
but he talked very casually to her.

521
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:29,032
You're crying your eyes out
because of that?

522
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:31,910
He's closer to me.

523
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:33,495
Why does he call me "Ju-ri" so politely

524
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,205
and why is she...

525
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,332
Why does he call her
"Ko Mun-yeong" like that?

526
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:44,339
And those clothes too.
We bought them together at a BOGO sale.

527
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:47,926
I can't believe he let her wear them.

528
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,136
And she slept in his room...

529
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:54,724
How could he let her sleep in his room?

530
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:01,439
Well, he said
there was a bit of a situation.

531
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:04,359
You know that Gang-tae
would never fool around with a girl

532
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,444
in his room behind his brother's back.

533
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:10,073
Don't you worry.
You'll definitely get your chance.

534
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,204
Mom, how did you know?

535
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:19,249
What? The fact
that you have a crush on Gang-tae?

536
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:21,626
Everyone in this neighborhood knows.
Here, eat.

537
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:26,923
Why keep it all inside?

538
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:29,092
Since this happened,
you should just tell him.

539
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:32,303
-But what if he rejects me?
-Just keep at it.

540
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:34,472
What if he runs away?

541
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:36,474
Chase him to the end of the world.

542
00:39:37,684 --> 00:39:41,146
I, too, had to make such efforts
to bring you into this world.

543
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:46,651
Here.

544
00:39:48,278 --> 00:39:51,239
But I must say, Mun-yeong has grown
into such a pretty lady.

545
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,200
Pretty, my ass!

546
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,744
She is not pretty.

547
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,788
NEW SEONGJIN PUBLIC BATH

548
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:01,875
Hey, will you please pick up your phone?

549
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,169
Goodness.

550
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,803
-Hello?
-<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

551
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:16,389
-We're in trouble.
-<i>Listen.</i>

552
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:19,726
I told you nothing's important to me
unless it's a life or death situation.

553
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,187
We're all about to die.

554
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:23,980
What?

555
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,398
<i>And when you read someone's book,</i>

556
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:29,152
<i>you can easily see
how that writer thinks and feels.</i>

557
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:34,407
Then I guess you also know
what I'm going to do next.

558
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:38,286
<i>But I, too, can attack you
with the tip of my pen.</i>

559
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,287
<i>Goodbye.</i>

560
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:48,963
He got surgery for brain hemorrhage

561
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,465
and woke up in two days.

562
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,842
No wonder Suicide Bomber
has been so quiet lately.

563
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:54,886
Sir, take a look at this.

564
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:58,056
He's demanding a huge amount
of compensation.

565
00:40:58,431 --> 00:40:59,432
If we don't give him that,

566
00:40:59,516 --> 00:41:02,185
Ms. Ko will either end up in prison
or end up destroying her career.

567
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:03,436
What should we do?

568
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:07,398
Check how much cash we have...

569
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:10,819
No, never mind.
Tell the accounting manager to join us.

570
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:14,405
The manager quit a while ago
and won't answer any of our calls.

571
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:16,866
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

572
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,993
You never asked.

573
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:23,331
Sir, the printing house
and the distribution warehouse

574
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,124
keep calling us
asking for the overdue payment.

575
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,460
Sir, how did things go at Seongjin City?

576
00:41:27,544 --> 00:41:30,672
-She's working on her next book, right?
-We're going to be okay, right?

577
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:34,634
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

578
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:35,969
-Sir, wake up!
-Mr. Lee!

579
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:37,220
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

580
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:39,347
-My gosh. Mr. Lee!
-Sir.

581
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,723
Mr. Lee.

582
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,359
-Are you okay, sir?
-Be quiet for a second. Hold on.

583
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:52,569
Give me a minute.

584
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:17,510
Gosh, no way.

585
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:23,433
Seung-jae.

586
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:26,477
Yes?

587
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,272
Do you hike?

588
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:30,732
Yes.

589
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:33,568
I used to be the chairwoman
of a hiking club.

590
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:50,668
Did you sleep with her?

591
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,380
Are you guys dating?

592
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:00,136
Do you like that lunatic?

593
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,475
Are you drunk already?

594
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,188
Then why did you ride Alberto
in the rain for her?

595
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:12,774
Why did you bring her home
when you don't even like her?

596
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,317
Why feed her and let her sleep over?

597
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,236
Was it for charity?
Are you a religious man?

598
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,449
The beer is a bit bland.

599
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:26,621
Gang-tae, don't act out of the ordinary.

600
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:31,501
-You'll die in the prism of your life.
-It's prime, not prism.

601
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:38,258
Anyway, you should be careful.

602
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:39,425
Have you forgotten already?

603
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:43,721
She hurt you with a knife
the first time you met her.

604
00:44:00,363 --> 00:44:01,197
Yes, she did.

605
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:06,244
My gosh, are you reminiscing right now?
Do you miss it or something?

606
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,039
-What are you talking about?
-Hey.

607
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:12,917
People who are insane
don't act based on logic.

608
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,086
They turn into monsters
the moment they lose it.

609
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:18,673
Look. Let this scar be a reminder.

610
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,925
Next time, it might not be your hand.
Goodness...

611
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:25,013
She might just go for your neck.

612
00:44:30,977 --> 00:44:32,020
You're right.

613
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,772
I should avoid her, right?

614
00:44:34,856 --> 00:44:36,691
Of course. Don't ever get involved.

615
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:40,528
I should stay out of her sight.

616
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:44,574
Exactly. Don't even go near her.

617
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:51,164
But the thing is, Jae-su,

618
00:44:59,714 --> 00:45:01,340
I am growing forgetful these days.

619
00:45:02,425 --> 00:45:04,135
-Forgetful about what?
-Everything.

620
00:45:07,346 --> 00:45:08,473
My scars.

621
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:11,100
The butterflies.

622
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,938
Even Sang-tae.

623
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,571
I sometimes just forget about them all.

624
00:45:28,618 --> 00:45:29,452
So

625
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,164
you should remind me like this

626
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,209
from time to time

627
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:39,962
and help me come to my senses.

628
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,093
Okay.

629
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,181
Okay, I get it. So stop smiling like that.

630
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,352
Why?

631
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,188
-Do I look like Joker?
-No.

632
00:45:59,982 --> 00:46:01,109
You look like Chucky.

633
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,766
<i>I'm paying you back with money</i>

634
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,309
<i>for the love you showed me
out of sympathy.</i>

635
00:46:36,144 --> 00:46:37,436
It'll be enough for a taxi ride.

636
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:41,941
Damn it.

637
00:46:46,154 --> 00:46:47,780
Did he give me that money
to get rid of me?

638
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:49,365
Am I only worth 30,000 won?

639
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:51,826
He lives like a poor beggar.

640
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:55,663
That cheap jerk! How dare he?

641
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,832
Darn it.

642
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,000
Cheap jerk!

643
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:04,422
That cheap jerk.

644
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:12,263
Cheap jerk.

645
00:47:30,656 --> 00:47:31,490
My gosh.

646
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:35,411
Why is he so fickle? It confuses me.

647
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,455
Does he have a split personality or what?

648
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:08,236
Sang-tae, are you sleeping?

649
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:21,582
Sang-tae, who do you like more?
Me or Ko Mun-yeong?

650
00:48:29,298 --> 00:48:31,217
I like you more.

651
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:36,639
You're my everything.

652
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:02,790
Who is it?

653
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:10,423
Mun-yeong.

654
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:13,801
We're doomed.

655
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:17,680
Why is she here?

656
00:49:21,183 --> 00:49:22,059
I'm here

657
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,063
because Mr. Lee tricked me
into coming here.

658
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:31,736
With our company building deposit,

659
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,989
I paid that darn Suicide Bomber
the compensation he asked for,

660
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,450
gave our staff their overdue salary
and severance pay,

661
00:49:37,533 --> 00:49:39,660
and paid all our subcontractors
their overdue payment.

662
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,370
And now, I'm broke.

663
00:49:41,454 --> 00:49:42,872
You didn't give me my severance pay.

664
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:46,876
You just bought me this suitcase and
asked me to follow you on a business trip.

665
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:48,502
-Are you a con artist?
-Hey!

666
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,464
I brought you here
to take responsibility for your future.

667
00:49:51,547 --> 00:49:53,716
How are you going to do that
when you've gone bankrupt?

668
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:56,177
Hey, I haven't gone bankrupt.

669
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,680
I still have Ko Mun-yeong. She's my hope.

670
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:00,931
Right?

671
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:02,016
Get out.

672
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,017
This is so annoying.

673
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:05,186
-Mun-yeong.
-Why do I have to be

674
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,521
the person who saves you
from this mess you're in?

675
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,358
Hey, come on.
Don't you know who caused this--

676
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,734
You caused this to happen.

677
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:15,363
Yes, that's right.

678
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,615
It's all because I was an incompetent CEO.

679
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:19,992
-It's all my fault.
-Incompetent jerk.

680
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:21,369
Now, leave.

681
00:50:22,203 --> 00:50:23,788
Mun-yeong, don't be like this.

682
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,166
Just let me stay by your side
and help you publish your books.

683
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:29,001
Last time, you even asked me
to live with you.

684
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:30,127
Don't you remember?

685
00:50:30,419 --> 00:50:32,254
Didn't you run away?

686
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,174
Someone else is going to move in here.

687
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:37,927
Who?

688
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:40,846
No way.

689
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:33,399
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

690
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:37,945
Young man.

691
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:40,072
Hey, young man.

692
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:50,541
Thank you.

693
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:05,681
I've had my eyes on you
for the past couple of days.

694
00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:09,852
And I noticed that you're very handsome.

695
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,148
You also have a nice build
and seem very reliable.

696
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,403
EMPLOYEE CARD

697
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:20,946
"Moon Gang-tae"?

698
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:23,532
You also have a great name.

699
00:52:27,203 --> 00:52:28,078
How old are you?

700
00:52:28,996 --> 00:52:29,914
I'm 30 years old.

701
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,708
What do your parents do?

702
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:36,420
They're dead.

703
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:38,422
Both of them?

704
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:41,342
Oh, dear.

705
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:45,596
Do you have a girlfriend?

706
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:50,935
No.

707
00:52:53,062 --> 00:52:55,856
So that nurse has a crush on you?

708
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,274
Pardon?

709
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,694
That's good.

710
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:02,196
What do you mean?

711
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:09,411
I'd like to introduce you to a nice lady
who would be perfect for you.

712
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:12,081
No, it's okay.

713
00:53:12,164 --> 00:53:13,874
It's not because she's my daughter.

714
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:17,294
She really is a great catch.

715
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:21,131
You should meet her
when she visits me one day.

716
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:23,425
Well, I'll think about it.

717
00:53:24,343 --> 00:53:26,178
I need to get back to work.

718
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:30,766
Let me know if you have a change of heart.

719
00:53:35,771 --> 00:53:38,357
They'll be a really good match.

720
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:51,078
This isn't it.

721
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,125
No.

722
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:02,256
This isn't it.

723
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,060
How about green?

724
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,358
Gosh, no.

725
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:23,902
This one?

726
00:54:25,237 --> 00:54:26,071
My goodness.

727
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:30,743
The first step is always the hardest.

728
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,496
But once you take your first step,
things will get easier from then on.

729
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:43,172
Now, it's time for you to show me
what you're capable of.

730
00:54:44,757 --> 00:54:46,342
No, no! This isn't right!

731
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:48,552
No!

732
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:49,887
-I'm sorry.
-Why did you do that?

733
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:50,971
-I'm sorry.
-That was bad.

734
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,681
-Come here.
-I won't do it again.

735
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:54,850
-Sang-tae.
-You can't do that.

736
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:57,144
The hospital director isn't sane either.
Don't you agree?

737
00:54:58,562 --> 00:54:59,730
Why are you crying again?

738
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,941
-You promised you wouldn't cry.
-You ruined it.

739
00:55:03,025 --> 00:55:05,444
-A-reum.
-Because I'm jealous.

740
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:07,655
I also want to play tag like that.

741
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:11,492
Hold my hand. Let's go take your medicine.

742
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:13,952
-You need to get scolded!
-No!

743
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:15,704
Do you want to get scolded?

744
00:55:17,873 --> 00:55:21,585
It's funny how people who should be
wearing a patient gown aren't wearing one.

745
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,588
-Why did you do that? Why?
-My goodness.

746
00:55:24,672 --> 00:55:26,173
Do you want to get scolded?

747
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,434
Ms. Ko.

748
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:39,603
How do you feel?

749
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,480
Never good. Why did you call me?

750
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,778
I heard what your father did to you.
I'm very sorry.

751
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:50,864
You weren't the one who strangled me.

752
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,826
But still, I was the one who told you
to take him out for walks.

753
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:58,330
Then it was a medical accident.
You can't just end it with an apology.

754
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,210
Then let's do this.

755
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:07,131
You can strangle me instead.
Here. Go ahead.

756
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:12,052
What a crazy old man.

757
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:17,558
<i>The sound of a ghost humming?</i>

758
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,435
Yes.

759
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:23,939
By any chance, do you know what time
it was when you heard that last night?

760
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:26,942
I don't know.

761
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:29,945
I don't even know what date it is today.

762
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:32,364
I just heard it on my way to the bathroom.

763
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,912
Then did you happen to see anyone
in front of room 203

764
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,206
or in the hallway?

765
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:46,086
She said it was a ghost humming,
so it was probably a ghost.

766
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:50,132
Ms. Nam.

767
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,218
Do you actually believe her gibberish?

768
00:56:53,302 --> 00:56:54,887
It's not gibberish.

769
00:56:55,804 --> 00:56:57,598
I swear I can hear it.

770
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:01,351
That's called auditory hallucination.
And it's proof that you're crazy.

771
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,482
Hey, I'm not crazy.

772
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:09,026
Yes, I'm sure you heard what you heard.

773
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:17,367
Then are you saying I'm crazy?

774
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,859
Standing here with you like this

775
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:53,779
reminds me of the past.

776
00:57:56,615 --> 00:57:58,367
Do you remember what you said

777
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:01,328
when I was crying on the rooftop
after I got slapped by a patient

778
00:58:02,788 --> 00:58:04,248
back at Yongrim Hospital?

779
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:08,669
"Why don't you slap me
and make yourself feel better?"

780
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:14,633
I didn't know you'd really slap me.

781
00:58:14,716 --> 00:58:16,802
I must've been crazy.
I don't know why I did that.

782
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:25,686
But thanks to that,
we became really close, didn't we?

783
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,526
Or are we not?

784
00:58:34,862 --> 00:58:36,196
Are we not close?

785
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:39,867
Ju-ri.

786
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,291
Do you want to slap me once again?

787
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,003
Why?

788
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:55,340
Because I feel like you'll get upset
in a little while.

789
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:05,475
Are you

790
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:08,562
rejecting me already?

791
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,355
Don't bother

792
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,525
wasting your emotions on me.

793
00:59:15,402 --> 00:59:16,570
I don't deserve any of that.

794
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:18,697
Because

795
00:59:20,574 --> 00:59:21,992
you're going to leave anyway?

796
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,247
It doesn't matter. Just...

797
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:32,377
Just let me keep liking you.
That's up to me.

798
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,137
Do me a favor.

799
00:59:47,226 --> 00:59:48,310
I hope

800
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,565
you don't run away

801
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,779
because you find me uncomfortable.

802
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:00,822
If you do,

803
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:05,619
it'll make me feel really pathetic

804
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,335
and sad.

805
01:00:16,129 --> 01:00:18,757
Just continue to live with us at our house

806
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,885
while you're in Seongjin City.

807
01:00:26,682 --> 01:00:29,351
My mom really likes you guys.

808
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:30,268
And...

809
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,816
Sang-tae likes living with us as well.

810
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:42,614
Please do that for me.

811
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:10,308
O Ji-wang is bad.

812
01:01:10,642 --> 01:01:11,643
O Ji-wang.

813
01:01:12,644 --> 01:01:16,773
O Ji-wang... O Ji-wang is a bad person.

814
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:21,653
He may be a doctor, but he's a bad person.

815
01:01:21,737 --> 01:01:25,157
O Ji-wang is really fast. He's bad.

816
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,076
He... He needs to learn his manners.
Koreans should be courteous.

817
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:33,248
Sang-tae.

818
01:01:37,085 --> 01:01:38,879
-Do you want to have fun with me?
-Yes.

819
01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:48,472
FACILITY MANAGEMENT CHECKLIST

820

<i>The number you have dialed is
currently unavailable.</i>

821
01:01:54,102 --> 01:01:55,145
<i>Please leave a voicemail...</i>

822
01:02:02,903 --> 01:02:05,572
How... How much did you pay for this car?

823
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,033
Does it cost more than one million won?
Is it two million won?

824
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,785
It costs 100 to 1,000 times more.

825
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:13,747
How... How much money do you have?
Are you rich?

826
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,624
I'm 100 to 1,000 times richer than you.

827
01:02:18,043 --> 01:02:19,378
I guess you like money.

828
01:02:19,461 --> 01:02:21,588
Yes, I... I like money.
I like money, cars,

829
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,006
and I like you, too.

830
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,883
I like you 100 to 12,000 times more.

831
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,763
But where are we going? It's dark outside.

832
01:02:34,976 --> 01:02:36,144
Where did he go?

833
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:38,730
I'm on duty again.

834
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:42,150
Are you looking for your brother?

835
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:43,235
Have you seen him?

836
01:02:43,944 --> 01:02:46,863
He left earlier with Ms. Ko.

837
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:49,491
Why was she here?
She didn't have class today.

838
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:51,284
I don't know.

839
01:03:00,418 --> 01:03:01,920
Is it okay

840
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:05,132
if I touch you?

841
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:18,353
Oh, my gosh.

842
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:30,198
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

843
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,534
-Do you like this place?
-Yes.

844
01:03:33,535 --> 01:03:35,662
-Would you like to move in with me?
-Yes.

845
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:39,124
-Then sign this.
-Okay.

Where is my brother?

848
01:04:44,773 --> 01:04:45,815
<i>He's with me.</i>

849
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:48,276
I warned you

850
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,613
to stay away from my brother.

851
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,742
The employee will live...

852
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:59,829
The employee will live in...

853
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:02,207
-I hung out with him because I was bored.
-the employer's...

854
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,542
Do you want to come pick him up?

855
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:07,671
<i>Where are you?</i>

856
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:10,632
We're at the cursed castle.

857
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,051
Okay.

858
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,262
Do you even know where it is?

859
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:17,472
Yes, I know.

860
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,687
How?

861
01:05:24,312 --> 01:05:26,106
-Because I've been there.
-<i>What?</i>

862
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:31,361
That day when you saved me,

863
01:05:32,612 --> 01:05:35,532
and I ran away from you.

864
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:38,618
Are you telling me

865
01:05:41,746 --> 01:05:42,956
that you knew?

866
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:46,918
I'll see you when I get there.

867
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,084
<i>Sang-tae.</i>

868
01:06:29,794 --> 01:06:31,880
<i>Should I tell you an old tale?</i>

869
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,674
Yes.

870
01:06:36,134 --> 01:06:38,595
A long time ago, deep inside the forest,

871
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:40,972
there lived a little girl

872
01:06:42,182 --> 01:06:43,892
in a cursed castle.

873
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:50,315
The little girl's mother
always told her daughter

874
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,235
that she's too special

875
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:58,782
to live among everyone else
outside the castle.

876
01:07:01,076 --> 01:07:02,243
The mother told her daughter

877
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,955
that she must live inside the castle.

878
01:07:12,045 --> 01:07:13,588
<i>However, the little girl</i>

879
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,633
<i>felt like she was imprisoned.</i>

880
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,013
<i>So she prayed to the moon every day.</i>

881
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,017
<i>"Please</i>

882
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:32,107
<i>send me a handsome prince
who can save me from here."</i>

883
01:07:37,404 --> 01:07:38,780
<i>"Will he come today?</i>

884
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:42,367
<i>Will he come tomorrow?"</i>

885
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,078
<i>The little girl</i>

886
01:07:46,538 --> 01:07:48,373
<i>waited every day
for her prince to show up.</i>

887
01:08:50,101 --> 01:08:51,352
Earlier, I was too...

888
01:08:55,857 --> 01:08:56,774
Get lost.

889
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:46,384

No, I'm against this team!

900
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,895
You cause trouble because you can't even

901

<i>control yourself.
So how are you going to care for him?</i>
