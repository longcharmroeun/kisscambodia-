00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:47,281
Sang-tae.

4
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:49,783
Sang-tae.

5
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,435
How long have you known?

6
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,605
When did you figure out who I am?

7
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,402
You said my eyes reminded you of her.

8
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,153
<i>You're not running away.</i>

9
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:09,530
<i>You're not avoiding me either.</i>

10
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,490
<i>You grew up to be a great guy.</i>

11
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,493
I'd say you didn't just grow,
you went through an evolution.

12
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:17,121
<i>I probably knew</i>

13
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,540
<i>the moment</i>

14
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:22,084
<i>I first looked into your eyes.</i>

15
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:30,884
You really know how to put on an act.

16
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,637
You could easily win an Oscar.

17
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,098
Was it fun?

18
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,226
You pretended not to know anything.
How despicable of you.

19
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,936
How dare you fool me?

20
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,191
-You also did the same--
-I...

21
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,239
I didn't pretend I didn't know you.

22
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:53,407
I know.

23
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,618
You wanted me to recognize you.

24
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:00,331
But I wanted to avoid you.

25
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,168
I wanted to keep acting like
I didn't know and ignore you.

26
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,085
Why?

27
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,590
I already told you the other night.

28
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,760
<i>She saved my life,</i>

29
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:15,846
but I ran.

30
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,266
Like a coward.

31
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,228
<i>And I've been running away since then.</i>

32
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:25,481
Did you get sick of putting on
your despicable act?

33
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,524
Why are you suddenly opening up?

34
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,446
So that I can properly end this.

35
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,033
Thank you

36
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:39,870
for saving me that day

37
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,456
at the frozen river.

38
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,584
I'm sorry

39
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,837
for running away
when I was the one who liked you first.

40
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,384
-I regretted it the moment I turned away--
-Cut it out.

41
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,388
I didn't get to say this to you

42
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:01,100
-that day when I came here.
-Stop talking.

43
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,851
That kept bothering me,

44
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,314
and I think that's why
I couldn't get over you.

45
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,401
So you no longer have feelings for me?

46
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:13,946
My brother is already a handful.

47
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,074
That's more than enough for me.

48
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,914
You care for your brother, so why not me?

49
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,291
Take care of me, too.
I need you as much as he does.

50
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:35,092
I'm done with being someone
who is needed by others.

51
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,857
You can't reject me.

52
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,317
I saved your life.
I let you live that day.

53
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,279
And I thanked you for that.

54
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:57,406
Because you saved my life that day,

55
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,324
I've been living a fucked up life.

56
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,999
I'll kill you if you go.

57
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:11,545
You can't run away. You're mine.

58
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,434
Have you lost it?
Do you want to get yourself killed?

59
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:27,811
Don't go.

60
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,149
Let's live together.

61
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,235
Let me go.

62
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,113
Gang-tae?

63
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:41,658
Sang-tae.

64
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,036
Are you okay?

65
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,496
Are you feeling better?

66
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,580
Yes.

67
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,082
Why did you drink?

68
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,834
Let's go home.

69
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,588
This... This is... This is my home now.

70
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:56,548
What?

71
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,967
I need... I need to live here now.

72
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,345
I... I made a promise.

73
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:03,805
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,809
I... Ms. Ko... I'm also...

75
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:11,355
I'm... I'm also an illustrator now.

76
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,903
-Give me that.
-No, it's... It's mine.

77
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,279
He signed a deal with me.

78
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,823
I hired him as my illustrator
for my books.

79
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,576
He'll be working here.

80
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,665
"The employee... The employee will live
in the employer's studio

81
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:31,959
and draw illustrations from there."

82
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:34,753
I told you, didn't I?

83
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,381
You can't run away from me.

84
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:41,093
Give me that, Sang-tae.

85
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,220
No, it's mine. No.

86
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:45,681
That's no good.
You're being taken advantage of.

87
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,767
-Give me that. Give it.
-No, it's... It's mine.

88
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,561
-Give it to me.
-I want to be an illustrator.

89
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,979
-I want to live here.
-Sang-tae.

90
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,147
This is our home now.

91
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,899
This is not our home!

92
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,452
No! No, that belongs to Sang-tae!

93
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:09,580
It's mine! No! That's mine!

94
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,623
That's mine!

95
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,208
-Sang-tae.
-It belongs to Moon Sang-tae!

96
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,586
I belong to myself! You don't own me!

97
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,212
Sang-tae!

98
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:21,925
No, it's mine! Mine!

99
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:25,262
No!

100
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,056
I belong to myself!

101
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,560
Moon Sang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae!

102
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm not yours! I belong to myself!

103
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,900
I belong to myself!

104
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,152
Moon Sang-tae! I belong to myself!

105
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,570
-Stop it.
-It's mine!

106
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,405
I'm not yours!

107
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,741
No! It's not yours!

108
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,744
-Stop it.
-You don't own me!

109
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,006
Sang-tae.

110
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,216
Go back inside.

111
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,846
I...

112
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,433
Go on.

113
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,103
Go on.

114
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,358
Moon Sang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae.
I don't belong to you.

115
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,817
I'm not yours.

116
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,284
I belong to myself.

117
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,912
Moon Sang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae.

118
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:32,913
I'm not yours!

119
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,144
Your brother abandoned you.

120
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,106
Now, it's your turn to choose.

121
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,984
Will you also abandon your brother,

122
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,155
or will you let him lock you down
your entire life?

123
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,743
Don't end up

124
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,080
being fickle about it
like you were back then.

CHAPTER 6 BLUEBEARD'S SECRET

126
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,112
<i>Mom!</i>

127
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,239
Mom!

128
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,788
Mom, I got my red belt today...

129
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:40,582
Gang-tae!

130
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:42,793
Why did you do that?

131
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:44,377
Why?

132
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,421
Why did you send your brother home first?

133
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:49,090
You should've stayed with him all day!

134
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,760
What were you doing
when he was getting beaten up?

135
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,971
I let you learn martial arts
so you could protect your brother.

136
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,724
How could you let him come home
looking like that? Goodness.

MOON GANG-TAE

138
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,023
My job

139
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,193
isn't to protect Sang-tae.

140
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,529
What?

141
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:14,199
I don't belong to Sang-tae!

142
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,284
I belong to myself!

143
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:19,329
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

144
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,587
What did you say?

145
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,549
What did you just say?

146
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,883
"Moon Gang-tae

147
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,011
belongs to Moon Gang-tae!"

148
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,603
I just want

149
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,941
my brother to die!

150
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:53,905
Gang-tae.

151
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,158
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

152
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,327
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

153
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:00,912
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

154
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,383
Gang-tae!

155
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,634
Gang-tae!

156
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,639
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

This belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

158
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:37,866
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

159
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:39,951
MOON GANG-TAE

160
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,037
Get up.

161
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,838
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

162
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:11,066
-That's mine.
-Come and get it.

163
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,986
That's mine. It's mine.

164
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:21,493
Give me that.

165
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,049
Give me that. Give it to me.

166
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,050
Give it back.

167
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:39,511
There!

168
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,974
Come on!

169
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,937
Sang-tae, don't... Goodness.

170
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,063
Sang-tae.

171
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,272
Sang-tae.

172
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:03,868
This belongs to Moon Sang-tae!

173
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,123
This belongs to Moon Sang-tae!

174
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,006
Sang-tae!

175
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,510
-Sang-tae...
-Gang-tae!

176
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,638
Gang-tae!

177
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,265
Gang-tae!

178
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,894
Gang-tae! Help!

179
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:32,188
Gang-tae!

180
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,652
<i>I just want my brother to die!</i>

181
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:41,948
Gang... Gang-tae!

182
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:43,742
Gang-tae!

183
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:46,953
Gang-tae!

184
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,788
Gang-tae!

185
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:50,790
Gang-tae!

186
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,126
Gang...

187
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,629
Gang-tae!

188
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,757
-Keep going.
-Gang-tae!

189
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:04,929
Just go.

190
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:19,736
Just leave him.

191
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,913
Gang-tae!

192
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,122
Help!

193
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:32,749
Climb up the ice, Sang-tae!

194
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,459
Sang-tae!

195
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,461
Go up!

196
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:37,712
How boring.

197
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,380
Sang-tae.

198
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,095
-Gang... Gang-tae.
-Sang-tae!

199
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:46,596
Sang-tae!

200
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,057
Sang-tae, hold my hand.

201
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,310
Sang-tae!

202
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,437
Sang-tae, help me get out!

203
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:55,814
Help!

204
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,066
Sang-tae! Help me!

205
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:58,983
Sang-tae!

206
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:03,696
Sang-tae.

207
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:05,240
Sang-tae!

208
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,000
Shall I help him?

209
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,089
Or not?

210
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,180
<i>Shall I help him?</i>

211
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,568
Or not?

212
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:45,590
Wait.

213
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,634
<i>Because you saved my life that day,</i>

214
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,552
<i>I've been living a fucked up life.</i>

215
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:39,894
Sang-tae.

216
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:43,439
Don't worry.

217
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:46,359
He won't be able to abandon you.

218
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:16,347
<i>The employee will live
in the employer's studio</i>

219
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:17,765
<i>and draw illustrations from there.</i>

220
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:22,729
<i>The employer will acknowledge the employee
as the best illustrator in the world.</i>

221
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,649
<i>The employer will buy the employee</i>

222
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,110
<i>a walk through van camping car
instead of paying him.</i>

223
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:32,780
<i>The employee has a little brother
who doesn't like to move.</i>

224
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,995
KO MUN-YEONG, MOON SANG-TAE

225
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,552
<i>Excuse me.</i>

226
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:40,848
I'll take this, this, and this.

227
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:42,100
I want this one.

228
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:44,602
I'll take everything except for this one.

229
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,191
Do you think she'll accept you
just because you buy her this?

230
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:53,945
That's not the problem.
She can't write if she's low on sugar.

231
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:57,573
We need to make sure she gets her fix
every now and then. How much is it?

232
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,909
-It's 52,200 won.
-Why can't he be nice to me as well?

233
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,502
Something doesn't feel right.

234
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:11,546
That's why your business went under.

235
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:13,005
You darn brat.

236
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:17,718
We need to get there first
before she brings someone else

237
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:20,012
to that cursed castle.

238
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:21,013
Hurry up and eat.

239
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:25,977
Gosh, it's so hot.

240
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,402
My goodness.

241
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,324
-Today's your day off, right?
-Yes.

242
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,453
My parents sent me some potatoes,
so I boiled...

243
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:47,832
What happened to your face?

244
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,835
Did a patient throw a fit?

245
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,253
No, it's nothing like that.

246
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,963
Did you fight with someone?

247
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:56,841
Did you?

248
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,594
I had an argument with my brother.

249
00:21:59,677 --> 00:22:01,012
An argument, my foot.

250
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,638
It looks like he beat you up.

251
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:04,682
My goodness.

252
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,227
Sang-tae!

253
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,980
If you hit your brother like that
one more time,

254
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,982
I'll have to give you a scolding.
Do you hear me?

255
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,320
-He's not home.
-He even ran away?

256
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,909
No, that's not it.

257
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,537
My goodness, that's great.

258
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:29,790
Does that mean
Sang-tae is an illustrator now?

259
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:36,047
Do you really think it's a good thing?

260
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,883
Of course it's a good thing.

261
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,469
I'd like to thank that person

262
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:45,473
for giving Sang-tae
such a great opportunity.

263
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:51,562
Gang-tae.

264
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,024
You should root for him.

265
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:59,403
You took good care of him until now.

266
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:03,533
Now, it's time for you
to let him do what he wants.

267
00:23:06,494 --> 00:23:09,121
You shouldn't stop people
from doing what they want

268
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,791
or liking someone.

269
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,668
Plus, it's impossible.

270
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:54,750
-Who...
-Gosh.

271
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,759
-Who was that?
-It's that guy.

272
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,137
He's that caregiver's older brother.

273
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,681
The guy who caused a scene
at the bookstore.

274
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:11,267
My gosh, it's that caregiver again?

275
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,353
Hey, Mun-yeong. Open the door.

276
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,565
Hey, open the door. Let me in.

277
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:21,444
Okay, fine. I'll just break the door. One.

278
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,154
Who's being so loud?

279
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,364
Two, three.

280
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,040
Why are you here?

281
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:39,462
-Kick him out of here right now.
-But I live here.

282
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,714
-What?
-He's right. We're living together.

283
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,550
We live together.
We're not married, but we live together.

284
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:46,052
-We're not married.
-My gosh.

285
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:48,095
You're living with this guy?

286
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,515
"The employee will live
in the employer's studio

287
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,809
-and draw illustrations from there."
-What illustrations?

288
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,103
Say hello to my exclusive illustrator.

289
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:58,397
Hello. I'm Moon Sang-tae, 35 years old.

290
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:00,733
My blood type is AB,
and I was born in the year of the rat.

291
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,276
I have autism spectrum disorder.

292
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,403
But I have no problem
taking care of myself.

293
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,324
I'm Yoo Seung-jae, the art director
who's in charge of illustrations--

294
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,242
No, I'm against this team!

295
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:11,744
-I'm all for it.
-Me too.

296
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:12,912
Me too.

297
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:15,706
Mun-yeong.

298
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,376
You cause trouble
because you can't even control yourself.

299
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:20,086
So how are you going to care for him?

300
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,004
What if both of you end up
causing trouble?

301
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:27,802
My safety pin.

302
00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:28,969
What? What pin?

303
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:31,263
I have my safety pin, so don't worry.

304
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:39,814
Gang-tae.

305
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,900
My brother.
He's... He's my little brother.

306
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,486
-We met him last time.
-He's my little brother.

307
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:48,280
He may be a coward,
but he's still my little brother.

308
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,533
Are you okay?

309
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:53,369
I'm sorry.

310
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,747
It's okay. Let's go inside.

311
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:57,665
Okay.

312
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:04,588
Mun-yeong.

313
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:06,507
Mun-yeong. Hey...

314
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:14,098
A collaboration between an author
with a personality disorder

315
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,517
and an illustrator
who has a developmental disorder.

316
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:20,187
Sir, this will either be a huge success
or a complete disaster.

317
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,231
My gosh.

318
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:26,861
What?

319
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:30,614
Give me your car keys.

320
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,202
My car keys? Why?

321
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,330
The mountain road is pretty rough,
so I need an SUV.

322
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:40,416
It's my car anyway. Goodbye then.

323
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,023
My goodness gracious.

324
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:05,775
I must've been crazy.

325
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,904
I can't believe
I said those things to him.

326
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:12,782
My goodness. Oh, by the way,

327
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:16,535
what's the name of the writer
that Sang-tae will be working with?

328
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:19,663
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

329
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,248
You've met her once.

330
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:22,750
Ko Mun-yeong...

331
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,585
He shouted only her name.

332
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,962
My gosh, what is wrong with me?

333
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,590
My goodness, why?

334
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,677
I feel so bad for my daughter.

335
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:38,182
-Mom.
-My goodness, my heart.

336
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,269
Why are you so startled?

337
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,772
What... What are you talking about?

338
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,691
Get me a cup of water
so I can take my medicine.

339
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:58,536
I'll have them ready.

340
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,120
It'll only take five minutes.

341
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,039
Five minutes.

342
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,835
You chose your brother again.

343
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,089
I have a few conditions.

344
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:12,591
Did I play a part in helping you
come to a decision?

345
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,805
He can stay during the weekdays.

346
00:28:18,472 --> 00:28:19,974
I'll take him home every weekend.

347
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:21,267
Did I not play a part?

348
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:25,354
There.

349
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:27,731
If Sang-tae wishes to quit,

350
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,400
I'll take him back whenever.

351
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:30,526
Not even just a little bit?

352
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,070
And...

353
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,658
I want you to respect him
as much as you can.

354
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,123
Okay, I will.

355
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:45,541
How can I trust you?

356
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,377
-Should I write a blood contract?
-You said promises are like trash.

357
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,297
I'll keep my word.

358
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,341
Because it's a promise I made to you.

359
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:07,813
No, please...

360
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:10,816
No, please.

361
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:13,277
Gang-tae! Moon Gang-tae!

362
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:22,786
They're gone.

363
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,624
Hey, do you have a death wish?

364
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:29,084
Do you want to be stabbed again or what?

365
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:31,629
I've warned you
not to go anywhere near that bitch.

366
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,839
I can't believe you packed up
and moved in with her.

367
00:29:33,923 --> 00:29:35,883
Have you lost your mind? Are you insane?

368
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,968
You'd better get back here
before it's too late.

369
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:42,056
Come back to me, please!

370
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:47,686
-That blabbermouth.
-Mom.

371
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:50,522
What's with Jae-su? Is he drunk?

372
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:53,817
Oh, the thing is...

373
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:55,778
Well...

374
00:30:03,244 --> 00:30:04,662
Ko Mun-yeong.

375
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,873
You evil witch!

376
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:17,007
This is where you'll work from now on.

377
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,927
There are so many books!

378
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,847
Upstairs... There are more books upstairs.

379
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:28,394
-Be careful, Sang-tae.
-That old man is huge!

380
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:30,270
There are so many books!

381
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:32,898
Sang-tae loves books.

382
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:33,983
What do you like?

383
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:39,780
-Nothing in particular.
-Sang-tae asked me to buy a camping car.

384
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,323
Do you like to travel?

385
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,909
-I've never traveled anywhere.
-Not even once?

386
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,871
-I'd like to travel.
-Where would you go?

387
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:49,957
Anywhere.

388
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,251
I'll travel without a set destination.

389
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:55,421
We've never traveled,
but we've moved so many times.

390
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:57,840
About 17 times. This is our 18th move.

391
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,050
-Sang-tae.
-Why did you move so many times?

392
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,720
-Because it follows me wherever I go.
-Who follows you?

393
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:04,596
-Sang-tae.
-It follows me wherever I go...

394
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,515
Come on.

395
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:08,058
Where's our room?

396
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:11,603
There are so many books!

397
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:23,365
Hi!

398
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:32,041
How pretty!

399
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,834
My room is so nice.

400
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,544
This was my room when I was little.

401
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,091
You guys will need another bed over here.

402
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:42,843
My room is so nice.

403
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:47,681
You've never had a bed before?

404
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:50,851
No.

405
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:56,190
Darn it. These sheets...

406
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:59,360
-When was the last time you washed them?
-About 20 years ago?

407
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,906
It's true vintage.

408
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,617
I can see outside from here!

409
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,035
Gosh, Sang-tae!

410
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:11,413
I'm stoked! This is so soft.

411
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,082
This is very soft.

412
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,126
How soft. Is this my bed?

413
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:17,961
Gosh, it's so soft.

414
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,113
No one saw you, right?

415
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,864
One person saw me.

416
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:47,783
-Who?
-Professor Ko.

417
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,326
Mr. Ko Dae-hwan?

418
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,287
Yes, he sat up and said...

419
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,580
Where are you going?

420
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,585
Are you going somewhere?

421
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:02,005
That's what he said.
Gosh, I almost got a heart attack.

422
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,799
I was so startled that I wet my pants.

423
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:05,551
Really?

424
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:11,849
-You need to change your underwear.
-It's okay.

425
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,405
Oh, my. This tastes extra delicious
because I haven't had it for a while.

426
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:27,739
It's sweet, isn't it?

427
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,617
That's soda.

428
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,786
That's the placebo effect.

429
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:35,664
If you think that it's soju,
it'll actually taste like soju.

430
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,083
Then you should've told me
after I finished this.

431
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,712
I told you to just leave
if you want to drink real booze.

432
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,589
Why are you not leaving and staying here?

433
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:46,884
It's not time yet.

434
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,677
You and your excuses.

435
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:51,472
All right, tell me.
Anything new about the patients?

436
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,267
But the thing is, shouldn't you
be able to pick out these things

437
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,394
during your sessions with the patients

438
00:33:57,478 --> 00:33:59,062
and diagnose them?

439
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:00,272
I mean, you're a doctor.

440
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,232
There's a saying that goes like this.

441
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,861
"Only those who have suffered
truly understand suffering."

442
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,114
Right. Some things
you just can't learn in books.

443
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:12,409
Yes, and there are limits to what
the patients tell me during the sessions.

444
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:15,329
Patients often deceive their doctors.

445
00:34:15,412 --> 00:34:16,496
That's true.

446
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,373
You know Joo Jeong-tae, right?

447
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,542
-The alcoholic in my room.
-Yes.

448
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,169
When he went out last week,

449
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:24,296
he filled sanitary gloves with soju

450
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,506
and hid them in his underwear
to bring them here.

451
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:15,013
Well, down there...

452
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:16,139
Sang-tae.

453
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,893
Have you ever heard
the story of <i>Bluebeard</i>?

454
00:35:22,062 --> 00:35:26,441
<i>Once upon a time,
a count with a blue beard</i>

455
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,778
<i>lived alone in a huge castle.</i>

456
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:33,740
-Welcome.
-<i>He was very wealthy,</i>

457
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,618
<i>but everyone avoided him out of fear</i>

458
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,746
<i>because of his blue beard.</i>

459
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:42,541
<i>But one day,</i>

460
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:47,212
<i>a poor woman came to the castle</i>

461
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:49,214
<i>and said that she wanted to be his bride.</i>

462
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,177
<i>Brimming with joy,</i>

463
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,181
<i>Bluebeard brought out all the jewels
and treasures from each room</i>

464
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:01,226
<i>and gave them to his wife as a gift.</i>

465
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:05,397
<i>However, there was an exception.</i>

466
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:09,318
<i>The room in the basement.</i>

467
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:14,865
<i>He warned her to never go into that room.</i>

468
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:17,868
<i>But his curious wife</i>

469
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:22,748
<i>eventually opened the secret door
without telling her husband.</i>

470
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,754
<i>Do you know what was in that room?</i>

471
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,800
<i>Corpses of women</i>

472
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,803
<i>were displayed on the walls.</i>

473
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:40,849
<i>They were the wives of Bluebeard
who had ignored his warning</i>

474
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,018
<i>and opened that door.</i>

475
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:46,229
<i>That's how they all ended up.</i>

476
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:52,527
Is that how the story ends?

477
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,072
Yes.

478
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:58,575
Sang-tae.

479
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:00,827
Don't go down

480
00:37:01,745 --> 00:37:03,664
to the basement without permission.

481
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,291
This isn't our house, you know.

482
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,256
But why were the villagers

483
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:16,301
afraid of Bluebeard?

484
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:21,390
Because he was different from them.

485
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:24,393
His beard was blue.

486
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,854
Is being different
something to be afraid of?

487
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,157
I guess so.

488
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:43,328
Do you have to live alone in a castle
when you're different?

489
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:45,414
No.

490
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,710
<i>He will eventually find his true love</i>

491
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:52,963
<i>who isn't afraid of his blue beard</i>

492
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:55,799
and tells him
that it's okay to be different.

493
00:37:57,968 --> 00:38:00,512
Someone who understands him for who he is.

494
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:45,432
They didn't move out for good.

495
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,142
He said they'll be back on the weekends.

496
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,227
They'll go back and forth and--

497
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,480
Jeez! Just pick a lane and stick with it!

498
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:59,571
It's not like she talked Gang-tae into it
to seduce him.

499
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:01,239
I'm sure it's strictly about work.

500
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:05,452
Seriously! Turn on your blinker.

501
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:09,790
Hey! Just lash out at me
and stop honking, will you?

502
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:10,999
You have a mouth, so use it!

503
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:14,836
<i>I'd staple your lips together
if you weren't my mom.</i>

504
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,632
Just say it, okay?

505
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:23,178
Honk, honk, honk!

506
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,096
Honk, honk, honk!

507
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:27,724
Have you lost your mind?

508
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:29,935
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

509
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:30,852
<i>Sir.</i>

510
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:33,772
What is your name?

511
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,401
Do you know where you are now?

512
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,031
This is odd.

513
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:47,536
His condition can change suddenly,

514
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:49,830
so keep an eye on him and keep me updated.

515
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:50,747
Yes, sir.

516
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:55,794
Where have you been?

517
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,589
I was feeling a little stuffy
so I went for a walk.

518
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:01,383
This week, you've been...

519
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,300
Ko...

520
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,887
Dae-hwan.

521
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,891
What did you say?

522
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,144
She's

523
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:16,606
so beautiful.

524
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,234
She looks

525
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,864
like an angel.

526
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:28,410
Who looks like an angel?

527
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:39,421
Mun-yeong's...

528
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:42,924
mother.

529
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,600
You shouldn't be drinking.

530
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,934
I didn't drink.

531
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:06,114
It's probably too soon
for another one-on-one with Ms. Ko, right?

532
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:09,701
You know what happened last time
they went out for a walk together.

533
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,370
But are you sure
he did that to his daughter?

534
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,623
What do you mean?

535
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,754
It's possible that he saw someone else
when he was looking at his daughter.

536
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:23,924
Who?

537
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:26,217
We'll have to find out.

538
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:30,180
Your snitch didn't tell you
anything about that?

539
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:33,224
I'll keep the linen room locked
from now on.

540
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,438
She knows everything.

541
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,412
I slept so well.

542
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:22,065
Ms. Ko, did you sleep well?

543
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,233
Oh, yes.

544
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,741
We got up at 6 a.m.
We washed all the sheets,

545
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:34,285
picked up groceries, and cleaned

546
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:36,579
while you slept.

547
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:49,217
Come and have breakfast.

548
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,469
Sang-tae, go wash your hands.

549
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,306
Hands should be washed in the bathroom.

550
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,231
What do you usually eat for breakfast?

551
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,400
We usually just have rice for breakfast.

552
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:08,361
Do you prefer bread?

553
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:11,072
No, rice.

554
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:12,991
Okay.

555
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:26,963
I want a lot.

556
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:41,936
Do you want more?

557
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:43,271
Sure.

558
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:52,238
Don't just say that you'll be here.

559
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,574
Come today, okay?

560
00:43:55,992 --> 00:43:59,162
PUBLIC PHONE

561
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:03,708
This guy is a real catch.

562
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:07,295
Remember your blind date in Dogok-dong?

563
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,547
That plastic surgeon
who looked like an octopus.

564
00:44:09,631 --> 00:44:12,383
This guy is 1,000 times
more handsome than him.

565
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:17,013
You only care about looks
because you take after me.

566
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:20,517
Really?

567
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,062
You'll come today?

568
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:30,193
So you're saying Ms. Kang Eun-ja
hasn't paid you back

569
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:33,154
for all the snacks she borrowed from you?

570
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:34,489
That's right.

571
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:36,825
Talk about stealing from the poor.

572
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:38,493
I mean, she's rich. What's with her?

573
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:42,330
She asked for money and said she'd
pay me back when her daughter visits.

574
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,500
Right, she even took my chocolate.
My chocolate and chips--

575
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,418
She's in a crisis. Be careful.

576
00:44:47,502 --> 00:44:49,587
Call the cops.
I want to talk to the manager.

577
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:51,756
-Let me talk to the director.
-All right.

578
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,718
We heard you. We'll look into it.

579
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:58,346
So please return to your rooms for now.

580
00:44:58,555 --> 00:44:59,514
Go on.

581
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,934
My daughter is...

582
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:07,564
Have a nice day.

583
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:15,905
She doesn't look too crazy

584
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,824
when you look at her.

585
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,289
What?

586
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:27,041
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

587
00:45:41,848 --> 00:45:45,143
Let's come separately next time.
People will get the wrong idea.

588
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:47,270
When are you done?
Let's go home together. I'll wait.

589
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:50,940
Does your car run on gasoline or diesel?
I smell gasoline.

590
00:45:56,738 --> 00:46:00,033
Pay me depending on what you think.

591
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:05,914
That's odd.

592
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:07,874
It's missing something.

593
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:11,044
Butterflies.

594
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,923
There should be butterflies
where there are flowers.

595
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:17,216
There are so many flowers,

596
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:20,053
yet I don't see a single butterfly.

597
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:25,558
Well, it's still a work in progress,
so I'm sure you'll draw them in soon.

598
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:27,894
No, I refuse. I refuse.

599
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:29,729
Is it hard to draw them?

600
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,316
Then should I try drawing one?

601
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,485
No, don't! No butterflies!

602
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:37,862
Not here. They can't come here.
No butterflies.

603
00:46:37,987 --> 00:46:41,616
No way. No butterflies!

604
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,785
No, butterflies can't come here.

605
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:44,702
No way.

606
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:20,238
Mr. Moon, didn't Ms. Ko
scan her access card a few minutes ago?

607
00:47:20,822 --> 00:47:24,075
-Yes. Why do you ask?
-Then why isn't she in class yet?

608
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:26,160
The patients are waiting
and she's not picking up.

609
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:27,787
I'll look for her too.

610
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,913
Thank you.

611
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,589
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

612
00:48:11,748 --> 00:48:12,790
Why are you so surprised?

613
00:48:20,256 --> 00:48:21,591
Did you forget about me already?

614
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:29,140
It's me, your mom.

615
00:48:37,106 --> 00:48:38,232
Where is she?

616
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:49,911
I've been waiting for you all this time.

617
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,298
You're so skinny now.

618
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,178
Still, in my eyes,

619
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:11,974
you're the prettiest girl
in the whole world.

620
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:20,441
Why won't you say anything?

621
00:49:23,236 --> 00:49:24,946
Don't tell me you don't recognize me

622
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:27,782
just because of a few plastic surgeries.

623
00:49:35,331 --> 00:49:36,165
Mom?

624
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:41,295
Is it

625
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:44,841
really you?

626
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:50,847
You're back?

627
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,142
What's the matter with you?

628
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,978
I know you were away for a month
because of your concert,

629
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:58,896
but why are you acting like
a complete stranger?

630
00:50:01,274 --> 00:50:02,275
My concert?

631
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,193
I told you over the phone

632
00:50:04,777 --> 00:50:07,405
that there's a guy
who's totally your type.

633
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:11,200
Nothing bad comes out of
following your mom's advice.

634
00:50:11,284 --> 00:50:12,118
Just meet him, okay?

635
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,203
I know you'll like him.

636
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:17,832
He's tall and buff.
But more importantly, his eyes.

637
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:20,501
He's got such nice eyes.

638
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:21,752
You crazy woman!

639
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:23,713
-Stop.
-What?

640
00:50:25,464 --> 00:50:28,009
Ms. Kang, you need to take
your medications.

641
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,386
-You should return to your--
-Oh, it's you.

642
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:33,723
I looked everywhere for you.

643
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:37,226
Hey, this young man is the guy
I told you about earlier.

644
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:39,395
What do you think? Isn't he so handsome?

645
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:41,314
-Let me escort you back to your room.
-Okay.

646
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:47,236
She can be a little prickly,
but she's very thoughtful.

647
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,448
She studied music in Germany and is now
a flutist at a symphony orchestra there.

648
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:53,451
But she's been traveling back and forth

649
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:57,496
between Germany and Korea
to look after me.

650
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,585
A SEVERE FORM OF DEPRESSION

651
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:04,253
Her depression is so severe

652
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:06,505
that she's experiencing
hallucinations and delusions.

653
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:09,383
She is a beneficiary
who receives welfare checks

654
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,637
but she believes she is the mistress
of some wealthy businessman.

655
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:16,015
-It sounded like she has a daughter.
-She did.

656
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:21,437
Her only child who she struggled to raise
as a single mother.

657
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,857
But her daughter died in a car accident
a few months ago.

658
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:28,861
She believes
that her daughter is still alive.

659
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:31,781
It must be hard for her
to accept her death.

660
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,074
For the time being.

661
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,993
"Emile couldn't relax.

662
00:51:36,452 --> 00:51:39,622
Maybe it was a trap his mother set up
to make him eat chicory.

663
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,749
Emile picked his nose."

664
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:42,917
<i>It's me, your mom.</i>

665
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,670
-"He wanted to see who the visitor was.
-<i>It's me, your mom.</i>

666
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,923
-Emile was invisible to everyone."
-<i>It's me, your mom.</i>

667
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,132
Be quiet.

668
00:51:50,216 --> 00:51:52,426
-"Emile quickly ran out.
-<i>It's me, your mom.</i>

669
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,595
-He thought it'd be safer that way.
-<i>It's me, your mom.</i>

670
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,180
-<i>It's me, your mom.</i>
-'Emile, welcome.

671
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:58,182
-This is your--'"
-I said, be quiet!

672
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:06,816
Goodness.

673
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:08,943
-Why did she yell?
-Why take it out on us?

674
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,278
-Jeez.
-Seriously.

675
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,530
Ms. Ko hates me.

676
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,031
She's so mean to me.

677
00:52:14,615 --> 00:52:16,242
I didn't even do anything wrong.

678
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,828
What's wrong? What happened?

679
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:21,414
Ms. Ko asked A-reum to read a book aloud.

680
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:24,417
Then she yelled at her to be quiet
when she started reading.

681
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:25,751
From my experience,

682
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:29,714
I'm sure that she'll be possessed
by a ghost soon.

683
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:33,718
People who hear ghosts talking to them
start talking nonsense like that.

684
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:36,178
Where's Ms. Ko?

685
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:43,853
LEE SANG-IN

686
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:50,901
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

687
00:52:50,985 --> 00:52:54,530
All right. Today is the day
I put an end to this once and for all.

688
00:52:54,613 --> 00:52:56,324
But if Ms. Ko finds out,

689
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:58,242
you're finished.

690
00:52:59,702 --> 00:53:01,162
Are you going to be okay?

691
00:53:01,704 --> 00:53:05,082
Well, I'm doomed either way.

692
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:07,585
Let's go!

693
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:19,555
I researched and organized

694
00:53:19,638 --> 00:53:21,432
the recent trends in children's literature

695
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:23,976
for Mun-yeong to refer to
while working on her next book.

696
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,520
I went to an internet café by myself and--

697
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,356
-Would you like me to pass it along?
-No.

698
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:30,107
I want to give this to her myself.

699
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:34,028
Then why did you want to see me?

700
00:53:34,987 --> 00:53:36,864
I'll get straight to the point.

701
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:38,866
Move out of her house.

702
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:41,077
Both you and your brother.

703
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:42,661
You two shouldn't be there.

704
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:44,955
Why not?

705
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:50,211
Because that's where I belong.

706
00:53:51,253 --> 00:53:52,421
You can't handle her.

707
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:54,048
It's not a job for everyone.

708
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:58,636
I've been enduring everything
and putting up with her for ten years.

709
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:00,846
I've been bending over backward for her.

710
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,225
I've been putting my life and soul
on the line to protect her.

711
00:54:04,683 --> 00:54:07,186
Why? What for?

712
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:11,232
Well, because I truly care about her and--

713
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:12,316
For money?

714
00:54:14,235 --> 00:54:15,736
You've made quite a bit of money

715
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:18,155
from selling her books, right?

716
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:25,204
Why boast about your sacrifices
when you've been well-rewarded

717
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:26,705
-for them?
-What?

718
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:28,082
I wasn't boasting!

719
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:30,543
Had I only considered her
as a means for me to make money,

720
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:33,796
I would've deserted her
when my company suffered because of her.

721
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:36,507
Our relationship isn't based on
monetary gain like we're capitalists.

722
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,592
It's much more than that!

723
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:41,387
What is it, then?

724
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:45,141
To Mun-yeong,

725
00:54:46,142 --> 00:54:49,520
I'm her publisher, mentor, brother,
and her man!

726
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:57,778
Anyway,

727
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:01,991
you're stealing my spot,
so move aside at once.

728
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:07,121
I don't want to.

729
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:10,082
What?

730
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:12,126
I won't move aside.

731
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:17,798
Doesn't that caregiver
seem like a great guy?

732
00:55:18,132 --> 00:55:20,176
All the other girls seem to think so too.

733
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:22,595
There are so many girls who are after him.

734
00:55:23,137 --> 00:55:25,681
You have to snatch him soon.

735
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:28,767
You're my only child.

736
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:29,977
It's my lifelong wish

737
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,937
to see the two of you married
and living happily

738
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:33,147
before I pass away.

739
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,816
It's not like I'll live forever.

740
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,693
Can't you just do as I say...

741
00:55:38,652 --> 00:55:39,487
Ms. Kang.

742
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,490
The head nurse
would like to speak with you.

743
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:45,367
With me? Now? I'm busy now.

744
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,535
Yes, you have to go now.

745
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,662
Hey, let me finish before you go!

746
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,632
Why isn't she answering her phone?

747
00:56:08,516 --> 00:56:11,268
GANG-TAE

748
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,314
Gang-tae!

749
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:16,482
Come join us.

750
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,197
Have a seat.

751
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:26,700
You must be hungry.

752
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,495
Gosh.

753
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:34,208
Can you even eat proper meals
in that remote place?

754
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:37,294
I couldn't sleep a wink
because I was so worried.

755
00:56:37,378 --> 00:56:38,254
That's why

756
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:40,214
I woke up early

757
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:42,550
and made a few things
with the ingredients I had.

758
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,009
Go on and eat up.

759
00:56:44,093 --> 00:56:45,302
Okay, thank you.

760
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:47,763
-Here. You too, Sang-tae.
-Thank you.

761
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:49,807
Here, eat up.

762
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,399
-Try this.
-Thank you.

763
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:01,860
Gosh.

764
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:04,029
The house feels empty

765
00:57:04,238 --> 00:57:06,824
without you guys.

766
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:17,167
Well, Ju-ri.

767
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,503
Yes, I heard

768
00:57:19,587 --> 00:57:21,964
you have to stay there for a while
because of Sang-tae's work.

769
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,384
Congratulations, Sang-tae.
I'd like a copy when your book comes out.

770
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:28,095
Well, buy your own copy.

771
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,264
You should pay for it with your money.

772
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,181
Sang-tae.

773
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:34,518
All right. When your book comes out,

774
00:57:34,602 --> 00:57:35,728
I'll buy 100 copies.

775
00:57:35,811 --> 00:57:37,062
Thank you. I'd appreciate that.

776
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,189
Eat up.

777
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:40,107
Okay.

778
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:52,119
My gosh, I knew that nurse would do this.

779
00:57:52,828 --> 00:57:55,456
She's even getting her mom to help her.

780
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:57,333
You can't leave like this.

781
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:59,710
You need to make sure
that skank stays away from him!

782
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,171
What did I tell you?

783
00:58:02,254 --> 00:58:03,881
I said other girls will try to snatch him.

784
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:06,300
Don't be so stubborn.
Listen to your mom, please!

785
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:09,762
I've been eyeing him for you,
but that bitch is about to snatch him.

786
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:12,890
Okay, fine. If you don't want to
do the work, I'll do it for you.

787
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,851
Is she the only one with a mom?
You have one too!

788
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:16,936
Please!

789
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,108
Please.

790
00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:26,528
Stop saying that word, "mom."

791
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:30,574
-What do I say, then? I am your mom.
-My mom

792
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:33,911
is dead.

793
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:37,331
What?

794
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:39,875
I said my mom

795
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:42,962
<i>is dead.</i>

796
00:58:45,464 --> 00:58:46,674
<i>Mom.</i>

797
00:58:49,385 --> 00:58:50,761
Her skull cracked,

798
00:58:51,637 --> 00:58:52,846
so there was blood everywhere.

799
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:56,725
No. That can't be.

800
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:58,435
Her limbs were all twisted

801
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:01,063
and wobbly.

802
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:03,190
No, it can't be.

803
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:05,109
The floor

804
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:09,571
is still stained with her blood.

805
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:11,990
No.

806
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,369
That can't be.

807
00:59:16,704 --> 00:59:18,706
-So ma'am,
-No.

808
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:19,623
please

809
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:22,876
wake up

810
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:26,046
from your dream.

811
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:29,717
No...

812
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,760
No...

813
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,862
What's on the menu today again?

814
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:51,488
Ms. Park!

815
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:53,949
Over there.

816
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,702
-We'll go check. It's okay.
-Okay. My gosh.

00:59:59,538 --> 01:00:00,372
Ms. Kang.

818
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,375
Ms. Kang.

819
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:05,002
Call Dr. Kwon. Hurry!

820
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:05,919
Yes, ma'am.

821
01:00:06,587 --> 01:00:07,588
Ms. Kang.

822
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:25,981
You're not going to eat?

823
01:00:30,569 --> 01:00:32,571
You left your phone at the hospital.

824
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:38,660
Are you asleep?

825
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:31,964
Is it

826
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:36,635
really you?

827
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,387
You're back?

828
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,838
You don't seem to be in a good mood today.

829
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:38,924
Mom.

830
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,052
Why did Bluebeard

831
01:03:44,304 --> 01:03:48,225
kill his wives?

832
01:03:49,017 --> 01:03:52,729
Because they didn't listen to him.

833
01:03:53,981 --> 01:03:56,233
You have to listen to Mom
at all times, okay?

834
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:58,235
That makes you a good girl, right?

835
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:01,196
Answer me.

836
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:05,367
Yes, I'll listen to you at all times.

837
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:09,037
Good.

838
01:04:09,955 --> 01:04:11,290
You're such a good girl.

839
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,585
But why did you bring him here?

840
01:04:58,086 --> 01:04:59,755
<i>I've warned you</i>

841
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:05,177
<i>that I will also kill the prince
who comes to save you.</i>

842
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,021
Ko Mun-yeong.

843
01:05:19,107 --> 01:05:19,983
Ko Mun-yeong.

844
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:27,824
Run.

845
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,409
Run.

846
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,536
-It's okay, Ko Mun-yeong.
-Run...

847
01:05:31,703 --> 01:05:33,372
-Run.
-It was just a dream.

848
01:05:33,455 --> 01:05:34,664
Please run. Go!

849
01:05:34,956 --> 01:05:36,833
Get out at once!

850
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:41,505
Get lost.

851
01:05:45,092 --> 01:05:46,343
Leave at once.

852
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,479
Okay, I won't leave.

853

<i>My mother always</i>

01:07:13,013 --> 01:07:14,055

857
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,683
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

858
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:19,227
What do you think you're doing?

859
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:23,565
The body can't lie.
So it cries when it's hurting.

860
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:27,819
But the heart is a liar, so it stays
silent even when it is hurting.

861
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:30,447
<i>I miss mom.</i>

862
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:33,658
Then what's going on between us?
Is it a fling?

863
01:07:33,742 --> 01:07:36,620
-What is this crap?
<i>-A nightmare doll.</i>

864
01:07:37,204 --> 01:07:38,455
<i>How do I look?</i>

865
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:40,498
You did well, Mun-yeong.

866
01:07:43,585 --> 01:07:44,628
Sang-tae.

867
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:48,131
Have you ever heard
the story of <i>Bluebeard</i>?

868
01:07:51,384 --> 01:07:53,762
BLUEBEARD DRAGGED HIS WIFE
DOWN TO THE BASEMENT

869
01:08:35,595 --> 01:08:37,889
AND CUT OFF HER HEAD

870
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:09,963
AND ONCE AGAIN,
BLUEBEARD WAS ALL ALONE

871
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:12,173
BLOOPERS
