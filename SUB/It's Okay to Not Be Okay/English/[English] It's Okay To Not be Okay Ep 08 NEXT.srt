00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,237
Are you sure I can trust you?

4
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,282
I also cut my brother's hair for him.

5
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:42,783
I'm the only one who can touch it.

6
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:48,206
The sea should be here. Hello!

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,044
He asked you to
cut his hair like that, right?

8
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:53,961
No.

9
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:56,547
I came up with that hairstyle.

10
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:58,466
I don't want a mushroom haircut.

11
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:00,468
It's too late.

12
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:02,428
I have the scissors.

13
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,848
Stay still if you want this to go well.

14
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,118
It's all done.

15
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:26,429
How do I look?

16
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,851
You look pretty.

17
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,239
I no longer need to listen to my mom

18
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:46,615
now that I cut off my leash.

19
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,035
So you wanted to escape from

20
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:50,453
your mother?

21
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:53,039
Yes.

22
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:54,790
Now, I'm free.

23
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:58,169
Congratulations.

24
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,881
Don't congratulate me.

25
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,341
I want a compliment.

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,058
Good for you. I'm so proud of you.

27
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:18,105
Now, let's go have fun wherever.
Whether it's to a mountain or a field.

28
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,232
Like the Cheerful Dog?

29
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:22,777
Yes, like the Cheerful Dog.

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,024
<i>It is a flower</i>

32
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:45,152
<i>Even if it blooms in the field
It is a flower</i>

33
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:48,656
<i>It is a flower</i>

34
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,909
<i>It is a flower</i>

35
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:53,953
<i>They're all flowers</i>

36
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,714
What... What happened to your long hair?

37
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,049
I cut it.

38
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,094
-What do you think?
-Long hair suits you better.

39
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,139
What do you mean?
She looks better with short hair.

40
00:04:13,222 --> 00:04:14,473
No.

41
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:16,934
She looked 100 to 1,000 times better
when her long, black hair

42
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:19,395
used to come down
all the way to her waist.

43
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:20,604
Why did she cut it?

44
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,023
-Why did you do that? Why?
-Sang-tae.

45
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:26,861
Let me cut your hair today as well.
It's really long.

46
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,529
You gave me a haircut on Wednesday.

47
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,822
I only gave you a trim.

48
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,907
Let's cut off a bit more today.
Now, eat up.

49
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,493
Okay. You looked better with long hair.

50
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,537
Why did you do that?
You shouldn't have cut it off.

51
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,958
Why did you get such an ugly haircut?

52
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,877
Why did you just kick me?

53
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,213
-Me?
-Yes, that's right. You.

54
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,340
You just kicked me three times.

55
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:50,134
These darn quail eggs.

56
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:56,932
Here.

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,401
I want a rolled omelet.

58
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:20,789
Here.

59
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:32,134
-Here.
-You should do it yourself.

60
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,386
You're not a baby.

61
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:38,140
<i>Your brother is so slow-witted.</i>

62
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,143
You mean he's too honest.

63
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,355
Are you taking your brother's side?

64
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:46,815
Of course. We're brothers.

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,194
Hey.

66
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,032
Come home as soon as you finish work.

67
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,659
Come and spend time with me.

68
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,750
From now on,
you're in charge of cutting my hair.

69
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,668
Okay?

70
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,045
Why not just go to a hair salon?

71
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,799
I'm just like your brother.

72
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:55,551
I don't like it
when other people touch me.

73
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,721
But you're an exception.
Only you can touch me.

74
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:07,980
Do I really look pretty?

75
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,237
Yes.

76
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,947
You look pretty.

77
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:26,957
I agree.

78
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,501
I also think I'm really pretty.

79
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,631
What was that laugh for?

80
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:37,384
Don't fight with Sang-tae.
Make sure you get along.

81
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:39,762
I'll see you.

82
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,269
Come home quickly.
If you're late, I'll kill you.

83
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:28,185
-Hello.
-Hello.

84
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:35,943
KO MUN-YEONG'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
PUT ON PAUSE TEMPORARILY

85
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:46,787
Gosh, you scared me.

86
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,373
Do I look that bad?

87
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:53,585
I look like a zombie.

88
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,130
Did something happen at night?

89
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,298
Do you have a concealer?

90
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,175
-What's that?
-Maybe a cushion?

91
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,386
-The cushions are in the lounge.
-No, a cushion compact.

92
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:05,389
Forget it.

93
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,977
Did something happen with a patient?
Who was it?

94
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:11,603
Mr. Ko Dae-hwan.

95
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:13,147
Why? What happened?

96
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:17,735
He had a seizure last night again.
It was a complete nightmare.

97
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:20,988
He came out to the hallway
with his eyes rolling upwards.

98
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:23,282
Then he started foaming at the mouth
and had spasms.

99
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,411
I didn't get to sleep a wink.

100
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:32,207
Gosh, why does this happen
every time I'm on night duty?

101
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,625
Why?

102
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,177
My goodness.

103
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:47,973
Do you think he'll be okay?

104
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,851
I'm worried he might have
another brain tumor.

105
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,895
He kept talking gibberish all night.

106
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:54,480
Don't worry too much.

107
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:57,483
I bet you didn't get any sleep last night.

108
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,818
I was actually thinking about
skipping meditation class

109
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,570
and get some good sleep instead.

110
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:03,155
You should do that. Here.

111
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:12,581
Get some sleep.

112
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:24,843
Mr. Moon.

113
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:27,721
Mr. Ko drooled too much saliva.

114
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:29,848
Can you help him get changed?

115
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:31,642
Sure.

116
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:39,566
That woman...

117
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,570
sang

118
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:45,823
a song.

119
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:48,867
What song?

120
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:50,619
"Oh My Darling, Clementine."

121
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,831
I'm sure

122
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:56,875
she's dead.

123
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,341
But that woman

124
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,637
is here.

125
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,432
Who are you

126
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:14,560
talking about?

127
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:20,858
She's dead.

128
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,570
But she's here.

129
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:35,289
WHAT IS THE TRUTH BEHIND WRITER
KO MUN-YEONG'S DISAPPEARANCE?

130
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,207
KO MUN-YEONG IS LOOKING AFTER
HER SICK FATHER

131
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,542
IS SHE PLANNING TO RETIRE?

132
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,922
<i>She's pretending to be a kind daughter.</i>

133
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,757
<i>I bet she doesn't even care.</i>

134
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,760
<i>She needs to become a better person first.</i>

135
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,263
<i>A fairy tale writer who cusses
doesn't deserve to write.</i>

136
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,557
<i>I really regret having read her books.</i>

137
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:57,644
I want to gather these insects
and spray pesticide on them.

138
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,022
Darn it.

139
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,649
I used to have tons of fans.
Where in the world are they?

140
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:14,036
Actually, my fan is right here.

141
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:17,581
Don't forget to ventilate the room
after you spray pesticide.

142
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:21,710
But if you want to kill insects properly,
electric fly swatters are the best.

143
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:25,505
Sang-tae, why do you like my fairy tales?

144
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,259
Because you wrote them.

145
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,556
So you like me, not my fairy tales.

146
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:37,017
-Why do you like me?
-Because you're pretty.

147
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,396
What do you like about me?

148
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,525
Your hair. Your long hair.

149
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:48,236
Your long, black hair
that came all the way to your waist.

150
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,155
It was so pretty. Gosh.

151
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,991
-You cut it off. You shouldn't have.
-End of meeting.

152
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,287
We never started a meeting.

153
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,581
How can you end a meeting
when we never even started one?

154
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:01,124
You give me a headache.

155
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,043
-Let's have a meeting later.
-"Later?"

156
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:04,586
Later... Later.

157
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:07,005
You mean sometime before you die?

158
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:10,050
No, I need to get a camping car.

159
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,427
I need to receive a camping car.

160
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:19,309
Do you have what I asked you to look into?

161
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:26,358
I know you told me
this is all part of work,

162
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,236
but I felt so uneasy
about doing a background search.

163
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:30,445
Why?

164
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,073
You're good at doing that.

165
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:37,494
If you hadn't done a background search
on that caregiver for Mun-yeong--

166
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:39,496
Her name is Nam Ju-ri.
She's currently single.

167
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:42,290
She met Moon Gang-tae
when they worked together

168
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:43,834
at the same hospital a year ago.

169
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:46,753
They haven't known each other long.

170
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:49,172
Her father died due to an illness
when she was little.

171
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:50,716
Oh, dear.

172
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,635
And her mother used to cook
for construction workers.

173
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,595
My goodness, she had a tough life.

174
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:59,016
Right now, she's working as a cook
at OK Psychiatric Hospital.

175
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,226
And the daughter and mother
are living together

176
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,312
at a two-story house
with a mortgage to pay off.

177
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,355
The Moon brothers live
in the rooftop house.

178
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:08,900
And their friend who runs a pizza place
lives in the basement.

179
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:11,987
And apparently, the owner of the house
gives them meals for free.

180
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:14,948
They're practically lodgers.

181
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:16,575
Mr. Lee.

182
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:18,660
Do you like that nurse?

183
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:24,583
Hey, why are you so quick-witted
when it comes to stuff like this?

184
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,959
Why can't you be like this with work?

185
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,133
Hey.

186
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,677
Be honest with me.

187
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:37,512
About what?

188
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:41,058
Between me and that caregiver...

189
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:42,934
Who do you think is better?

190
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,186
For a romantic relationship?

191
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,105
I'm taller and bigger than him.

192
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:49,983
And think about
my social position and maturity.

193
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,235
Aren't I much better than him?

194
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:56,073
But you lack the most important trait.

195
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,284
What's that?

196
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,747
This. Your face.

197
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,167
My gosh. You little!

198
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:31,316
How do I look?

199
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:33,610
You look pretty.

200
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:42,869
I must be crazy.

201
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:30,917
Hey, can I talk to Ms. Park Ok-ran?

202
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:33,545
Yes, right now.

203
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:37,716
Come in.

204
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:39,426
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

205
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,179
My goodness.

206
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,348
Hello, Ms. Park.

207
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:48,101
You can sit over here.

208
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:53,565
Stay.

209
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:54,482
Just stay.

210
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:59,821
My goodness, you look great these days.

211
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,823
I guess the medicine is working.

212
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:05,243
Why did you want to see me?

213
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,581
I wanted to ask you something.

214
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:14,544
By any chance,
did you happen to see Mr. Ko Dae-hwan

215
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,546
in the hallway last night

216
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:19,341
at around midnight?

217
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:22,385
I did

218
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:25,472
go to the bathroom at that hour.

219
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,724
But I didn't see him.

220
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:37,150
By any chance, did you sing a song
when you went to the bathroom?

221
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:38,944
A song?

222
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,363
What song?

223
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:46,701
Ever since he regained consciousness
he keeps saying the same thing.

224
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:49,496
What was it... You know...

225
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:50,413
Right!

226
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,625
"Oh My Darling, Clementine."

227
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,671
He keeps saying that he heard that song.

228
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:06,554
<i>In a cavern, in a canyon,</i>

229
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:09,641
<i>Excavating for a mine</i>

230
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:13,186
...sang a song.

231
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,356
<i>Oh My Darling, Clementine.</i>

232
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:20,151
<i>Lived a miner</i>

233
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:24,239
<i>forty-niner,</i>

234
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:28,493
-I'm not a ghost.
-"A ghost"?

235
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,121
Yoo Seon-hae,
that woman who used to be a shaman,

236
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:32,664
keeps talking nonsense.

237
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:36,501
She keeps saying a ghost shows up at night

238
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:38,795
and sings at the end of the hallway.

239
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:45,302
But

240
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:47,971
I'm not a ghost.

241
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,975
Of course you're not a ghost.

242
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:55,020
So you didn't sing that song?

243
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,273
No, I didn't.

244
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,443
Okay then.

245
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,417
Why are you smiling?

246
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:19,336
It's just that

247
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,339
no one's really paid attention to me

248
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,800
even though I've been here
for a few months.

249
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:29,054
But now, people are paying attention.

250
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:33,683
How interesting.

251
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,608
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

252
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:53,119
<i>You are lost and gone forever,</i>

253
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:59,000
<i>Dreadful sorry Clementine</i>

254
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:01,002
It's that song.

255
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,381
<i>Why do you think she lied?</i>

256
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:08,843
I don't know.

257
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:11,596
But

258
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:14,599
why are you asking me?

259
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:18,686
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
is Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's only guardian.

260
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:21,940
And right now, you're pretty much

261
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:24,150
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong's guardian.

262
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:27,195
So it's kind of your business as well.

263
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:29,989
I don't think it is.

264
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,121
Chew on this.

265
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:40,792
Chewing on something
helps you prevent dementia.

266
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:46,131
It seems like something strange
is happening at our hospital.

267
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,176
Let's keep this between you and me
for the time being.

268
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,347
And during that time,
I'd like you to keep a close eye

269
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,517
on Ms. Park Ok-ran.

270
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,565
You're teaming up with the most
powerful man in this hospital.

271
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,320
Are you just going to chew and ignore me?

272
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:17,036
What do you want?

273
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,919
KO MUN-YEONG'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
PUT ON PAUSE TEMPORARILY

274
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:42,562
-Where are you going?
-The Chinese restaurant and pizza place.

275
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:44,272
You're going to eat that much?

276
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:46,733
I'm having Chinese with Gang-tae,
and I work at the pizzeria.

277
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:49,944
"Gang-tae"? I want to go, too.

278
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,658
HARIMGAK

279
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:56,784
Here's your <i>jjamppong</i>.

280
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,620
This is that <i>jjamppong</i>.

281
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,207
It has mussels and chili pepper inside.

282
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,042
The broth tastes amazing.

283
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:11,841
Why would you come to a shabby place
like this to eat <i>jjamppong</i>?

284
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:13,593
Our mom used to bring us here often

285
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:15,803
because I loved the <i>jjamppong </i>here.

286
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,805
"I want to have it every day, Mom.

287
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:20,016
I want to eat it every day."

288
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:23,269
No wonder.

289
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:26,397
It seemed like a famous restaurant
with a long history.

290
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:29,817
Eat up.

291
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:49,003
Here. Eat up.

292
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,381
What about you, Mom?

293
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:52,799
I'm not hungry.

294
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:05,353
Is it good?

295
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,773
-Yes.
-Really?

296
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,194
It's spicy.

297
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,867
Holy shit! It's so damn spicy!

298
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:26,332
It's capsaicin.

299
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,084
Capsaicin can be very addictive.

300
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,045
It releases endorphin when you eat it
and helps you get rid of your stress.

301
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:34,048
But it hurts when you poop.
It hurts when you poop the next day.

302
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,717
Your butthole hurts so much.

303
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,969
It's... It's so spicy.

304
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,234
-So cold!
-Thank you.

305
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:54,944
-Thank you.
-I'll bring this back.

306
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,029
-Here.
-I love it.

307
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,489
Sang-tae, you're getting wet.

308
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:02,160
It's... It's raining. Wasn't it delicious?

309
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:05,413
It's sunny, but it's raining.

310
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:06,623
It's raining.

311
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:08,207
-It's pouring. I love it.
-Slow down.

312
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,961
Capsaicin is really addictive.
Don't you think so?

313
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,296
We had a big meal.

314
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,464
-We did, didn't we?
-Yes.

315
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:16,174
I wonder why it's raining.

316
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:18,217
-Slow down.
-It's pouring.

317
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:20,261
-Let's slow down.
-Gosh, we had a really big meal.

318
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:22,305
It's pouring over here as well.

319
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:23,473
Let me join.

320
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:26,976
Capsaicin is really addictive.

321
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,187
Ms. Ko finished everything
because it was so yummy.

322
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,356
It will hurt when you poop.

323
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,733
Has it ever happened before?
It hurts a lot.

324
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,506
Let's have coffee together.

325
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:58,591
Go by yourself.
My lunch break is almost over.

326
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:00,093
It will only take ten minutes.

327
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,569
Two iced Americano coffee, please.

328
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:19,487
Okay.

329
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:48,307
I want it.

330
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:09,328
Excuse me.

331
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:11,706
Are you Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

332
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,502
My goodness, it's you.

333
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:19,589
I can't believe I'm meeting you here.
This is amazing.

334
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,966
-Do you know me?
-Of course.

335
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,385
I've been your fan for a long time.

336
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:26,471
Just a second.

337
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:30,933
Here. This is my business card.

338
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:47,617
-By any chance, is he your boyfriend?
-No, he's just someone I know.

339
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:51,537
That's good to hear.

340
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:52,872
Have a seat.

341
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:56,292
Well then,
I guess I'll join you for a moment.

342
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:06,427
Last summer, our company was
in charge of planning

343
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,096
your art book event.

344
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,848
But I bet you don't remember.

345
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:14,977
Back then, I saw you from a distance.

346
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,021
I can't believe I'm seeing you here.

347
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,439
That's what you call destiny.

348
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:19,982
"Destiny"?

349
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,984
I'm hoping that destiny

350
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:25,488
will allow us to keep in touch.

351
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:28,991
If you ever have time,

352
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:30,827
we should meet up for a meal.

353
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,703
Sure.

354
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:37,542
Then here. Can you write down
your phone number for me?

355
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:52,640
<i>Dear Daniel, I hope you buy me beef.</i>

356
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,685
<i>Mun-yeong will be waiting for your call.</i>

357
00:27:58,813 --> 00:27:59,814
Excuse me.

358
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:01,524
Sir.

359
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:04,944
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

360
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,446
But can you take a photo of us together?

361
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,699
Oh, sure.

362
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,117
Click on the camera icon.

363
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,541
One, two...

364
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,006
About your hand on her waist...

365
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:26,257
You want his hand on my waist?

366
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:30,386
Here. Take the photo.

367
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:44,025
You're very nice to your fans.

368
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,820
According to Mr. Lee, I sell one more book
every time I smile at a fan.

369
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:49,780
You should be focusing on writing,
not marketing.

370
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,742
And why would you give him your number

371
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:54,535
when you don't even know him that well?

372
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,038
I couldn't help it. I like handsome stuff.

373
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,247
"Handsome"?

374
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:00,917
What's wrong?

375
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:04,295
Go home. I need to get going now.

376
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,265
Are you

377
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,101
jealous?

378
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,062
Don't be ridiculous.

379
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,772
I'm late, thanks to you.

380
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:27,360
Handsome, my ass!

381
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:29,779
He's such a cheeseball.

382
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,503
How handsome.

383
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:51,592
Gosh, I'm hungry.

384
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:58,975
-What?
-What is it?

385
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,309
Do you know that man?

386
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,529
I don't want that.

387
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:15,032
No, please. No way.

388
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,662
You don't want that? So what?
It's my house.

389
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,914
I've been paying
half of the mortgage payments.

390
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:24,625
Don't you feel bad
for the situation he's in?

391
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,294
He doesn't know anyone in Seongjin City,

392
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:28,504
and he's broke
because his company went belly up.

393
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,179
Okay, but why do you have to help him?

394
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:38,681
Why do you care?

395
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:39,724
How can I not care?

396
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:42,226
He's the CEO of the publishing company
Sang-tae is signed with.

397
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,936
But we don't even have an empty room...

398
00:30:46,522 --> 00:30:47,523
Mom.

399
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,277
Don't tell me you'll let him
move into the room on the roof.

400
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:55,990
Mom?

401
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:57,992
-Just split it, then.
-Split what?

402
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:00,995
You and Jae-su should
split your rooms in half.

403
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:03,998
<i>Does she think my room is a chicken?</i>

404
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:05,499
It's not like ordering
half and half chicken!

405
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:09,045
I have to share the room with the guy
from the publishing company?

406
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,921
I get that she wants more rent,

407
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:13,674
but she's abusing her power
as the landlady. Don't you agree?

408
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,638
Jeez, I heard he's moving in today.
I'm so upset.

409
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:23,809
Everyone around that woman,
Ko Mun-yeong, is such a pain in the butt!

410
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:27,897
Stop scratching. It'll bleed.

411
00:31:29,732 --> 00:31:30,941
Sang-tae!

412
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:35,279
Are you mad at me?

413
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:37,198
I kept calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

414
00:31:37,281 --> 00:31:39,992
I thought you were avoiding me
because you feel bad about slapping me--

415
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,456
Why does it have to be my place?

416
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:47,458
Because of you, I guess?

417
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:53,756
There's someone I like.

418
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,966
Yes, I know.

419
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,553
The unrequited love
you want to give up on.

420
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:02,973
But you know, Ju-ri...

421
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,477
Don't turn into a bitch.

422
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,730
Why can't it be me?

423
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,109
Why that bitch?

424
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,944
And I can

425
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:19,156
be a bitch too.

426
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:22,827
You're kind and sweet.

427
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,830
You should meet a guy
who will love you for who you are.

428
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,084
I'm not kind.

429
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,836
Well...

430
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:34,505
Most people who say that they're not kind

431
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,132
tend to be kind.

432
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:41,345
Gosh, whatever.

433
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:49,562
Both the nice girl and the bitch

434
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,106
are head over heels for the same guy.

435
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:01,365
Jeez, what? What's your problem?

436
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:03,159
You want me gone or what?

437
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:05,828
I heard you told her that
a copy of her book

438
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:08,164
will sell every time
she smiles at her fan.

439
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,624
An author only needs to write well.

440
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,126
She's not a celebrity.

441
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,879
Why must she be extra friendly
when it's not necessary?

442
00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:17,631
Because of your third-rate sales tactics,

443
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:21,218
she's learned to call
just about anyone handsome

444
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:23,137
and make finger hearts all the time.

445
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,347
She lets a stranger
put his arm around her waist

446
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:27,433
and even goes out to eat
with a guy she doesn't know.

447
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,103
You forced her to smile so often

448
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:33,272
that she only raises
the corners of her mouth

449
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,608
and looks like the Joker when she smiles.

450
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:37,943
What the heck are you talking about now?

451
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:40,029
Do your job better!

452
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:42,948
Seriously.

453
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,790
What did I do so wrong?

454
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:15,940
A-reum.

455
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:18,484
A-reum?

456
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:22,404
Gosh, my feet fell asleep.

457
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,991
I'm so sorry.

458
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:28,827
That old man, Mr. Gan, kept pestering me
to play table tennis with him,

459
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,120
so I had to shake him off.

460
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,497
You must be exhausted.

461
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:37,044
How much longer do we have to meet up
in secret like this?

462
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:42,299
You know that patients are not allowed
to date one another.

463
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:46,303
There are eyes everywhere.
This linen room is the only safe place.

464
00:34:47,096 --> 00:34:48,180
Those jerks.

465
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,059
Let's just try to make the most of it.

466
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:55,020
Why don't we just enjoy the thrill
until we're discharged?

467
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:59,942
I feel as though
we're in some tragic love story.

468
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:06,824
A-reum.

469
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:09,827
If you don't mind,

470
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,162
I want to kiss...

471
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,207
May I kiss you?

472
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,001
Oh, gosh.

473
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:36,145
Damn it. I'm sleepy.
Why do I have to change the sheets now?

474
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:38,147
I'm so annoyed.

475
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:44,862
She always works me like a dog
when I'm working overtime.

476
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,447
Park Haeng-ja, that old witch.

477
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:50,534
I'll do it later. Just take some rest.

478
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:51,744
Really?

479
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,121
Then can I nap here for just an hour?

480
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,373
But I can't help you
if Ms. Park finds out.

481
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,374
That's fine.

482
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,419
Oh, boy. I'm exhausted.

483
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:30,949
Be careful.

484
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:32,326
What the...

485
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:47,591
Just this one time. Please pretend you
didn't see anything just this once.

486
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,969
Gang-tae. Please, big brother.

487
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,098
From what I know, I'm younger than you.

488
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:59,520
Gang-tae, let us love. Please?

489
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:00,437
Get up.

490
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:04,191
You see, love is not a sin.

491
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:05,818
Patients are human too.

492
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,195
Right, it's not a sin.

493
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:10,072
But, it's against the rules.

494
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:14,410
I can't believe this.

495
00:37:17,162 --> 00:37:17,996
Gosh, A-reum.

496
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,501
One of you

497
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:24,420
will probably be transferred.

498
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:29,842
Brother, please.

499
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:31,885
Do not tell your higher-ups.

500
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,096
Please, I beg you.

501
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:40,602
You should focus on your treatment

502
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:42,604
so that you can be discharged soon.

503
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:44,857
Once you leave here,

504
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,568
no one will try to break you two apart.

505
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:54,616
Damn it.

506
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:04,960
I'm home!

507
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:06,253
Hi, Sang-tae.

508
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:11,383
Gosh, I don't want to do this.

509
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:16,388
I'm bored.

510
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:29,276
Sang-tae.

511
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,404
Can't you knock? It's rude
to just barge in without knocking.

512
00:38:32,488 --> 00:38:34,406
Hang out with me. Can you play poker?

513
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:37,034
-Oh, Mang-tae.
-No, poker.

514
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:38,368
Mang-tae is mine.

515
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:40,496
It's mine now. Gang-tae gave it to me.

516
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,914
No.

517
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:42,831
Mang-tae...

518
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:45,083
Gang-tae made it in May of 2007
and gave it to me.

519
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,045
He said Mang-tae would eat up
all my nightmares, so I--

520
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:50,714
I adopted Mang-tae in June of 2020,
so it's mine now.

521
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:54,426
No, that's not true.
I never gave him up for adoption, so how?

522
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,553
-Mang-tae is mine.
-No, it's mine.

523
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:57,513
No, Mang-tae is mine.

524
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,264
-No, Gang-tae gave it to me.
-Give it back.

525
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:00,557
-No, it's mine.
-No, it's mine.

526
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,892
-It's Sang-tae's.
-No, it's mine!

527
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:03,268
-No, it's mine!
-Give it back!

528
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:05,229
-It's mine.
-Please, give it back.

529
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:06,480
Mang-tae belongs to Sang-tae.

530
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:08,273
-No, it's mine.
-Mang-tae is mine!

531
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:09,900
-No! It's mine. Give it back!
-It's mine!

532
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:11,276
-Mang-tae is mine!
-It's mine!

533
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,444
It's mine...

534
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:06,555
Sang-tae?

535
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:10,684
-Mang-tae is mine!
-No, Mang-tae is mine!

536
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,227
-I said, it's mine!
-Mang-tae is mine!

537
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,520
-It's mine.
-It's mine!

538
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:15,397
-Mang-tae is mine.
-I told you that it's mine!

539
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,982
-No! It's mine!
-It's mine!

540
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:18,191
-It's mine.
-Mang-tae is mine!

541
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,152
-No, it's mine!
-No, it's not!

542
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:27,909
-Who does Mang-tae belong to?
-Who does Mang-tae belong to?

543
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,870
It's mine, right? You gave it to me.

544
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:30,954
We're three brothers.

545
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:32,706
Mang-tae, Gang-tae, and Sang-tae, right?

546
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:35,000
-Both of you.
-It's mine!

547
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,793
No, I told you that
Mang-tae is mine. Mine!

548
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:39,212
-No, it's mine!
-Mang-tae is mine.

549
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:40,964
-It's mine.
-Mang-tae is mine!

550
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:42,174
-Mang-tae is mine!
-Be quiet!

551
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,192
Both of you, give it back.

552
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:06,656
One.

553
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,241
Two.

554
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:11,995
Three.

555
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,371
Hey!

556
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:15,624
Go away! I hate you!

557
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,042
-I hate you.
-Hey!

558
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:20,170
I hate Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

559
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:24,466
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong is vicious.
She's a real fighter.

560
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:26,343
Ko Mun-yeong...

561
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:27,385
You too. Give it back.

562
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:30,472
You gave it to me! You can't take it back!

563
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,350
I told you not to fight with Sang-tae.
Anyway, give it to me.

564
00:41:36,353 --> 00:41:37,479
Give it back, now.

565
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:40,690
There!

566
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,709
You jerk! You petty asshole!

567
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,044
You petty bastard!

568
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:02,504
I can't believe that petty bastard!

569
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:11,221
Sang-tae, come out.

570
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:13,098
You should get changed.

571
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,646
If you don't want to come out,
just open the door.

572
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:31,616
You know that Mang-tae

573
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:35,495
can't catch the butterflies anyway.

574
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:39,040
Mang-tae can't catch the butterflies.

575
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,585
What did you say?

576
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,545
I can't really hear you.

577
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:49,676
He's of no use
if he can't catch the butterflies.

578
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:51,928
Exactly.

579
00:42:52,888 --> 00:42:55,182
You shoved it into the drawer
and forgot about it,

580
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,350
so I gave it to Ms. Ko.

581
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,858
I'm sorry I didn't ask
for your permission first.

582
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:07,986
But when you don't need something,

583
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:11,031
it's nice to offer it
to someone who needs it.

584
00:43:12,574 --> 00:43:13,408
"Offer"?

585
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,660
Yes, that's right.

586
00:43:16,411 --> 00:43:17,412
But...

587
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:21,082
if I give all my stuff
to people who need them,

588
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,667
what about me?

589
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,588
What will I have left?

590
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:35,555
You will

591
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:37,891
always have me.

592
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:41,394
Forget Mang-tae. You have Gang-tae.

593
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,981
Ms. Ko is alone, so she needs Mang-tae.

594
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:47,609
Then will you let her have Mang-tae?

595
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,445
Yes, she can have him.
She can have Mang-tae, not Gang-tae.

596
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,076
She can have Mang-tae, not Gang-tae.

597
00:43:59,788 --> 00:44:00,622
Yes.

598
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:04,793
She can have Mang-tae, not Gang-tae.

599
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,002
Yes, she can take him.

600
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:22,435
Hey.

601
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,107
I can't sleep because I'm fuming mad.

602
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,025
What did I do wrong?

603
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,194
Sang-tae said you could have him.

604
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:33,822
Mang-tae.

605
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,241
Mang-tae is all yours now.

606
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:41,871
Whatever. It was mine to begin with.

607
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:44,416
Try to stay calm
even when Sang-tae gets worked up.

608
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,793
-Don't give me orders.
-It's not an order.

609
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:51,423
I'm asking you for a favor.

610
00:44:59,222 --> 00:45:00,974
But how can I suppress my anger
and stay calm?

611
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,479
Tell me. You're an expert at it.

612
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:10,775
I saw you do it
when I cut your hand with a knife.

613
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:15,363
Even when that man grabbed your brother
by the hair at the bookstore

614
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,200
and when your brother
beat the crap out of you on the floor.

615
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:22,412
You just kept it all inside
and let him beat you up.

616
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:26,916
How do you do that?

617
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,128
If I just suck it up,

618
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:34,632
nothing will happen.

619
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:38,178
If I let my emotions get the better of me

620
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:40,346
without thinking about the consequences,

621
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,393
Sang-tae and I wouldn't have
this kind of relationship.

622
00:45:47,187 --> 00:45:48,855
Keeping it all inside and enduring it

623
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:52,609
is the only way

624
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:55,653
I can protect Sang-tae.

625
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:00,742
I think that's why we're meant to be.

626
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,624
You're patient,

627
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:09,250
and I'm volatile.

628
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,504
Like a bomb and its safety pin.

629
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:15,256
We go hand in hand.

630
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,218
We're meant to be together.

631
00:46:21,304 --> 00:46:23,264
How many guys
do you think you're meant to be with?

632
00:46:24,057 --> 00:46:24,891
What do you mean?

633
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,519
Why don't you go ask your "handsome" fan?

634
00:46:27,602 --> 00:46:28,561
"Handsome"?

635
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:37,445
You mean, this pen?

636
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:41,366
What do you think?

637
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:43,785
Isn't it so handsome?

638
00:46:44,994 --> 00:46:47,372
Just look at this shape. It's perfect.

639
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,417
But you know,

640
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,384
you're much more handsome

641
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:01,594
than this pen.

642
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:04,931
Gosh, what are you doing?

643
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:07,934
So don't be jealous.

644
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:12,647
What? I'm not jealous.

645
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:14,566
I'm sleepy.

646
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,652
Go upstairs and sleep.

647
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,155
I don't want to. Mang-tae is here.

648
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,074
Relax, will you?

649
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,791
By the way, did Director O call you?

650
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:33,960
About resuming your class.

651
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,129
He did.

652
00:47:36,713 --> 00:47:37,547
I see.

653
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:40,884
They received many requests
from the patients.

654
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,344
I guess

655
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:45,889
they all liked your class.

656
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:43,280
My mustache!

657
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:46,826
Where did my mustache go?

658
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:49,078
Oh, that.

659
00:49:49,745 --> 00:49:50,746
I shaved it off.

660
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,000
What?

661
00:49:55,835 --> 00:49:56,669
Why?

662
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:58,671
Well...

663
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:00,005
Damn you!

664
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,593
How dare you touch my mustache?

665
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:06,971
You're partially responsible. Let go!

666
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:10,057
-You little...
-What?

667
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:15,312
Wait, hold on. No.

668
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:18,190
No. Please! No!

669
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,278
Ko Mun-yeong...

670
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:24,655
-You bitch.
-I can't focus because of him.

671
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:27,783
Seriously, what a pain in the butt!

672
00:51:27,176 --> 00:51:28,260
You had gum stuck on it?

673
00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:31,847
Yes, it was glued on it.

674
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,099
My goodness.

675
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:38,020
You look so handsome
without your mustache.

676
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,231
Jae-su, I'm glad you shaved it off.

677
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:45,903
Thank you so much, Jae-su.

678
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:47,738
My gosh.

679
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:49,824
Didn't he lash out at me
for shaving it off?

680
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:58,332
What are you doing, Seung-jae?

681
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,170
Good morning, Ju-ri.

682
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:05,923
Did I wake you up?

683
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:06,882
No.

684
00:52:07,383 --> 00:52:09,343
Why are you cleaning out of the blue?

685
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:13,180
Oh, I figured I should do something
to help out

686
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,182
while staying here with you.

687
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:17,726
I'll be in charge of cleaning the room.

688
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:22,064
Just think that I'm invisible.

689
00:52:22,147 --> 00:52:23,858
Don't mind me.

690
00:52:31,156 --> 00:52:32,366
Ju-ri.

691
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:34,410
Do you notice anything different?

692
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,620
You looked better with a mustache.
Why did you shave?

693
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,751
Here, have some meat.

694
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,090
Sang-tae can be a handful,

695
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:51,510
but he can draw very well,

696
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:53,220
so please take good care of him.

697
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:56,682
Then I'll make sure
there's always meat on the table.

698
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:59,643
My gosh. Don't you worry, ma'am.

699
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:03,022
I have to say, this is a feast.

700
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:04,732
I don't even know what I should eat first.

701
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:07,693
The soup is too salty.

702
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:18,787
Eat up.

703
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,835
I must say, you're very impressive.

704
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:28,339
You're still young,
yet you have your own publishing company.

705
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,842
I run my own pizzeria
despite my young age--

706
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:33,177
Ms. Kang.

707
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:37,890
I know I'm only paying
200,000 won a month to stay here,

708
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,226
but I'll get back on my feet again soon

709
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,897
and make sure I repay your kindness
a thousandfold.

710
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,484
Then finish your food quickly.
Let's put it down in writing.

711
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:51,737
My gosh.

712
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:03,999
What is it now? Why are you in a bad mood?

713
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,543
Why did you ask Mr. Lee
what his parents do?

714
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:08,504
He'll stay with us for a while.

715
00:54:08,587 --> 00:54:10,589
I can't even ask him about his family?

716
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:13,592
It bothers me
that you seem so intrigued by him.

717
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:16,261
Because he's interested in you.

718
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:17,721
How did you know?

719
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:19,682
When you get to my age, you'll understand.

720
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:22,017
There are some things
that you just know when you're older.

721
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:24,728
If you know that,

722
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:27,356
don't lead him on.

723
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,526
He's hardworking and cheerful.

724
00:54:30,818 --> 00:54:32,486
He seems like a responsible guy.
So why not?

725
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,823
Mom, you know why I'm being like this.

726
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:38,742
Yes, I know. That's why I'm saying this.

727
00:54:39,535 --> 00:54:42,830
That guy won't even reciprocate
my dear daughter's feelings.

728
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:44,331
I, too, hate him for that.

729
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,418
I hate him,

730
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:49,795
but I also feel bad for him.

731
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,425
However, you matter a lot more to me.

732
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:58,804
You told me to keep on chasing after him
even if he rejects me.

733
00:54:59,304 --> 00:55:01,140
I'm worried that
you're going to follow him

734
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:03,892
to the edge of a cliff
if I let you continue to chase after him.

735
00:55:14,653 --> 00:55:15,696
Hello.

736
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,448
Oh, that's your live-in cook.

737
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:20,075
The three of you came together?

738
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,328
Yes, I'm here to work on the mural.
Gang-tae has his day shift,

739
00:55:23,412 --> 00:55:25,164
and Ms. Ko has her class.

740
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,291
-Is that right?
-Yes.

741
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,043
You got a haircut.

742
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,627
It looks nice.

743
00:55:32,212 --> 00:55:33,922
He gave me a haircut.

744
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:39,344
You cut her hair?

745
00:55:39,428 --> 00:55:42,347
Why did you do that?
She looks prettier with long hair.

746
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:46,268
Come over when you have some time.

747
00:55:46,351 --> 00:55:47,853
I'll make some food for you.

748
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:51,482
I don't think
your daughter likes the idea.

749
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,194
She takes after me,

750
00:55:55,277 --> 00:55:56,487
so she can't hide her feelings.

751
00:55:58,906 --> 00:56:01,075
Don't worry.
Just come over and have some food.

752
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:03,619
You two can fight again
if you have any energy left.

753
00:56:03,702 --> 00:56:06,163
Even better if you girls can make up
after the fight.

754
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:09,374
We have to go.

755
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,761
Do you like that two-faced girl?

756
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:22,721
What?

757
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:26,141
-Why did you cut Ms. Ko's hair? Why?
-Sang-tae, that's...

758
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:27,893
Or do you have a crush
on your live-in cook?

759
00:56:28,727 --> 00:56:29,853
Stop talking nonsense.

760
00:56:29,937 --> 00:56:31,480
Then why did you unlink my arm?

761
00:56:31,563 --> 00:56:33,065
Why should I link arms with you?

762
00:56:33,148 --> 00:56:34,525
Because we go hand in hand.

763
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,318
Let go.

764
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:38,779
The bomb needs its safety pin.

765
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:42,616
Let me... Let me join.
I want to link arms too.

766
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,286
-Okay?
-Look ahead of you,

767
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,830
or you'll trip and fall. Look ahead.

768
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:48,997
-Okay?
-Look ahead of you.

769
00:56:49,081 --> 00:56:51,041
Look ahead of you,
or you'll trip and fall.

770
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:02,177
Gosh, I thought you'd be mad at me
and refuse to teach.

771
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:03,929
I was so worried yesterday.

772
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:08,600
Well, I heard the patients
miss my class like crazy.

773
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:10,227
Did Mr. Moon say that?

774
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:14,940
I guess he was too embarrassed
to tell you that he threatened me.

775
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,026
He threatened you?

776
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:20,904
He said I'd better resume
the fairy tale class,

777
00:57:20,988 --> 00:57:23,574
or he wouldn't do anything
I tell him to do.

778
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:26,368
He glared at me and gave me an ultimatum.

779
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:28,662
Why did he do that?

780
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:32,624
I guess he wants to see you
even when he's working.

781
00:57:36,545 --> 00:57:38,338
There's something I want to ask you.

782
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:41,550
Do you,

783
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:46,763
by any chance,
know our patient, Ms. Park Ok-ran?

784
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:51,852
Park Ok-ran?

785
00:57:52,478 --> 00:57:54,021
Oh, her.

786
00:57:55,397 --> 00:57:56,982
-You know her?
-Yes.

787
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:02,237
She's in my class.

788
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:05,407
What about her?

789
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,285
I was just wondering
if she was enjoying the class.

790
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,958
If you feel dizzy
or have trouble falling asleep

791
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,793
after taking the medication,

792
00:58:17,002 --> 00:58:18,504
-Open your mouth, please.
-let us know.

793
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,008
Roll your tongue like this.

794
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:39,900
Thanks so much, brother.

795
00:58:40,234 --> 00:58:41,985
For not telling Ms. Park.

796
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:45,364
I'm still undecided.

797
00:58:46,782 --> 00:58:48,825
You see, A-reum and I

798
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:51,495
promised each other
that we'd wait until we get discharged.

799
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:53,872
We have to follow the rules, you know.

800
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:56,959
We'll focus on getting better so that

801
00:58:57,042 --> 00:58:58,752
we can be discharged soon
and love each other

802
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,546
as much as we want
after we leave this place.

803
00:59:02,631 --> 00:59:03,674
I'm glad to hear that.

804
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:07,302
Your determination is what matters.

805
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,265
But to be honest, it's hard.

806
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,935
Unlike you, I'm not that patient.

807
00:59:16,144 --> 00:59:17,479
It'd be better if I never saw her.

808
00:59:18,105 --> 00:59:20,274
I see her every day,
and it's really driving me crazy.

809
00:59:20,816 --> 00:59:22,359
I tell myself to just never look at her.

810
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:25,404
But I keep thinking about her
even when I close my eyes.

811
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:31,243
Then when I see her,

812
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:32,911
I want to touch her.

813
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:41,461
Whenever I see her smile with another guy,

814
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:42,879
I get so pissed off.

815
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,305
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i> was written by

816
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:54,433
Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont,
a French author in the Middle Ages.

817
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:58,729
It was only when the story
was adapted into an animated film

818
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:01,231
-that the image of...
-<i>My head keeps saying I shouldn't,</i>

819
01:00:01,523 --> 01:00:02,816
<i>but I can't stop looking at her.</i>

820
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,068
-The story is said to teach us
-<i>And my heart</i>

821
01:00:05,444 --> 01:00:06,778
-to never judge anyone
-<i>can only follow my eyes.</i>

822
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:08,196
by their looks alone.

823
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,781
<i>It's really driving me crazy.</i>

824
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:25,255
But that's just what adults
want to tell children

825
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:27,549
to discipline them.

826
01:00:39,478 --> 01:00:42,522
Beauty and the Beast <i>is a story
about Stockholm Syndrome.</i>

827
01:00:44,066 --> 01:00:46,777
The Beast lives alone
in the castle because of a curse.

828
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,363
He holds a lady named Belle hostage
in the castle

829
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,948
and grooms this victim of his.
That's what the story is about.

830
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,785
Isn't it about a kindhearted lady

831
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:56,662
being locked in a castle
instead of her father

832
01:00:56,745 --> 01:00:58,538
and helping the Beast
remove the curse on him

833
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:01,124
because she falls in love with him?

834
01:01:04,086 --> 01:01:07,130
<i>The Beast is usually selfish
and harsh on Belle.</i>

835
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,966
<i>So doing something nice
once in a blue moon</i>

836
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,052
<i>and gazing at her
with a faint smile on his face</i>

837
01:01:12,844 --> 01:01:15,972
<i>was enough to move the naive lady, Belle.</i>

838
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:19,559
"Yes.

839
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:24,439
The Beast is lonely.
I should embrace him with my love.

840
01:01:25,357 --> 01:01:28,068
Only I can change him."

841
01:01:29,694 --> 01:01:31,488
But Belle was being delusional.

842
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:32,656
Correct.

843
01:01:34,366 --> 01:01:35,784
No!

844
01:01:35,867 --> 01:01:38,245
-A-reum!
-<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

845
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:41,039
isn't some crude story
about the Beast grooming his victim.

846
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,917
-Then what is it?
-The Beast

847
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,253
turns into a prince

848
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:50,090
because of the power of Belle's true love.

849
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,968
Belle's love

850
01:01:53,427 --> 01:01:55,971
calmed the Beast's violent nature.

851
01:01:57,472 --> 01:01:58,390
That love

852
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:01,893
embraced his wounded soul.

853
01:02:03,645 --> 01:02:06,022
The greatest thing anyone can do
as a human being.

854
01:02:07,315 --> 01:02:09,776
It's...

855
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:12,237
pure love.

856
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,989
Hey, I'm about to puke.

857
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:17,367
The drugs must be wearing off.
Did you take your medication?

858
01:02:21,997 --> 01:02:23,081
<i>That love</i>

859
01:02:23,832 --> 01:02:26,209
<i>embraced his wounded soul.</i>

860
01:02:33,758 --> 01:02:34,760
Love?

861
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:43,059
<i>It is a flower</i>

862
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:47,772
<i>It is a flower</i>

863
01:02:47,856 --> 01:02:52,819
<i>It is a flower</i>

864
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:54,905
Oh, my.

865
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,157
This really is a work of art.

866
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,533
Hello!

867
01:02:58,617 --> 01:02:59,701
Hello.

868
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,331
This mural totally
brightened up the space.

869
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:07,417
When did you learn to paint so well?

870
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:10,962
I was born with the talent.
It's a natural-born talent.

871
01:03:11,046 --> 01:03:12,547
I never had to learn it.

872
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:14,257
-Oh, you were born with it.
-Yes.

873
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,469
My gosh, I really envy those
who can draw or paint well.

874
01:03:17,552 --> 01:03:18,804
Yes.

875
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:23,308
May I paint a little flower right here?

876
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,810
No! Don't touch it.

877
01:03:24,893 --> 01:03:27,938
Don't touch my brush.
Don't touch my mural.

878
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,065
Oh, okay. I won't touch it.

879
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:32,526
-Okay.
-I won't touch any of this.

880
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:34,194
<i>It is a flower</i>

881
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,530
<i>Even if it blooms in the mountains</i>

882
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:38,281
-<i>It is a flower</i>
-What are you listening to?

883
01:03:38,365 --> 01:03:40,450
<i>It is a flower</i>

884
01:03:40,534 --> 01:03:42,619
-"It's all Flowers"?
-Yes.

885
01:03:42,702 --> 01:03:44,955
I love that song.

886
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:46,414
<i>Even if it blooms in the mountains</i>

887
01:03:46,498 --> 01:03:48,291
-<i>It is a flower
-It is a flower</i>

888
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,584
<i>Even if it blooms in the field</i>

889
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:51,002
-<i>It is a flower
-It is a flower</i>

890
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:52,212
<i>-Even if it blooms in the field
-Even if it blooms in the field</i>

891
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,463
-<i>It is a flower
-It is a flower</i>

892
01:03:53,547 --> 01:03:55,131
-That song, right?
-Yes.

893
01:03:57,092 --> 01:03:58,802
When you're done with this,

894
01:03:58,885 --> 01:04:00,846
would you like to come with me
to see some flowers?

895
01:04:00,929 --> 01:04:01,763
Sure.

896
01:04:02,222 --> 01:04:04,349
My gosh, this is incredible.

897
01:04:04,432 --> 01:04:05,392
You're amazing.

898
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:06,309
Thank you.

899
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,457
Will Ms. Lee A-reum be okay?

900
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,461
She agreed to meet him.

901
01:04:33,545 --> 01:04:36,214
Mr. O is in there with her,
so let's see how it goes.

902
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:38,508
I heard he used to hit her.

903
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,553
Why visit her when they're divorced?
He has no shame.

904
01:04:42,304 --> 01:04:44,848
Anyway, Ms. Lee is too nice.

905
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,683
Why would she even see him?

906
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,436
They went to middle school together.

907
01:04:50,604 --> 01:04:52,689
They've known each other
for more than half their lives

908
01:04:52,772 --> 01:04:55,275
if we include the three years
they were married to one another.

909
01:04:56,109 --> 01:04:57,777
I'm sure it's hard to just sever all ties.

910
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:01,615
This is why grooming is scary.

911
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,784
Ms. Ko was so right.

912
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:19,966
A-reum! Wait, A-reum!

913
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,051
A-reum.

914
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:22,135
Let go.

915
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:24,220
Don't visit me ever again.

916
01:05:24,512 --> 01:05:25,847
I'm sorry for everything.

917
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:26,765
Let's start over.

918
01:05:26,848 --> 01:05:28,391
I promise I'll be good to you.

919
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,435
I won't be fooled again.

920
01:05:30,518 --> 01:05:32,354
Things are already over between us,

921
01:05:32,437 --> 01:05:34,397
and I'll start afresh
when I leave this place.

922
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:35,565
A-reum.

923
01:05:35,982 --> 01:05:38,276
Think about the times
when we were happy together.

924
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,445
If I... If I hit you again,

925
01:05:40,528 --> 01:05:43,365
I'll cut my hand off. I really mean it.

926
01:05:43,448 --> 01:05:44,991
There's someone I like.

927
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:47,327
What?

928
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:55,418
What the hell are you talking about?

929
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:57,754
I'm going to live with him
when I get discharged,

930
01:05:58,296 --> 01:05:59,923
so just move on and live your life.

931
01:06:00,048 --> 01:06:01,633
You're already seeing some bastard?

932
01:06:01,716 --> 01:06:03,802
-You're hurting me. Let go!
-You piece of...

933
01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:12,477
Oh, my.

934
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,729
I thought you were the trash can.

935
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:15,730
Ms. Ko!

936
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,194
I sure am at a psychiatric hospital.

937
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:22,779
It's full of crazy bitches.

938
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:24,572
Why don't you check yourself in too?

939
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:26,449
You crazy bastard.

940
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,911
Goodness...

941
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,580
Hey, get up.

942
01:06:32,664 --> 01:06:35,208
I said, get up.
You're not going to get up?

943
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:46,970
Mr. Moon!

944
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,472
-Just a moment.
-No, no...

945
01:06:54,602 --> 01:06:56,479
Gang-tae! Stop.

946
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:57,856
You know you shouldn't do this.

947
01:06:57,939 --> 01:06:59,065
Stop.

948
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,818
What are you doing?

949
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:03,820
Enough. Stop.

950
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:05,530
No! Don't, Mr. Moon.

951
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:08,450
Please don't.

952
01:07:10,201 --> 01:07:11,244
Please...

953
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:16,791
Don't hit him. No, no.
You shouldn't hit him.

954
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,168
You shouldn't hit him.

955
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,385
Are you okay?

956
01:08:12,013 --> 01:08:12,931
No.

957
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:16,684
It hurts.

958
01:08:58,935 --> 01:08:59,978
What are you going to do?

959
01:09:00,478 --> 01:09:02,897
Well, technically it is self-defense...

960
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:04,107
No, it isn't...

961
01:09:05,066 --> 01:09:08,069
-It's excessive use of force--
-Whatever the reason,

962
01:09:08,152 --> 01:09:11,698
a caregiver punched a visitor,
so he should be punished.

963
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,742
If A-reum hadn't stepped in,
it could have been much worse.

964
01:09:14,826 --> 01:09:16,536
And it's not just about Mr. Moon

965
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,496
-but the honor of the hospital--
-You heard her, right?

966
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:20,790
Try to justify yourself.

967
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,626
I'm sorry. My brother...

968
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:27,338
I'm sorry. My brother... I'm sorry, I...

969
01:09:27,422 --> 01:09:30,550
I'm the older brother
so I will give a good talking to him.

970
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,427
You should've tolerated.
Why did you do that?

971
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,305
Did you count to three
in your head or not?

972
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:37,765
You should've counted to three.

973
01:09:38,725 --> 01:09:40,643
I will accept any punishment.
Whatever it may be.

974
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:43,021
Well, firing you may be going overboard.

975
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:44,981
But reprimanding you won't be enough.

976
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,068
I guess, I'll have to suspend you.

977
01:09:49,861 --> 01:09:52,363
And you won't be paid
while you are suspended.

978
01:09:53,865 --> 01:09:54,699
Yes.

979
01:09:55,283 --> 01:09:56,117
Go pack your things.

980
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,081
Hey, are you on drugs? Or are you drunk?

981
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:04,292
Why did you punch him?
He's definitely going to sue you.

982
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,377
Why did you do that?

983
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,547
You are good at keeping it
all inside and enduring it.

984
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,054
Bye.

985
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:24,187
Gang-tae.

986
01:10:28,483 --> 01:10:30,818
Are you really leaving? Just like that?

987
01:10:32,654 --> 01:10:34,072
Can't you say you're sorry

988
01:10:34,155 --> 01:10:35,782
and that it was a mistake?

989
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:36,866
It wasn't...

990
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:38,993
a mistake.

991
01:10:57,303 --> 01:10:58,137
Mr. Moon.

992
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:00,515
You were so cool.

993
01:11:00,598 --> 01:11:01,683
You rock!

994
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,019
Oh no. It's all because of that jerk.

995
01:11:05,311 --> 01:11:07,855
Gang-tae, come back soon, okay?
We'll be waiting for you.

996
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,904
Mr. Moon...

997
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,744
Why is he smiling?

998
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:23,413
No, he isn't.

999
01:11:24,122 --> 01:11:25,957
He got suspended.
He's probably close to crying.

1000
01:11:26,624 --> 01:11:29,836
No. I saw him smiling just now.

1001
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,772
Okay, fine.
When it looks like you want to run away,

1002
01:11:49,856 --> 01:11:51,941
I'll run away with you
right there and then.

1003
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:55,069
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

1004
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:58,466
I...

1005
01:12:58,883 --> 01:12:59,884
got suspended.

1006
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:04,639
They're not going to
pay me during my suspension

1007
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:07,183
and I'm probably going to get sued.

1008
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:11,437
Everything is so messed up.

1009
01:13:13,648 --> 01:13:14,899
You said before

1010
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:18,027
you'll run away with me

1011
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,154
whenever I want.

1012
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,078
I want to

1013
01:13:27,954 --> 01:13:29,205
go on a trip with you.

1014
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:34,919
Right now.

1015
01:13:41,134 --> 01:13:42,009
Let's go.

1016
01:14:25,803 --> 01:14:28,890
