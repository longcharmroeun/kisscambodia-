00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:10,478
I should go... Now...

4
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,072
This is so strange.

5
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,825
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong told me
to come over with you,

6
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:26,994
but she's not here.

7
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,288
Mun-yeong?

8
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:30,831
Mun-yeong...

9
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,961
I wonder if she and Gang-tae
have made up yet.

10
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,713
Have they made up...

11
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:42,635
This means I have to change my plan.

12
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,768
It'll be more fun to put both you
and Mun-yeong to sleep together.

13
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,813
I guess they kissed...

14
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,900
My gosh, you're so cute.

15
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:03,906
Don't touch it. Don't touch my hair!

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,616
Don't touch my hair.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,119
Don't touch... Don't touch my hair.

18
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,496
Goodness.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,542
What do I do...

20
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:17,795
Gosh.

21
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,555

SANG-TAE

23
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:38,232
-Sang-tae, where are you--
-<i>Oh, Mr. Moon.</i>

24
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,742
You're always looking for your brother.

25
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:49,702
Sang-tae.

26
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,746
Sang-tae.

27
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,248
Sang-tae.

28
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:55,458
Sang-tae!

29
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,337
Where can I meet you?

30
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:04,592

Sang-tae.

33
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,203
Sang-tae.

34
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,122
Sang-tae!

35
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,873
Sang-tae.

36
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,673
Why are you looking at me like that?

37
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:28,134
You look as if
you want to rip me to pieces.

38
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:30,261
I like that.

39
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,263
What did you do to Sang-tae?

40
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,851
Don't worry. I didn't kill him.

41
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:40,354
I gave him a tranquilizer,
so he'll wake up soon.

42
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,815
But it's too bad.

43
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,692
Mun-yeong should've been here, too.

44
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:48,195
I really wanted to see
which one of them you'd choose.

45
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,742
-Did you hide her somewhere?
-Why are you doing this?

46
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,202
Why are you doing this to us?

47
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:58,748
Because you ruined my daughter.

48
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:02,752
-What?
-She was my most perfect artwork,

49
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,004
but she's changed because of you.

50
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,089
Is your daughter...

51
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:11,635
an artwork to you?

52
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:16,599
We don't look alike at all, right?

53
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,185
I went under the knife
so I wouldn't look like her,

54
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,562
but she got those facial features from me.

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,317
That face and that body.
Her hair and even her soul.

56
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:30,863
I molded her. I created her.
She's my work of art.

57
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:35,910
Mun-yeong doesn't belong to you.

58
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,497
She's a person, not a piece of art.

59
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:41,373
She's a human being!

60
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,086
Damn it.

61
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:51,675
She won't listen to me because of you!

62
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,513
All failures must be discarded.

63
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,479
I don't want to do that

64
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:05,481
because of all the hard work I've done.

65
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,025
I'll give you a chance instead.

66
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,069
Take your brother and run far away.

67
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,988
As far away as you can go from Mun-yeong.

68
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:14,782
No.

69
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,951
I'll never do that.

70
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,621
I knew you'd say that.

71
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,958
Then here's another option for you.

72
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,837
Kill me.

73
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,509
If you kill me, you'll get your revenge.

74
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,553
And when Mun-yeong sees

75
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,680
that you killed me,
she'll get her old self back.

76
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:40,599
Then the two of you will never get out
of your ill-fated relationship.

77
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:42,768
So,

78
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:46,480
this was the ending

79
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:48,816
that you wanted?

80
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,234
Correct!

81
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,447
A happy ending for everyone.

82
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,996
Give it up.

83
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,039
What?

84
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:06,166
That messed up ending you're dreaming of

85
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,377
will never come.

86
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,005
-Because I will never
-Gosh.

87
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:14,925
give up on Mun-yeong.

88
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,515
Even though your mother died
because of Mun-yeong?

89
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:25,019
Do you want to hear the story?
It's very interesting.

90
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,743
This is where I met your mother
for the first time.

00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,687
Hello.

94
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,023
The employment agency sent me here
for the job--

95
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,150
Okay, then do the work.

96
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,611
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:17,655
Thank you.

98
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,107
Hey, what are you doing over there?

99
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:05,953
A bird with a broken wing
can't fly anyway.

100
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,621
What?

101
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,625
I should kill it, right?

102
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,898
She said since the bird can't fly anyway,

103
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,568
it'd be better just to kill it.

104
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:41,947
I'm proud of her.

105
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,659
Well...

106
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,954
There's this hospital
my elder son goes to.

107
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:51,790
Excuse me.

108
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,084
Yes, ma'am?

109
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,588
Thank you for your hard work.

110
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,177
Oh, okay.

111
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:51,892
Mom...

112
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,484
That's it?

113
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,196
That's why

114
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:07,199
you killed her?

115
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,914
Because of

116
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,126
what she said?

117
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:25,300
That's why you killed my mom?

118
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,852
She talked as if
my daughter was a lunatic.

119
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:38,355
How dare she.

120
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,324
Yes, kill me.

121
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:54,580
Don't...

122
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,292
Don't ever become weak.

123
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,220
<i>But you know,</i>

124
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,472

125
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,810
<i>still my mom.</i>

126
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,377
Gosh, you're such a coward.

127
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,933
This is why I don't like people
who are weak.

128
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,941
But Mun-yeong and I
are different from you guys.

129
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,484
Get that?

130
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:11,490
Stop talking bullshit.

131
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,496
There you are.

132
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,499
Denying it is useless

133
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,752
because you and I share the same blood.

134
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:24,670
No.

135
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,257
I'm not a monster like you!

00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,400
<i>You shouldn't.</i>

139
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:49,569
You

140
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,531
promised me.

141
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,034
That you wouldn't do this.

142
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,421
Hey.

143
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,007

144
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,883

00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,305
Moon Gang-tae, wake up.

Moon Gang-tae!

148

Did you think you'd be able
to escape from me by cutting your hair?

149
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:25,439
Wake up.

150

Please wake up, Moon Gang-tae--

151
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,236
I told you so!

152
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:37,993
You should've listened to Mom.

153
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,662
My daughter, my baby.

154
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:42,748
My baby.

00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,744
People stick together
because they're weak.

171
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:54,796
We lean on each other like this.

172
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,884
That's what makes us human.

173
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,345
Will you ever be human?

174
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,476
Let's go.

175
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,868
What on earth did you do to Park Ok-ran?

176
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,663
Oh, that woman.

177
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,084
She was such a great actress.

178
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:50,393
<i>Walk down the hallway at dawn</i>

179
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,731
<i>while singing "Oh My Darling, Clementine."</i>

180
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,987
<i>Visit Do Hui-jae's castle at night</i>

181
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,907
<i>and wish Mun-yeong a happy birthday.</i>

182
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,663
<i>Go to the study</i>

183
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:12,916
<i>and leave the envelope with the butterfly
on the desk.</i>

184
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:31,643
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 9</i>

185
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:33,395
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 9</i>

186
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:36,982
Ms. Park Ok-ran.

187
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,578
The show's over now,
so she should leave the stage.

188
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:57,168
Maybe she's putting on a different show
elsewhere.

189
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,343
It's about time
you left the stage as well.

190
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:07,971
Please get going.

191
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,366
Is he really just asleep?

192
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:30,952
He'll wake up, right?

193
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:32,579
Why?

194
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:34,998
If he never wakes up,

195
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:37,626
will you take your own life
like Romeo did?

196
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,919
He may never wake up?

197
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,632
He fainted because he got
high doses of Ativan.

198
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,636
But I've given him some fluid,
so he'll wake up in a few hours.

199
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,012
Don't worry too much.

200
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:23,546
Is he okay? Is my little brother okay?

201
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,008
Yes. He's just asleep,
so don't worry too much.

202
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:30,303
The head nurse is really horrible.
She's a horrible person.

203
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,807
She tried to hurt my siblings
and lied to me.

204
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,559
She even tried to touch
the back of my head.

205
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,977
I'm glad you taught her a lesson.

206
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,897
You saved their lives, Sang-tae.

207
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,191
I'm truly proud of you.

208
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:46,820
I saved them. I did it.

209
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:51,825
I saved them.
That's right. I saved their lives.

210
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,211
You get hurt

211
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,674
because of me every single time.

212
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:12,512
I'm sorry.

213
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,976
I'm sorry.

214
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,645
Denying it is useless

215
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:23,398
because you and I share the same blood.

216
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:28,445
If you stay with me,

217
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,575
your life will be miserable.

218
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:37,162
I'm sorry.

219
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:03,062
-Pick up, please.
-<i>The number you have dialed is not...</i>

220
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,149
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

221
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:10,111
Why isn't anyone picking up?
What if something terrible happened?

222
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:12,530
Damn it. This is driving me nuts.

223
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,660
Hey, you're here for questioning.
What's with this attitude?

224
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,037
I'm really sorry.

225
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,415
Someone I know
is in an urgent situation at the moment.

226
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,000
Please excuse me for a moment.

227
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,127
Look who's talking.

228
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:28,213
You can't afford
to worry about someone else now.

229
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:32,008
You crossed the centerline
and made an illegal U-turn.

230
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,384
When you were told to stop,

231
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,721
you kept speeding and almost hit a deer!

232
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:37,931
Gosh, seriously!

233
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:41,017
Who cares about that darn deer now?

234
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,311
Someone might die!

235
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:46,231
-Mr. Lee!
-Hey, Seung-jae.

236
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,525
What happened?

237
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,193
Ju-ri.

238
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,697
You made an illegal U-turn,
went over the speed limit,

239
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,575
ran away, and almost killed a deer?

240
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,328
That sounds like an NIS agent
in an intense car chase.

241
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:03,248
What the heck were you doing
all by yourself?

242
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:05,416
Jeez, it's none of your business.

243
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,544
Ju-ri, spare me a moment.

244
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:14,467
Are Gang-tae and Mun-yeong really okay?

245
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:15,760
Are you sure?

246
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,054
Yes, Jae-su called

247
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,598
and told me that they're fine.
He told me not to worry.

248
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,102
What's going on?

249
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:25,520
Ju-ri.

250
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:31,192
I think for some people, it's just
really hard to live a normal life.

251
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,532
It feels like some mean god's
sent all kinds of misfortune their way.

252
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,411
I feel so bad for them,
and it makes me upset

253
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:44,289
and furious.

254
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,294
The law of
the total number of misfortunes.

255
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:53,756
I heard we all have a set amount of
happiness and misfortune assigned to us.

256
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:56,884
If their lives have been filled
with misfortune up till now,

257
00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:59,512
it means only happiness awaits them.

258
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,308
I really hope that's the case.

259
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,900
Gross, that was so cheesy.

260
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:16,279
I want to down a glass of soda.

261
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,657
Then when I woke up,

262
00:23:19,741 --> 00:23:23,494
I saw the mean head nurse
grabbing Mun-yeong by the hair

263
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:26,289
and trying to stab Gang-tae
with the pen with her other hand--

264
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,334
-She tried to stab him. You got all angry
-Yes, so...

265
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:32,754
and hit her on the back of her head
with the book.

266
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,923
In conclusion, the brave Sang-tae
saved Mun-yeong and Gang-tae's lives.

267
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,217
I've heard the story eight times,
so I have it memorized.

268
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,679
Right. You're proud of me, right?

269
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,640
Are you proud of me?

270
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:47,435
I am, of course.

271
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,481
You rock. You're the best.

272
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,192
-You're the best.
-The best! I'm the best!

273
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,281
Anyhow, I ran here
because I was worried about him.

274
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:03,326
Is he Sleeping Beauty or what?
When the heck will he wake up?

275
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,578
-A kiss!
-What?

276
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:09,374
Only the prince's kiss
can wake Sleeping Beauty.

277
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:10,583
That's right, a kiss.

278
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,088
-So from behind, I smacked...
-Smack!

279
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:24,073
Did you sleep well?

280
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:26,701
Yes.

281
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,080
I think I slept for too long.

282
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:33,916
I had a really long dream,

283
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:37,545
and it was a terrible nightmare.

284
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,512
It wasn't a dream.

285
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:49,974
Come downstairs.

286
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:52,268
We need to talk.

287
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:24,967
Now do you see?

288
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:33,059
It actually happened right here.

289
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,354
Just a few hours ago.

290
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,907
Please wake up, Moon Gang-tae. Wake up!

291
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:49,534
It's all over now.

292
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:52,787
We're alive,

293
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:54,831
and my mom...

294
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:00,878
That woman was arrested.

295
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,632
And the truth will be revealed soon.

296
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:11,681
Please leave.

297
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,520
Leave this place.

298
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:21,691
Like you said, I'm not an empty can.

299
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,693
I have feelings too,

300
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,446
so I will never forget

301
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:32,201
the terrible things you and Sang-tae
had to experience here because of me.

302
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:34,787
They'll stay with me forever.

303
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,124
And you'll probably

304
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,793
suffer emotionally every time you see me.

305
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:48,509
We won't forget any of it.

306
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,054
We'll overcome it.

307
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:54,515
You said that's

308
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,393
the only way we can become

309
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,979
real adults whose souls can grow.

310
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,318
We should just...

311
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:09,655
Let's just think of it as a nightmare.

312
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,702
I can do it.

313
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,166
Stop pretending.

314
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:23,711
Stop pretending like it doesn't hurt.

315
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:26,130
Stop pretending like you're okay.

316
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:27,882
Pretending to be okay...

317
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,719
You're going to do it

318
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,305
in front of me. Not just Sang-tae.

319
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:37,850
And seeing that masked face

320
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:41,270
will make me walk on eggshells around you.

321
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:43,814
It'll suffocate me.

322
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,442
I'll be tormented.

323
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:51,572
I don't want to live like that.

324
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,492
That's why I'm asking you to leave.

325
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,621
Move out tomorrow with Sang-tae.

326
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,048
Mun-yeong.

327
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:14,303
Do you really mean it?

328
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,225
Yes.

329
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:21,978
I just want to live alone.

330
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:24,021
Like I used to.

331
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:02,268
You did well, Mun-yeong.

332
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:05,980
You did well.

333
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:41,183
Why do both of you look so tired?

334
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,477
Did you not get much sleep last night?

335
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,355
-I had to think about--
-Something came up last night.

336
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:50,082
By any chance,

337
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:55,072
did Ms. Ko and Mr. Moon
get into a fight last night or something?

338
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,744
Well, you ended up
at the police station last night, Mr. Lee.

339
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:03,622
And Jae-su,
you closed the restaurant early

340
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:05,791
and ran to Ms. Ko's studio.

341
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:10,295
Doesn't that mean
something crazy happened there?

342
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:12,589
-Is that right?
-Is it true?

343
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:17,719
No, not at all.

344
00:31:17,928 --> 00:31:20,472
They did get into a heated argument, but--

345
00:31:20,556 --> 00:31:23,892
Right, they reconciled quickly.

346
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:28,772
Gosh. Mun-yeong not only has a bad temper,
but she's also very fussy.

347
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:31,525
She's a hard one to please.

348
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:35,779
Mr. Moon must be having a hard time.

349
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:38,323
Gosh, you obviously don't know him well.

350
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:40,617
He's like a nine-tailed fox.

351
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,244
He has a knack for gaining control

352
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,162
over someone by charming the person.

353
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,915
Tell Ms. Ko to be careful
because the fox might eat her liver.

354
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,667
-Sure, of course.
-Okay?

355
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:52,170
It sounds like the two of them
are meant to be.

356
00:31:52,254 --> 00:31:53,630
The soup will get cold. Eat up.

357
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:54,840
-Okay.
-Okay.

358
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:57,801
I think they're lying.

359
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,198
Sang-tae.

360
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:24,286
Sang-tae.

361
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:29,291
Hey, are you okay?

362
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,419
Are you all right?

363
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:37,257
Did you... Did you get enough sleep?

364
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:41,637
What about your hand?
Has it stopped bleeding?

365
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,138
It doesn't hurt anymore?

366
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:45,474
It hurts.

367
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,061
It hurts so much that

368
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:51,021
I feel like I'm dying.

369
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:54,441
Oh, no. Then you need to go
to the hospital. The hospital.

370
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:02,950
Thank you.

371
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:06,411
Thank you for saving

372
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:08,497
all of us.

373
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,501
But...

374
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:15,420
But...

375
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,131
why did she do that?

376
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:23,136
The head nurse was a nice person.

377
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:25,889
Why did she do such a bad thing?

378
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:33,897
That woman

379
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,234
was a terrible person

380
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,112
who just acted nice.

381
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:42,656
She said

382
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:47,869
she really hated the idea
of others becoming happy.

383
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,998
<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.

384
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,459
There's a story like that in that book.

385
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:57,087
The female serial killer
who kills happy people.

386
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,922
That is the Witch of the West.

387
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:02,217
You read that book too?

388
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,012
Yes. Someone left the book
at the hospital, so I read it.

389
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,142
Not the whole book though.
Only up to page 63.

390
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,394
But it's so boring. It's really boring.

391
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:16,440
I see.

392
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:19,067
It's a boring book, so don't read it.

393
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:24,948
Is the head nurse
as horrible as the Witch of the West?

394
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,078
Yes.

395
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:35,042
But she gave me Dooly's mom as a gift.

396
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:38,086
Then,

397
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:40,964
what do I do with Dooly's mom now?

398
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,847
I'll put it in the trash on my way out.

399
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:50,891
Okay, throw it out.

400
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:56,980
No, don't throw it out.

401
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:04,154
Why not? A bad person gave it to you.
Let's just throw it out.

402
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:08,492
No, Dooly's mom didn't do anything wrong.

403
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:10,744
The person who gave it to me is bad,

404
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:13,830
but Dooly's mom isn't.

405
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:18,210
She... She didn't do anything wrong,
so don't throw her out. I won't let you.

406
00:35:20,295 --> 00:35:21,254
You're right.

407
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:24,341
She didn't do anything wrong.

408
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:27,302
She's not the bad one.

409
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:32,808
I won't... I won't throw you out.

410
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:36,228
You must've been scared.

411
00:35:36,311 --> 00:35:40,232
I'm sorry. I won't throw you out.
No way. I won't let it happen.

412
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:10,470
Are you up?

413
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:13,140
I made some soup,

414
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:15,225
so eat it when you get hungry.

415
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:17,561
I'm going to the hospital.

416
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:41,918
Sang-tae.

417
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,713
If Mun-yeong

418
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:49,885
wants us to move out, what will you do?

419
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,349
We're a family,
so we should live together.

420
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,395
But what if she tells us to move out?

421
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,481
We can move out.

422
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:06,568
We should take Mun-yeong with us though.

423
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:12,407
Why?

424
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:16,578
Because she'll be left alone
if the two of us move out.

425
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:18,163
If she's left all alone,

426
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,000
she'll be bored.

427
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,337
She always says that she's bored
and asks me to play with her.

428
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:32,385
But what if

429
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:35,764
she says that only the two of us
should move out?

430
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,937
Over my dead body.

431
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:47,901
We'll just say, "Over my dead body."
That will make us the winner.

432
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:50,779
Over my dead body! We're going to win.

433
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:52,739
Over my dead body. We're not moving out.

434
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:55,742
Over my dead body.
We're not going anywhere.

435
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:57,994
Over my dead body. We're not moving out.

436
00:37:58,078 --> 00:37:59,955
Over my dead body!

437
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:21,797
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

438
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,064
Why?

439
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:26,940
Are you running away again
to a different hospital?

440
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:28,262
No.

441
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:32,821
I want to take it easy now.

442
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,907
I guess we were thinking the same thing.

443
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:39,035
I'm going to quit
so I can spend my time doing what I want.

444
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:41,705
Shall we hang out together?

445
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:45,166
I already have someone to hang out with.

446
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,253
Can you at least act like you're torn?

447
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:51,923
Are you

448
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:56,469
resigning because of what happened?

449
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:00,265
As the director, I should
take responsibility for what happened.

450
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,977
I didn't know what was going on
right under my nose,

451
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:08,148
so I don't think I can continue
to study the mind.

452
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:15,613
Then,

453
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:21,453
think of this as the last time.

454
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,539
Can I get a session with you?

455
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,375
Sure.

456
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:30,837
Tell me what's on your mind.

457
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:43,183
Oh, there you are.

458
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:45,852
You should eat something.

459
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:49,022
Gang-tae made egg soup. It's very good.

460
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:53,568
But I... I like the rice bowl more,
so that's what I had.

461
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:01,618
Oh, right. Is your head okay?

462
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:06,247
I saw that evil woman
grab you by the hair yesterday.

463
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,167
Did you lose a lot of hair?

464
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,757
She tried to hurt you
because she didn't want you to be happy.

465
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,218
She's evil. So evil.

466
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:24,766
Right, I need to show you my homework.

467
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:27,477
I practiced drawing
so many facial expressions.

468
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,020
Do you want to see it?

469
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:29,938
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

470
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:35,902
That homework...

471
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:38,071
You don't need to do it.

472
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:40,907
What?

473
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:44,994
We won't publish the book.

474
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:49,916
What? Why... Why not?
Why won't we publish it?

475
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:51,251
Because I don't want to.

476
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:55,839
And when Gang-tae is back
from the hospital,

477
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:57,715
I want you guys to move out.

478
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:01,094
I'm terminating our contract.

479
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:06,349
If you... If you terminate the contract,

480
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:09,269
the penalty goes up threefold.

481
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:10,728
I'll pay you however much you want.

482
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:12,814
Move out before the end of the day.

483
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:17,402
Over my dead body.

484
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,114
Over my dead body. I don't care.

485
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:22,824
Over my dead body.
I don't care what you say.

486
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:25,034
Over my dead body!

487
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:26,619
Over my dead body. I'll win this fight.

488
00:41:26,703 --> 00:41:30,331
No way, I'm not moving out.
Over my dead body!

489
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:43,928
To be honest,

490
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:48,808
I'm not sure if I can handle it.

491
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:52,604
Do Hui-jae...

492
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:56,983
The things that woman said to me,

493
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:00,987
her face, and the things that she did...

494
00:42:02,363 --> 00:42:03,781
Whenever I think about those things,

495
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,784
my mom, who was killed unjustly,

496
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,163
and my brother,
who saw that while hiding...

497
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,294
I just can't get any of it out of my head,

498
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:22,383
and I can't breathe.

499
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,514
Despite that,

500
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,475
I lied to Mun-yeong.

501
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:34,687
I said that I could overcome all of it.

502
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:39,734
But...

503
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,324
Mun-yeong

504
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:48,743
won't buy it.

505
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:58,127
Being together torments you.

506
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,007
But if you break up,
it'll be equally painful.

507
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,678
If both options feel like death,

508
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:08,596
wouldn't it be better to suffer together?

509
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:11,599
Be honest with me.

510
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:15,520
I bet you wanted to kill Do Hui-jae
when you were alone with her.

511
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:23,236
Yes, kill me.

512
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:27,699
-Yes.
-Then why didn't you kill her?

513
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:32,620
Because

514
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:35,498
I thought of Mun-yeong.

515
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:40,586
Right, exactly.

516
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:43,339
The one that torments you

517
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:47,218
can also be the one to save you.

518
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:50,221
You were about to explode,

519
00:43:51,306 --> 00:43:53,182
but she prevented you from blowing up.

520
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,116
What is all this?

521
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:16,164
Mun-yeong,
why on earth are you being like this?

522
00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:17,248
What do you think?

523
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:19,125
I told you everything over the phone
yesterday.

524
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm not going to write anymore.

525
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:25,757
Fine.

526
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:28,968
I understand it's about time
you got tired of writing fairy tales.

527
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:33,473
Then why don't we just switch
to a different genre?

528
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,063
Yes, let's try a genre
that better suits your personality.

529
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:43,524
What about a crime novel or a thriller?

530
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:47,487
A horror novel? A martial arts fiction
or a tragic love story?

531
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:49,364
Or...

532
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:50,865
What about an erotic novel?

533
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:51,866
I will retire.

534
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,035
I don't want to write anymore.

535
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:57,038
I'm just going to retire
and spend my time doing what I want.

536
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:00,792
No. Don't say that, Mun-yeong.

537
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,585
Gosh...

538
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:07,340
If it's because of the mental shock
from the recent incidents,

539
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:10,093
you can take about a year off and...

540
00:45:10,218 --> 00:45:11,260
Mr. Lee.

541
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:18,559
There are

542
00:45:19,602 --> 00:45:21,938
no more stories that I want to write.

543
00:45:22,605 --> 00:45:23,773
That's why.

544
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:26,859
And I'm going to sell this house.

545
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:29,487
So stop hovering around me.

546
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:32,115
Just go back to Seoul with Seung-jae.

547
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:33,950
You're free now.

548
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,038
No, no way.

549
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:41,457
I can't even imagine

550
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,334
SangSangESang Publishers
without Ko Mun-yeong.

551
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:44,919
And without you,

552
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:47,046
none of my visions will come true,

553
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,215
so that freedom is completely useless.

554
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:52,927
Mun-yeong, please. I'll be good to you.
Change your mind just this once.

555
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,345
Stop whining.

556
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:56,305
My head hurts
because I didn't get much sleep.

557
00:45:57,306 --> 00:45:58,808
I need to get some sleep, so get lost.

558
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:14,490
I guess she's really made up her mind
to stop writing this time.

559
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:20,496
Why don't we just find a different writer
to sign with and--

560
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,333
Hey, do you think I'm being like this
to sell books and make money?

561
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:25,835
Yes.

562
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:28,671
Writing fairy tales

563
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,216
is the only way
Mun-yeong can communicate with the world.

564
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,302
It's the only way
she can talk and breathe.

565
00:46:34,385 --> 00:46:39,390
If she doesn't want to do that anymore,
it means she's just going to die.

566
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,575
-Director O.
-Yes?

567
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:00,703
You know how you asked me
to hang out with you earlier?

568
00:47:01,537 --> 00:47:03,372
What are you going to propose this time?

569
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,169
Well, I'll come by from time to time.

570
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:11,964
So in return, can I plant a tree
in the hospital garden?

571
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:13,090
"A tree"?

572
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:14,717
Sure. Why not?

573
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:17,261
What kind of tree?

574
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:20,223
It could be a walnut tree or a ginkgo--

575
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:22,225
No, don't plant a ginkgo tree. They stink.

576
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:37,374
I told you so!

577
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:38,595
My baby.

578
00:48:07,753 --> 00:48:10,005
You seemed to be having a nightmare.

579
00:48:11,674 --> 00:48:13,217
Pack up and leave.

580
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:14,927
I want you to leave today.

581
00:48:16,762 --> 00:48:18,555
I just need Mang-tae.

582
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:20,724
I don't need Gang-tae anymore.

583
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:23,477
Oh, right.

584
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:28,524
You already told me
you don't want anyone to rely on you.

585
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:32,319
So that's good. Now, hurry up and leave.

586
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:35,030
Are you

587
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,827
really going to live alone?

588
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:43,205
I've been living alone all my life.

589
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:47,006
People like me aren't able to live
among others.

590
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:49,003
It's better to be secluded.

591
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:52,172
-Why?
-Because that's how I was born.

592
00:48:54,758 --> 00:48:55,592
Mun-yeong.

593
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:58,887
You can't live by yourself anymore.

594
00:49:00,264 --> 00:49:01,306
Why not?

595
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,642
Because now, you know how it feels

596
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:06,020
to feel warm at heart

597
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:08,939
and to have a full stomach.

598
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:17,698
So

599
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:20,367
just admit it.

600
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:21,660
Admit what?

601
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,081
That you're just a little kid

602
00:49:26,832 --> 00:49:28,000
who wants to be loved.

603
00:49:41,388 --> 00:49:43,474
Cut the nonsense and just move out.

604
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,146
Do you want me to tell you a story?

605
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:50,731
No.

606
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:54,234
A long time ago...

607
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:55,944
Shut up.

608
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:00,365
There lived two poor brothers
who cared for each other very much.

609
00:50:03,243 --> 00:50:06,705
One day, it was the harvest season,
so they both harvested rice.

610
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:10,084
The older brother was worried
his little brother might run out of rice,

611
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:13,796
so he secretly carried
a sack of rice at night

612
00:50:14,254 --> 00:50:16,256
and left it in front of
his little brother's house.

613
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,845
The same day, the little brother
also carried a sack of rice

614
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,473
and put it in front of
his older brother's house

615
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:28,560
thinking that his older brother might
need more due to his big family.

616
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:31,063
When they woke up the next day,

617
00:50:31,146 --> 00:50:34,942
they both noticed that they still had
the same amount of rice as before.

618
00:50:36,944 --> 00:50:39,071
The two brothers thought it was strange.

619
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:42,074
So they did the same thing that night
and left a sack of rice

620
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:44,201
in front of each other's house.

621
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,458
And that continued for days.

622
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,006
Do you know
what the moral of this story is?

623
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,637
"Siblings who care a lot about each other

624
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,891
should live together so they won't
end up doing pointless work."

625
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:12,312
It's funny, isn't it?

626
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:15,524
What a joke.

627
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:17,401
What kind of moral is that?

628
00:51:19,486 --> 00:51:20,821
My brother came up with it.

629
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:24,908
Do you not like

630
00:51:27,578 --> 00:51:28,954
me and my brother?

631
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:33,834
I know you do.

632
00:51:35,878 --> 00:51:36,837
Right?

633
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:42,968
Let's not do anything
that will waste our time.

634
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,263
I don't care where we live.

635
00:51:48,098 --> 00:51:49,474
I just want us to live together.

636
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:52,436
Okay?

637
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:05,324
Mun-yeong.

638
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:11,205
Answer me.

639
00:52:13,665 --> 00:52:15,626
Can we talk?

640
00:52:17,211 --> 00:52:19,671
Will you stop being so stubborn?

641
00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:23,175
Did you just yell at me?

642
00:52:27,846 --> 00:52:28,680
No.

643
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:32,768
I think my voice tends to sound louder

644
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:35,729
in this room.

645
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,236
I'll leave you to get some rest
if you're tired.

646
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:46,573
Get some rest.

647
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:07,886
<i>Why not?</i>

648
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,681
-<i>Cancer.</i>
-<i>Cancer?</i>

649
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:12,724
-<i>You heard me.</i>
-<i>Yikes!</i>

650
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:13,892
<i>It's too late.</i>

651
00:53:16,228 --> 00:53:17,854
Did... Did you tell her?

652
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,774
Yes.

653
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:24,194
But I think I only made it worse.

654
00:53:26,238 --> 00:53:28,365
Did... Did you follow my instructions?

655
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:33,578
I told her that siblings who care
a lot about each other

656
00:53:34,162 --> 00:53:36,832
should live together so they won't
end up doing pointless work.

657
00:53:37,374 --> 00:53:39,626
I... I bet you made it sound boring.

658
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,463
Some people have a way
of making things sound really boring.

659
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:46,300
Gang-tae, you're so boring.

660
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:52,848
-<i>I'm going to die now!</i>
-"I'm going to die now!

661
00:53:52,931 --> 00:53:55,517
-I have so much resentment and regret.
-<i>I have so much resentment and regret.</i>

662
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,810
-There's so much I want to eat.
-<i>There's so much I want to eat.</i>

663
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:58,478
-I feel so bad for myself!
-<i>I feel so bad for myself!</i>

664
00:53:58,562 --> 00:54:01,231
-My... My pitiful youth!"
-<i>My... My pitiful youth!</i>

665
00:54:01,315 --> 00:54:02,983
My gosh, this is so hard.

666
00:54:05,402 --> 00:54:06,987
-Whatever.
-You're not popular

667
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:09,072
because you're so boring.

668
00:54:09,156 --> 00:54:12,367
Let's be honest.
BLACKPINK is the most popular.

669
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:14,286
Let's be honest about that.

670
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:30,635
Why are you alone? Did you call Mun-yeong?

671
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,513
Yes, but she didn't respond.

672
00:54:33,597 --> 00:54:36,016
It was so rude of her not to reply.

673
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:39,394
Hey.

674
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,647
Come eat with us.
We have quail eggs and rolled omelet...

675
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,983
Can we talk?

676
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:03,668
When are you going to leave?

677
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:06,922
You should eat first.

678
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:08,507
You haven't eaten anything.

679
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:10,509
Are you trying to be a live-in-cook?

680
00:55:11,426 --> 00:55:14,596
Go back to where you used to live.

681
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,600
-We can't.
-Why not?

682
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:22,145
The water pipe burst.

683
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:25,690
-What?
-The entire place is flooded.

684
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,443
It'll take days to fix.

685
00:55:52,926 --> 00:55:54,761
Hey, it's me.

686
00:55:55,804 --> 00:55:57,055
Can you talk right now?

687
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:02,477
NURSES' OFFICE

688
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:04,771
Ju-ri.

689
00:56:05,564 --> 00:56:07,357
Shouldn't we tell the patients

690
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:09,609
that Director O is going to retire?

691
00:56:09,693 --> 00:56:11,862
I feel like they already know.

692
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:14,614
"Things aren't very stable

693
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:16,950
because people keep quitting.

694
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,703
If we tell them now,
the patients will feel agitated."

695
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:22,164
That's what Director O said.

696
00:56:22,914 --> 00:56:26,334
But shouldn't we at least plan
a retirement ceremony?

697
00:56:26,418 --> 00:56:29,129
Gosh, it's not an honorable retirement.

698
00:56:29,212 --> 00:56:31,006
I'm leaving because
I'm no longer qualified.

699
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:33,133
You're done with your shift, right?

700
00:56:33,216 --> 00:56:34,342
Yes.

701
00:56:34,426 --> 00:56:36,219
Let's all go eat.

702
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:38,805
I'll go after I make a phone call.

703
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:48,648
What do you want?

704
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:52,861
<i>Mun-yeong, I'm really sorry,
but can you do me a favor?</i>

705
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:54,112
No, I can't.

706
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:56,198
<i>My mom is sick.</i>

707
00:56:59,451 --> 00:57:03,371
She took the day off today
because she's really sick.

708
00:57:03,663 --> 00:57:05,790
I called her earlier,
and she didn't sound very well,

709
00:57:05,874 --> 00:57:07,292
so I'm really worried about her.

710
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,381
I can't reach Sang-in and Seung-jae
because they went to a seminar,

711
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:14,674
and I have a night shift today.

712
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:16,927
Then ask Gang-tae.

713
00:57:18,261 --> 00:57:19,679
I'm really sorry.

714
00:57:20,764 --> 00:57:22,516
But can you go instead?

715
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:24,267
<i>I know she's old and all,</i>

716
00:57:24,351 --> 00:57:26,978
<i>but she'll feel more comfortable
around a woman.</i>

717
00:57:27,854 --> 00:57:29,606
-<i>Can you help?</i>
-No, I can't.

718
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:31,733
Why would you ask me
to take care of your mom?

719
00:57:50,627 --> 00:57:51,878
Hey, you're here.

720
00:57:58,134 --> 00:57:59,386
Are you really sick?

721
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:02,556
You seem to have more energy than I do.

722
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:05,642
When you're my age, you're always sick.

723
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:08,061
My knees ache

724
00:58:08,144 --> 00:58:09,854
along with the joints in my arms and legs,

725
00:58:10,438 --> 00:58:12,274
so I can't even sleep at night. Oh, boy.

726
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:16,444
Nam Ju-ri, that two-faced bitch.

727
00:58:16,528 --> 00:58:18,697
Don't badmouth my precious daughter.

728
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,282
Now, come here and eat.

729
00:58:26,746 --> 00:58:27,664
Here.

730
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:31,418
I heard you didn't eat for days.

731
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:34,963
So I cooked scorched rice soup
instead of rice.

732
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:37,549
Here.

733
00:58:41,678 --> 00:58:42,804
Sit down.

734
00:58:44,723 --> 00:58:48,727
Just go along with it and eat.

735
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:52,022
Do you know how many people
were involved in planning this

736
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:54,274
so we could put something
into that empty stomach?

737
00:59:00,864 --> 00:59:03,533
Hey, it's me.

738
00:59:04,284 --> 00:59:05,785
Can you talk right now?

739
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:09,080
Why? What is it this time?

740
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:11,750
You're starting to scare me.

741
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:15,587
No, it's not that.

742
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:20,550
This is a bit embarrassing,
but I need your help.

743
00:59:21,843 --> 00:59:23,386
What? "Embarrassing"?

744
00:59:24,012 --> 00:59:26,806
Then you should take
the afternoon off tomorrow, Mom.

745
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,683
Okay, sure.

746
00:59:29,184 --> 00:59:33,271
Tell Gang-tae to send me a list
of Mun-yeong's favorite food via text.

747
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:38,151
Mun-yeong hasn't been writing, eating,

748
00:59:38,234 --> 00:59:39,653
or going outside.

749
00:59:39,736 --> 00:59:42,280
I was so worried
that something might happen to her.

750
00:59:42,364 --> 00:59:44,866
My gosh, thank you guys so much.

751
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,327
My goodness. We're not doing this for you.

752
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:50,246
We're doing it because Gang-tae asked.

753
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:54,751
Then I'll prepare something else

754
00:59:54,834 --> 00:59:56,920
other than food.

755
00:59:57,629 --> 00:59:58,630
Like what?

756
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:08,223
Hey, Jae-su. It's me, Seung-jae.

757
01:00:08,765 --> 01:00:12,227
By any chance, do you have time
to chat tomorrow?

758
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:14,270
Okay, bye.

759
01:00:16,272 --> 01:00:17,440
I think he likes me.

760
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:22,153
I'm serious.

761
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,282
<i>My goodness.</i>

762
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:29,285
Sit down and eat.

763
01:00:31,955 --> 01:00:33,123
Sit down.

764
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:38,753
There.

765
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:41,673
Eat up.

766
01:00:49,973 --> 01:00:51,725
Shit, it's so damn hot!

767
01:00:55,937 --> 01:00:58,940
Why would you swear like that
with that precious mouth of yours?

768
01:00:59,024 --> 01:01:01,151
Blow on it to cool it down
and eat it slowly.

769
01:01:01,234 --> 01:01:02,694
You don't want to burn your mouth.

770
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:14,831
You won't believe it.

771
01:01:16,124 --> 01:01:17,417
Last night,

772
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:20,253
Gang-tae called Sang-in

773
01:01:21,296 --> 01:01:24,632
and asked him for help
so he could get you to eat something.

774
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,470
I'm pretty sure he felt bad
about calling me.

775
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:31,681
I bet he couldn't dare ask me
to cook for you

776
01:01:31,765 --> 01:01:34,309
after how he rejected Ju-ri.

777
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:37,771
But you eventually cooked everything.

778
01:01:37,854 --> 01:01:40,356
Exactly. I'm such a fool.

779
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:49,783
Here.

780
01:01:50,658 --> 01:01:51,659
There.

781
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:01,669
Why is everyone

782
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,841
so nice to me?

783
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:11,054
I'm not your family.

784
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,181
Because you're pretty.

785
01:02:14,474 --> 01:02:17,811
You're pretty, you eat well,

786
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:21,481
and it's nice how you like Gang-tae
for who he is

787
01:02:21,564 --> 01:02:24,400
even though he has nothing to offer.

788
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:47,924
Gosh, I'm hungry.

789
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:49,676
Can I also have some food?

790
01:03:17,537 --> 01:03:19,873
Is... Is this Mom's tree?

791
01:03:19,956 --> 01:03:20,832
Yes.

792
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:24,836
Whenever we miss her,

793
01:03:25,545 --> 01:03:27,422
we just need to come here.

794
01:03:27,505 --> 01:03:29,966
Oh, I see.

795
01:03:32,594 --> 01:03:34,262
Mom... Mom.

796
01:03:35,138 --> 01:03:38,182
This... This is our new family photo.

797
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:41,561
The girl in the middle is Mun-yeong.
She's pretty.

798
01:03:41,644 --> 01:03:43,229
She... She looks better with long hair.

799
01:03:43,313 --> 01:03:46,733
But Gang-tae cut her hair like this.

800
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:51,487
Mom.

801
01:03:54,073 --> 01:03:54,908
I

802
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,577
grew up well, didn't I?

803
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,500
Yes, you grew up well.

804
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:07,420
And so did I.

805
01:04:08,796 --> 01:04:11,674
Mom, I hope you also grow up
into a big tree.

806
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:14,969
From now on,

807
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:17,847
I'll take good care of Sang-tae,

808
01:04:19,807 --> 01:04:20,683
Mom.

809
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:24,312
She... She didn't have you
so you could take care of me.

810
01:04:25,396 --> 01:04:26,230
You...

811
01:04:27,482 --> 01:04:29,901
You weren't born to take care of me.

812
01:04:31,069 --> 01:04:32,528
That's...

813
01:04:33,238 --> 01:04:35,949
That's not why Mom gave birth to you.

814
01:04:37,492 --> 01:04:40,078
Older brothers are supposed to
take care of younger brothers.

815
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:42,455
And... And that's why I hit that bad woman

816
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:44,916
on the back of her head.

817
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:48,670
I... I protected you
while you were sleeping.

818
01:04:52,882 --> 01:04:53,883
You're right.

819
01:04:55,718 --> 01:04:56,970
You were born

820
01:04:58,137 --> 01:04:59,597
to protect me.

821
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:04,978
Yes, but you're all grown up now,
so it's time you take care of yourself.

822
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:07,605
I'm... I'm busy now.

823
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:08,982
Bye, Mom.

824
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:15,655
Mom.

825
01:05:18,157 --> 01:05:19,158
Did you hear that?

826
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:29,752
Wait for me.

827
01:05:38,761 --> 01:05:40,805
I'll be honest with you.

828
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:44,183
I sometimes think
he might be a psychopath.

829
01:05:44,267 --> 01:05:47,729
He's way too cold-hearted and indifferent.

830
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:49,147
I agree.

831
01:05:49,564 --> 01:05:52,692
I really hate it how he sometimes
puts on a fake expression.

832
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:55,653
I know, right? My gosh.

833
01:05:55,737 --> 01:05:58,114
On top of that, he's also out of his mind.

834
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:02,076
Do you know what he said to me last time
at my restaurant?

835
01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:04,996
Serengeti.

836
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,374
Serengeti.

837
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,293
Do you even know where that is?

838
01:06:10,376 --> 01:06:12,336
At first, I thought he was
talking about spaghetti.

839
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,965
Serengeti is a place in Africa.
It's all the way in Africa.

840
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:19,344
He wanted to go there
when he doesn't even have a passport.

841
01:06:19,427 --> 01:06:20,845
He's crazy.

842
01:06:20,928 --> 01:06:22,680
Why is that crazy?

843
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:25,099
What?

844
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:30,688
Why is it crazy
that he wants to go to Serengeti?

845
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:32,148
Why?

846
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,400
My gosh, you startled me.

847
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:06,557
My goodness.

848
01:07:08,643 --> 01:07:10,269
Did you go somewhere?

849
01:07:10,853 --> 01:07:12,105
Sang-tae.

850
01:07:12,855 --> 01:07:14,565
You reek of alcohol.

851
01:07:18,569 --> 01:07:19,570
Sang-tae.

852
01:07:21,406 --> 01:07:23,533
Can you ask Gang-tae

853
01:07:25,118 --> 01:07:28,371
what excuse he's going to use tomorrow
to stay here?

854
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:32,667
I went to Ju-ri's house,

855
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:35,211
and their water pipe was fine.

856
01:07:38,714 --> 01:07:40,675
Over my dead body.

857
01:07:42,343 --> 01:07:43,761
Do you have a death wish?

858
01:07:43,845 --> 01:07:47,765
What? Oh, here.
You need to check my homework.

859
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:51,060
I told you not to bother.

860
01:07:51,352 --> 01:07:53,646
I'm done writing fairy tales.

861
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:55,314
I'm going to stop.

862
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,316
No.

863
01:07:58,151 --> 01:07:59,318
I'm going to retire.

864
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:05,450
You... You need to check my homework
so I can become an illustrator.

865
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:07,994
So... So check my homework.

866
01:08:08,578 --> 01:08:10,705
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

867
01:08:11,581 --> 01:08:16,711
If... If you don't write,
I'll publish a book with someone else.

868
01:08:16,878 --> 01:08:18,671
I... I want to keep drawing.

869
01:08:20,423 --> 01:08:24,010
My gosh, you have no loyalty.

870
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,512
You're just going to work with whomever?

871
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,974
No... No, not whomever.

872
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:31,851
I'll be working with a real partner.

873
01:08:34,937 --> 01:08:37,440
Okay, fine. Let's take a look.

874
01:08:38,232 --> 01:08:40,943
They used to be stick figures.
Let's see how much you've improved.

875
01:08:45,448 --> 01:08:48,534
Take... Take a look.

876
01:08:49,619 --> 01:08:51,537
He looks happy.

877
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:56,792
He... He smiled like this

878
01:08:56,876 --> 01:08:59,670
after he told me he likes someone.

879
01:08:59,754 --> 01:09:01,005
He smiled.

880
01:09:01,088 --> 01:09:05,843
This... This is how Gang-tae looks
when he's happy.

881
01:09:05,927 --> 01:09:08,888
Take... Take a look at this.

882
01:09:08,971 --> 01:09:14,018
It's... It's not fake. He's really happy.

883
01:09:14,101 --> 01:09:16,979
Gang-tae... Gang-tae looks happy.

884
01:09:17,063 --> 01:09:19,941
I drew him
because I saw it for the first time.

885
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:33,955
Look. Right here.

886
01:09:39,877 --> 01:09:41,921
It's a happy expression.

887
01:09:42,296 --> 01:09:44,257
Why are you crying?

888
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:46,842
Because it's beautiful.

889
01:09:49,845 --> 01:09:51,430
It's so beautiful.

890
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:57,520
Do you want it?

891
01:10:00,064 --> 01:10:00,898
Yes.

892
01:10:02,191 --> 01:10:03,401
I want it.

893
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:06,946
Can I have it?

894
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,123
Here. I'll let you have it.

895
01:10:24,839 --> 01:10:29,552
I... I really want to publish
a fairy tale book.

896
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:34,807
I... I want to take my book
and show it to my mom.

897
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,851
I want to tell her I'm an illustrator now.

898
01:10:43,733 --> 01:10:44,567
Your mom?

899
01:10:45,276 --> 01:10:49,614
Yes, we planted a tree for her
at OK Psychiatric Hospital.

900
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:51,407
My mom's tree.

901
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:21,062
I'm sorry.

902
01:11:24,815 --> 01:11:25,900
I'm so sorry.

903
01:11:39,872 --> 01:11:40,831
I

904
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:42,958
followed you.

905
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:48,923
Your hobby is to kidnap people.

906
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,426
My hobby is to tail people.

907
01:11:59,016 --> 01:12:00,059
Do you think that's funny?

908
01:12:04,397 --> 01:12:05,815
I might not be funny.

909
01:12:09,985 --> 01:12:11,570
But I do want to impress you.

910
01:12:17,785 --> 01:12:19,537
I'll keep trying.

911
01:12:21,622 --> 01:12:22,623
I'll do everything I can

912
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,252
to overcome what happened

913
01:12:27,628 --> 01:12:29,088
and cope with it.

914
01:12:31,674 --> 01:12:32,591
So please

915
01:12:33,843 --> 01:12:35,302
stop pushing me away.

916
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:37,763
Let me stay by your side.

917
01:12:39,598 --> 01:12:40,433
Please?

918
01:12:56,157 --> 01:12:57,116
Then what about this?

919
01:12:58,868 --> 01:12:59,994
How will you compensate for this?

920
01:13:07,877 --> 01:13:09,044
I'm sorry

921
01:13:10,379 --> 01:13:11,464
I made you get hurt.

922
01:13:27,104 --> 01:13:27,938
I love you!

923
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,953
I love you, Mun-yeong.

924
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,178
I love you!

925
01:14:00,638 --> 01:14:01,680
I said, I love you!

926
01:14:06,268 --> 01:14:08,020
I love you so much!

927
01:14:10,022 --> 01:14:11,857
I said I love you! Why are you leaving?

928
01:14:14,944 --> 01:14:15,778
Hey!

929
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:17,988
I love you!

930
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:22,576
Mun-yeong!

931
01:14:23,202 --> 01:14:24,286
Wait...

932
01:14:25,746 --> 01:14:26,747
Mun-yeong, I love you.

933
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:30,501
-Shouldn't he get admitted?
-I love you! Will you please stop?

934
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:32,920
Mr. Moon has changed so much.

935
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:35,130
Love changes people.

936
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:52,523
Mun-yeong.

937
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:55,943
I love you.

938
01:14:56,485 --> 01:14:58,862
Is that not it? Is it something else?

939
01:14:59,697 --> 01:15:00,864
Will you please say something?

940
01:15:01,907 --> 01:15:04,618
If you tell me you love me one more time,
I might just...

941
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,670
You might just what?

942
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,384
Do this?
