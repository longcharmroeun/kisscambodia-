Mun-yeong.

4
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:22,680
I love you.

5
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,376
Is that not it? Is it something else?

6
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,837
Will you please say something?

7
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:31,210
If you tell me you love me one more time,
I might just...

8
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:41,157
You might just what?

9
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:45,912
Do this?

10
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:18,664
My gosh, that darn deer.

11
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:21,295
Shut up, you stupid deer!

12
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:42,204
I love you.

FINAL CHAPTER
FINDING THE REAL FACE

14
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:02,923
"Memorandum.

15
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,444

-<i>fairy-tale book.</i>

20
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:16,871
His handwriting is horrible.

21
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,064
Sang-tae.

22
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,399
MEMORANDUM

23
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:25,029
My gosh, I can't believe
you got him to write a memorandum.

24
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:27,239
You're amazing, Sang-tae.

25
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,802
But were you waiting here
just so you could show me this?

26
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:34,682
-No.
-Then did you miss me?

27
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,833
-Hey, boss.
-What?

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,789
I want to quit my part-time job.

29
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:44,846
-What?
-I want to quit working for you.

30
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,886
All of a sudden?

31
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,572
People always quit all of a sudden.

32
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,140
So I feel very sorry.

33
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,487
Why?

34
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,979
Is it because you want to get paid more?

35
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,943
Okay, fine. I'll raise your hourly wage
by 500 won...

36
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,195
No, I'll give you 1000 won more.

37
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,324
I want to be an illustrator,
not a part-timer.

38
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:11,921
What?

39
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:14,615
I want to become a real illustrator.

40
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,247
A real one.

41
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:23,671
No.

42
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,642
No, you can't.

43
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:28,342
This is way too sudden.

44
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:30,302
I won't accept it.

45
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:36,659
Sang-tae, if you must quit,
find me a replacement.

46
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,662
But that person needs to be
a great worker just like you.

47
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,831
I need to like them,
and they need to draw well,

48
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,691
and they need to have
a unique perspective.

49
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,949
I wanted to be really cool
when I let you go.

50
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,667
It's hard for you

51
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,874
to be cool. Let's be honest.

52
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,102
Sometimes, it's not too bad to lie.

53
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,337
No, I need to be honest.

54
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,299
You're way too honest.

55
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,178
Why did you hang my photo

56
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,650
on your mom's tree?

57
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,753
I thought she might want to see you.

58
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,208
Who did you tell her I was?

59
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,503
That you're Sang-tae's best friend

60
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,235
which is something she always longed for.

61
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,250
And that you're also

62
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,112
the woman I love.

63
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,692
I told her the three of us
are a family now

64
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:12,112
and that she shouldn't worry.

65
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,116
I feel like

66
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,663
she might really hate me.

67
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,873
Let's be honest.

68
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,504
You're not exactly likable.

69
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:31,036
Are you kidding me?

70
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,425
Why do you want to be liked by others?

71
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:35,648
Just be good to me.

72
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:42,852
I'm sleepy.

73
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:46,856
I'm sleepy.

74
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,193
I said I'm sleepy.

75
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:53,112
<i>Okay, let's sleep.</i>

76
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,072
-Okay.
-Let's sleep.

77
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:58,075
Okay, let's go.

78
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,494
No, I didn't say "Let's go."
I said, "Let's sleep."

79
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:02,746
You're going to sleep here?

80
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,725
No, let's go. I'll give you a ride.

81
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,411
I already told Gang-tae
that I'm going to sleep here.

82
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:13,185
-Why?
-So they can make up.

83
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,718
They need to make up on their own.

84
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,555
If I get involved,
I'll only end up disturbing them.

85
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,348
They won't be able to reconcile.

86
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:24,393
Jae... Jae-su, you can sleep here, too.

87
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:27,646
And by the way,
I really hope you don't snore.

88
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,941
Get... Get sinus surgery or something.

89
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:32,443
Sang-tae.

90
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,997
When will I ever become
a big brother like you?

91
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,579
You need a sibling.

92
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:47,099
You'll be a big brother
once your parents have another baby.

93
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,586
Gosh, I just want to be
your little brother.

94
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,180
Careful. I'm holding a knife.

95
00:08:58,654 --> 00:08:59,863
I realized

96
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,180
that I forgot to tell you something.

97
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,284
What's that?

98
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:07,051
I'm jobless now.

99
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,335
You quit your job?

100
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:15,825
-Yes.
-Why?

101
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,626
I want to try new things.

102
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:21,443
Don't tell me you're really
thinking of going to school.

103
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:24,134
I'll study for
the national college entrance exam--

104
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,993
No.

105
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,485
If you must, get your degree online.

106
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,345
I don't need your permission.

107
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,562
Why would you study
when you've worked hard all your life?

108
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:32,646
Don't bother.

109
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,593
Don't bother doing anything.
Just stay right by my side

110
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:37,208
like a parasite.

111
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,626
I told you I'm holding a knife.

112
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,032
I take that back.

113
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,366
I didn't mean to say "parasite."

114
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,383
What's your plan? You told me
you're not going to write anymore.

115
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,753
There's nothing I want to write about.

116
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,880
Then what about that story

117
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,162
where those three people
go on a trip in a camping car?

118
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,443
I've been looking forward to that.

119
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,458
Do you want to read it?

120
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:08,599
I want to show it off.

121
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,855
You and Sang-tae worked on it.

122
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:15,814
So I want to show it off to people.

123
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:19,818
Follow me.

124
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,034
Take a look.

125
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:32,956
Sang-tae drew it.

126
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:38,629
It's Moon Gang-tae
wearing a really happy smile on his face.

127
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,965
While you were sleeping,

128
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,259
you apparently smiled like that
saying you like someone.

129
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,429
You must really like her

130
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,306
seeing that you confessed
your feelings for her

131
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,641
even in your dream.

132
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:53,644
Yes.

133
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,734
This doesn't

134
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,614
look like me.

135
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,118
After I saw this drawing,

136
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:12,704
I made some changes to the story.

137
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,457
But I can't tell you the ending.

138
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:16,875
You're

139
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:18,794
going to publish the book?

140
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,380
Well, I'm going to publish this one.

141
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,423
But I don't know about the future.

142
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:31,723
Do you like it?

143
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,726
Yes, I like it.

144
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:40,732
Who do you like better? Me or Sang-tae?

145
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:44,653
The person I like the most

146
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,492
is myself.

147
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,037
I'm home!

148
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,085
-Sang-tae, did you eat?
-Yes.

149
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,589
Darn, that sly fox.

150
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,135
Do you like me more?

151
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:11,221
Check.

152
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:16,059
My gosh, I can't believe
I didn't see that coming.

153
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:18,228
I lost again.

154
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:20,272
What do you want this time?

155
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,568
Sausage? Corn? Chocolate?

156
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,031
It's hard to keep
losing on purpose, isn't it?

157
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,327
You make it way too obvious.

158
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:37,915
You just seemed really down these days.

159
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,417
You pretended to lose all the time

160
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,379
and bought me food
so you could cheer me up?

161
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,881
My goodness.

162
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:48,550
Take this.

163
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,303
What is it?

164
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,850
It's my last prescription for you
as your doctor.

165
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,062
Put them on and walk out of here.

166
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:04,232
Don’t shut your eyes

167
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,611
and pretend like you can't find the exit.

168
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:11,073
Leave with those shoes on,
and don't return until you find the door.

169
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,285
My goodness, what in the world...

170
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:26,380
Do they fit?

171
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,132
They fit perfectly.

172
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,087
Goodness.

173
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,547
I feel so bad for him.

174
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,177
-Byeol, I changed this.
-Dad, it hurts!

175
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,722
-So can you...
-Dad, it hurts! It hurts!

176
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,599
-"Dad"?
-Didn't he say "It hurts"?

177
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,435
I think he said both.

178
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:24,438
Dad, it hurts! It really hurts, Dad!

179
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,692
Fire him right now.

180
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,237
I was going to quit anyway.

181
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,908
-My gosh.
-He just called him "Dad," right?

182
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,411
Then is he Director O's son?
The one he had a bit late?

183
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:42,831
That explains why
he was always so arrogant.

184
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,082
Gosh, that hurts.

185
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:49,254
I thought he'd grow up

186
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:51,631
if I made him work for me,
but he's hopeless.

187
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,717
I'm going to take him with me
when I retire.

188
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,927
So keep that in mind, and have a good day.

189
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:57,679
You come here.

190
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,390
Gosh, you're hurting me!

191
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:01,433
Unbelievable.

192
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,977
He doesn't look like his dad at all.

193
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:07,105
Not all children look like their parents.

194
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:10,942
<i>You quit your part-time job?</i>

195
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,486
Yes.

196
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,447
That means we're all jobless.

197
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,532
We really are alike.

198
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:21,522
By the way, did you guys make up?

199
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,873
It's better to kiss than to fight.

200
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,500
Don't worry, Sang-tae.

201
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,169
We not only kissed,
but we also French kissed.

202
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,187
French... French kissed?

203
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,774
Yes, but that wasn't enough, so we even...

204
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:47,938
Gosh, why do you keep kicking me?

205
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,525
-Did I?
-Yes, you kicked me twice.

206
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,693
Damn it,
my ankle bone hurts like hell now.

207
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:56,724
Sang-tae.

208
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,534
Mun-yeong decided to publish the book
that you guys have been working on.

209
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,327
Really... Really?

210
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,580
You did such an excellent job
on your homework,

211
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,126
so I decided to give you a reward
by publishing the book.

212
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,628
I'm getting a reward.

213
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,338
But I can't give you a camping car.

214
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:20,011
Why... Why not?
You... You signed the contract.

215
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:23,056
"The employer will buy the employee

216
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,350
a walk through van camping car
instead of paying him."

217
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:26,518
That was in the contract.

218
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:28,061
Yes, I know.

219
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,438
But the problem is the sentence
that comes after that.

220
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,107
The sentence that comes after that?

221
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,527
"The employee has a little brother
who doesn't like to move."

222
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:36,486
Exactly.

223
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,739
But that little brother
no longer needs to move.

224
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,409
So you don't need a camping car anymore.

225
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,329
Hey, stop trying to be funny.

226
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,291
I'll just pay you instead. You like money.

227
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,418
Yes... Yes, I like money.

228
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,254
-Sang-tae.
-I... I need money when I'm old.

229
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:56,756
Money... Money isn't everything in life.

230
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,592
But I also need to give pocket money.

231
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:00,218
Then I'll pay you. Do we have a deal?

232
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,553
Yes, we have a deal.

233
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,642
Darn it.

234
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:13,482
When... When are we
going to get back to work?

235
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:15,650
-Right away.
-"Right away"?

236
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,237
You guys really are best friends.

237
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,199
Mun... Mun-yeong, use your spoon
when you eat quail eggs.

238
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,326
Don't be stubborn when things don't work.

239
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,661
You need to learn to try other methods.

240
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,538
You need to stop nagging.

241
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,009
How are you going to take responsibility
for this issue?

242
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,969
When have I ever taken responsibility?

243
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:45,472
Well...

244
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:49,434
You lied and announced
that our company is going to publish

245
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,811
the last book
of <i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.

246
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:55,899
And now, people in this business
think I'm a fraud.

247
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:58,443
My reputation has hit rock bottom.
What are you going to do now?

248
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,361
Pick it back up.

249
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:04,824
If you wanted to use
the manuscript as bait,

250
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,077
you could've just messed
with Suicide Bomber.

251
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,496
Why did you also have to get me involved?

252
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,456
Here.

253
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:13,750
What's this?

254
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,839
MYSTERY CRIME FICTION
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 10</i>

255
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:23,635
Oh, my gosh.

256
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:25,512
<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.

257
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,057
You really had this?

258
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,518
That's the one and only copy.

259
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,272
You can throw it away or publish it.
It's up to you.

260
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,566
If you publish it,

261
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,109
you'll make enough money

262
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,820
to make up for all the money you spent
bribing people because of me.

263
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,283
-Mun-yeong.
-Now, choose.

264
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,159
Choose what?

265
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,248
This is the revised manuscript
of my last book.

266
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,249
This is great.

267
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,900
You can't have both.

268
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,674
You can either publish my mother's book

269
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,594
or mine. The choice is yours.

270
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,325
I'm not going to publish a book
that was written by someone

271
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,577
who gave you so much pain

272
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,246
just so I can make a fortune.

273
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,463
Are you sure you won't regret it?

274
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:44,215
You'd benefit a lot more
from Do Hui-jae's last book

275
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,427
than Ko Mun-yeong's last book.

276
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:53,183
Mun-yeong, I like your books a lot better
than your mother's.

277
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:58,188
Do you want to eat something fancy?
How about some beef?

278
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,899
Beef sounds nice.

279
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,320
You're going to pay, right?

280
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:13,286
Gosh, I'm sick of always
being so constipated.

281
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:17,040
What? Where did they go?

282
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:19,918
Should I clean this up for you?

283
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,504
Yes. Thank you.

284
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,339
My gosh.

285
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,925
That cheap jerk.

286
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,434
My goodness, that's great.

287
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,482
I can't believe Sang-tae is really
going to make his debut as an illustrator.

288
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:43,858
Yes, of course.

289
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,944
We're going to sign a contract with him

290
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,154
and have him work
with other writers as well.

291
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:52,283
Mun-yeong told me
she won't be writing for a while.

292
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:53,785
You have a point.

293
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:58,248
He should work with different writers
to become a better illustrator.

294
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:59,165
Exactly.

295
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,838
My goodness.

296
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:09,759
Sang-in, I'm going to miss you so much
when you move to Seoul.

297
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,679
I got some good rest.

298
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,598
So I should find a new office
and start anew.

299
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:17,767
When is that going to be?

300
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,937
Once I find a new office.

301
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:27,235
So you should enjoy my company
while I'm still around.

302
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,412
-Mr. Lee.
-Hey, you're here.

303
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:40,373
You ignored all my texts and calls,

304
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,250
but you're here dehulling bean sprouts?

305
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,879
Hey, why are you empty-handed?
Where's the manuscript?

306
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,297
What manuscript?

307
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:51,759
<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.
I told you to bring it with you.

308
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,511
<i>"The Murder of the Witch of the West"</i>?

309
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:55,305
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

310
00:21:56,556 --> 00:22:00,518
What are you talking about?
I even sent you a text.

311
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,062
I didn't get a text.
I didn't get anything.

312
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:04,397
Look. I'll show you...

313
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,067
<i>Seung-jae, we hit the jackpot.</i>

314
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,695
<i>I have the copy
for </i>The Murder of the Witch of the West.

315
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:12,822
<i>This is our last hope
and source of income.</i>

316
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:15,742
<i>So make sure you bring
the manuscript on the table.</i>

317
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,077
<i>Don't forget to bring it, okay?
Don't forget!</i>

318
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:26,085
Lee Sang-in, that darn peddler.

319
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:38,848
SEONGJIN DETENTION CENTER

320
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:01,704
You really came.

321
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:06,459
This will be the last time you see me.

322
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,921
How long do you think
they will stay with you?

323
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,633
-We're a family.
-How are they your family?

324
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:30,733
My baby.

325
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:35,446
I love you so much.

326
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,409
You're so precious to me.

327
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,163
I wanted you to live like me.

328
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,749
I didn't want you to be swayed by others.

329
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,419
I wanted you to devour your surroundings
and live as a strong woman.

330
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:52,213
That's not too hard.

331
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:55,133
You just need to follow your instincts.

332
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,594
But why...

333
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:01,055
Why would you hang around
with those jerks--

334
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:01,973
I'm relieved.

335
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,685
What?

336
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,895
I almost turned into a demon like you,

337
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,897
and I'm so relieved that I didn't.

338
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,733
-Ko Mun-yeong!
-I...

339
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:16,529
really feel sorry for you, Mom.

340
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:21,868
The fact that you don't even know
that you're pitiful

341
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,579
makes me pity you even more.

342
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:28,291
You only have an appetite.

343
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,002
But you know nothing about warmth.

344
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:34,714
You won't ever know.

345
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,176
And you're not even interested.

346
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:42,347
That's why

347
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:46,309
we're different.

348
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,979
Unlike you, I've learned

349
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,068
how warm

350
00:24:58,237 --> 00:24:59,238
and nice it feels.

351
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:02,533
"Warmth"?

352
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:09,165
But even so,

353
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,793
don't skip your meals.

354
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:16,130
I'll try my best

355
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,801
to erase you from my memory.

356
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:22,470
You'll never be able to erase me.

357
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:28,351
Never!

358
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:31,521
You will never be able to erase me
from your memory!

359
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:33,147
Never!

360
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:37,985
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

361
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,960
You erased the butterfly.

362
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:57,463
No... No, I didn't erase it.

363
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:00,550
I just... I just painted over it.

364
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,844
You can't tell, right?

365
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:05,722
Now, I just need to draw a new butterfly.

366
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,934
Never! You will never

367
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:13,688
be able to erase me
from your memory! Never!

368
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,115
See?

369
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,452
You can't erase me.

370
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,330
You and I are the same.

371
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,215
Butterfly.

372
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:46,971
You told me that the word "psycho"
comes from the word <i>psyche.</i>

373
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,099
But to us,

374
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:52,852
it's a symbol of cure.

375
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:56,272
A cure that heals our soul.

376
00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:57,982
You should remember that.

377
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,205
<i>You're right.</i>

378
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,041
<i>If you can't erase it,</i>

379
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:20,713
you just need to cover it
with something better.

380
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:22,732
Right?

381
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:26,010
Butterfly is <i>psyche</i>,
and it symbolizes cure.

382
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,722
A butterfly that cures.
It's a kind butterfly.

383
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:31,974
Do... Do you want me to paint one?

384
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:35,186
Do you want to see?
Do you want to see me draw it?

385
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,732
Yes. Draw one that looks nice and pretty.

386
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:42,819
Okay. A nice and pretty butterfly.

387
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,153
It cures.

388
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:54,497
Welcome.

389
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:03,005
Cut the crap.

390
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,094
HIRING PART-TIMER
NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED

391
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,597
I heard you quit.

392
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:15,142
Yes, I'm going to study now.

393
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,727
Goodness.

394
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:18,771
Should I close the shop

395
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:21,315
and study with you as well?

396
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,361
We can both get a better education.

397
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:27,446
Should I give it a shot?

398
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:30,533
-Jae-su.
-Yes?

399
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,078
Do you really want to study for the exam
and go to college?

400
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,959
-No, not at all.
-Exactly.

401
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,421
Don't try to follow what I do.

402
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,756
Do what you really want to do,

403
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:49,176
and go where you want to go.

404
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:50,970
What does that mean?

405
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:54,432
Are you telling me to get lost

406
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,392
because you don't need me anymore?

407
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,770
Are you saying I'm worthless and nuggety?

408
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:00,771
It's "nugatory."

409
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,816
You just pronounced it
like chicken nuggets.

410
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:09,155
Exactly. I'm so angry and upset at you

411
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,532
that I feel like a useless piece
of chicken nugget.

412
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:20,583
Hey, big brother.

413
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:24,712
My big brother, Jae-su.

414
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,881
What's the matter with you?

415
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:29,634
I'll treat you like an older brother now.

416
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:32,929
You're a year older than me.

417
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:34,680
I thought you didn't want a big brother.

418
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:36,599
What's with the sudden change?

419
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:40,311
Now that I think about it,

420
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,523
it's better to have a lot of big brothers.

421
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,654
I was able to hang in there

422
00:29:51,113 --> 00:29:52,573
because you were always there

423
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:57,286
by my side.

424
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,581
You made me laugh,

425
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,876
helped me breathe,

426
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,922
and made me feel less lonely.

427
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,302
Thank you, Jae-su.

428
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:24,480
You punk.

429
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,651
Then you'd better be good to me, okay?

430
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,237
Okay, I'll be good.

431
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:34,865
Call me "big brother."

432
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:36,867
My big brother.

433
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,247
-One more time.
-My big brother, Jae-su.

434
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,218
One more time.

435
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,376
That's enough.

436
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,179
-The box.
-The box...

437
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:50,080
He's sleeping right now.

438
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,754
Here, they're having fun on a picnic.

439
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:58,631
They're... They're in the forest.

440
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:02,651
This... This is <i>psyche</i>.

441
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:04,845
She's having fun with a butterfly.

442
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,847
-Okay, next.
-Okay.

443
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:10,226
This... This is the Box Man.

444
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,854
But... But I need to draw it again. Pass.

445
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,148
And here, she has a frog on her head.

446
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:22,113
Come on.

447
00:31:22,138 --> 00:31:24,823
The eyes of the Emotionless Princess
are too small. Make them bigger.

448
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,742
You... You want them to be bigger?

449
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,762
How... How much?
One centimeter or two centimeters?

450
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,705
Make them half the size of her face.

451
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,892
That... That'll be unrealistic.

452
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,418
She's not the big-eyed frog
from <i>The Boy Frog</i>.

453
00:31:36,502 --> 00:31:38,254
-Have some fruit.
-My gosh.

454
00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:40,756
No. You can't see it.

455
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,716
Leave.
Outsiders are not allowed to be here.

456
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,426
Why am I an outsider?

457
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,845
Yes, you're an outsider.
That's why you should stay outside.

458
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:48,889
Let me stay and watch. I'm so bored.

459
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,641
No, that's out of the question. Get out.

460
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,049
Sang-tae.

461
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:53,930
But...

462
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,473
You're just going to leave me here?

463
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:01,110
What else would I do?

464
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:04,984
Didn't you push me out on purpose?

465
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:07,825
Why would I do that?

466
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,712
-Are you done?
-Yes.

467
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:20,921
-Let me see.
-Here.

468
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,173
-What is this?
-I drew the eyes bigger.

469
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:24,633
It's horrible!

470
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,055
My goodness.

471
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:34,602
<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.
Will you please show up?

472
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:38,063
Hey.

473
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,400
Stop doing such a lousy job
and really look for it, will you?

474
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:47,672
Seung-jae, aren't you going to answer me?

475
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:52,057
Mr. Lee.

476
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:56,290
I thought you promised not to publish
<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.

477
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,961
Of course I'm not going to publish it.

478
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:04,840
But I just want to be prepared
for the future.

479
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:08,218
I'm just going to think of it
like an installment savings account.

480
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,428
That's all there is to it.

481
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:13,349
If this is just for you,
then why must I help you look for it?

482
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:15,517
Hey.

483
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,704
Don't you know whose fault this is?

484
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,357
Had you not left the manuscript
at the coffee shop,

485
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,691
I wouldn't have had to

486
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,152
go through the trash
like a feral cat, you fool.

487
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,654
What? You jerk!

488
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:28,739
What?

489
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:31,179
What did you say? Hey.

490
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,577
Hey, do you not even give a damn anymore?

491
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,329
Right, I quit!

492
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:39,041
I hope you find <i>The Murder of the Witch
of the West</i> and have a good life!

493
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,754
-Hey, Seung-jae!
-What? You jerk!

494
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:00,062
Gosh, what is this smell?

495
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:04,733
Seung-jae,
doesn't something smell funky in here?

496
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,444
What?

497
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:12,741
It's not me.
I took a shower as soon as I got home.

498
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,159
I see.

499
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:17,704
Gosh, it really stinks in here.

500
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,416
Jeez. I'll keep the door open.

501
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,920
SANG-IN
JU-RI, ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW?

502
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:39,351
I thought it'd be too boring
to drink solo.

503
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:47,401
I guess the stench from you
followed Seung-jae all the way to my room.

504
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:48,944
Oh, no. Do I still stink?

505
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:50,696
I washed up so I thought it'd be okay.

506
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,491
I'm sure I'll get used to the smell
in a few minutes.

507
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:55,993
All right.

508
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:03,542
Seung-jae is still really mad at me,
isn't she?

509
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,252
Did you pick on her again?

510
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,129
Don't be so mean to that kid.

511
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:09,965
What? "Kid"?

512
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:14,136
Seung-jae is at least
six years older than you.

513
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,053
What?

514
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,057
But she always uses honorifics
when she's talking to me.

515
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:21,393
Oh, that?

516
00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:24,438
She likes to act young and slow-witted

517
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:26,273
because she believes

518
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,776
that it's a surefire way
to an easy, cushy life.

519
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,403
When I think about that,
I do feel bad for her, but... Gosh.

520
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:33,113
How sly.

521
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:36,450
So she's actually older than me?

522
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,327
Are you sure?

523
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,287
Yes, she is older than you. My goodness.

524
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:44,333
You work at a psychiatric hospital.

525
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,544
I can't believe
you're such a bad judge of character.

526
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:50,422
I should teach you a thing or two.

527
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,966
When I see someone, I can tell
what kind of person he or she is.

528
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:10,651
God, I'm about to puke.

529
00:36:20,536 --> 00:36:23,664
Lee Sang-in, this is your punishment
for picking on me.

530
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,378
I'll let him stress out for a month
and then return it to him.

531

STORY BY KO MUN-YEONG
ILLUSTRATIONS BY MOON SANG-TAE

533
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:50,792
Mun-yeong! Your new book is finally out!

534
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:54,212
Mr. Moon Sang-tae!
The book has been published.

535
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:58,884
<i>Finding the Real Face.</i>

536
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:02,512
I've got the first edition here,
still hot off the press.

537
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:05,557
You've waited so long for this, Mr. Moon.

538
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,559
My gosh, thank you.

Moon Sang-tae!

541
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:15,609
That's my name, Moon Sang-tae.

542
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:17,736
-Are you excited?
-Yes, of course.

543
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:20,113
I'm super excited and happy right now.

544
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,324
Look, there's a photo of me right here.
My gosh!

545
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:24,451
Congratulations on your debut, Mr. Moon!

546
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,621
-My gosh. I worked on this book,
-Oh, my.

547
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,790
<i>Finding the Real Face.</i>

548
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,583
Sang-tae, where are you going? Sang-tae!

549
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:35,462
Hey, I'm coming too. Wait up!

550
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,592
Jeez, I keep getting a bad feeling.

551
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:42,719
I don't think this book will do well.

552
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:46,306
-Why do you say that?
-This isn't her usual writing style.

553
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,433
Mun-yeong has changed,
and so has her writing style.

554
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,562
If only I'd managed to get my hands
on <i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>,

555
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,439
I wouldn't be this worried
and anxious now.

556
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,859
Don't worry too much, Mr. Lee.

557
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:02,364
You know that your gut feelings
have always been wrong.

558
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:04,408
Jeez, you little...

559
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:11,498
Mom. Mom!

560
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,167
Mom.

561
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:17,295
Do you see this, Mom? This right here.

562
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,842
It's my name, Mom. "Moon Sang-tae."

563
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,721
My name... My name is Moon Sang-tae, Mom.

564
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:28,932
I'm an illustrator now.
A professional illustrator.

565
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:32,144
Do you want to see my illustrations, Mom?

566
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,814
Look, I drew all of these. This one too.

567
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:39,151
And I can even draw
facial expressions now.

568
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,069
-Sang-tae.
-Yes.

569
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,741
Mom is probably very curious
as to what the book is about.

570
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:47,534
-Why don't you read it to her?
-Sure!

571
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,870
I'm very good at narrating stories.

572
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:53,582
I can use different voices for Ddochi,
Douner, and Dooly. You know that, right?

573
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:54,499
Of course, I know.

574
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,003
Mom, I'll read the book out loud to you!

575
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:01,715

578
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:09,139
I'll read you the story, Mom.
It'll be fun.

579
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:10,807
"<i>Finding the Real Face.</i>

580
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:15,520
Once upon a time
in a castle in the deep forest,

581
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:19,608
there lived three people
who had their real faces stolen

582
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:22,444
by the Shadow Witch.

583
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:26,656
The boy wore a mask with an awkward smile.

584
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,659
Then there was the princess
who was loud but all empty inside,

585
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:33,371
and there was also a man
who was trapped inside a box.

586
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,917
They couldn't make any facial expressions
because their faces were stolen from them.

587
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,127
They had no way of understanding
each other's feelings,

588
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:42,547
so they always misunderstood one another
and fought."

589
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,552
My eyes are welling up with tears
even though I'm so happy,

590
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:48,929
my brother and sister.

591
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:53,225
Mom, don't the illustrations look so good?

592

00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:02,359
-You did an excellent job.
-I know. "Moon Sang-tae," Mom.

595
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:05,403
I did a great job, Mom!

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,336
Seung-jae, I think we need more chairs.

599
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:24,339
Oh, the hospital staff said
they'll just stand.

600
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:28,844
No, I mean...
There are no seats for the press.

601
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:31,680
Oh, I sent out the press release,

602
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:34,724
but because of the lie we told
about <i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>,

603
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:36,810
they all think we're lying again.

604
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,437
Only one reporter will be attending.

605
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:42,274
Which reporter?

606
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:47,946
Reporter Yoo.

607
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:50,156
-Who?
-Me.

608
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:52,033
Reporter Yoo Seung-jae.

609
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:59,124
I'm going to record the entire event
and upload it to my channel.

610
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:05,672
I thought you were a total quack,

611
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:08,341
but you are a competent doctor after all.

612
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:10,051
You helped Sang-tae

613
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:14,180
spread his wings and fly
like those butterflies.

614
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:18,518
Gosh, I didn't do anything.
He did it all on his own.

615
00:42:21,688 --> 00:42:24,149
By the way, you look nice today.

616
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:28,069
What's with that cheesy comment?

617
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,575
Can I stop by your place for some food
from time to time?

618
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,577
I used to do that often, you know.

619
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,621
I'd peek over the wall and go,

620
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:42,250
"Sun-deok! Let's hang out!"

621
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,794
What's with you? Have you lost your mind?

622
00:42:45,003 --> 00:42:46,421
Are you really going senile or what?

623
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:48,340
Gosh, seriously...

624
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,467
Director O.

625
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,597
My gosh, look who's here.

626
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,228
That scarf is beautiful.

627
00:43:04,522 --> 00:43:06,858
I thought my neck would look too bare
without it.

628
00:43:07,442 --> 00:43:10,779
I splurged and bought it on sale
at the department store

629
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,907
because I heard today is an important day.

630
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,452
Great purchase. It looks amazing on you.

631
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:24,376
Oh, right. Please visit my restaurant
when you have some time.

632
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:26,378
I'll make delicious braised fish for you.

All right, the book launch party
will begin shortly.

635
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,183
Let's all head over to the therapy room.

636
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:41,851
Let's go.

637
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:43,937
-Shall we?
-Let's head back inside.

638
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,151
Jeong-tae!

639
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:51,444
Jeong-tae!

640
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,737
A-reum!

641
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,162
-How have you been?
-What about you?

642
00:44:01,246 --> 00:44:02,247
I've been well.

643
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,082
I missed you.

644
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,795
By the way, I don't see
that handsome caregiver anywhere.

645
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,672
Oh, he'll be here.

646
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:18,221
I guess his son
still hasn't learned his lesson.

647
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,848
Gosh, he's handsome.

648
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,309
Why am I so nervous?

649
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,359
Seung-jae.

650
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:34,112
Jae-su.

651
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:50,336
Excuse me.

652
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:52,464
Gi-do.

653
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,800
Ju-ri, it's been so long!
How have you been?

654
00:44:55,884 --> 00:44:58,386
Oh, my. He's totally my type.

655
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,182
You look like a different person now.

656
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:04,684
Are you preparing
for the civil service exam?

657
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,146
Yes. As you know, my dad is no longer
an assemblyman because of me.

658
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:10,774
It's okay. You can laugh.

659
00:45:10,857 --> 00:45:14,944
So I'm trying to follow suit
and work for the government.

660
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:17,113
Gosh, that's why I'm racking my brain
to study hard.

661
00:45:17,697 --> 00:45:18,531
I'm proud of you.

662
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:23,328
But where's my handsome Gang-tae
and that fiery writer?

663
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:25,872
I should narrate the story
because I wrote it.

664
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:27,290
Why would you butt in?

665
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:30,710
Ko Mun-yeong,
I drew all the illustrations,

666
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,755
which means half of the book is mine.
And I'm also good at narrating stories.

667
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,842
-Are you an attention seeker?
-What? What's that?

668
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:41,471
A seeker? Do they look for things?
What is that?

669
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,973
Jeez. Enough, both of you.

670
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:45,600
We'll be late. Let's go.

671
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:47,977
Anyhow, I can't let you
read from the book. Stay out of it.

672
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,980
No. We worked on it together,
so it's only fair that I do it with you.

673
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,649
-Just stay out of it.
-I don't want to.

674
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:54,109
-Just stay out of it!
-No!

675
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,027
If you keep fighting,
neither of you can do it.

676
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:57,362
I'll narrate the entire book.

677
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,699
-Stay out of it.
-No way.

678
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:03,618
-Just do as I say.
-I don't want to.

679
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:05,453
BOOK LAUNCH
<i>FINDING THE REAL FACE</i>

680
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:07,580
WITH WRITER KO MUN-YEONG
AND ILLUSTRATOR MOON SANG-TAE

681
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:08,748
All right.

682
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:12,794
I'd like to thank you all
for attending this meaningful event

683
00:46:13,378 --> 00:46:16,923
that signals the children's book publisher
SangSangESang's new beginning.

684
00:46:17,006 --> 00:46:22,137
And I'd also like to extend
my sincere gratitude to Director O Ji-wang

685
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,308
and OK Psychiatric Hospital's staff
for preparing this venue.

686
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:28,935
Let's get started right away.

687
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:32,021
The children's book author,
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong,

688
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:36,109
and the illustrator, Mr. Moon Sang-tae,
will read their hot new release,

689
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:40,488
<i>Finding The Real Face,</i>

690
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:43,491
which was born
out of their fantastic collaboration.

691
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:53,793
<i>FINDING THE REAL FACE</i>

692
00:46:56,796 --> 00:47:00,925
"Once upon a time
in a castle in the deep forest,

693
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:05,471
there lived three people
who had their real faces stolen

694
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:09,017
by the Shadow Witch."

695
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:15,773
"The Box Man spoke.

696
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:18,985
'If we want to stop fighting
and find happiness,

697
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:22,238
we must retrieve our stolen faces.'"

698
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:25,783
"So they hopped in their camping car

699
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:29,120
and began their journey
to find their faces.

700
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:32,207
<i>Then one day, they ran into a mother fox</i>

701
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:35,710
<i>who was bawling, curled up on the snow."</i>

702
00:47:36,878 --> 00:47:39,505
<i>"The Masked Boy asked the mother fox.</i>

703
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:42,592
<i>'Ma'am, why do you keep crying?'"</i>

704
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:45,887
"'Oh, I came out here to find some food

705
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,223
but dropped my baby
whom I was carrying on my back

706
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:51,434
<i>somewhere in the snow.'"</i>

707
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:54,103
<i>"The mother fox's tears had run dry.</i>

708
00:47:54,812 --> 00:47:56,231
<i>She wailed while beating her chest.</i>

709
00:47:56,856 --> 00:48:00,735
<i>When the Masked Boy saw that,
warm tears started gushing from his eyes."</i>

710
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:06,115
<i>"Then the snow began to melt quickly,</i>

711
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:11,621
and the baby fox, who was frozen
under the snow, soon appeared."

712
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:16,334
"The three of them resumed their journey.

713
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:18,461
Soon, they ran into a clown

714
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:21,923
who was dancing naked
in a field of thorny flowers.

715
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:25,468
<i>The Emotionless Princess asked,</i>

716
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,554
<i>'Why are you dancing with all your might,</i>

717
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,473
<i>knowing you'll be pricked by the thorns?'</i>

718
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:34,936
'I feel that this is the only way
to make people look at me.

719
00:48:37,188 --> 00:48:39,565
But it hurts,

720
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:41,609
and no one's looking at me.' He answered.

721
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:46,197
<i>Then the Emotionless Princess
walked into the field of thorny flowers</i>

722
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:50,451
<i>and started dancing with the clown.</i>

723
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,414
<i>'I'm an empty can, so I won't be hurt
even if I get pricked by the thorns.'</i>

724
00:48:55,456 --> 00:48:59,377
<i>When she began hopping and dancing,</i>

725
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:03,631
<i>loud clanking noises echoed</i>

726
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:06,384
<i>from her empty torso.</i>

727
00:49:07,135 --> 00:49:09,887
<i>And upon hearing those sounds,
people began to flock to where they were.</i>

728
00:49:10,138 --> 00:49:11,889
<i>The crowd watched their dance</i>

729
00:49:11,973 --> 00:49:13,933
and applauded them.

730
00:49:15,643 --> 00:49:16,894
-That moment--"
-"That moment..."

731
00:49:20,606 --> 00:49:21,899
-"That moment--"
-"That moment--"

732
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,070
-"That moment--"
-"That moment--"

733
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,488
"That moment..."

734
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:30,742
-"That--"
-"That moment..."

735
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:34,704
-Damn it. It's my turn.
-No, it's my turn. Look, this part.

736
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:37,582
-It's my turn.
-Look! "Mun-yeong" is written right here.

737
00:49:37,665 --> 00:49:40,126
-"Mun-yeong."
-No, I see my name. Why steal my part?

738
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,754
-This is my part.
-Can one of you just continue?

739
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:45,006
Just stop.
If you want to read, do it properly.

740
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:46,632
Why do you keep stopping between words?

741
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:48,009
This is better than being boring.

742
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:49,927
That man yawned when you were reading it.

743
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:51,012
-Your part was boring.
-Damn it.

744
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:52,930
Just do as I say and don't butt in!

745
00:49:53,014 --> 00:49:55,725
"Damn" is a bad word. It's a swear word.

746
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:58,311
Are you swearing at me?
At your big brother?

747
00:49:58,394 --> 00:49:59,812
Are you going to swear at me?

748
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,731
-This is all your fault.
-Are you yelling at me?

749
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:03,649
You said, "Damn it" while I was reading.

750
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,610
Forget it. I'm out.
You can do it by yourself.

751
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:07,111
Are you yelling at me right now?

752
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:09,280
-Why are you angry?
-They're really something.

753
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:11,032
-Hey! Look who's talking.
-What?

754
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:12,742
-Why are you all riled up?
-What about you?

755
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:13,951
-Why are you angry?
-You're...

756
00:50:14,035 --> 00:50:16,287
-Quiet down, both of you!
-I quit. I'm out.

757
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:19,040
-Why are you yelling at me?
-This is all your fault.

758
00:50:19,123 --> 00:50:21,167
-I told you!
-You ruined everything!

759
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,794
-You ruined everything.
-It's your fault!

760
00:50:22,877 --> 00:50:24,462
-You ruined it all.
-Look who's talking!

761
00:50:24,545 --> 00:50:26,047
-I'm out.
-What's your problem?

762
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,591
-I don't want to do this.
-I told you I wanted to do this alone!

763
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:37,825
Oh, dear. They won't grow up anytime soon.

764
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,537
I thought you were off today.

765
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:45,416
Yes, I just wanted to take
a quick look around before I head home.

766
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,127
Don't be too harsh on them.

767
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,422
They argue like that because
they still have a lot of growing up to do.

768
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:56,010
Here.

769
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,307
Sang-tae

770
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:05,353
put one aside for you,
saying that you, of all people,

771
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:07,021
shouldn't have to buy the book.

772
00:51:07,104 --> 00:51:09,148
My gosh, how sweet.

773
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:13,653
Then I guess I don't have to buy
100 copies of the book.

774
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,779
Right.

775
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,240
Open it.

776
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,750
<i>Dear my fake, real mom.</i>

777
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:31,671
<i>Thank you for all the delicious meals.</i>

778
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:34,131
<i>I want to eat the food
that you make every day.</i>

779
00:51:34,215 --> 00:51:37,093
<i>I really like you, Ms. Kang.</i>

780
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:39,470
<i>Here's a heart for you.</i>

781
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,557
<i>Six hearts.</i>

782
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:46,269
"My fake, real mom"?
What on earth does that mean?

783
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:47,770
Well...

784
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:52,191
You're not our real mom,
but he likes you as much as her?

785
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,193
Something like that, I guess.

786
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:58,781
Oh, my. All the cooking I did for you guys
has paid off, I suppose.

787
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:03,744
Well...

788
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:08,249
May I hug you?

789
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:11,877
Goodness, you don't have to ask.

790
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:20,678
Thank you.

791
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:23,681
I wish you all the best.

792
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:51,292
It's okay.

793
00:52:52,293 --> 00:52:55,171
No one else will know except for
the people who were there today.

794
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:02,595
<i>-I'm done. I'm out.
-Go! Leave!</i>

795
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:05,097
<i>My gosh, Ko Mun-yeong
is obviously no match for him.</i>

796
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,807
<i>This is funnier than</i> Comedy Big League.

797
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:09,560
<i>The Emotionless Princess
versus the Box Man. Who will win?</i>

798
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:14,398
This might actually work to your advantage
in terms of marketing.

799
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:18,152
Do you really think so?

800
00:53:19,737 --> 00:53:20,821
Yes, of course.

801
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,078
Gosh. You're such a bad liar, Ju-ri.

802
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:34,794
Mr. Lee.

803
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:38,005
You may fall,

804
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,217
but I know that you'll never give up

805
00:53:42,635 --> 00:53:44,136
because you're a very strong person.

806
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:53,479
I guess I won't get to see you often

807
00:53:53,562 --> 00:53:55,564
now that you're moving back to Seoul
to start afresh.

808
00:53:57,358 --> 00:53:58,859
I am starting afresh,

809
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:01,987
but I'm not moving back to Seoul.

810
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,950
I got an office space in Seongjin City.

811
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:07,618
What?

812
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:11,372
Rent is very expensive in Seoul.
Why would I move back there?

813
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:17,586
And you're here too.

814
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,879
How beautiful.

815
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:03,591
I mean, the sea.

816
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:09,013
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

817
00:55:09,972 --> 00:55:12,558
-No. I'm sorry, Mun-yeong.
-Goodness.

818
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:14,393
-All right.
-I'm sorry. I apologize.

819
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,353
-So we're good now, right?
-Yes!

820
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:19,648
Gang-tae, we're sorry.

821
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,567
-Let go.
-Hey!

822
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,861
The troublemaker trio!

823
00:55:25,863 --> 00:55:27,740
I have something for you guys.

824
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,042
Sang-tae, I'm paying you for your mural.

825
00:55:39,543 --> 00:55:42,338
-Do you like it?
-Yes. My gosh!

826
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:44,548
Sir, this is too much.

827
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,717
Director O Ji-wang, you're...

828
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:51,180
You're like the wizard of Oji-gun.
How did you think of this?

829
00:55:51,263 --> 00:55:53,057
My, I want this.

830
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,683
Don't even. It's mine.

831
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,268
It's mine, Mun-yeong. It's all mine.

832
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:58,562
I want a ride too!

833
00:56:02,274 --> 00:56:06,320
Sir, I know you got this in return
for the mural, but it's too much.

834
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:07,988
Just the gesture is enough.

835
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:09,657
But I want to give you this.

836
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:13,160
All three of you went through a lot
because of what happened.

837
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,080
I hired someone I should've never hired.

838
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:21,085
I owe you an apology for that as well,
so just accept it and let's call it even.

839
00:56:21,168 --> 00:56:23,003
That will make me feel better.

840
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:26,465
But accepting this doesn’t feel right.

841
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,511
Then just keep your word and hang out
with me when you have some free time.

842
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:33,931
Will do.

843
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:37,184
You should

844
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,062
go on a long trip in that camping car.

845
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,690
There are many things you can learn
on the road.

846
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,529
But I must say, it'll be exhausting
to look after those two.

847
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,573
Right, but I think

848
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:53,784
it'll be fun.

849
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:59,582
<i>I want to move
to the scariest neighborhood.</i>

850
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:01,625
Come on. Let's go.

851
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:06,046
You always wanted the three of us
to go on a trip together

852
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,965
in a camping car.

853
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:11,176
Isn't that why you drew this?

854
00:57:12,344 --> 00:57:15,389
But we no longer need to run away
from the butterfly,

855
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:18,517
so why should we go somewhere far away
in that camping car?

856
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:20,644
I don't want to go.

857
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,273
No, we're not running away.

858
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:26,483
We're going on a trip.

859
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,819
What's the difference?

860
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,113
I don't want to go.

861
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,408
Well, when you run away,

862
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:38,871
you go to a faraway place to never return.

863
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:41,248
But a trip

864
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:45,169
is going somewhere far with
the intention of returning eventually.

865
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:49,214
Why leave
if you're going to return eventually?

866
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:50,758
I don't want to go.

867
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,427
Then why eat
if you're going to poop it all out anyway?

868
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:04,313
You said you've run out stories
that you want to write about.

869
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,108
We should go on a trip
so that you can find some inspiration.

870
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:11,445
I heard writers often get ideas

871
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,781
for their next books while traveling.

872
00:58:14,406 --> 00:58:17,076
We'll eat, sleep, and drive. On repeat.

873
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:21,580
Do you really think doing that
over and over in that small camping car

874
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,415
will help me find inspiration
out of thin air?

875
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,668
You don't know that

876
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:27,878
until we actually begin our trip.

877
00:58:28,879 --> 00:58:30,297
You can try to find some inspiration

878
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,508
while I nurture my mind and study.

879
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:34,260
And Sang-tae will work on his drawings.

880
00:58:34,593 --> 00:58:35,427
Great plan, right?

881
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:37,179
I'm not sure.

882
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:38,097
Hey.

883
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:41,976
You said you wanted
to go on a long trip with me.

884
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,061
Maybe not a long trip.

885
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:45,980
If you really want to go,
let's do a day trip.

886
00:58:46,063 --> 00:58:47,648
"A day trip"? Are you kidding me?

887
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:50,109
I just want to hit the road
with no destination in mind

888
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:53,904
and keep on driving freely
without worrying about the future.

889
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,699
Whether it takes a month or half a year,

890
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:58,951
we'll keep on driving
until we want to stop--

891
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:00,327
Calm down.

892
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:02,413
Don't get so worked up.

893
00:59:03,205 --> 00:59:06,000
Try counting to three
when you can't control yourself.

894
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,627
It'll help you calm down.

895
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:19,888
I mean...

896
00:59:21,515 --> 00:59:23,350
How could they do this to me?

897
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:27,980
I've been suppressing myself
all these years

898
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:29,857
and just enduring it all.

899
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,693
They obviously know that,

900
00:59:32,776 --> 00:59:34,361
so how could they do this to me?

901
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,072
Unbelievable. Right, Jae-su?

902
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:37,990
Yes, you're right.

903
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:39,742
My goodness.

904
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:42,995
I wondered why you offered
to buy us drinks.

905
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:45,289
You obviously needed someone to vent to.

906
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,126
Gosh, look at you sulking
over something so little.

907
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:51,879
Hey, Gang-tae. How have you been
putting up with everything all along?

908
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:56,133
They're publishing a fairy tale together

909
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,386
so I have been ostracized.

910
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,348
I've become an outcast.

911
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:05,350
But...

912
01:00:07,227 --> 01:00:09,188
I didn't complain at all

913
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,191
and looked after them
throughout the entire process.

914
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,362
That's right. If it weren't
for all your help, Gang-tae...

915
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:18,947
Gosh, that book wouldn't even exist today.

916
01:00:19,031 --> 01:00:20,491
-Right?
-Yes.

917
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:22,117
-Right?
-Yes, sure thing.

918
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:24,119
I mean, is that too much to ask?

919
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,537
Is it?

920
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:27,581
It's not like
I want to go to the Serengeti.

921
01:00:27,664 --> 01:00:29,541
I can't go there
because I don't have a passport.

922
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,086
You know? It's not like
I want to go to outer space...

923
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,296
Honestly...

924
01:00:36,423 --> 01:00:40,677
I just wanted the three of us
to go on a trip in that camping car.

925
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:44,056
Just driving through
the mountains and fields, you know?

926
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,851
I said, "Let's just go with the flow
and see where it takes us."

927
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:51,522
And they can't even do that for me?

928
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:56,777
You're absolutely right! Gang-tae,
you've been putting up with so much.

929
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,447
Sang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong can't do that
to you. They owe you an apology!

930
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,241
My gosh, I'm really sorry.

931
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:06,203
Gang-tae, I sincerely apologize
on their behalf.

932
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:11,166
Really?

933
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,795
Yes, of course.

934
01:01:15,629 --> 01:01:16,672
Do you really think so?

935
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:17,714
No doubt.

936
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:20,300
You too?

937
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:23,178
Yes, of course.

938
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,725
This is all fake. It's all a lie.

939
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:29,935
It's all fake.

940
01:01:30,894 --> 01:01:31,895
Gosh!

941
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:38,986
-Here.
-He's dead-drunk.

942
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,079
Jeez, where have you been?

943
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:51,999
Hey, do you know what time it is now?

944
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:55,460
What's going on? Did you drink?

945
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:57,588
He reeks of alcohol.
He's obviously been drinking.

946
01:01:58,255 --> 01:01:59,089
Hey.

947
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,634
What's with the suitcases?
Are you guys going somewhere?

948
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:05,554
What do you think?
You said we should go on a long trip.

949
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:08,599
We put on an act yesterday
to surprise you when you got home.

950
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:10,642
You got all mad at us and stormed out.

951
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:11,810
And you even drank?

952
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,772
Put this on. It's our family T-shirt.

953
01:02:15,856 --> 01:02:18,442
It's so cute. Look at this.
It's super cute.

954
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:33,415
Why fool me
when you were going to come anyway?

955
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:37,920
You two, seriously...

956
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:42,466
I'll go put this on.

957
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,136
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

958
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,972
By the way, why did you drink so much?

959
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,975
-I don't know.
-Did you drink alone?

960
01:03:05,113 --> 01:03:06,907
What the heck. Poor me.

961
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,536
You pestered us about this trip,

962
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,872
and look at you all hungover now.
What a great way to start a trip.

963
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:19,628
Are you okay, Gang-tae?
Do you have a headache?

964
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:21,296
Do you feel like throwing up?

965
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,174
-No. I'm okay, Sang-tae.
-You're okay?

966
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:27,552
Whatever. You always say that you're okay.

967
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:28,804
You're obviously not okay now.

968
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:32,683
Ko Mun-yeong, it's not nice to get angry
at someone who's not feeling well.

969
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:35,143
Why are you getting irritated?

970
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:37,271
What? Are you lecturing me right now?

971
01:03:37,354 --> 01:03:39,606
He's the one who's in the wrong.
Why give me this bullshit?

972
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:43,902
"Bullshit"?

973
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,989
This is my first time hearing that word.

974
01:03:47,072 --> 01:03:48,532
That's a swear word, right?

975
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:50,367
Did you swear at me just now?

976
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,495
Did you? Then I should teach you a lesson.
Get a taste of this.

977
01:03:53,578 --> 01:03:55,205
-Let go!
-Get a taste of this!

978
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,707
-Gosh!
-Stop swearing, will you?

979
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,167
He started it.
Why are you giving me this bullshit?

980
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:01,420
-Hey, you said that again!
-Jeez.

981
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:03,088
-<i>Stop it!</i>
-<i>Shit!</i>

982
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:04,756
-<i>What? "Shit"?</i>
-<i>It hurts!</i>

983
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,674
-<i>"Shit"?</i>
-<i>Gosh!</i>

984
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:19,563
The noodles will get soggy.
Hurry up and eat.

985
01:04:20,188 --> 01:04:21,189
No, thanks.

986
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,274
Have some.

987
01:04:23,233 --> 01:04:25,527
If you waste food, you get punished.

988
01:04:27,654 --> 01:04:30,449
-Let's just share this.
-Okay, I'll split this in half.

989
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:40,917
"Gosh, this wasn't the camping road trip
I had dreamed of."

990
01:04:42,419 --> 01:04:43,670
Are you getting a reality check?

991
01:04:44,838 --> 01:04:47,632
"A reality check"? What's that?

992
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,634
Realizing your reality.

993
01:04:51,553 --> 01:04:53,138
It's like waking up from a vain dream.

994
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,223
Oh, I see.

995
01:04:58,226 --> 01:05:01,188
Gosh, I need a nap.

996
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:02,731
Wake me up around dinnertime.

997
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:06,943
You need to learn some slang words.

998
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:10,155
I am trying.
You need to learn more manners.

999
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,658
Do you know what "IA" means?

1000
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:14,409
Yes, an iced Americano coffee.

1001
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:15,660
Then what's "HA"?

1002
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:17,329
A hot iced Americano coffee.

1003
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:20,248
-Whatever.
-"IA" is an iced Americano coffee and...

1004
01:07:36,676 --> 01:07:37,636
You're not going to bed?

1005
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:40,263
I can't fall asleep.

1006
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:47,771
I'm sorry.

1007
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:52,150
For what?

1008
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,069
For hurting you twice

1009
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:56,947
physically.

1010
01:08:00,408 --> 01:08:01,409
I really hope

1011
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:07,499
you'll never be hurt again.

1012
01:08:17,842 --> 01:08:18,677
And...

1013
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,137
thanks.

1014
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,351
For bringing me

1015
01:08:28,144 --> 01:08:29,271
on this trip.

1016
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:35,193
What's gotten into you?
This is so unlike you.

1017
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:47,872
I love you,

1018
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:50,125
Moon Gang-tae.

1019
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:55,714
I'm not

1020
01:08:56,923 --> 01:08:58,383
pretending.

1021
01:09:00,343 --> 01:09:01,386
I love you for real.

1022
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:05,056
I really mean it.

1023
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,488
Sang-tae.

1024
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:04,032
Let's go to Namhae today.

1025
01:10:04,115 --> 01:10:06,868
Gang-tae, Moon Gang-tae.

1026
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:07,952
Yes.

1027
01:10:08,328 --> 01:10:09,704
Are you having a good time?

1028
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:12,749
Yes, I'm having a blast.

1029
01:10:12,832 --> 01:10:15,502
Do you want to keep on driving
in the camping car?

1030
01:10:16,586 --> 01:10:17,420
Yes.

1031
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,255
Until... Until when?

1032
01:10:20,256 --> 01:10:23,218
Well... Until we get tired of it, I guess?

1033
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,762
I see.

1034
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:29,349
Then... Then go with Mun-yeong.

1035
01:10:29,432 --> 01:10:33,353
I want... I want to go somewhere else.

1036
01:10:37,273 --> 01:10:40,110
Why? Are you not enjoying the trip?

1037
01:10:40,193 --> 01:10:44,072
I am. I'm having so much fun.
I'm having a great time too,

1038
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:46,658
but I...

1039
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,578
I want to work.

1040
01:10:52,205 --> 01:10:53,957
I want to draw illustrations

1041
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:58,169
and make children's books.
That's more fun for me.

1042
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:02,340
I see.

1043
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:09,723
All right, then. Let's head back home.

1044
01:11:10,306 --> 01:11:13,226
No, you can keep playing.

1045
01:11:13,309 --> 01:11:16,563
I want to work.

1046
01:11:16,646 --> 01:11:21,067
They said someone will be here soon
to pick me up.

1047
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:24,028
All right, let's get going.

1048
01:11:24,612 --> 01:11:25,989
Ko Mun-yeong!

1049
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,700
-Mun-yeong.
-Yes.

1050
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:33,246
Another children's book author is in love
with my illustrations

1051
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:36,583
and wants to work with me.

1052
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:40,879
They said their story
needs my illustrations.

1053
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,507
-Sang-tae.
-Someone

1054
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:48,428
needs me.

1055
01:11:49,512 --> 01:11:51,222
I'm needed.

1056
01:11:53,808 --> 01:11:57,771
Sang-tae, I also need your illustrations.

1057
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:01,941
Sang-tae.

1058
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,363
Will you be okay

1059
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:09,741
without me?

1060
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:13,203
Won't you

1061
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:16,790
need me?

1062
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,834
Moon Gang-tae

1063
01:12:20,877 --> 01:12:22,212
belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1064
01:12:26,883 --> 01:12:29,594
I don't belong to Sang-tae!

1065
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:31,262
I belong to myself!

1066
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:34,724
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

1067

Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1068
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:47,112
You belong to yourself,
and I belong to myself.

1069
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,739
You belong to yourself,
and I belong to myself.

1070
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,955
Right.

1071
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,126
I belong to myself.

1072
01:13:04,587 --> 01:13:05,797
I don't belong to you.

1073
01:13:06,756 --> 01:13:07,966
Moon Gang-tae

1074
01:13:09,509 --> 01:13:10,635
belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1075

Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1076
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:19,060
Hold on.

1077
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:23,189
Gang-tae.

1078
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:26,818
Don't cry, Gang-tae.

1079
01:13:29,612 --> 01:13:30,613
Gang-tae.

1080
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,327
Thank... Thank you.

1081
01:13:37,257 --> 01:13:38,257
Gang-tae.

1082
01:13:39,508 --> 01:13:41,718
Thanks.

1083
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:44,919
Thank you, Sang-tae.

1084
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:51,551
I'm grateful

1085
01:13:54,178 --> 01:13:55,513
that you're my big brother.

1086
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,314

-Hello.
-Hello.

1091

-I can take your bag.
-Thank you.

1092

All right.

1115
01:16:14,902 --> 01:16:19,240
<i>"That moment, the Masked Boy's voice
reached him from inside the tunnel."</i>

1116
01:16:19,782 --> 01:16:22,577
<i>"'Mister, don't worry about us.
Just run far away.</i>

1117
01:16:23,077 --> 01:16:24,620
<i>The Shadow Witch will return soon.'"</i>

1118
01:16:25,538 --> 01:16:28,708
<i>"However, the Box Man
mustered up the courage</i>

1119
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:32,712
<i>to take the box off his head.
Then he went inside the tunnel</i>

1120
01:16:32,795 --> 01:16:35,882
<i>and saved the Masked Boy
and the Emotionless Princess.</i>

1121
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:39,635
<i>Upon getting out of the dark tunnel,
the two of them </i>

1122
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:43,931
<i>saw the man's face covered
with dirt and grime instead of the box</i>

1123
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:45,767
<i>and burst out laughing.</i>

1124
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:49,270
<i>They laughed and giggled.</i>

1125
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:52,065
<i>While laughing uncontrollably,</i>

1126
01:16:52,148 --> 01:16:55,360
<i>the Masked Boy's mask suddenly fell off."</i>

1127
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,364
<i>"The can surrounding
the Emotionless Princess' torso</i>

1128
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:01,407
<i>also fell off and made a clanking noise."</i>

1129
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,742
I like her.

1130
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:06,454
<i>"The Box Man, now out of his box,
said this when he saw</i>

1131

while laughing."</i>

1132
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:10,750
"Happy."

1133
01:17:13,753 --> 01:17:16,047
He's happy.

1134
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:19,926
<i>I'm happy.</i>

1135
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:34,107
<i>"What the Shadow Witch had stolen
from them</i>

1136
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,569
<i>was not their true faces</i>

1137
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:43,533
<i>but their courage to find happiness."</i>

1138
01:18:06,461 --> 01:18:07,706
Bye!

1139
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,645
-Here.
-I got it.

1140
01:18:16,223 --> 01:18:19,375
Oh, he said we're going to have
some coffee first.

1141
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:22,363
Gosh.

1142
01:18:22,613 --> 01:18:24,490
We have coffee, right?

1143
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:26,826
Didn't you guys have coffee earlier?

1144
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,788
Where's the coffee?

1145
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,206
I'll get it for you.

1146
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:36,294
Let's try that again.

1147
01:18:36,919 --> 01:18:38,254
Shut up, you stupid deer!

1148
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:42,175
Let's try again.

Hold on.

1152
01:19:04,566 --> 01:19:05,401
Enough.

1153
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,577
It's a tacit rule.

1154
01:19:10,494 --> 01:19:11,329
-Do you?
-Yes.

1155
01:19:12,288 --> 01:19:13,122
I'm sorry.

1156
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,583
...for breach of contract,

1157
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:18,169
a verbal agreement based on trust
is enough. It's a tacit rule.

1158
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,380
My goodness. How? Is he okay?

1159
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:25,301
He's lying.

1160
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,097
He's lying.

1161
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,475
Mr. Lee's father is a liar.

1162
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:34,852
He's lying.

1163
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,063
Mr. Lee's father is a liar.

1164
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:41,192
<i>He's just like his father</i>

1165
01:19:42,584 --> 01:19:44,503
I can't pinpoint it,
but I think there's some resemblance.

1166
01:19:44,528 --> 01:19:45,530
You're wrong.

1167
01:19:45,809 --> 01:19:46,852
I'm very pretty.

1168
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:49,967
-We don't look alike at all.
-Don't lie, Ko Mun-yeong.

1169
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:55,283
Don't lie, Ko Mun-yeong.

1170
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,668
I'm very pretty!

1171
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:00,711
Do you want to fight?

1172
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,004
You little...

1173
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:03,339
Maybe...

1174
01:20:05,424 --> 01:20:06,717
Hold on. I'm sorry.

1175
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,930
Where is she?

1176
