"My brother...

00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:11,227
I just want my brother to die!"

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,770
I just want

6
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,897
my brother to die!

<i>"I just want my brother to die!</i>

I just want my brother to die."

9
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:21,737
You said that.

10
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,116
You said to Mom every day
that you wanted me to die.

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,743
That's why you pushed me into the river
that day.

12
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:30,997
<i>I shouted for help.</i>

13
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:34,584
<i>I shouted... I kept crying for help,</i>

14
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,918
<i>but you ran away.</i>

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,628
<i>You left me alone in the water
and ran away.</i>

16
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:41,257
You wanted me dead. Every single day...

17
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:46,095
-I bet you wanted to kill me.
-No...

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,722
Everyone.

19
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,766
Everyone!

20
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:54,770
He's trying to kill his older brother!

21
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,316
-No.
-Everyone!

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,317
No...

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,194
He's trying to kill his older brother!

24
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,073
Listen, people!

25
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,241
He is...

26
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,744
-He's trying to kill his older brother!
-No...

27
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,290
Everyone,
He's trying to kill his older brother!

28
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:18,210
<i>Sang-tae. Do you know the story called</i>
King Donkey Ears?

29
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:19,795
He's trying to kill his older brother!

30
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,966
Listen, everyone!

31
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,178
He... He's trying to...

Everyone!

33
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,891
Listen up, everyone!

34
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:34,143
He's trying to kill his older brother!

35
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,644
No...

36
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,730
-Everyone, listen!
-No, that's not true.

37
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:40,399
-My little brother tried to kill me!
-That's not true.

38
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:45,488
No, Sang-tae. That's not true.

CHAPTER 10
THE GIRL WHO CRIED WOLF

40
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:56,916
UNDER SEDATION
DO NOT DISTURB

41
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,377
Did he fall asleep?

42
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:00,711
Yes.

43
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:10,221
We gave him sedatives, and he fell asleep.

44
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,349
Why don't you let him stay here
for a while?

45
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,851
I'm not saying he should be hospitalized.

46
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,396
We'll just temporarily
take care of him here.

47
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:21,982
Okay.

48
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:29,824
He'll be asleep for a while.

49
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,912
You should go outside and get some air.

50
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:34,472
Hey, where are you going?

51
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,684
How far are you going to walk?

52
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,855
My feet hurt.

53
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,858
Gang-tae!

54
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:52,198
I told you not to turn your back on me!

55
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:08,964
It's your fault

56
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,092
for having such a broad back.

57
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:15,971
Aren't you hungry?

58
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,767
There's a delicious udon restaurant

59
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,810
-two train stops away from here.
-Ko Mun-yeong.

60
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,232
Stop following me.

61
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,992
But we go hand in hand.
We should be together.

62
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:41,455
Go home.

63
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,500
I need to be with my brother.

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,463
You did nothing wrong.

65
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,301
Your brother just got unlucky

66
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,053
and fell into the river that day.

67
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,933
Gang-tae! Help!

68
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,393
Gang-tae!

69
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,146
You were a coward,
but you weren't malicious.

70
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,442
You ran away, but in the end,

71
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,112
you came back and saved your brother.

72
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,158
You're innocent.

73
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:23,998
I ran away

74
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,210
because I really

75
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,506
wanted him to die.

76
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:36,927
Sang-tae knows that.

77
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:39,346
And

78
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:41,682
so did you.

79
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,811
What do you know about me?

80
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,355
Who are you to act up like this?

81
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,274
Hypocrite.

82
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,653
There's no way I'm innocent.

83
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:56,614
So

84
00:05:57,197 --> 00:05:58,824
are you going to sacrifice
your entire life

85
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,535
for your brother
so you can atone for your sin?

86
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:06,832
Why did you

87
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,376
save me

88
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,672
from the river that day?

89
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,176
You should've just left me to die.

90
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:20,929
If I had died that day,

91
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,392
I wouldn't have had to live this way.

92
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,261
I kept calling for him.

93
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:03,806
But he left.

94
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,101
He just abandoned me.

95
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,313
He left me all alone

96
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,692
and left far away.

97
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,443
He tried to kill his brother.

98
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,696
I heard he pushed him into a river.

99
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,990
You really can't tell a book by its cover.

100
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,119
No wonder his smile

101
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:27,371
always seemed a bit creepy.

102
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:29,248
I saw it.

103
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,292
-What?
-I could tell

104
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:34,420
by the look in his eyes.

105
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:38,590
He's a guy who's cruel enough
to kill someone.

106
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,843
-But he's handsome.
-Ignore her. She's talking gibberish.

107
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,094
Yes, he really is.

108
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,762
So what if he's handsome?

109
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,599
You crazy shaman!

110
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,143
-Jeong-tae!
-Watch what comes out of your mouth!

111
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,238
My gosh.

112
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,206
Wipe your face.

113
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,878
Mr. Joo Jeong-tae was really good

114
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:18,213
at aiming people with a fire extinguisher.

115
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,799
I guess he really was a firefighter
back in the days.

116
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,010
That stuff is used to put out fire,
not people.

117
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:24,595
Didn't you hear what he said?

118
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,848
The stuff we said is
what caused this mess.

119
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,769
Let's be careful of what we say
from now on.

120
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,646
Let's not even talk about Mr. Moon.

121
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:38,025
My gosh.

122
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:41,904
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

123
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,865
Here are Ms. Park Ok-ran's recent
counseling records that you asked for.

124
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,870
But why are you interested in her
all of a sudden?

125
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,542
Well, she's been experiencing
severe changes in mood lately.

126
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,544
And her affect seems
very different from usual.

127
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,645
AFFECT: EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS
AND EMOTION

128
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,465
I just want to see
if there's a specific cause to that.

129
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,342
COUNSELING ROOM

130
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,055
Are you getting along okay
at the hospital?

131
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:09,890
I have a question.

132
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,727
Go ahead.

133
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,605
Did he really try to kill him?

134
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:18,899
What?

135
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,610
Did the caregiver really try
to kill his brother?

136
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:30,077
No, I believe there was a misunderstanding
between the two.

137
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:39,628
Ms. Park.

138
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,049
Why do you think Othello...

139
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:46,593
killed his wife?

140
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,974
Because of a misunderstanding.

141
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,029
I brought your bag.

142
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,501
Sang-tae, are you sleeping?

143
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,087
Aren't you hungry?

144
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,216
This place feels really empty, doesn't it?

145
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,094
I'll move you to the ward
once there's an empty room.

146
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,805
By any chance, if you want to go home--

147
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:34,266
No. I don't want to go home.

148
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:38,145
Okay, you can stay here for a while.

149
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,691
Let me know if you need anything.

150
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:44,735
Okay?

151
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,798
My gosh, he's been out of reach all day.

152
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:08,467
This is driving me crazy.

153
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:11,386
I bet there's one more person
who's having a mental breakdown.

154
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,471
Do you think I should go?

155
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,264
You can't do anything to help Mun-yeong.

156
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,141
No, I was talking about Mr. Moon Sang-tae.

157
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,476
Hey.

158
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:20,145
God knows when she'll start
writing her next book

159
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,564
now that she got involved in their fight.

160
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,441
But you're worried about
the older brother?

161
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,359
Unbelievable!

162
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,654
You really care about
nothing else but money.

163
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,155
What did you just say?

164
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,824
Your parents gave you an appropriate name.

165
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:35,285
"Sang-in" means merchant!
You're all about the money!

166
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:39,414
Then I guess according to your name,
you're always out of luck.

167
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,794
My parents went to a naming center
and paid 300,000 won for my name.

168
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,713
My great-grandfather who fought for our
country's independence gave me my name!

169
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:49,424
Stop it, you guys.

170
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:53,261
I'm worried sick because I don't even know
if my friend is dead or alive.

171
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,180
But all you care about is selling books.

172
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,350
If Ko Mun-yeong hadn't convinced him
to go on a trip with her,

173
00:11:58,433 --> 00:11:59,768
none of this would've happened.

174
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:04,189
It takes two to tango.

175
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:07,067
He went with her because he wanted to.

176
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,653
He left his brother here all by himself

177
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,697
and spent the night with Mun-yeong.

178
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,699
I bet he went with her
with an ulterior motive.

179
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,413
I really think you guys should shut up.

180
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:23,333
Ko Mun-yeong is the cause of all this!

181
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:28,088
Moon Gang-tae is the cunning one!

182
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:30,048
-Are you serious?
-Seriously?

183
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,175
-Are you kidding me?
-Look who's talking.

184
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,052
Oh, gosh. Did you work out?

185
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,434
Let's eat.

186
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:42,602
-Okay.
-Okay.

187
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,372
I know they have a lot on their minds.

188
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:05,542
But I hope they didn't skip their meals.

189
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,766
UNDER SEDATION
DO NOT DISTURB

190
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:01,890
Sang-tae.

191
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:15,404
<i>Why did you save me
from the river that day?</i>

192
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:17,280
<i>You should've just left me to die.</i>

193
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:18,573
That horrible jerk.

194
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,063
Why is he just sitting there
instead of going inside?

195
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:59,114
When someone has autism,
it means they shut the door to the world.

196
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,867
Gang-tae is

197
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:06,329
waiting for Sang-tae
to open that door first.

198
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,815
He's like a trapped ghost.

199
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,819
He can't approach you.

200
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,280
But he can't leave either.

201
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,283
He's just like a ghost that's trapped.

202
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,248
I bet it's really hot in there.

203
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,043
It's driving you crazy, isn't it?

204
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,796
Wait a minute.

205
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,051
How long did it take
for Crown Prince Sado to die

206
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,969
in the rice chest?

207
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,682
I can't remember if he died

208
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,393
due to hunger

209
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,065
or died due to the heat.

210
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,903
You brothers are both

211
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:21,696
extremely stubborn.

212
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,116
I'll take your brother upstairs.

213
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,994
So come out of there
and get some fresh air.

214
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,080
And go to the bathroom.

215
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:31,498
My goodness.

216
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:10,078
Eat this.

217
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,123
This is the best
when you don't have an appetite.

218
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:20,005
Have you tried a three-legged race?

219
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:24,050
You know, where each pair have their
adjacent legs bound together and run.

220
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:29,472
I tried it a couple of times
at my son's school sports event.

221
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,558
But I always ended up falling down first.

222
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,311
So we never got to reach the finish line.

223
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,983
It's like you and your brother
are running a three-legged race.

224
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:46,323
Do you think

225
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:50,618
we're both holding each other back?

226
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,245
No.

227
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,165
You're both relying on each other.

228
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,710
As long as one person stays strong
when the other person falls down,

229
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,754
you guys will never fall down together.

230
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,214
Try your best to stay strong.

231
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:05,216
Who knows?

232
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,303
Sang-tae might be the one
to help you one day.

233
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:20,690
I thought Sang-tae

234
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,654
had forgotten about everything.

235
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,159
He never once mentioned that day.

236
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,207
So I thought he had erased it
from his mind.

237
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,250
That's what you wanted to believe.

238
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,756
But most people with autism
have really good memory.

239
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:49,052
They either just try to avoid
their emotions

240
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,598
or express their emotions
a little differently compared to us.

241
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,352
"Avoid"?

242
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,604
You shouldn't avoid it.
Just face it head-on.

243
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,358
Come back to work.

244
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,902
Ms. Lee A-reum's ex-husband told me

245
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:09,739
he's going to drop all charges
after I blackmailed him a little.

246
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,492
I suspended you for a few days,

247
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:13,910
so that's more than enough.

248
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,873
-Is that really--
-I need you back because the guy

249
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,459
who's doing your job is terrible at it.
Maybe I should fire him.

250
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:27,507
That hurts!

251
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,134
Ms. Park! Ms. Nam!

252
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,346
Hey, stop. Jeong-tae.
You shouldn't bite people.

253
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,223
You're not a dog or a crocodile.

254
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,183
-My gosh, please stop.
-That's enough.

255
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,352
It really hurts! Let me go!

256
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:40,812
Mr. Moon.

257
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,527
Gang-tae.

258
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,280
Gang-tae.

259
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,742
He refused to take his medicine.

260
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,828
He's a patient.
He should take his medicine.

261
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,414
You can't force patients
to take their medicine.

262
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,000
He did it on purpose.

263
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,128
He lured my fingers near his mouth
so he could bite them.

264
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:08,131
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

265
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:09,132
He says I'm the problem.

266
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:12,218
He says it's because I told everyone
that you and Ms. Ko are getting married...

267
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:19,851
I should've stitched up your mouth,
not your hand.

268
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,020
JAE-SU

269
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,617
So this is how it feels
to love someone unrequitedly.

270
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:40,872
When you ignored my calls,

271
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,583
I was so worried
that I got extremely angry.

272
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:48,213
But now that I see you,
it's hard to be angry at you.

273
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:51,883
I warned you, didn't I?

274
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:54,344
I told you to stay away from Ko Mun-yeong.

275
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,808
I told you to constantly remind yourself
with that scar she gave you.

276
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,151
Jae-su.

277
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:15,365
I...

278
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,410
woke up from my dream.

279
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:32,173
I should've focused on my brother.

280
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,471
But I dared to dream an impossible dream.

281
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:45,103
I should've known my place.

282
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:53,486
I dreamed the impossible dream.

283
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:44,454
My gosh.

284
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,042
I brought all your favorite toppings.

285
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:52,754
You should eat this while it's warm.

286
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:55,340
It looks so delicious.

287
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,134
It smells amazing.

288
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,396
Oh, gosh.

289
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,608
I shouldn't leave the restaurant empty
for too long.

290
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:16,986
I should go back and sell a lot of pizzas.

291
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,946
I don't even have a part-timer.

292
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:21,783
I bet it'll feel great if I come back

293
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,701
and see an empty box.

294
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,293
KO MUN-YEONG

295
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:04,549
GANG-TAE

296
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,805
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

297
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:33,271
Look at you. You look so worn out.

298
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:37,608
You look like a dried jujube seed.

299
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:42,113
-Why are you here?
-You haven't been home in a while,

300
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,698
so I brought you your underwear.

301
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,200
Briefs, boxers, thongs, and mesh.

302
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,161
I don't know your taste,
so I brought everything.

303
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:49,495
Follow me.

304
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,790
-I need to--
-Okay, I'll take care of your report.

305
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:56,461
Bye, guys.

306
00:24:58,337 --> 00:24:59,505
See? They're dating, right?

307
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,382
She even brought his underwear,

308
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:03,009
so there's no doubt about it.

309

"<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>

311
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,830
THE LITTLE BROTHER KILLS HIS BIG BROTHER

312
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,108
I thought about it,

313
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,818
and I think this is for the best.

314
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,947
It's time for you to stop playing hostage.

315
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:50,867
"Hostage"?

316
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:56,747
I don't want you to spend your entire life

317
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:58,040
taking care of your brother.

318
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:03,629
I know you want to live with me.

319
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:05,965
You want me in your arms,

320
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:08,175
and you want to have fun with me.

321
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:13,014
No.

322
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:15,474
Your mouth can tell lies.

323
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,352
But those eyes

324
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,563
cannot.

325
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:26,027
I...

326
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:29,989
woke up from my dream.

327
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:32,325
What?

328
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:33,534
It's my fault.

329
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:36,621
I...

330
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:39,582
should've focused on my brother.

331
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,585
He should've been my all.

332
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,546
But I was distracted by you.

333
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:50,176
I never should've stopped you
that day we met again.

334
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:53,888
I should've avoided you
when you started talking about destiny.

335
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:55,973
What we have

336
00:27:58,184 --> 00:27:59,310
is an ill-fated relationship.

337
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,733
Stop putting on an act.

338
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:08,694
You told me I make you smile.

339
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:10,488
So there's no way we're ill-fated.

340
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,531
Please do me a favor.

341
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,577
Stay out

342
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:19,038
of my life.

343
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,043
You promised not to leave me.

344
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,003
-Was that--
-Yes.

345
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:27,129
It was all bullshit.

346
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:30,383
It was my first time having fun,
so I got too excited

347
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,718
and just said whatever.

348
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:35,471
My brother

349
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:38,641
is already a handful.

350
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:44,063
I'm already having a hard time
bearing with him, so please...

351
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:46,899
Please...

352
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,863
Please stop stirring up my miserable life.

353
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:55,992
And get lost.

354
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,663
You're lying.

355
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,583
Remember what you told me last time?

356
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,920
When I told you to get lost,

357
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,506
you told me it sounded like
I was asking you not to leave.

358
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,261
What you just said

359
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:20,182
sounded like you want me

360
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,226
to hold onto you.

361
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,034
Don't go.

362
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:43,539
No.

363
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,250
You were like

364
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,336
a firecracker to me.

365
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:51,839
A one-time event.

366
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,925
I had my fun, so it's time for you

367
00:29:57,845 --> 00:29:59,680
to get out of my life.

368
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,376
I'm not a firecracker! I'm a bomb!

369
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:30,753
I don't disappear once I explode!

370
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:33,255
I blow up and kill everyone!

371
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:34,562
<i>Then stay there until the doors open.</i>

372
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,854
"Until the doors open"?

373
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:39,483
Am I a stone sculpture or what?

374
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:42,987
<i>Making sure the author is well and healthy
is one of your main duties.</i>

375
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,697
Then come here and do it yourself.

376
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,992
How dare you? I'm a busy man,

377
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,743
whereas you have nothing to do.

378
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,086
If you're going to keep treating me
like a worthless surplus,

379
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:00,588
I'd rather

380
00:34:02,381 --> 00:34:03,799
-quit.
-Oh, gosh.

381
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,926
-Ju-ri.
-Hello?

382
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,470
Mr. Lee?

383
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:13,142
I hope you go bankrupt.

384
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:19,982
He already did.

385
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:30,868
-Heading out to work?
-Yes.

386
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:33,787
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

387
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,998
No, it's only a short bus ride away.

388
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,876
-Just finish your breakfast.
-No, I'm done.

389
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:41,587
I just need to put those away.

390
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,507
I have some time
before my appointment anyway,

391
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,593
so I'll drop you off on the way.

392
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:50,804
Let me give you a ride.

393
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:58,812
Let's see what we can listen to.

394
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:03,275
Are you going somewhere today?

395
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,739
Yes, I have to go to Seoul
to attend a seminar for book publishers.

396
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,116
I need to show the industry people

397
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,035
that I, Lee Sang-in, am still alive.

398
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:15,162
And I thought I should
do some business as well.

399
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,543
This is a classic car, you know.

400
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:28,175
Hey, what's wrong with you today?

401
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:31,470
Why are they both going bonkers?

402
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,434
Hey.

403
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:40,270
-I think the heater is on.
-What?

404
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:41,313
The heater.

405
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:46,694
Jeez, is it because of the hot weather?
What is wrong with my car?

406
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,656
We'll be okay, right?

407
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:54,952
Yes, of course. It's still no problem

408
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:57,371
to drive the car...

409
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:06,630
Be safe, Ju-ri.

410
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:09,967
Please take good care of her, sir.

411
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,978
It was the perfect chance
to spend some one-on-one time.

412
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,190
My wallet. No, my wallet!

413
00:36:54,803 --> 00:36:55,929
Mom?

414
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,057
It's the Mom.

415
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:04,271
It's Dooly's mom. A Brachiosaurus!

416
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,232
-Hi!
-Hi. My gosh!

417
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,235
Brachiosaurus. It's huge!

418
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:17,159
Dooly is a ceratosaurus.
He's a ceratosaurus.

419
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:18,702
Look, here.

420
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,412
He's a carnivore.

421
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:24,249
And Dooly's mom... Dooly's mom.

422
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:25,834
Look, right here.

423
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:28,837
Dooly's mom is a brachiosaurus,
a herbivore.

424
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:33,717
They have nostrils on top of the head.
It is one of their main characteristics.

425
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,718
Hang on.

426
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,679
They're mom and son.
How could they be different species?

427
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:38,597
Right.

428
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,478
There's a secret behind Dooly's birth.

429
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,522
-Really?
-Yes.

430
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:49,900
Dooly's mom was a stepmom.

431
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:51,693
I mean, fake. She was a fake mom.

432
00:37:51,777 --> 00:37:56,448
Dooly's real mom lost the egg
before Dooly could hatch.

433
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:59,451
This brachiosaurus found the egg,
hatched it,

434
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:01,078
and raised Dooly by herself.

435
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:06,208
That's the speculation made
by the fans of the cartoon like myself.

436
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,628
So, she was a good mom
even though she was a fake mom.

437
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:11,463
That's right. Anything fake is bad,

438
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:14,800
but all moms are good.

439
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,762
Was your mom also a good person?

440
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:25,477
She was a good mom to me,
but a bad one to Gang-tae.

441
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,939
Dooly...

442
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:34,361
Here.

443
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:44,037
Stop staring at the food
and dig in already.

444
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,123
Okay.

445
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:47,874
Thank you for this.

446
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,302
They say you must be kind
to people you hate.

447
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:00,637
I wholeheartedly agree with that saying.

448
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:04,308
I hate you.

449
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:07,060
That's why I cooked up this feast for you.

450
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:09,313
You rejected my daughter,

451
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:11,398
and you're now head over heels
for another girl.

452
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:12,816
How could I not hate you?

453
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:16,194
"Should I tell them to move out?

454
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,948
Not seeing him around
will help her forget him and move on."

455
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:21,908
I ask myself all the time.

456
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:28,290
Would you like us to move out?

457
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,711
I don't think

458
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:36,298
I can sleep worry-free at night
after kicking you guys out, so no.

459
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,136
I'll take Sang-tae home today,

460
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,306
so just focus on
pulling yourself together.

461
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:52,773
Thank you.

462
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,441
You don't need to thank me.

463
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,444
If you're not going to be my son-in-law,

464
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:00,238
you should just be born as my son
in your next life.

465
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:04,910
You can be a good son all your life
and repay me then.

466
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,169
But I don't want to be born again.

467
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,171
Don't be so difficult.

468
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,632
Eat up, will you?

469
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,643
Brachiosaurus.

470
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,978
She doesn't have a teardrop.

471
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,481
However, I'll name her
"Teary without tears."

472
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:36,900
Teary without tears.

473
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,780
I'm happy. I'm so happy!

474
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,004
You'll come home today, right?

475
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,803
Come home for dinner.

476
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:07,139
And make up with Sang-tae.

477
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,767
He had a big meal, and I even saw him

478
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,769
having a lengthy conversation
with Ms. Park.

479
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,231
That means he's not angry anymore, right?

480
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:21,278
You know, there's that thing
we always say to the patients.

481
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:24,990
"If you want to make
the people around you happy,

482
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:27,743
you must find your own happiness first."

483
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:33,874
Being selfish isn't always a bad thing.

484
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:39,421
Try to only think about your happiness
when things are too stressful.

485
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,549
It's okay to do that.

486
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,062
Then,

487
00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:58,690
can I

488
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,821
ask you for a selfish favor?

Sang-tae will stay with us at home
for a little while.

499
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:50,302
He asked me to bring his bare essentials.

What are you apologizing for?

512
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:37,385
For running away

513
00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:41,723
when you fell into the water.

514
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,520

that I wished you were dead.

For wishing

519

that I had a normal brother

520
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:14,923
For wishing that often.

521

00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:26,309

564
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:10,076
I see that you can drink.

565
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,918
Let me slap you in the face.

566
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:23,423
-What?
-I said, let me slap you in the face!

567
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:29,595
You see,

568
00:52:30,138 --> 00:52:32,432
you are the biggest bitch

569
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:35,310
in the entire universe.

570
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,395
When we were little,

571
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:39,939
you harassed my friends

572
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:42,942
and made me an outcast.

573
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:47,655
Then you even stole the guy
I have feelings for.

574
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:52,744
Do you find joy
out of seeing me left all alone?

575
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,789
You stole the one thing I wanted,
knowing I have nothing.

576
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:00,126
Happy now? You bitch.

577
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:04,088
You obnoxious bitch.

578
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:06,507
You're so damn mean!

579
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:11,596
-You're cute.
-Yes, that's right.

580
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:13,389
I'm so freaking cute.

581
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:17,727
When I'm this cute,

582
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,104
why does Gang-tae only like you?

583
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:24,192
Because I'm pretty?

584
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:30,907
Screw you.

585
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,162
You little...

586
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,314
<i>One, two, three.</i>

587
00:54:04,732 --> 00:54:06,651
<i>Smile. Don't cry.</i>

588
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:13,699
Smile.

589
00:54:30,174 --> 00:54:31,342
Ju-ri!

590
00:54:31,926 --> 00:54:32,760
Mun-yeong!

591
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:37,974
Ju-ri?

592
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:41,310
-Ju-ri, wake up.
-What? Damn it.

593
00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:45,773
She's just drunk, right?

594
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:47,733
Don't tell me you hit her.

595
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,360
I almost did,

596
00:54:50,027 --> 00:54:51,529
but she passed out before I could.

597
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,073
How much did she drink?

598
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:59,120
She's not looking good.
I should carry her on my back.

599
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:01,414
Do you like her?

600
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,457
Yes.

601
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,042
Who do you like more? Me or her?

602
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,587
What's with you? You're scaring me.

603
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,839
Answer my question. Who do you like more?

604
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,009
Well...

605
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:15,761
I like you both, in different ways.

606
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:16,846
That wasn't the question.

607
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,515
Who comes first? And who comes second?

608
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:24,979
Mun-yeong.

609
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:28,107
When you're talking about people,

610
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:32,028
you should never number them like that.

611
00:55:33,654 --> 00:55:37,074
You can cherish and care about people

612
00:55:38,075 --> 00:55:39,285
in different ways.

613
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,746
Think about the different kinds of yellow,

614
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:44,248
such as vivid yellow,
mustard yellow, and dull yellow.

615
00:55:44,332 --> 00:55:47,293
Even the same color can take
different names depending on its chroma.

616
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:49,545
The same goes for human emotions,

617
00:55:49,754 --> 00:55:51,047
such as affection.

618
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:54,675
Fondness, hatred,

619
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,802
love, friendship, and lust.

620
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,889
They are like a rainbow.

621
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,518
But when they're mixed together,

622
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:05,603
they turn jet black.

623
00:56:09,607 --> 00:56:11,442
You probably got used to living
with those guys.

624
00:56:13,778 --> 00:56:16,822
But how do you feel now that you're alone?

625
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:23,621
I'm just

626
00:56:26,374 --> 00:56:27,291
bored.

627
00:56:29,043 --> 00:56:30,795
I get sudden bouts of irritability,

628
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:34,006
and I feel colder at night.

629
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:37,635
I also get hungry more often.

630
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:42,348
There's only one way to explain
all those emotions.

631
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:44,350
Do you know what that is?

632
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:02,577
<i>You miss him.</i>

633
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,333
I miss him.

634
00:57:13,504 --> 00:57:14,672
I miss him.

635
00:57:19,343 --> 00:57:20,177
<i>I miss him.</i>

636
00:57:23,764 --> 00:57:24,849
<i>I miss him.</i>

637
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:35,735
I miss him.

638
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,125
Where's my phone?

639
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:52,835
My phone.

640
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:55,671
Where did my phone go?

641
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:57,256
Gosh, where is it?

642
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:00,843
-My phone...
-Here you go.

643
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:02,928
Thanks.

644
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:08,851
Well, I hope I didn't make any mistakes
last night.

645
00:58:08,976 --> 00:58:10,311
No, not at all.

646
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,982
You threw up twice in Mr. Lee's clunker,

647
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:16,859
but it's a great excuse to scrap the car,

648
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:18,361
so don't worry about it at all.

649
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,324
Want some?

650
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:13,332
Is your stomach okay?

651
00:59:15,376 --> 00:59:17,670
-Pardon?
-Are you not hungover?

652
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:20,381
No.

653
00:59:23,175 --> 00:59:24,969
Why are you suddenly
talking so casually to me?

654
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:26,387
What?

655
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:46,657
I can finally breathe.

656
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,160
-Where's Ju-ri?
-I got her.

657
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:50,745
Just get your stuff from the trunk.

658
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:01,088
All right, Ju-ri.

659
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:04,216
Come on.

660
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,303
Moon Gang-tae.

661
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,515
Come on, Ju-ri. Let's go home.

662
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,893
Did she drink a lot?

663
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:16,062
You piece of...

664
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:19,315
All right. No more swearing, please.
My ears are about to rot.

665
01:00:23,444 --> 01:00:25,029
You sent me there on purpose, didn't you?

666
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:29,241
So that Ko Mun-yeong and I can make up.

667
01:00:30,868 --> 01:00:32,912
I bet you were worried
she'd be lonely all by herself.

668
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:35,539
Isn't that why you sent me there?

669
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:38,459
You jerk.

670
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:41,837
Do you not know
that I have feelings for you?

671
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,673
Do you know or not?

672
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:48,636
Quiet down, please. You'll wake up
everyone in the neighborhood.

673
01:00:50,846 --> 01:00:54,517
You said it's okay to be selfish
when things are too stressful.

674
01:01:00,272 --> 01:01:02,441
Am I... Do you think I'm a pushover?

675
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,574
By the way, why do you keep
talking so casually to me?

676
01:01:10,658 --> 01:01:11,575
Hey!

677
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:15,079
Mun-yeong and I are friends.

678
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:16,664
Okay?

679
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:20,167
So why is it that
when you're talking to her... "Hey!"

680
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,795
You call her like that,

681
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,675
while you always talk so politely to me?

682
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:29,677
What the heck? You jerk!

683
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:32,930
Just talk casually to me.

684
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:36,892
Just do as I say, you jerk!

685
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:41,522
Okay.

686
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:50,865
Thanks.

687
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:02,209
Are you not feeling well?

688
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:05,212
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

689
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,046
KO MUN-YEONG

690
01:02:39,914 --> 01:02:42,208
It's so hot. Can't they turn up
the air conditioner?

691
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:45,044
You're hot too, right?
You're covered in sweat.

692
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:48,130
-Yes, it's pretty hot today.
-Hold on.

693
01:02:52,259 --> 01:02:54,929
Jeez, you're burning up.
You feel as hot as a heating pad.

694
01:02:55,262 --> 01:02:56,680
Are you feeling under the weather?

695
01:02:57,681 --> 01:02:58,933
I guess the heat got to me.

696
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:15,741
Goodness.

697
01:03:16,742 --> 01:03:19,662
Look at you swearing at me nonstop
as soon as you pick up the phone.

698
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:22,122
You were obviously waiting
for someone else's call.

699
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,542
Mun-yeong.

700
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,505
I'll treat you to dinner
at a fancy restaurant today.

701
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:31,590
Let's have some beef.

702
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:36,470
We should slice some steaks.
It's been way too long.

703
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,682
"Why"? What do you think?

704
01:03:40,432 --> 01:03:41,850
Today is

705
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:45,187
that day, you know. It's that day.

706
01:04:04,915 --> 01:04:06,041
Does he like the Mom?

707
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:11,338
Dooly's mom.

708
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,090
I gave it to Sang-tae as a gift.

709
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:19,054
Thank you for looking out for him.

710
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:21,056
Did you know?

711
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:23,517
Dooly's mom was actually
not his birth mom.

712
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:30,399
Sang-tae is very selective about
who he shares that with.

713
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:34,445
Sang-tae and I have gotten quite close.

714
01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:38,032
By the way,

715
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:42,036
do you know if he's close
to Ms. Park Ok-ran, the patient?

716
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:46,540
No.

717
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:48,334
Why do you ask?

718
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,170
I was just curious.

719
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:56,008
Try to keep a watchful eye on her
during your shifts.

720
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:58,677
She's been quite unstable.

721
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:50,938
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>

722
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:59,113
<i>I feel as though she's intentionally
trying to provoke other patients.</i>

723
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:04,493
That song.

724
01:06:05,536 --> 01:06:06,912
Did you just hum the song?

725
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:18,966
Why?

726
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:21,426
Are you going to kill me again?

727
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:29,434
Die. Just die!

728
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,894
Why are you being like this?

729
01:06:31,728 --> 01:06:32,813
Help!

730
01:06:32,896 --> 01:06:35,357
-Help--
-You can't fool me anymore, you monster!

731
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:37,317
-Help!
-Die.

732
01:06:37,401 --> 01:06:39,903
-You monster!
-Help me!

733
01:06:39,987 --> 01:06:41,780
-Mr. Ko!
-Let go!

734
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:45,409
Let go of me! I must kill her!

735
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,578
If not, I will die!

736
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:49,538
-Please calm down.
-I said, I'll die!

737
01:06:49,621 --> 01:06:50,747
Calm down, please.

738
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:54,126
-Calm down.
-I'll die if I don't kill her. I'll die!

739
01:06:58,505 --> 01:07:00,090
I have to kill her!

740
01:07:01,049 --> 01:07:02,759
I must kill that woman.

741
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:06,305
That day,
I should've killed Mun-yeong too.

742
01:07:07,264 --> 01:07:10,893
All monsters must be killed!

743
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:15,314
No!

744
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:19,693
Your daughter is not a monster.

745
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:26,742
She is not a monster.

746
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,204
If you don't kill her,

747
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:32,456
you will die.

748
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,674
So, you were just reading.

749
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,802
Mr. Ko suddenly came up to you
and started choking you?

750
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:48,430
For no reason?

751
01:07:50,807 --> 01:07:51,892
Yes, that's right.

752
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:55,103
He called me

753
01:07:56,146 --> 01:07:57,356
a monster.

754
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,441
A monster.

755
01:08:01,526 --> 01:08:03,278
That crazy bastard.

756
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:05,948
Shall I

757
01:08:06,823 --> 01:08:07,991
just kill him?

758
01:08:09,576 --> 01:08:11,245
<i>So, Park Ok-ran</i>

759
01:08:11,828 --> 01:08:15,624
provoked Ko Dae-hwan
by humming "Oh My Darling, Clementine."

760
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:18,752
<i>Then, Ko Dae-hwan</i>

761
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:23,048
called her a monster
and tried to kill her.

762
01:08:23,131 --> 01:08:26,385
You can't fool me anymore, you monster!

763
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:31,348
But the person he usually calls a monster

764
01:08:32,683 --> 01:08:34,268
is Do Hui-jae, his wife.

765
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,061
Then,

766
01:08:37,104 --> 01:08:40,065
do you think
he mistook Ms. Park Ok-ran for his wife?

767
01:08:40,357 --> 01:08:42,734
Either she knows

768
01:08:44,027 --> 01:08:46,863
a lot about Do Hui-jae, or...

769
01:08:50,284 --> 01:08:53,870
Park Ok-ran could actually be Do Hui-jae.

770
01:09:10,637 --> 01:09:12,598
What brings you here?

771
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:14,641
You said

772
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,769
I could come over for food.

773
01:09:21,481 --> 01:09:24,234
Yes, I did. What would you like to eat?

774
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:41,835
Happy birthday.

775
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,212
It's not like you just gave birth,

776
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:46,048
but you wanted to eat seaweed soup,

777
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:47,424
so it must be your birthday.

778
01:09:48,342 --> 01:09:50,052
This is my birthday gift for you, then.

779
01:09:52,262 --> 01:09:53,472
Dig in.

780
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:06,735
Do you like it?

781
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:11,365
Well, it's not bad.

782
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:13,450
I'm glad.

783
01:10:19,873 --> 01:10:21,166
Oh, boy.

784
01:10:39,851 --> 01:10:42,854
Hey, leave me alone.
Gosh, what a nuisance.

785
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:45,440
Goodness, what the...

786
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:50,237
Hey, you've been ignoring
all my calls and messages.

787
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,863
Why the hell

788
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:53,698
are you having dinner here?

789
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,325
I said I'd buy you a steak--

790
01:10:55,409 --> 01:10:56,702
This seaweed soup has beef in it.

791
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:02,708
Happy birthday, Ms. Ko.

792
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,794
I'd like to sing a song
to celebrate Ms. Ko's birthday.

793
01:11:05,877 --> 01:11:07,254
Okay, sure.

794
01:11:09,256 --> 01:11:13,301
<i>Why were you even born?</i>

795
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:15,429
<i>You ugly</i>

796
01:11:15,512 --> 01:11:16,680
Got a death wish?

797
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,407
Damn it. That's the last one.

798
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:38,368
I'll give you something
even more precious.

799
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:42,247
Surprise! I got this for your birthday.

800
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,877
They said this pendant
is two hearts put together,

801
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,503
so I chose this in a heartbeat.

802
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:50,297
Our hearts put together.

803
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,174
It's perfect for us, isn't it?

804
01:11:52,257 --> 01:11:54,426
You write books, and I sell them.

805
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:06,563
My gosh, it suits you perfectly.

806
01:12:06,646 --> 01:12:09,608
Oh, my.
You're dazzlingly beautiful, Mun-yeong.

807
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:12,527
This is your way of pushing me
to get moving on my next book, isn't it?

808
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:15,572
Okay, point taken.
I should get moving if you're pushing.

809
01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:17,157
Hey, what are you talking about?

810
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:23,288
Mun-yeong.

811
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,792
Hey, why are you--

812
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:28,835
Stay there.

813
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,635
Sang-tae, Moon Sang-tae! Open up, bestie.

814
01:12:36,718 --> 01:12:38,512
It's me. Open the door.

815
01:12:43,558 --> 01:12:45,685
No, no, I can't...

816
01:12:45,769 --> 01:12:48,063
If you don't let me in,
I'll break down the door.

817
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:53,568
No, don't.
Don't break the door. Don't do that.

818
01:12:53,652 --> 01:12:56,530
I should... I should call the police.
What was the number?

819
01:12:56,613 --> 01:12:58,949
I brought a power saw. I'm not kidding.

820
01:12:59,824 --> 01:13:03,328
Gosh. Dial 911 to report a fire.

821
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:04,830
Dial 111 to report a spy.

822
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,666
-To report a crime...
-I can only wait three seconds.

823
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:09,125
You'd better open up before that.

824
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:10,460
-One.
-No...

825
01:13:10,544 --> 01:13:11,628
Two.

826
01:13:12,879 --> 01:13:14,798
-Three!
-Don't break it!

827
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:16,299
Don't break down the door.

828
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:34,150
-Here.
-Oh, Mang-tae.

829
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:37,028
Take it back.

830
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,154
I'm giving him up.

831
01:13:38,738 --> 01:13:39,573
You're giving him up?

832
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:42,200
Instead of Mang-tae,

833
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:43,493
can I have Sang-tae?

834
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:46,705
I want Sang-tae.

835
01:13:52,419 --> 01:13:53,670
That smile is fake.

836
01:13:53,753 --> 01:13:56,798
No, it's real.
I'm bored without you, bestie.

837
01:13:58,633 --> 01:13:59,551
You're lying.

838
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,136
I came to pick you up.

839
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:02,470
You're lying.

840
01:14:03,054 --> 01:14:04,097
To tell you the truth,

841
01:14:05,348 --> 01:14:06,308
it's my birthday today--

842
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:07,934
You're lying. You're lying to me.

843
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,186
I want you to hang out with me,
as a birthday present.

844
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:11,521
You're lying.

845
01:14:11,605 --> 01:14:13,523
Are you a lie detector or what?

846
01:14:13,607 --> 01:14:15,150
You're lying. Stop lying to me!

847
01:14:15,233 --> 01:14:17,360
You're lying!

848
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:20,322
Liars are bad. Only bad people lie.

849
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:23,241
Liar. She told me
she was going out by herself.

850
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,367
All by herself.

851
01:14:24,451 --> 01:14:26,578
Besties don't keep secrets
from each other,

852
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:28,914
but those two went somewhere fun
without me.

853
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,999
I don't need this.

854
01:14:31,082 --> 01:14:32,459
I don't need a camping car anymore.

855
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:35,378
I don't need a camping car.
I don't need this anymore!

856
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:36,421
I don't need it!

857
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,118
Sang-tae.

858
01:15:08,995 --> 01:15:10,830
The one who's really bad

859
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:15,126
is the person who doesn't believe
anything others say.

860
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:17,837
No, you're wrong. No.

861
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,383
You know the story,
<i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</i>, right?

862
01:15:22,759 --> 01:15:24,427
You don't look okay.

863
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:26,805
Why don't you get an IV drip
instead of taking medicine?

864
01:15:26,972 --> 01:15:27,889
No, it's okay.

865
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,518
This is enough.

866
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:34,771
<i>The shepherd boy lied all the time.</i>

867
01:15:37,023 --> 01:15:40,819
<i>The boy repeatedly lied to the villagers</i>

868
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:43,738
<i>that a real wolf showed up.</i>

869
01:15:46,616 --> 01:15:49,202
<i>Do you know why the boy
tricked the villagers like that?</i>

870
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:53,456
Because he was bored, obviously.

871
01:15:53,957 --> 01:15:54,791
Wrong.

872
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,253
Because he was lonely.

873
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,760
He did that because he was so lonely,
all by himself in the mountains.

874
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:12,452
-What happened?
-Ms. Park Ok-ran smacked him in the head.

875
01:17:12,535 --> 01:17:14,245
-What?
-Well...

876
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:16,372
She said she dropped something important

877
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:19,167
in the garden earlier
and asked me to help her find it,

878
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,710
so I stepped out with her and--

879
01:17:20,794 --> 01:17:23,004
She suddenly grabbed a stone
and hit him in the head.

880
01:17:24,589 --> 01:17:26,341
He passed out and woke up just now.

881
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:30,386
What about Ms. Park Ok-ran?
Where is she now?

882
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,473
What do we do? It looks like she escaped.

883
01:17:33,556 --> 01:17:35,475
Call the police station nearby. Hurry.

884
01:17:35,558 --> 01:17:36,643
-Come with me.
-Okay.

885
01:17:37,769 --> 01:17:39,896
Anything else? Did she say anything else?

886
01:17:40,647 --> 01:17:42,482
She said today is
a very important day for her.

887
01:17:43,108 --> 01:17:45,777
I heard her mumbling about
having to meet someone today.

888
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,487
<i>Today is a very important day to me.</i>

889
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:49,739
-<i>What if</i>
-Did you get through?

<i>the writer Do Hui-jae actually isn't dead?</i>

891
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,118
-<i>What if she just disappeared?</i>
-Mr. Moon!

892
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:55,995
-<i>Then we know one thing for sure.</i>
-No.

893
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:57,705
-<i>She'll definitely come back</i>
-No.

894
01:17:57,789 --> 01:17:59,874
<i>to see her husband and daughter.</i>

895
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:01,042
