CHAPTER 12 :
ROMEO AND JULIET

4
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:16,792
Do you want some toast? I made them.

5
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,836
-What do you want on your toast?
-No, it's okay.

6
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,504
While my bestie burned
eight pieces of toast,

7
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:22,548
I did the laundry and cleaned the house.
What a morning!

8
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:24,425
On the other hand, you were fast asleep.

9
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:27,428
Why didn't you wake me?

10
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,305
I even slapped your face to wake you up,

11
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,891
but you kept sleeping
like the princess in<i> Sleeping Beauty</i>.

12
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,726
Princess.

13
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:36,062
If you want to wake a princess,
you need to kiss her.

14
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:39,440
I did.

15
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:43,694
By the way,

16
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:47,198
shouldn't we name the characters first?

17
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:52,828
-He’s a guy who has no sense of self.
-Okay.

18
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:55,623
She’s an emotionless princess
who is just like an empty can.

19
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:56,707
Okay.

20
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,211
-And he's--
-Those aren't names.

21
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,339
Gang-tae and Sang-tae are names.
But what you just said aren't names.

22
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:05,174
Today's my day off.

23
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,051
They don't need names. That's the trend.

24
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,637
"Trend"? What's that?

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,679
You don't need to know.

26
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,682
If you guys have time,
do you want to go for a ride later?

27
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,310
-Stop asking questions.
-I'm only asking because I'm curious.

28
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:17,520
Then don't be curious.

29
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,021
Mind your language to your older brother.

30
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,440
-I'm the boss at work.
-Don't abuse your power.

31
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,235
-You can eat all of this yourself.
-No, I can't. It tastes horrible.

32
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,487
-Let me know when you're done.
-Don't get on my nerves.

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,156
-What did I do to get on your nerves?
-I'll be in my room.

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,616
Are you asking for a fight?

35
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,326
Gang-tae told me that fighting is bad.

36
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,454
-He told us to hold our anger.
-I'm going, okay?

37
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:38,457
We're in a meeting now,
so try to think of their names.

38
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,408
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting ready to go to work.

39
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,870
Today's my day off.

40
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,496
So what?

41
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,207
Want to hang out?

42
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:24,462
Should we go for a ride on Alberto?

43
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:28,883
Did your number one and two,
Sang-tae and Ms. Ko, reject you?

44
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,885
Is that why you're asking me,
you're number three?

45
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,596
Are you upset again?

46
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,723
<i>Gang-tae, want to know something?</i>

47
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,058
What?

48
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:43,230
You're sly as a fox.

49
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:47,026
Whenever you need me,
you talk to me all serious

50
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,321
and get me all worried
by looking at me with your teary eyes.

51
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:53,449
But once you get what you need,
you just ignore me right away.

52
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:55,910
You selfish punk.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,622
So do you not want to hang out?

54
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,460
-Do you like me better or Sang-tae?
-You.

55
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:07,755
Then is it me or Ko Mun-yeong?

56
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:09,882
-You.
-<i>Come to my restaurant.</i>

57
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:16,931
My gosh.

58
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:21,936
"Sly as a fox"?

59
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,314
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

60
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:27,608
Here.

61
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,945
I heard you have weak knees

62
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,947
because you're always cooking standing up.

63
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,907
Ju-ri told me she's extremely worried.

64
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,116
Here.

65
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:37,826
When did I say that?

66
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,246
Don't forget to take one every day
for your health.

67
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:41,705
My goodness.

68
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,708
It's okay.
You should give it to your parents.

69
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:48,462
I already bought them a box.
It's inside the car trunk.

70
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,922
I'm going to give it to them today.

71
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:52,383
Really?

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,222
My goodness, then I guess
I should take one right now

73
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,849
to thank you for the kind gift.

74
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,434
Yes, of course.

75
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:05,729
You're way better than my daughter.

76
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,773
Let's see. There.

77
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,777
Are you off to see your parents?

78
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,989
Yes, something came up at home.

79
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,783
I should go to my room.

80
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,203
-Thank you.
-No problem.

81
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,253
It's nothing big.
It's just a monthly event.

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,921
"A monthly event"?

83
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:36,135
Yes, my dad broke three ribs
and got hospitalized.

84
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,387
My goodness. How? Is he okay?

85
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,471
I'm so sorry to hear that.

86
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:40,514
He's lying.

87
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:43,142
Mr. Lee's father is a liar.

88
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,852
<i>He's just like his father</i>

89
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,645
<i>The apple doesn't fall far from the tree</i>

90
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,860
My gosh, that darn brat needs to be quiet.

91
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,445
Did you really just lie to me?

92
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:01,994
The thing is,
whenever a cousin gets married,

93
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:04,079
my dad gets really jealous

94
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:08,584
and makes me visit him
by making up all sorts of stuff.

95
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,588
Going on a few blind dates

96
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,673
is the least I can do as his son.

97
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,300
So you're going on a blind date today?

98
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,218
Yes, I do it once a month.

99
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,429
That's why it's a monthly event.

100
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,936
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

101
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:31,398
Well, I'll call you.

102
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,324
He's going to call?

103
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:45,037
He's totally my type.

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,747
-Should I ask for his number?
-No, don't.

105
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,041
Look at him resting his chin on his hand.

106
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:52,127
-My gosh, this is crazy. Look at him.
-He's so handsome.

107
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,172
-Will you look at that face?
-My goodness.

108
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,511
<i>My dear Ms. Ko.</i>

109
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,806
<i>Just like how ants are drawn to sweets,</i>

110
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,434
<i>lots of women are getting ready
to hit on my lonesome friend, Gang-tae.</i>

111
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,980
<i>So I ask of you to quickly visit
my pizzeria.</i>

112
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,815
Damn, get out of the way.

113
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:15,651
I'm going to kill those darn ants. Move!

114
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:22,741
Here. You can try all our toppings
with this pizza.

115
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,829
Try the one with sweet pumpkin first.
It's sweet just like you.

116
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:36,338
It's good.

117
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,844
Want to know something?

118
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,637
When someone's in love,

119
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,433
the brain releases vitamins

120
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,685
and makes that person
seem more attractive.

121
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,270
It's "dopamine," not vitamin.

122
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,356
Are you showing off
that you work at a hospital?

123
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,526
We both didn't receive good education.
We're like two peas in a pot.

124
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,902
It's "pod," not pot.

125
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,745
-You should be careful.
-Of what?

126
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,496
-Of women.
-What?

127
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,581
Women who are eyeing you.

128
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,250
But you should be more careful

129
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:17,379
of the crazy woman who is after the women
who have their eyes on you.

130
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,672
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:22,509
Welcome.

132
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,265
We have tons of pizza boxes
ready for you today.

133
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:29,933
I'm already full.

134
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,271
How did you know I was here?

135
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,661
Weren't you in a meeting with Sang-tae?

136
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,080
How is that important

137
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,956
when you're here surrounded by ants
that are after you?

138
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,754
I shouldn't have prepared so many boxes.

139
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,758
Hurry up and finish your pizza
so we can get out of this ant nest.

140
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,135
I just started eating. Give me a minute.

141
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,179
Goodness.

142
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:09,056
OK VEGETABLE GARDEN

143
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,891
Hello. Hi.

144
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:12,476
Hello.

145
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:17,940
Hello, tree.
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?

146
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,776
Oh, hello.

147
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:26,198
You guys might not look the same,
but you're all birds.

148
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,075
So don't fight, okay?

149
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,704
You guys are so adorable and kind.
I'll be off now.

150
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,665
Bye, tree.

151
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,084
He's here.

152
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,546
I thought he might not return
because he was upset with me.

153
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:47,594
Ms. Park.

154
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:49,680
You wanted to see me?

155
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,432
I wanted to ask you something.

156
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:53,892
Sure.

157
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,728
Why did you get rid of
Ms. Park Ok-ran's bed already?

158
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,815
-Because she can't come back.
-What do you mean?

159
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,278
Patients who run away
rarely come back on their own will.

160
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:05,904
And we have a long waiting list.

161
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:10,409
Let's not do the same
with Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's bed.

162
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,911
Don't call hospice either.

163
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:16,456
We should let him stay here.

164
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:19,668
Yes, I already told our staff to do that.

165
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,253
Gosh, that was fast.

166
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,757
But sir.

167
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:28,677
Why do you think

168
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,557
Mr. Ko Dae-hwan acted out
when he saw Ms. Park Ok-ran that day?

169
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,852
It's most likely that he had delusions.

170
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,522
I'm guessing he mistook her for his wife.

171
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,149
The writer, Do Hui-jae?

172
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:44,610
It seems like he hated his wife

173
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:48,405
-and feared her at the same time.
-Why?

174
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:53,201
Apparently, she killed someone.

175
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,663
Who did she kill?

176
00:10:58,665 --> 00:10:59,791
Hello.

177
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,003
-Hey, Sang-tae.
-Good morning, Ms. Park.

178
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:05,005
-Hi. Sit here.
-Okay.

179
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,674
I'll leave you guys to talk.

180
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,927
-It's nice to see you.
-Yes.

181
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:13,680
-No!
-I want some, too.

182
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,685
I hate kids and animals.

183
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:21,939
-Why?
-They're unreasonable,

184
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,357
they whine all the time,

185
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,108
and they always beg for love.

186
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:26,318
That's why I like them.

187
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:29,655
They make me care for them
because they're unreasonable.

188
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,950
It's cute to see them whine.

189
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:38,747
And because they beg for love,
it makes me grow fond of them.

190
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,668
Just like you.

191
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:48,715
I will not have your kids.

192
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,053
Don't expect that from me.

193
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,472
I don't want to be jealous of my child.

194
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,395
Come here.

195
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,444
Closer.

196
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:21,289
Not everyone can be a mother, you know.

197
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:22,582
Gosh.

198
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,335
Darn, that punk.

199
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,630
-Wait.
-I want that one.

200
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:31,550
Min-jae, sit down. Come here and sit.

201
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,179
-There you go. Is it yummy?
-Yes.

202
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,098
You eat so well.

203
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,782
Are you still upset

204
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,285
that I refused to pay
for a mural with no butterflies?

205
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:01,163
A... A promise isn't something
you can take so lightly.

206
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,874
You need to keep your promise.
That's only the right thing to do.

207
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,921
I just want you to stop

208
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:14,676
running away from butterflies.

209
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:19,848
Since you've always been running away,
Gang-tae had to go through tough times.

210
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,683
But... Butterflies...

211
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,812
I'm scared of them.
I don't like butterflies.

212
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,733
Let me tell you something interesting.

213
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:31,318
Sure.

214
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:35,322
In ancient Greek,
the word butterfly is <i>psyche</i>.

215
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:36,907
<i>Psyche</i>?

216
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,700
Do you know what they symbolized?

217
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,122
-They were a symbol of "cure."
-"Cure."

218
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,167
Not all butterflies are scary.

219
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,129
There are many butterflies
that are good and can cure people.

220
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:54,424
So instead of being so impatient,

221
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,261
why don't we both try
and overcome the fear together?

222
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:00,847
"Cure."

223
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:04,684
If we keep trying,
there might be a butterfly

224
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:09,439
flying around in your mural one day.

225
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,691
Yes. Cure.

226
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:18,949
Cure.

227
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,291
Is your next book going to be based
on my brother's drawing?

228
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,460
Is it about kids going on a trip
in a camping car?

229
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:32,587
It's about us. The three of us.

230
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:35,382
Am I the guy with no sense of self?

231
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,592
And are you the emotionless princess?

232
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,718
Yes.

233
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,595
Then what about my brother?

234
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,681
He's a guy who's trapped inside a box.

235
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,978
What do they do on that trip?

236
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,193
They meet people who are weirder
and a lot more deficient than they are.

237
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,822
-What happens after that?
-That'd be a spoiler. No more.

238
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,244
-It sounds fun.
-Of course.

239
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm the writer.

240
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,420
I hope it's going to be
a happy ending this time.

241
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:15,589
Me too.

242
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:26,266
By the way, where are we going?

243
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,894
To buy bread.
You burned it all this morning.

244
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,146
I see.

245
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:38,236
Look at all this stuff.
I've never been to a place like this.

246
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:40,405
I want this.

247
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:42,449
Just get one.

248
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,492
I thought about it, and I think

249
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,453
it'd be nice to have a son
who looks like you.

250
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:50,624
I don't think I'll get jealous.

251
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:52,417
Let's have a son.

252
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,630
You really need to stop
getting ahead of yourself.

253
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,343
Why? What's wrong? Let's have a son.

254
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,303
Let's have a son! I want a son!

255
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,722
Why won't you cooperate?

256
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,307
I want your cooperation!

257
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,893
-Gosh, be quiet.
-He must not want a baby.

258
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:11,394
I wonder why he doesn't want one.

259
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:13,980
I wonder why he won't cooperate.
He looks completely healthy.

260
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,399
Stop talking about having a baby.
Just go and get some milk.

261
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:34,084
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

262
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,754
Did you hear?
Dr. Kwon is getting married soon.

263
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:38,922
He wasn't seeing anyone.

264
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,299
He's marrying the woman he met
on a blind date last month.

265
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:43,426
-That quickly?
-Come on.

266
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,387
When you're at his age,
you just get married

267
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,471
if everything seems okay.

268
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:51,351
Were you guys talking about me?

269
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,937
Then let me just cut to the chase.

270
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,146
Surprise.

271
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,320
Everything's proceeding so quickly.

272
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:07,867
My ideal type showed up on the blind date.

273
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,211
Should I leave Sang-tae's art supplies
in the study?

274
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,427
Let me go.

275
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,430
When are we going to start
using the same room?

276
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,391
Why would I do that?
I sleep with Sang-tae.

277
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:33,143
Let go of me.

278
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,145
I'm home.

279
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:38,732
Let go of me right now.

280
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,234
Sang-tae! We're over here!

281
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,030
Okay, fine. Let's hang out later.

282
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:46,448
In my room?

283
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:48,616
Yes, in your room.

284
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:53,496
I'll be waiting for you.

285
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,941
<i>I'll call you.</i>

286
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,126
Yes, Mr. Lee.

287
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,630
We have the overall storyline.

288
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:46,716
I'll ask Mr. Moon about the illustrations.

289
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:52,389
I came up with a list of places
we can go for research.

290
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:54,933
It's near the art library.

291
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,603
Okay. Bye, Mr. Lee.

292
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,319
Was that Mr. Lee?

293
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:08,238
Yes.

294
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,032
Did he say anything in particular?

295
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:13,118
Like what?

296
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:15,954
No, never mind.

297
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:22,919
Mr. Lee's blind date
apparently looked like Song Hye-kyo.

298
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,797
His ideal type of woman
is someone who looks like her.

299
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,051
That guy falls in love so easily.
He really got lucky this time.

300
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,891
Butterfly is <i>psyche</i>,
and it symbolizes "cure."

301
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,685
Butterflies that cure are good.

302
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,313
-Did the director tell you that?
-Yes.

303
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:45,024
"Stop running away
and face the butterflies

304
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:48,319
so that Gang-tae won't have to go through
tough times anymore."

305
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:50,447
Do you really think you can do that?

306
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:57,704
Is... Is this expensive?

307
00:19:57,787 --> 00:19:59,956
How... How much is all this?

308
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,627
Sell lots of books and pay me back.

309
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,046
I'm going to take a shower.

310
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:11,342
<i>Psyche</i> symbolizes "cure."

311
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:15,054
There are tons of good butterflies.
There are tons of them.

312
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:18,349
There are tons of good butterflies.
<i>Psyche</i> symbolizes "cure."

313
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:29,319
No.

314
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,531
I don't need a pillow.
I can lay on his arm.

315
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:53,009
You came running
without even drying your hair.

316
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:07,273
Come here and sit down.

317
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,695
You really don't listen.

318
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,822
This is a lot of alcohol.

319
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:45,687
My brother started getting counseling--

320
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,022
I forbid you to talk about your brother.

321
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,399
If you do, drink an entire glass.

322
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,735
Then you can't cuss.

323
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:54,904
If you do, drink an entire glass.

324
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:55,822
Deal.

325
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,325
Shit, my damn head hurts like hell.

326
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,452
Why am I so freaking dizzy? Damn it.

327
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:06,666
Look at you swear.

328
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:10,920
You should go to bed.

329
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,639
I'm...

330
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:25,727
so happy.

331
00:22:28,354 --> 00:22:32,775
I'm so happy that you and Sang-tae

332
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,488
live here with me now.

333
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:12,940
Good night.

334
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,472
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

335
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:33,062
<i>No, I'm talking about Ms. Park Ok-ran.</i>

336
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,314
<i>Why did she go there?</i>

337
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:38,192
<i>There's no way she escaped</i>

338
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,154
<i>just to wish Ms. Ko a happy birthday.</i>

339
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:54,250
The butterfly said it'd kill me as well.

340
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,627
It'll kill me!

341
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,421
<i>Those butterflies!</i>

342
00:24:58,504 --> 00:25:00,006
<i>They said they'll kill me.</i>

343
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,383
The butterflies will kill me!

344
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,844
They're coming to kill me!

345
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:15,396
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

346
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:08,859
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

347
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:15,741
My gosh, I hope you spend
a longer time outside this time.

348
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,119
Don't come back in just a few hours.

349
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:21,497
Don't worry. I'll see you later.

350
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:24,875
-You should eat a lot of delicious stuff.
-Okay.

351
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:31,507
I bet he's just going to get on a bus

352
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,300
and come back after circling around a bit.

353
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:35,136
Yes, probably.

354
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,931
But how did he end up
doing something like that

355
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:40,725
when he can't even kill an ant?

356
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:44,937
-What do you mean?
-Mr. Kan told me everything.

357
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:47,440
He told me he killed so many people.

358
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:49,275
Is that why he went crazy?

359
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:52,820
He's such a weak and kind person.

360
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:56,866
It wasn't something he could handle.

361
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:30,483
Turn off the gas stove

362
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:32,234
to save money.

363
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,278
We need to save gas to save money.

364
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:37,698
I forgot.

365
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:40,951
Your... Your eyes are red.

366
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:43,621
Did... Did you not sleep well?
You have the eyes of a rabbit.

367
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:46,665
No, I slept well.

368
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,963
You have counseling today, right?

369
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,717
Yes... Yes, I have counseling.
I... I have counseling today.

370
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,638
Butterfly is <i>psyche</i>,
and it symbolizes "cure."

371
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:03,724
It symbolizes "cure"...

372
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,313
But I'm still scared of them.

373
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,027
What... What if the butterfly
appears again?

374
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:16,946
We'll... We'll have to move again.

375
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:24,578
Sang-tae.

376
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:27,623
Let's stop

377
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,751
running away.

378
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,795
But the butterflies...

379
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,715
You know that I'm good at fighting, right?

380
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,676
Yes, you're a great fighter.

381
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,636
You have a red belt in taekwondo.

382
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,847
You beat up all the kids who bullied me
with your kicks.

383
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,598
You're also good at using your nails.

384
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:50,938
So from now on, if you're scared,
just hide behind me.

385
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,401
But... But I'm your big brother.
I'm an adult.

386
00:29:55,484 --> 00:29:56,861
If I hide behind my little brother,

387
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,737
that would make me... What's it called?

388
00:29:58,821 --> 00:29:59,822
A scaredy-cat?

389
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:03,242
It's okay.

390
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:07,163
I've been hiding behind you all my life.

391
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,415
Behind me?

392
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:29,935
Hey, babe.

393
00:30:30,644 --> 00:30:32,855
Grilled meat? Sounds great.

394
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:34,565
Tonight?

395
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:38,402
Why did he have to say he'll call?
I can't stop looking at my phone.

396
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:40,321
-Ms. Nam.
-Yes?

397
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,532
Mr. Ko is slowly starting to recover
his cognitive orientation.

398
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:46,118
-So take him for a short walk.
-Okay, ma'am.

399
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:49,038
Oh, right.
Is Mr. Moon working the day shift today?

400
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,706
Yes, he got here a few minutes ago.

401
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,970
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

402
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:08,265
Mr. Moon.

403
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,603
What? What is that?

404
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:15,898
Did you receive
a love letter or something?

405
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:17,483
-Come on. Show me.
-It's nothing.

406
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:19,902
What's the matter?

407
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:23,989
Oh, you see...

408
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:27,576
I went into room 201 while doing
my rounds earlier in the morning

409
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,455
and found a dangerous item in the room.

410
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:35,292
Gosh. I have to say,
Mr. O Cha-yong always does

411
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:38,546
such a clumsy job when he's checking
the patients' belongings, doesn't he?

412
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:41,006
I'm sorry.

413
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,925
I'll train him better.

414
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,304
Can you do another thorough check
on the rooms on the second floor, then?

415
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:49,473
-Sure, no problem.
-Here.

416
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:53,978
You must be getting tired.

417
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:56,146
Would you like to sit down for a moment?

418
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:10,703
Will I

419
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,207
die soon?

420
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:19,878
Have I been

421
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,007
punished enough?

422
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:35,269
"Years went by,
and the boy became an adult.

423
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:36,604
He no longer had nightmares.

424
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:40,024
But for some strange reason,
he wasn't happy at all.

425
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:41,483
One night--"

426
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,610
Headed to the hospital?

427
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,361
Yes. Hello!

428
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:48,073
Oh, you're wearing
something different today. Nice clothes.

429
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:50,951
-Yes, I am.
-You look very young today.

430
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:53,996
By the way, how old are you?

431
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,998
Me? I'm 70.

432
00:32:56,081 --> 00:33:00,210
You're 70? You're older than me.
You're an adult.

433
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:01,628
I am an adult indeed.

434
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:04,965
Being an adult isn't always great.

435
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,884
Right, I agree.

436
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:09,011
-Oh, look!
-Do you want this?

437
00:33:09,094 --> 00:33:10,596
Thank you.

438
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:15,601
Right, the mural.

439
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:16,935
It looks amazing.

440
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:20,564
It's amazing. It looks super cool.

441
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:24,985
But Director O Ji-wang wouldn't pay me
because I refused to draw butterflies.

442
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,321
He is not a man of his word.

443
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:30,157
Why can't you just draw some butterflies?

444
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,328
I'm scared of butterflies.

445
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:35,245
Why?

446
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:38,374
Do you have a bad memory
of butterflies or something?

447
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:48,175
Don't let the past trap you,

448
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:49,259
or you'll end up like me.

449
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:51,637
Look at me.

450
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,597
I can't go back out into the world.

451
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:56,016
I'll always be stuck in the hospital.

452
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,852
The past can trap me?

453
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:00,312
Yes.

454
00:34:01,814 --> 00:34:04,066
Then I can just open the door and get out.

455
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,235
No, you can't.

456
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:08,320
You won't be able to see the door.

457
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:14,368
You can't get out
once you're trapped in the past.

458
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,745
Don't end up like me.

459
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:39,036
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

460
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:40,746
Do your ears hurt?

461
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,247
God, that sound...

462
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:45,667
-Is that sound bothering you?
-That sound...

463
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:49,004
This sound? This sound...

464
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:13,070
Sir! What's wrong?

465
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:17,157
Are you okay, sir?

466
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,993
It's okay. You're okay.

467
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,828
You're okay. It's all right.

468
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:24,832
Could you please call
OK Psychiatric Hospital right away?

469
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:26,583
You're okay. You're safe.

470
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,795
You're okay. It's all right.

471
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:32,965
You're okay. You're okay now.

472
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:34,925
Count to three in your head.

473
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,804
You're okay. You're okay now.

474
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,848
You're okay. It's all right.

475
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:45,185
You're safe, okay? Everything's okay now.

476
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:53,360
Director O.

477
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:55,988
Can you just kill me?

478
00:36:56,572 --> 00:36:58,240
Don't you worry.

479
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,866
You'll die anyway.

480
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:05,747
All of us here, including myself,
will die eventually anyway.

481
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:07,624
Don't be so anxious.

482
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:14,923
It's okay. Try to relax.

483
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:25,058
-What's up?
-Well, this...

484
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,269
I'd like to

485
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,271
lend this book to him.

486
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,690
-Really?
-I'm not giving it to him though.

487
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:33,734
He can borrow it.
I paid a lot of money for it,

488
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,193
so it's mine.

489
00:37:36,278 --> 00:37:37,779
Okay, he can borrow and read it.

490
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:39,031
Yes, I'm lending it to him.

491
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:47,748
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

492
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:49,499
Come in.

493
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:55,088
I must say, he sure is your big brother.

494
00:37:56,214 --> 00:38:00,177
Without Sang-tae's help, Mr. Kan
would've gotten in a dangerous situation.

495
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,388
I am your big brother.

496
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:05,515
Have a seat.

497
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:09,895
Good job.

498
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,607
Remember what you told me earlier?

499
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,652
-Can you also tell your brother?
-Sure.

500
00:38:17,277 --> 00:38:18,570
What is it about?

501
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:22,240
Mr. Kan told me
that I shouldn't end up like him.

502
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,703
He said you can never get out

503
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,622
once you're trapped in the past

504
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:31,249
because you can't even see the door.

505
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:34,419
A trauma?

506
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:35,921
Yes.

507
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:38,298
He fought in the Vietnam War
when he was only 20.

508
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:42,427
It left him with traumatic memories.

509
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,100
There were a lot of kids.

510
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:51,019
Kids

511
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:55,524
with sparkling eyes.

512
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,819
They were adorable.

513
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,826
I just couldn't bring myself
to look at them,

514
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,661
so I...

515
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:10,664
closed my eyes.

516
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:12,624
Then I...

517
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:18,922
I killed all those innocent people.

518
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:22,592
I don't even know why I'm still alive.

519
00:39:23,468 --> 00:39:25,595
You were just following an order.

520
00:39:26,138 --> 00:39:27,514
You had no choice.

521
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:30,809
You're nothing more than a beast
if you blindly follow such orders.

522
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,978
A human being with a heart
would never do that.

523
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:37,733
I shouldn't even call myself human.

524
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:45,980
<i>THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES</i>

525
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:48,704
"So don't forget any of it.

526
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,079
Remember it all and overcome it.

527
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:53,540
If you don't overcome it,

528
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:58,044
you'll always be a kid
whose soul never grows."

529
00:39:58,837 --> 00:40:02,674
I'm not a kid. I'm an adult.

530
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:08,555
Sang-tae.

531
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:11,892
Yes, I won't run away anymore.

532
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,727
I will not run away.

533
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,520
-My gosh.
-That's right.

534
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:18,440
You're incredibly brave, Sang-tae.

535
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:19,399
That's right.

536
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,736
Then would you be able to tell us

537
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:26,782
what you remember about that day?

538
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,412
Yes.

539
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:36,458
Well...

540
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:42,756
That day...

541
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:43,882
-I--
-Kitty!

542
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,468
That night...

543
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:50,555
Well...

544
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,766
SEONGJIN WELFARE CENTER

545
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:55,685
I have to work late from now on,

546
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:57,979
so you'll have to go home with Gang-tae.

547
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,232
Okay?

548
00:41:00,982 --> 00:41:02,275
Look, it's a cat.

549
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:03,568
Kitty!

550
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:08,114
Sang-tae, get back here.
You shouldn't go in there.

551
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,992
Get back here, Sang-tae!

552
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:14,120
Fine. I'm leaving.

553
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,206
I'm leaving without you.

554
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:20,752
Bye.

555
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,922
Bye, Sang-tae!

556
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,102
Kitty.

557
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:38,854
Kitty?

558
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:08,383
I didn't get to say this earlier.

559
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:12,721
It is me

560
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,433
who will take care of my child.

561
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:15,367
My gosh, why do you look so scared?

562
00:43:16,743 --> 00:43:18,495
It's okay.

563
00:43:19,871 --> 00:43:20,872
It's all right.

564
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:31,258
Yes, good boy.

565
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:36,680
Do not tell anyone

566
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,308
about what you saw or heard here.

567
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:45,313
If you do, I'll kill you.

568
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:50,193
Even if you run away,

569
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:55,073
I will chase you down no matter what
and make sure

570
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,868
I kill you.

571
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:02,288
<i>The... The butterfly killed Mom.</i>

572
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:04,124
Okay?

573
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:09,796
Answer me.

574
00:44:11,756 --> 00:44:13,216
I said, answer me!

575
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:22,934
<i>There was... There was a butterfly
on that woman's jacket.</i>

576
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:26,021
There was a butterfly
sitting on her jacket.

577
00:44:27,188 --> 00:44:28,023
"Her jacket"?

578
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,901
That butterfly...

579
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:34,988
Do you remember what it looked like?

580
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,740
Yes.

581
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:41,202
Yes, I do remember.

582
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,750
Well...

583
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,128
Gosh.

584
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:02,015
Actually,

585
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:05,393
<i>there was a mom butterfly.</i>

586
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:10,523
<i>And I saw a tiny baby butterfly</i>

587
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:12,817
sitting on the mom butterfly's back.

588
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,070
It was sitting on its back?

589
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:25,121
<i>Yes, there were two...
I saw two butterflies.</i>

590
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:29,918
<i>The mom and the baby. Two butterflies.</i>

591
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:46,601
<i>I think that's why we're meant to be.</i>

592
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,354
<i>If someone shows up when you need them,</i>

593
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,773
<i>you call that destiny.</i>

594
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:54,609
<i>And I</i>

595
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:56,653
<i>need you.</i>

596
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,496
<i>I hope it's going to be</i>

597
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:09,040
<i>a happy ending this time.</i>

598
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,571
Your book is quite engaging.

599
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:03,697
Yes, I know.

600
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,000
You heard about your father, right?

601
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:19,046
How much time does he have left?

602
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:23,300
Let me rephrase that.

603
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,638
When will he die?

604
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:33,060
I wouldn't be surprised
even if he passed away tomorrow.

605
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:38,607
I'm sick of doctors telling me
the same thing over and over.

606
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:43,987
You know,

607
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:46,949
if you're okay with it,

608
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:52,871
why don't we take your father out
for a walk when you have some time?

609
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,249
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

610
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,546
I...

611
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:04,758
don't want to.

612
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:17,938
Yes.

613
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,232
So I took off my shirt right away
and put it over his head

614
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,109
like Gang-tae does for me all the time.

615
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:25,988
Then he stopped screaming and calmed down.

616
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:27,197
My gosh.

617
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,158
Great job, Sang-tae.

618
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:31,702
I'm so proud of you.

619
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:32,661
I know.

620
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,205
Yes, the cafeteria. I'm at the cafeteria.

621
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:36,748
So I...

622
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,793
Where was I?

623
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,422
Anyway, I asked someone to call
OK Psychiatric Hospital

624
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:45,048
and came here with him in the ambulance.

625
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:49,261
There's a storybook that I like.
It's called <i>The Boy Who Fed on Nightmares</i>.

626
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,263
-I lent him that book.
-My, how sweet.

627
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,764
He can't keep the book though.

628
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:55,142
I paid a lot of money for it,
so I can't let him keep it.

629
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:58,729
Anyhow, he kept thanking me.

630
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:00,939
He said he's grateful to me.
He's grateful.

631
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,190
-Absolutely.
-Yes.

632
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:03,150
Sang-tae.

633
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:06,612
Let's wait for Gang-tae
and go home together.

634
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:11,408
Ko Mun-yeong, she's a lot older than you.
You need to say hello to her first.

635
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:15,746
Hello.

636
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,914
Yes, hi.

637
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,251
Shall we eat out? It's been a while.

638
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:23,879
No, I want to eat at home.

639
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,505
We shouldn't be eating out.

640
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,717
We have to save money to live better.

641
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,638
It looks as though

642
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,848
the three of you are actually a family.

643
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,017
I'm getting jealous here.

644
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,103
No. Strictly speaking, we're not a family.

645
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:43,398
Gang-tae and I have the same surname,
Moon, whereas she...

646
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:45,233
What was your surname? Right, Ko.

647
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:46,526
Ko and Moon.

648
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,779
Different surnames.
And she's not on our family register.

649
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:53,825
We're not a real family,
but we're like a family.

650
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:56,745
-The family register isn't everything.
-What?

651
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,954
A family is...

652
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:07,214
-A family is...
-Yes?

653
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,842
You become one
if you take a portrait together.

654
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,512
What? A family portrait?

655
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:16,181
That's right. Forget the family register.

656
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,433
A family portrait is the proof
that you're a family.

657
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:25,399
The two of you are so much alike.

658
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,240
Our eyes... Do our eyes look alike?

659
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,451
No, we don't look alike at all.

660
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:40,288
I can't pinpoint it,
but I think there's some resemblance.

661
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:42,040
You're wrong. I'm very pretty.

662
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,918
Don't lie, Ko Mun-yeong.

663
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,797
You cut... You cut your hair.

664
00:50:57,848 --> 00:50:59,015
What time do you get off work?

665
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:04,229
What happened to your hand?

666
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:07,065
I hurt it while working.

667
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,359
Who's the jerk that did this to you?

668
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:10,610
Who did this?

669
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,614
I'm asking you who did it.

670
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:25,834
What's going on?

671
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:28,170
Are you mad at me?

672
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,842
Am I going bonkers again
without being considerate

673
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,385
of your feelings

674
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,137
like an empty can?

675
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,479
I'm just tired.

676
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:49,232
I didn't get much sleep last night.

677
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,450
Go home with Sang-tae.

678
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,786
I have to work the night shift as well.

679
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:05,040
Really?
Then you'll probably be off tomorrow.

680
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:05,957
That's great.

681
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,794
The two of us and Sang-tae
should take a family portrait tomorrow.

682
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:20,472
I already made an appointment
at a fancy photo studio.

683
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:23,475
We should stop by a tailor shop on the way
and buy a couple of suits.

684
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:26,853
Maybe another time.

685
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,773
-What?
-Let's do it some other day.

686
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:32,609
-Not tomorrow.
-But I already made an appointment.

687
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:35,403
-Cancel it.
-No, I don't want to.

688
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,364
Let's not put it off
and just do it tomorrow.

689
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:40,367
We have to take a family portrait together
to become a real family.

690
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,701
Leave!

691
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,250
Please.

692
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:50,502
Just leave.

693
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:55,048
Please.

694
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:00,804
I have to work.

695
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:52,898
I'm going to take a photo!
I have to look cool.

696
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:56,026
One... One, two, three.

697
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,990
One, two, three. Look cool.

698
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,492
One, two, three.

699
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,670
What do I do to look cool?
One, two, three.

700
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,466
Jeez, why the heck is he mad at me again?

701
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,009
I mean, just why?

702
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:25,305
Darn it. Yesterday was so nice.

703
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,308
We drank together all night.

704
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,811
Did I do something silly when I was drunk?

705
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:36,858
Why is he angry? Just why?

706
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,111
Was that a soliloquy or a question for me?

707
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:42,822
I'm asking because
I can't quite figure it out.

708
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:46,493
Did you order ten boxes of pizza
at this late hour

709
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,703
just to make me come all the way here

710
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:50,664
because you wanted to know why he's angry?

711
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,040
It's obviously not because

712
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,751
I wanted to eat ten boxes of pizza
in the middle of the night.

713
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:57,045
Why?

714
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,005
Why is Gang-tae upset?

715
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:00,966
You must know since you're his bestie.

716
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,149
He never really opens up to anyone.

717
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:23,530
Do you know how I've managed
to stay close to him all these years?

718
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,201
By having no idea of

719
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:32,247
what goes on in his mind
or how he really feels.

720
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:38,461
You see, Gang-tae is an expert
at hiding his feelings.

721
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:42,674
Nothing good will come out of
prying and forcing him

722
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:44,968
to share his feelings and thoughts.

723
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:48,304
All you can do is just be there for him

724
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:50,765
and try to comfort him quietly.

725
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,811
That is

726
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:57,689
all I do.

727
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:06,031
<i>Obviously, he's never
even had a chance to whine</i>

728
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:07,574
<i>or complain to his parents.</i>

729
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:11,119
<i>He got so used to just putting up
with things and keeping it all inside.</i>

730
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:14,539
<i>Then one day,
he realized he'd become an adult.</i>

731
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,503
<i>But he's still a kid inside,
so how would you understand</i>

732
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,131
<i>his feelings and thoughts?</i>

733
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,551
<i>Even parents can't fully understand
their own child.</i>

734
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,951
<i>ROMEO AND JULIET</i>

735
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:05,340
<i>We look like Romeo and Juliet.</i>

736
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:08,468
<i>You're right. The ill-fated mortal enemies</i>

737
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,845
<i>who should've never crossed paths.</i>

738
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,848
<i>No, they were meant to be. It was fate.</i>

739
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:15,934
<i>It was tragic fate.</i>

740
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:19,014
<i>ROMEO AND JULIET</i>

741
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:39,207
Your hand didn't do anything wrong.

742
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,794
Your heart is the problem
because you can't control it.

743
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:47,590
Sir.

744
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,050
Yes?

745
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,762
I think the "butterfly"
that killed my mom was...

746
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,061
Mun-yeong's mother.

747
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:02,689
Are you sure?

748
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,190
The possibility that it may be true

749
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:08,528
scares me.

750
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:12,198
I hope I'm wrong.

751
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:17,287
No, I wish I had stayed in the dark.

752
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,503
Isn't it just too cruel?

753
00:58:27,464 --> 00:58:30,300
I was beginning
to feel like I could finally

754
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:33,303
breathe a little.

755
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:37,557
I was finally

756
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:41,936
starting to get the urge to live

757
00:58:45,482 --> 00:58:47,275
just like everyone else.

758
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:54,532
Because of that damn butterfly,

759
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,163
I've had to

760
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,459
crawl and suffer all these years.

761
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:08,504
But how could that butterfly be

762
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:14,844
her mother?

763
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:29,150
I always thought

764
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:34,239
I'd tear the butterfly to shreds
if I ever crossed paths with it,

765
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:38,660
but I can't even do that anymore.

766
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:43,790
I feel so guilty when I think

767
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,167
about my mom and my brother.

768
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,296
What do I do?

769
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:56,386
I promised my brother
that I'd fight the butterfly

770
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,096
in his place.

771
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:01,891
I...

772
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,688
I told him that we shouldn't run away.

773
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,736
This is so messed up.

774
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:20,785
I just want to run away.

775
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:48,563
I don't want Mun-yeong
to suffer like this,

776
01:00:51,608 --> 01:00:52,775
so I hope

777
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,989
she never finds out about this.

778
01:01:01,576 --> 01:01:03,411
I don't want her to be hurt.

779
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:11,502
I don't want her to ever care
about other people's feelings.

780
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,423
I hope she can just live without emotions

781
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:19,677
like an empty can.

782
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:19,612
<i>I'm so happy that you and Sang-tae</i>

783
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:24,242
<i>live here with me now.</i>

784
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:28,329
I used to

785
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,958
hate this place so much.

786
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:36,462
Why?

787
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,800
Because my dad lost his sanity here

788
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,303
and my mom

789
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,682
died in this very house.

790
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,521
Blood kept gushing out

791
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,775
from her head.

792
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:03,740
And my dad locked her up

793
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,827
in the basement.

794
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:12,915
But the thing is,

795
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,754
she vanished after that.

796
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:20,965
My mom vanished.

797
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,012
She vanished?

798
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,431
Yes.

799
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:32,393
I don't know if she actually died

800
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:36,689
or if she just disappeared.

801
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:40,818
I guess only my dad knows the truth.

802
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,531
If...

803
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,160
If your mom comes back,

804
01:03:51,496 --> 01:03:52,997
how do you think you'll feel?

805
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,376
I'll be terrified.

806
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,088
And I'll feel suffocated.

807
01:04:02,215 --> 01:04:03,800
But you know,

808
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,804
she is

809
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:12,350
still my mom.

810
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:40,187
-Is he coming?
-No.

811
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:42,565
He won't wake up.

812
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:45,610
He won't even answer me.

813
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:47,653
He's just sleeping
with the blanket over his head.

814
01:05:47,737 --> 01:05:50,448
He's such a sleepyhead. A sleepyhead.

815
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,456
I guess he's tired.

816
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:00,166
Sang-tae, let's take it another day.

817
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,835
But I'm...
I'm wearing my nice clothes today.

818
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:06,088
And I got up at 6:50 a.m.,
which is so early. Very early.

819
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:07,381
I even styled my hair with wax.

820
01:06:07,465 --> 01:06:09,717
And yesterday... Last night...

821
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,678
I practiced so many cool poses last night.

822
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:15,598
What do I do?

823
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,600
What do I do?

824
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,897
-Let's go, Sang-tae.
-What?

825
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:26,359
Let's just go and take some photos
for the book, then.

826
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:29,820
Yes, photos.

827
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:30,946
Let's take photos.

828
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,365
Yes.

829
01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:39,983
GANG-TAE

830
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:43,103
PHOTO STUDIO ADDRESS

831
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:14,824
-Hello!
-Hello.

832
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:15,908
Hello.

833
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:54,947
Are you okay?

834
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,615
Are you in a bad mood today?

835
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:58,367
I'm always in a bad mood.

836
01:07:58,451 --> 01:07:59,577
Don't worry about me.

837
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:03,164
Will my photo really be included
in the book?

838
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:05,666
Yes, of course. You're the illustrator.

839
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,418
Right, I am.

840
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:11,797
I practiced so many cool poses last night.

841
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:13,466
-You did?
-Yes.

842
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:14,759
Then show me.

843
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:18,512
One, two, three.

844
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:26,270
One, two... One, two, three!

845
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:34,111
Sang-tae.

846
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:35,613
Yes?

847
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:37,281
That's all fake.

848
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,459
You don't need to try so hard.

849
01:08:49,627 --> 01:08:52,004
Just relax and be yourself.

850
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,549
That's the real Moon Sang-tae.

851
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:59,220
"The real...

852
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:02,556
Moon Sang-tae"?

853
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:04,475
Yes.

854
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:07,061
"The real Moon Sang-tae"?

855
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:21,158
The lady can sit on the chair.

856
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:22,952
Sir, please stand next to her.

857
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,747
Great. Sir, could you stand
a little closer to her?

858
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:28,958
-Sure.
-Nice. That's perfect.

859
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,752
Now, look at the camera
and give me a big smile.

860
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:35,089
A big smile, please.
Eyes on the camera. Here we go!

861
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:37,591
-One, two--
-Oh, look!

862
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:39,218
Wait. Just a second, please.

863
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:43,722
My brother... My little brother is here.

864
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:48,602
My gosh, my brother...
That's my real brother.

865
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:29,935
I'm not

866
01:10:32,605 --> 01:10:33,772
too late, right?

867
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:58,088
