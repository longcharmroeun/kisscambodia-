3
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:32,707
I...

4
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,584
got suspended.

5
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,420
They're not going to
pay me during my suspension,

6
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,381
and I'm probably going to get sued.

7
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,343
Everything is so messed up.

8
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:47,513
You said before

9
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:49,890
you'll run away with me

10
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,393
whenever I want.

11
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:57,273
I want to

12
00:00:58,316 --> 00:00:59,442
go on a trip with you.

13
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,072
Right now.

14
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:12,246
Let's go.

15
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:40,608
CHAPTER 9
KING DONKEY EARS

16
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,947
Where should we go?

17
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,450
Don't you think it'd be nice to go abroad?

18
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,619
South America and Europe both sound nice.

19
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:55,081
Let's go somewhere hotter than here.
How about Africa?

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,833
Serengeti, the wildlife refuge.
What do you think?

21
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:05,800
"What in the world have I done?"

22
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:11,514
Is that...

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,849
what you're thinking right now?

24
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,103
No, not at all.

25
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:18,938
You'd better not be thinking that.

26
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,399
You impressed me by punching that guy

27
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,025
and even asked me to take you on a trip.

28
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,611
Don't tell me
you're starting to regret it.

29
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,656
No, of course not.

30
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:30,699
I'm not regretting it.

31
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,035
Then let's go to Serengeti.

32
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:36,914
I don't have a passport.

33
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,793
Are you from outer space?

34
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,296
-Who doesn't have a passport these days?
-Me. I don't.

35
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:49,051
-We can go to Jeju Island.
-We won't be able to return today.

36
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,636
"Return today"? Are you joking?

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,681
Last time, you offered to take me
to a mountain or a field.

38
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,015
That won't take more than a day.

39
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,642
Okay, fine.

40
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:58,728
Then for one night--

41
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,688
If we're spending the night,
let's take Sang-tae.

42
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:09,488
-What are you doing?
-Think carefully before you answer.

43
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:10,656
Stop the car.

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,617
Do you want to go for a day
or spend the night with me?

45
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:14,577
Stop the car!

46
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,162
Do you want to spend the night with me

47
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,457
or die with me?

48
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,959
Ko Mun-yeong!

49
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,973
Are you nuts? Why would you risk your life
to joke around?

50
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:39,768
Who says I'm joking around?

51
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:44,023
Please. At least count to three
before you do anything impulsive.

52
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,861
Did you count to three
before you punched that guy?

53
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,617
Get out.

54
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,786
If I stay with you,

55
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,079
it'll make me
want to crash into something.

56
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:50,965
Damn it! Gang-tae, that darn asshole!

57
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,300
He wanted to go on a trip.
Is he teasing me or what?

58
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:57,763
Is he really teasing me?

59
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:01,100
What the heck? How dare he tease me?

60
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:03,561
How am I going to get back at him?

61
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,488
Hey, buddy.

62
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:17,074
You're so strange these days.

63
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:19,577
I didn't have lunch.

64
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:21,787
You always skip meals,

65
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,914
and you quit your job
like it's your hobby.

66
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,626
But you punched someone today
and got suspended.

67
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,546
I'm surprised you have an appetite.

68
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:36,969
This is good.

69
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,557
Buddy, you must be sick in the mind.

70
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,767
Let's go get a checkup.

71
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:49,273
-Do you also think I'm a little strange?
-Not just a little. Very.

72
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,613
-What's the matter with me, Jae-su?
-It's the lunatic virus.

73
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:57,906
-"A virus"?
-That day,

74
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:02,286
when Ko Mun-yeong
hurt your hand with a knife,

75
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:07,041
her lunatic virus must have
entered your blood vessels

76
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:10,586
and totally messed up your brain.

77
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,260
You almost convinced me.

78
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,762
I almost thought of writing a novel.

79
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,183
-Do you know the word for that in English?
-"In English"?

80
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,310
Gosh, do you think I'm dumb?

81
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,104
You want to know what it is in English?

82
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,397
My gosh, come on.

83
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:32,191
It's "Nobel" as in
Nobel Prize in Literature.

84
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:34,193
My goodness, I guess you didn't know.

85
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,990
Yes, novel. That's what I said.
Novel Prize in Literature.

86
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:40,991
My gosh, seriously.

87
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:43,452
Okay, fine. My pronunciation sucked.
I admit that, okay?

88
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,246
-Jae-su.
-Yes, I know.

89
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,333
Gosh, that's enough.

90
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,876
End of conversation. Just drop it.

91
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:51,835
I...

92
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,296
want to have fun.

93
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,092
Sure. Why not?

94
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,136
It's been a while.
Let's go for a ride on Alberto.

95
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,221
Where do you want to go?

96
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:08,894
-Serengeti.
-Sereng... What?

97
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,939
He's not that kind of person.

98
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:14,984
He's a very patient guy.
I can't believe he punched someone.

99
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,568
It's just like when you fart.

100
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:18,946
If you hold it in 99 times

101
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,782
and finally let it out,
it could kill people.

102
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,535
You... You have no manners.

103
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,745
Don't talk about farting
when we're eating.

104
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:29,998
It's making me lose my appetite.

105
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,959
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

106
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,213
Eat... Eat your own side dishes.

107
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,968
But how did he end up punching someone?

108
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:44,555
Back in the days,
I also beat up guys who used to bully you.

109
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,724
He probably got angry for the same reason.

110
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:50,144
Back when I was young,
I had a crush on Sun-deok.

111
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,895
But I got rejected three times.

112
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,398
That's... That's quite a surprise.

113
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,984
But... But how did you reject him?

114
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,111
"I don't like you!
I really don't like you!"

115
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:00,612
That's how I rejected him.

116
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:04,283
He was very unusual
ever since he was young.

117
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,784
It was a 50-50 chance.

118
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,620
He was either a genius or an idiot,
so I just rejected him.

119
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,415
You regret it, don't you?

120
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,625
My goodness, how did you know?

121
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,170
I regret it very much.

122
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:18,964
Don't leave any food on your plate.

123
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,550
Did you see that?

124
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,719
She still has feelings for me.

125
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,846
Don't be delusional. Drink your soup.

126
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,309
Director.

127
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:34,855
I'm sorry for bothering you
during your meal.

128
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:36,899
But can you come with me for a moment?

129
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,485
What's going on?

130
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,695
-You can keep eating.
-Okay.

131
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:46,200
Why can't she get discharged?

132
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:48,118
We're not saying she can't get discharged.

133
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:49,995
-But there's a procedure--
-I don't care.

134
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,956
-Let's go.
-Please calm down.

135
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,793
-The director will be here--
-How do you expect us to calm down?

136
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,002
Her ex-husband...

137
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:00,964
We brought her to this hospital
so that jerk wouldn't find her.

138
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,759
But that lunatic managed to find her here.

139
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,971
You should just come with me
to the States.

140
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:09,765
You can get treated there.

141
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,850
No, I don't want to go.
Just go by yourself.

142
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,477
Stop complaining! Let's go!

143
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,356
If you must leave...

144
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:23,320
What? What do you want?

145
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,949
Our hospital administration
is handled over there.

146
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:28,867
You need to pay before you go.

147
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,414
-You need to pay.
-We'll pay, okay?

148
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:36,083
-Let's go, Mom.
-My goodness.

149
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,586
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

150
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,631
Hurry up. Come on.

151
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,553
Ms. Lee A-reum isn't ready
to get discharged.

152
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,514
Are you really going to let her leave?

153
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,311
What else can we do to stop her
from leaving?

154
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,773
Her family won't let her stay.

155
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,613
-Come here.
-What is it?

156
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:07,781
Be quiet.

157
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:10,826
Jeong-tae. Listen to me carefully.

158
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,119
I'm listening.

159
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,914
You see, A-reum...

160
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,082
What about her?

161
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:20,002
Well, the thing is, A-reum...

162
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,504
No! A-reum...

163
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,930
Hey, Jeong-tae.

164
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:36,435
You shouldn't let people find out
that you and A-reum are a couple.

165
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,896
So just try your best to hold it in.

166
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:42,107
-I'll try to find a way.
-Damn it.

167
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:46,737
Jeong-tae.

168
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:51,575
Tomorrow, someone who can help you
will show up from the west.

169
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,827
What? A ghost from the west?

170
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:57,414
Someone who can help him
will show up from the west.

171
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,625
A person. Not a ghost.

172
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,336
He snores, grinds his teeth, and farts.

173
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:04,713
He does it all simultaneously.
It's like a darn orchestra.

174
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,261
I bet every single hole
in Lee Sang-in's body opens up

175
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,514
when that guy goes to sleep.

176
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:17,768
My gosh, it's hilarious.

177
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,729
If you can't stand him,
you can sleep in our room.

178
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,230
-It's empty.
-Can I really do that?

179
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,487
-I also have a favor to ask you.
-"A favor"?

180
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,616
It's regarding Sang-tae.
Tomorrow, can you--

181
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:33,825
Sure.

182
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,162
-But I'm not done talking.
-There's no need to explain.

183
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,957
I'll help you out no matter what.

184
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,792
That's what you call loyalty.

185
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,044
Thanks.

186
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,005
Then who do you like more? Me or Sang-tae?

187
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,342
-Do I really need to answer that?
-What?

188
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,470
I'll see you.

189
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,144
I like you, too.

190
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,485
-"Those two guys are
-<i>Those two guys are</i>

191
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:11,029
-trying to take over our house.
-<i>trying to take over our house.</i>

192
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,073
-They're a pair of rascals."
-<i>They're a pair of rascals.</i>

193
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:14,116
I hate them.

194
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:18,537
I really hate Dooly and his friends.

195
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:22,124
It's not even their house,
but they do whatever they want.

196
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,668
I like Ko Gil-dong.

197
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:27,629
"Ko Gil-dong"?

198
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:31,258
He let those guys into his territory.

199
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,803
He's a nice guy.

200
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,432
-What do you think?
-I like him.

201
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:42,269
I... I also like Gil-dong.

202
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:46,064
This... This guy's name is Teary.
His real name is Ko Gil-dong.

203
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:48,775
His name is Teary. This right here
is actually a piece of thread,

204
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,819
but it's also a teardrop.
His name is Ko Gil-dong.

205
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,030
-Do you also like him?
-Yes.

206
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:56,575
Ko Gil-dong is a caregiver
for Dooly, Douner, and Ddochi.

207
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:59,828
I mean, he's their guardian,
and he gives them a place to sleep,

208
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,330
gives them food, and protects them.

209
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,000
Just for your information,
I'm Gang-tae's guardian.

210
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,170
And a guardian should be
dependable and trustworthy.

211
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:11,423
I'm an adult and his older brother.
That's who I am.

212
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,265
We really click, Sang-tae.

213
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,267
We're like best friends.

214
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,231
"Best friends"?

215
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,319
Best friends.

216
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,364
My gosh, we're best friends.

217
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,449
Yes, best friends.

218
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,659
Best friends.

219
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,498
Sang-tae, I'm home.

220
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:55,300
Can we talk?

221
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,305
Best friends.

222
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,066
Are we not going anywhere tomorrow?

223
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:17,197
Did you overreact like that earlier
to have fun for just one day?

224
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,492
One day is more than enough for me.

225
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,245
I dreamt of that day

226
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,541
my entire life.

227
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:36,716
You're so annoying.

228
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,221
So are we going tomorrow?

229
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,515
Sometimes,

230
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,060
you're like a tamer, not a caregiver.

231
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:48,812
"A tamer"?

232
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:51,857
I feel like you're taming me.

233
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,866
I think it's the opposite.

234
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,705
I keep doing things I wouldn't normally do

235
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,458
because of you.

236
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,254
<i>Earlier,</i>

237
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:17,340
<i>I couldn't hear</i>

238
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:21,136
<i>or see anything.</i>

239
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,060
I must have been out of my mind.

240
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,274
I really couldn't hold my anger.

241
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:38,278
No, you weren't out of your mind.

242
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,284
You were stunning.

243
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,657
Should we leave the house
tomorrow morning?

244
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,951
Yes, sure.

245
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,328
Good night.

246
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:39,172
I want to twist that deer's neck.

247
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,508
Shut up, you stupid deer!

248
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,833
Ju-ri.

249
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,794
Where are you going?

250
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,885
Seung-jae.

251
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,972
Have you ever been in a one-sided love?

252
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,892
No, I would never do something so dumb.

253
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,185
It's such a waste of time.

254
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,398
I know, right?

255
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,192
It's a waste of time.

256
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,695
You deserve way better.

257
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,033
-Do you know who I have a crush on?
-Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

258
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:53,496
I'm very slow when it comes to work.

259
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,334
But when it comes to love,
I'm very quick-witted.

260
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,881
Let's be honest and realistic.

261
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,966
You're a lot better than Mr. Moon.

262
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:08,136
He may be good-looking,
but he has absolutely nothing...

263
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:13,767
You're right.

264
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,063
He doesn't have anything to offer.

265
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,276
He really doesn't.

266
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:27,113
I must've thought

267
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,578
I could be the one to fill up

268
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,416
his empty life.

269
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:43,046
What's the matter with me?

270
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:51,721
I must be drunk.

271
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,057
Let's go inside after we finish this.

272
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,940
I personally think
you should be with a guy

273
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,403
who's older than you, and has a laid-back

274
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:11,241
and broad-minded personality,
with the characteristics of a businessman.

275
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,994
I'm sure you'll be able to find
a guy like that somewhere nearby.

276
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,933
She's finally doing her money's worth.

277
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,859
<i>No, you weren't out of your mind.</i>

278
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,069
You were stunning.

279
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:50,780
I must be out of my mind.

280
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,575
What?

281
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,036
No, it's nothing. Go back to bed.

282
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,123
-Go back to sleep.
-Okay.

283
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,546
If you're out of your mind,
you need to go to a hospital.

284
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,715
It means you're sick.

285
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,619
<i>I must have been out of my mind.</i>

286
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,163
I really couldn't hold my anger.

287
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,583
He shouldn't have held back
his desire either.

288
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:45,794
My gosh.

289
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:05,814
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

290
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:06,731
DIRECTOR O'S MUSIC CLASS

291
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:10,151
<i>-It's okay to not be okay</i>
<i>-It's okay to not be okay</i>

<i>-I'm really okay</i>
<i>-I'm really okay</i>

299
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:36,803
I love you guys.

300
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:40,557
THERAPY ROOM

301
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:52,151
It's sunny outside.

302
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,238
Why don't we go for a walk?

303
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:08,167
Sang-tae, I have plans today,
so I'm going to be a bit late.

304
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:12,463
So wait for me at Jae-su's.
I'll go pick you up in the evening.

305
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:16,009
"We really click, Sang-tae.
We're like best friends."

306
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,886
-What?
-Best friends.

307
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,764
Ms. Ko and I are best friends now.

308
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:25,268
That means we're buddies and besties.
It means we're really close.

309
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:29,147
Your best friend is Jae-su.
My best friend is Ms. Ko.

310
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:33,860
I also have a best friend now.
I have a best friend.

311
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,824
Don't you miss your daughter?

312
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,201
I heard her fairy tale class is
really fun.

313
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:44,996
Maybe I should watch her teach one day.

314
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:51,252
She's just like that woman.

315
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,672
-"That woman"?
-Everyone

316
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,384
got fooled by that woman.

317
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:01,763
She has the face of an angel.

318
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,641
But there lives a demon inside.

319
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,564
Everyone is good and bad.
We all live with both traits.

320
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,609
That woman is a monster.

321
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,195
She killed someone.

322
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,573
I'm telling you. She killed someone.

323
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:24,869
Where is that monster?

324
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:27,455
She's dead.

325
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,165
I killed her.

326
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:40,635
I'm sure

327
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:42,762
I killed her.

328
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:44,681
But she came back.

329
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,433
She came back to kill me.

330
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:50,520
She's going to kill me.

331
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,198
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>

332
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:05,952
Ms. Park Ok-ran.

333
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,830
You're not allowed in here.

334
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,665
Why were you reading this

335
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,376
when I wasn't done reading it myself?

336
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:18,923
Well, I was just...

337
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:23,886
See?

338
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:26,806
It's because you touched something
that wasn't yours.

339
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,058
I hate it

340
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,477
when people do that.

341
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:44,574
Are you okay?

342
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:48,244
Yes, I'm okay. It's just a paper cut.

343
00:24:48,327 --> 00:24:50,037
-I'll give you a bandage.
-No, it's okay.

344
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:53,958
By the way, I noticed that
Mr. Joo Jeong-tae went outside today.

345
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,668
Wasn't it Mr. Kan Pil-ong's turn?

346
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:57,295
Yes.

347
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:01,424
But Director O signed a permit
for Mr. Joo Jeong-tae this morning.

348
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:06,012
I bet someone made a deal
behind the curtain.

349
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:07,930
"A deal"?

350
00:25:10,224 --> 00:25:11,517
Are you ready?

351
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,395
I'm going in, okay?

352
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,954
Are you doing a circus show?

353
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:33,623
Are you running away?

354
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,667
I mean...
Can't you wear something comfortable?

355
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:38,669
I feel comfortable naked.

356
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,546
Don't you have anything normal?

357
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,465
-I don't want to look normal.
-Why not?

358
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:46,344
Because it's normal.

359
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:50,348
-At least wear comfortable shoes--
-What did you pack?

360
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:56,020
Are we evacuating?

361
00:25:56,103 --> 00:25:59,273
Well, we might get hungry
when we're outside...

362
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:02,568
My goodness.

363
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,322
Did a patient call you or something?

364
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:11,953
I just thought we might need it
just in case...

365
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,329
Don't make it so obvious

366
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,498
that this your first time going somewhere.

367
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:22,129
You just need to take care of me.

368
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:32,348
-Don't pick up.
-Hello?

369
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:34,725
Who is that jerk?

370
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,228
Two club sandwiches, please.

371
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:45,778
You should eat it while it's warm.

372
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,780
You had something urgent to tell me?

373
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:49,907
I can't talk properly when I'm hungry.

374
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:54,370
Do you have plans?

375
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:56,831
Yes.

376
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:58,833
A date with Ms. Ko?

377
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,088
I told you already.

378
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:08,301
I'm amazing
when it comes to reading people's minds.

379
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:12,930
Then

380
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,766
can I ask you something?

381
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,687
Go ahead.

382
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:25,818
What's the psychology
behind people who overdress

383
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:28,696
and wear things that are way too fancy?

384
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:32,825
I'm guessing it's because

385
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,661
they want to show off, right?

386
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,544
It's the opposite.
They want to protect themselves.

387
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:47,048
They think they're too weak,
so they use clothes for protection.

388
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,551
It's like an armor.

389
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:58,059
So you should do a good job
of protecting her.

390
00:27:58,142 --> 00:27:59,602
I'm talking about Ms. Ko.

391
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:09,987
My best friend...

392
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,032
When... When are we
going to have our meeting?

393
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:14,492
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

394
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:16,452
What kind of women
did Gang-tae hang out with?

395
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:24,043
Nurses, patients,

396
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:27,546
teachers at my school, landlords...

397
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,675
No, I'm not talking about
those kinds of women.

398
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,386
-What kind of women does he like?
-He doesn't like women.

399
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,223
-Does he like men?
-He likes me.

400
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:41,018
"You're my favorite person
in the whole world, Sang-tae."

401
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:42,937
Gang-tae only hangs out with me.

402
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,691
No wonder he doesn't know how to have fun.

403
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:52,071
I should make sure he has a blast.

404
00:28:52,154 --> 00:28:53,739
No. Mang-tae.

405
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:56,575
I gave you Mang-tae.

406
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,578
-What?
-You can play with Mang-tae.

407
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:00,955
Gang-tae will play with me.

408
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,374
And I... I will play with my best friend.

409
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,543
-Can't I play with Gang-tae?
-No, you can't.

410
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:08,337
Gang-tae can only have fun with me.
He's my little brother.

411
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:12,550
Do you also adore Gang-tae?

412
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,094
Yes, I really adore him.

413
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,723
He... He has beautiful eyes.
He has the most beautiful eyes ever.

414
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:21,517
Have you ever hated him?

415
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,734
I guess you have.

416
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,611
When did you hate Gang-tae?

417
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:38,075
Aren't you going to tell me?

418
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,873
Sang-tae.

419
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:47,668
Do you know the story called
<i>King Donkey Ears</i>?

420
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,422
Yes, the guy goes into the bamboo forest
and shouts,

421
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,632
"The king has donkey ears!"

422
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:56,427
Yes, that's right.
If you keep a secret to yourself,

423
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,554
you end up getting frustrated.

424
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:01,140
You need to tell someone
in order to relieve your stress.

425
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,437
When did you hate Gang-tae the most?

426
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:16,364
My phone is...

427
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,240
Hey, Jae-su.

428
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:21,202
I need to talk on the phone.

429
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,636
Maybe you were right about that.

430
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:42,973
You said that Ms. Ko's mother
may not be someone whom she misses

431
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:46,352
but someone whom she still fears.

432
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:49,021
It's just my guess.

433
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:53,442
We can't trust everything
that a dementia patient says,

434
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:56,570
but that doesn't mean we can entirely
rule out the possibility.

435
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,114
What if

436
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:01,575
the writer Do Hui-jae actually isn't dead?

437
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:03,619
What if she just disappeared?

438
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:04,995
Then we know one thing for sure.

439
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:09,875
She'll definitely come back
to see her husband and daughter.

440
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,046
Let's hope I'm worried for nothing,

441
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,383
but just in case,

442
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:19,426
I wanted to ask you

443
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:23,139
to protect Ms. Ko and be there for her.

444
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,855
"NONSTOP" BY OH MY GIRL

445
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,402
Your brother is very calculating.

446
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:38,779
What do you mean?

447
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,116
He's all about give and take.
He doesn't give away anything for free.

448
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:46,745
Isn't that why you guys are best friends?
Because you two are alike.

449
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:10,811
Aren't you scared of riding motorcycles?

450
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,354
No, it doesn't. Hand me the helmet.

451
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,190
It's so scary.

452
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,691
-Jeez.
-Super scary!

453
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:18,777
Wait up!

454
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,324
Isn't it so nice to be home for a change?

455
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:25,951
Ms. Kang will throw a <i>samgyeopsal</i> party
for you this evening.

456
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,287
Why are you following me, Jae-su?

457
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:29,872
To hang out with you.

458
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,583
So you want me to leave?

459
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,586
You're so mean.

460
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,546
I closed up the restaurant for the day

461
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,423
and drove Alberto
all the way up the mountain

462
00:32:39,506 --> 00:32:41,300
in this heatwave just to pick you up.

463
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:42,593
Right. You did that, boss.

464
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,095
Yes! I am your boss.

465
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,724
What kind of part-timer wants to hang out
with his boss at his place?

466
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:56,607
What?

467
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:01,654
What's that?
Is Ms. Kang making kimchi already?

468
00:33:01,737 --> 00:33:03,030
Kimchi is made in the winter.

469
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:04,907
November 7th is the first day of winter.

470
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:10,704
My, I feel so refreshed.

471
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,874
Gosh, our very own illustrator

472
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,919
Mr. Moon is here.

473
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:20,130
Hello! Mr. Lee Sang-in,
the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers.

474
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:22,007
-Hello.
-What on earth are you doing here

475
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:24,760
half-naked in broad daylight?

476
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,512
As you can see, I'm enjoying my vacation.

477
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:30,224
Usually, I book a resort overseas
every summer

478
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,560
and do nothing but read books
for about a month.

479
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,105
This was not planned, but I ended up
spending my summer like this here.

480
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,985
Mr. Moon, take a dip.

481
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:42,861
-It's so refreshing.
-No, I don't want to.

482
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:44,280
I don't like water. I hate water.

483
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:45,864
Jeez, why did you do that?

484
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:47,700
Wait, Sang-tae. Wait up!

485
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:55,291
Where are we headed?

486
00:33:55,457 --> 00:33:57,084
You wanted to see
the mountains and fields.

487
00:33:57,459 --> 00:33:58,877
Then I guess the mountains first?

488
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,564
Is this the deviation
you've been dreaming of?

489
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,359
Are we going to tie a rope
around our ankle and jump or something?

490
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:24,987
Shall we?

491
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:28,073
-Let's go.
-No.

492
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,326
Why not?

493
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:31,577
I'm scared.

494
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,789
-Why are you laughing?
-Well...

495
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:37,750
Hearing you say the word, "scared"--

496
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,834
You think it's funny?

497
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,337
Do you think it'll be fun
to cross this stupid bridge?

498
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:45,299
I just

499
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:48,802
wanted to come up high
and enjoy an open view.

500
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,056
I can't come here with Sang-tae.

501
00:34:56,685 --> 00:34:57,895
I saw it, so it's all good now.

502
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,104
Let's go back down.

503
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,065
So you're saying

504
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,567
you can't hang out
with Sang-tae like this?

505
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,945
Okay, fine. Let's do this.

506
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,450
But carry me on your back.

507
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:17,706
Wait here. I'll be right back.

508
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,710
Hey! Carry me on your back!

509
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,546
I said, carry me!
Give me a piggyback ride!

510
00:35:25,214 --> 00:35:27,091
Darn it. Crap.

511
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,221
Shit! It's shaky.

512
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,766
That's why it's called the Shaky Bridge.

513
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,393
Why is it freaking shaky?

514
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:39,978
Wait up.

515
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:42,314
Why don't you sing a song
if you're scared?

516
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,774
A song?

517
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:48,570
<i>If I</i>

518
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:51,407
<i>Feel lonely</i>

519
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,784
<i>If I</i>

520
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:54,702
Stop.

521
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:56,495
Why?

522
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:58,205
You sound scary.

523
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,331
Do you have a death wish?

524
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,335
<i>If I</i>

525
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,087
Gosh, I'm hungry.

526
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:06,672
What will you feed me?

527
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:09,758
Since we're in the mountains...

528
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:11,427
How about raw squid?

529
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,512
-What?
-Well, let's see.

530
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:15,097
Is there a good restaurant nearby?

531
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,356
Go stand over there.
I'll take a picture of you.

532
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,774
You said you're hungry.

533
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:27,276
Come on.

534
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,117
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

535
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,830
I told you to smile, not cry.

536
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:41,540
Just take it, will you?

537
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,251
Strike a cool pose.

538
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,346
Enough. I don't want photos.

539
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:58,766
Okay. If it's embarrassing,
I'll take it with you.

540
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,683
Sit back down.

541
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:02,311
Sit down.

542
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:05,898
One, two, three.

543
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,194
Smile. Don't cry.

544
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:22,372
Hello?

545
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:31,965
We were told to expect someone
who can help us from the west.

546
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:33,842
It was true.

547
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,178
My gosh.

548
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:39,389
What is going...

549
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,393
Can you explain this?

550
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:46,188
Oh, what happened was...

551
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:48,982
You know, I'm supposed
to stay out overnight tomorrow.

552
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,901
Can Jeong-tae go instead? Joo Jeong-tae.

553
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:54,571
A-reum!

554
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:57,824
<i>We just got into a taxi</i>

555
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,660
<i>and said we'd go as far as we could.</i>

556
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,371
<i>That's why we ended up here.</i>

557
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,332
181,800 WON

558
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:18,136
CHEAP GUESTHOUSE
300M

559
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,016
We spent all the money we had
on the taxi ride,

560
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,893
so we couldn't pay for the room.

561
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:27,813
-We're totally broke.
-That's right.

562
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:30,899
How did you get my number?

563
00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:36,029
This reads,
"Call in case of an emergency."

564
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,076
EMERGENCY CONTACTS

565
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,829
Out of everyone here,
you're the closest to me.

566
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:47,958
Spending time with a patient
outside the hospital--

567
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,627
It's not allowed.
I know that it's against the rules.

568
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,838
So just lend us some money
to pay for the room.

569
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,090
It was hard for me to get out for a night.

570
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:58,218
I'll stay here with A-reum
just for the night

571
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,720
and return to the hospital tomorrow.

572
00:39:00,762 --> 00:39:02,180
They also accept credit cards.

573
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:06,977
No, I can't do that.

574
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:09,146
-Why not?
-Why can't you?

575
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:10,939
Strictly speaking, this is all your fault.

576
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,150
Patients can't date one another,

577
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,277
so you told me
to just hold back my feelings.

578
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,487
-So I listened to you and did just that.
-Right.

579
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,115
But when A-reum's ex-husband
slapped Ms. Ko in the face,

580
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:22,576
-what did you do?
-He didn't hold himself back.

581
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,078
Well, in that moment--

582
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,205
Because you punched him,

583
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:29,333
A-reum's parents came to see her
at the hospital,

584
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,500
and they discharged her.

585
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:32,336
That means we will have to
part ways tomorrow.

586
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:36,214
And you can't even pay
for us to stay here for a night?

587
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,302
This is so cruel.

588
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:42,763
Very cruel, indeed.

589
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:46,725
Apologize to them.

590
00:39:48,477 --> 00:39:49,895
It looks like it was your fault.

591
00:39:50,646 --> 00:39:52,314
I paid for the room next to theirs.

592
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:56,777
Hey.

593
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,075
I told you that we can't stay overnight.

594
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,952
My gosh, are you Cinderella or what?

595
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:11,458
Sleep here by yourself.

596
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,002
I bet they'll elope tomorrow.

597
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,130
The woman will move to the States soon,

598
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:20,801
and the man has to return
to the psychiatric hospital tomorrow.

599
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:23,303
I mean, look at those eyes.

600
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,305
Do you think they can be apart?

601
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:31,728
Your rationality can never win
against your desires.

602
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:39,069
Will you let the patient run away?
How irresponsible.

603
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:43,865
Or will you break them apart
despite knowing how in love they are?

604
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:45,701
That's so cruel.

605
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:50,372
Let's just stay with them here tonight.

606
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:53,875
That way, you can take him back
to the hospital tomorrow.

607
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:55,335
Right, Mr. Caregiver?

608
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,138
I've been

609
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:08,014
suspended from work,

610
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,100
so I refuse to work.

611
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:24,072
See? We're so screwed.

612
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:25,866
We'll be okay, A-reum.

613
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:37,502
All right.

614
00:41:37,627 --> 00:41:39,296
Do you guys know
when Gang-tae will be here?

615
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:41,673
It'd be nice if he could join us.

616
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:44,843
-Well, he'll get here pretty late.
-Did he get a part-time job again?

617
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:46,595
No, he had to meet someone.

618
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:47,512
Who?

619
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:49,639
Oh, I'm sure he's out
meeting up with people he knows.

620
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:51,600
He has lots of time
now that he's been suspended,

621
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,519
-so he's probably out clearing his head.
-Gosh, that's good.

622
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,647
When will he get to take it easy
if not now?

623
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:00,192
My gosh,
you've been grilling meat nonstop.

624
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:02,194
Here, Ju-ri. Have some.

625
00:42:02,277 --> 00:42:03,737
I'll eat it myself.

626
00:42:05,113 --> 00:42:08,533
Gosh, this is embarrassing.
Even my arm is getting tired.

627
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:10,076
Don't be like that. Just eat this.

628
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,078
Here.

629
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,913
Why are you being like this, seriously?

630
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:23,965
Are you enjoying working with Ms. Ko?

631
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:25,467
We will work later.

632
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,928
"Later" means sometime before you die.

633
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,805
What? Before you die?

634
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,391
Jeez, so she's working on a book
that will be published posthumously?

635
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,019
Gosh, Mun-yeong...

636
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:38,313
Have you two gotten quite close?

637
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:40,190
Yes, we're best friends now.

638
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:42,108
Best friends don't keep secrets
from each other.

639
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:44,069
Then you should've brought her.

640
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:46,363
I told her I'd love
to invite her over for a meal one day.

641
00:42:46,446 --> 00:42:48,824
She said no.
She went somewhere fun by herself.

642
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:51,701
I... I would've been happy
to hang out with her.

643
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,620
You didn't want to hang out with me.

644
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:55,997
You're really hurting my feelings,
Sang-tae.

645
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:57,999
That's very odd.

646
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:01,002
She wouldn't want to go out in this heat.

647
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:04,172
Maybe they went together.
Ms. Ko and Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

648
00:43:18,186 --> 00:43:20,063
You sure work in publishing.

649
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:25,152
You're incredibly creative, Seung-jae.

650
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:27,028
Right? She really is.

651
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:29,698
Hey, maybe I should have you sign
a publishing contract as a writer.

652
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:36,872
Well, how about a beer for everyone?

653
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:38,039
I'd love that.

654
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:39,249
I'll go.

655
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:46,464
I'll give her a hand.

656
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:52,637
Mr. Lee, do you mind picking up
some coffee milk for me?

657
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:53,680
You crazy little brat...

658
00:43:59,394 --> 00:44:01,938
They're probably together now, right?

659
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,026
Gang-tae and Mun-yeong.

660
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:08,194
Not sure.

661
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:11,197
And who cares?

662
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,159
I mean, you're with me now.

663
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,752
I'm beginning to understand
why Mun-yeong has stuck around you

664
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:25,754
for so long.

665
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:27,839
That's a compliment, right?

666
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:35,055
But to tell you the truth,
it's actually the other way around.

667
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,390
I'm the one that's sticking around her.

668
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,060
Why?

669
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,230
Well...

670
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,401
Because she cannot be left alone.

671
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:52,989
She's very lonely.

672
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,369
But she doesn't want anyone to know that,

673
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:59,829
so she pushes people away.

674
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,957
She's complicated.

675
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:12,884
I have to say, they're so alike.

676
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,390
Do you think that's why
they're attracted to each other?

677
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:21,559
Ju-ri.

678
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:24,980
There can be countless reasons

679
00:45:25,814 --> 00:45:27,649
as to why we fall for someone.

680
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,193
For example, you might fall for
how pretty they look when they cry.

681
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,114
Or you might fall for them
when they get drunk and swear at you.

682
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:37,158
Or it might be when they
unexpectedly slap you in the face.

683
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:45,041
Mr. Moon must've also

684
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:47,210
found some kind of reason

685
00:45:49,004 --> 00:45:51,047
to fall for Mun-yeong.

686
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:14,270
The owner of this guesthouse said
we can drink this.

687
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:15,896
She made this fruit marmalade herself.

688
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,570
You haven't called him yet?
Shall I call him?

689
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:23,571
No, don't.

690
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:25,281
I'll go call him now.

691
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:41,046
Hey.

692
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:44,008
Did you eat dinner?

693
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:46,093
Yes, we had <i>samgyeopsal</i>.

694
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:47,887
<i>My gosh, you guys must've had a feast.</i>

695
00:46:48,512 --> 00:46:49,597
<i>What are you up to now?</i>

696
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:51,557
What are you up to?

697
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,434
What? Me?

698
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:55,686
Well, I'm...

699
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:00,858
I'm chatting with you on the phone.

700
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,860
<i>When will you be back?</i>

701
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:07,239
Oh, I'll be back very late.

702
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:09,784
Around midnight? Or around 1 or 2 a.m.?

703
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:15,372
No, I may have to sleep here tonight.

704
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:18,626
Don't wait for me.
Just go to bed, Sang-tae.

705
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:22,922
And make sure you close the window screens
before you go to bed.

706
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:25,132
Don't sleep on the floor.

707
00:47:25,841 --> 00:47:27,259
<i>Also, make sure the fan is rotating.</i>

708
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,096
<i>If you get bored</i>

709
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:33,349
<i>or can't fall asleep, call me.</i>

710
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:40,439
<i>You too.</i>

711
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,235
Call me if you get bored.

712
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:09,552
Oh, I've seen that face on TV dramas.

713
00:48:10,177 --> 00:48:11,011
What do you mean?

714
00:48:11,595 --> 00:48:13,389
The face of a man
who is cheating on his wife.

715
00:48:21,188 --> 00:48:22,731
I don't want to be a mistress.

716
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:23,983
I want to be a faithful wife.

717
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:25,150
But those two

718
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:27,236
can't be best friends, can they?

719
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:34,451
Sang-tae was happy

720
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:37,037
about being best friends with you.

721
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:40,875
Well...

722
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:43,377
I'm also fond of your brother.

723
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:45,421
He's cute.

724
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:56,891
There was something

725
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:00,853
my mom wished for her whole life.

726
00:49:03,898 --> 00:49:05,316
Seeing Sang-tae with a friend.

727
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:11,906
A real friend who truly understands him.

728
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:14,825
Just one.

729
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:23,000
I had a friend like that
a long time ago as well.

730
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:26,420
A friend who understands me.

731
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:43,312
<i>THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES</i>

732
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:47,691
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

733
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,402
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

734
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:52,988
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

735
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:55,824
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

736
00:49:55,908 --> 00:49:57,117
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Gosh!

737
00:49:57,993 --> 00:50:00,162
-Look at that!
-Hilarious!

738
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:01,330
What an idiot.

739
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:02,539
<i>That girl</i>

740
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:06,001
-<i>was afraid of her classmates.</i>
-<i>Nam Ju-ri is a crybaby</i>

741
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:09,213
-<i>Nam Ju-ri is a crybaby</i>
-<i>Nam Ju-ri is a crybaby</i>

742

-<i>Nam Ju-ri is an idiot</i>
-<i>Nam Ju-ri is an idiot</i>

743
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:13,634
<i>But those kids</i>

744
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:15,970
<i>were afraid of me.</i>

745
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:33,529
Get lost.

746
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:36,323
Hey. Shall we

747
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:39,201
become friends?

748
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:47,376
<i>I liked it because I was no longer bored.</i>

749
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:49,253
<i>And she liked it</i>

750
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:52,047
<i>because her classmates
no longer bullied her.</i>

751
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,677
<i>But the thing is...</i>

752
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,720
Ready or not!

753
00:50:57,803 --> 00:51:00,597
-Rock-paper-scissors! I won!
-<i>She didn't want just one friend.</i>

754
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:03,934
<i>She wanted to be everyone's friend.</i>

755
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:06,437
<i>And I</i>

756
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:09,314
-<i>didn't like that.</i>
-We won!

757
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:11,984
So?

758
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:15,988
Did you harass those kids?

759
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:17,865
Yes.

760
00:51:18,782 --> 00:51:20,617
I thought she'd only be friends with me

761
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:23,662
if she became lonely again.

762
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:25,414
Let's do it together.

763
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:34,381
What do you think? Did I do a good job?

764
00:51:52,316 --> 00:51:53,817
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

765
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:08,040
Don't... Don't come close.

766
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:12,503
Go away.

767
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:16,340
I said, go away!

768
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:21,804
Please.

769
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:24,973
Please go away.

770
00:52:41,406 --> 00:52:43,826
A friend who truly understands you

771
00:52:45,744 --> 00:52:47,079
does not exist.

772
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:50,624
You should reconcile with her.

773
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:52,251
I don't want to.

774
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:57,714
-Why not?
-Because I have a best friend now.

775
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:03,512
And I also have you.

776
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:08,308
Hey.

777
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:10,936
Your cheeks are...

778
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:12,229
Goodness.

779
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:24,032
-What's wrong?
-This is booze.

780
00:53:24,116 --> 00:53:24,950
What?

781
00:53:25,742 --> 00:53:27,828
No, the lady said
it's raspberry marmalade.

782
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:30,205
I guess she didn't put in enough sugar.

783
00:53:32,124 --> 00:53:33,417
No, Jeong-tae!

784
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:35,419
I won't drink this.

785
00:53:35,502 --> 00:53:37,629
You saw me spitting it out just now.

786
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:52,269
Hey.

787
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:55,856
Go sleep in the other room

788
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:57,816
and send Jeong-tae here.

789
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,694
Those lovebirds
have to part ways tomorrow,

790
00:54:00,777 --> 00:54:01,945
so just leave them be.

791
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:07,159
Don't turn your back on me.

792
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:21,089
I see that you smile a lot like an idiot

793
00:54:21,173 --> 00:54:22,758
when you're drunk.

794
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:28,597
I have fun

795
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:30,557
when I'm with you.

796
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:36,313
I keep on smiling.

797
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:42,361
This won't do.

798
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:44,738
What do you mean?

799
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,534
-Hey.
-What's the matter?

800
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:51,620
-Come here.
-Why are you being like this?

801
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:53,580
-Who's more in love?
-Calm down, please.

802
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:55,666
The one who's more patient.

803
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:56,875
-Ko Mun-yeong!
-Moon Gang-tae!

804
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,919
Why?

805
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,340
Because love is all about patience.

806
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:22,985
Okay, fine. Let go of me now.

807
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:23,944
I'll just go to sleep.

808
00:55:27,155 --> 00:55:28,782
I said I'll go to sleep.

809
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,840
Please.

810
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:47,592
Stay still and just go to sleep.

811
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:55,267
Come on. Just sleep.

812
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,271
I heard you can fall asleep easily

813
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,316
when someone caresses your hair.

814
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:48,570
CHEAP GUESTHOUSE

815
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:01,708
I told you

816
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:06,505
that I can no longer

817
00:57:08,882 --> 00:57:10,509
hold myself back.

818
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:18,433
I guess

819
00:57:21,645 --> 00:57:23,230
I can't run away anymore.

820
00:57:38,578 --> 00:57:42,165
Don't go. Don't leave me, Mom.

821
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:46,253
Gang-tae, I'm here.

822
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:50,424
I'm here. Don't leave me.

823
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:16,450
Moon Gang-tae!

824
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:22,414
Moon Gang-tae!

825
00:58:29,754 --> 00:58:31,006
Don't go.

826
00:58:31,298 --> 00:58:32,716
Don't go...

827
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,605
MY BROTHER

828
00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:57,449
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

829
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,251
Moon Gang-tae!

830
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:12,047
Moon Gang-tae...

831
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:29,689
Where were you?

832
00:59:30,816 --> 00:59:31,650
Well...

833
00:59:34,194 --> 00:59:35,820
To get what I couldn't give you last time.

834
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:37,322
What?

835
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:53,046
Don't trample on them this time.

836
00:59:55,382 --> 00:59:56,675
They're beautiful.

837
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:01,388
So are you.

838
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:42,447
Oh, you guys are still here.

839
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,950
The other couple
left early in the morning.

840
01:01:45,033 --> 01:01:47,118
Pardon me?
Their shoes are still here though.

841
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,454
I have no idea.

842
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,584
Gang-tae.

843
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:07,514
With this, we can stay together for
a month without worrying about anything.

844
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,266
I thought we'd have to part ways
in the morning,

845
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,060
so I didn't get any sleep last night.

846
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:16,022
Who knew Ms. Ko would give us money
so that we could run away together?

847
01:02:16,272 --> 01:02:17,774
Isn't she so cool?

848
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,988
-A-reum.
-What is it?

849
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,281
I really don't think

850
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:27,575
this is right.

851
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:29,536
What do you mean?

852
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:30,954
Running away like this

853
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:34,624
will turn our love into nothing
but a petty and cowardly act.

854
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:38,002
-What are you talking about?
-You see...

855
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:41,381
The truth is,
I still go crazy when I see alcohol.

856
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:44,008
Even last night,
I struggled to restrain myself.

857
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:46,845
Had you not been with me,

858
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:48,722
I would've drunk until I dropped.

859
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:50,974
I have not yet

860
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,644
recovered enough to take care of you

861
01:02:56,187 --> 01:02:57,939
and be responsible for your happiness.

862
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:01,818
We can just try our best together.

863
01:03:11,995 --> 01:03:14,956
No, I need to get through this on my own.

864
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:17,292
I will get through this.

865
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:20,003
I promise you that I'll fully recover

866
01:03:20,962 --> 01:03:22,464
and come to you.

867
01:03:24,215 --> 01:03:25,508
So please

868
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,764
wait for me. I won't take long.

869
01:04:08,718 --> 01:04:12,680
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

870
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:22,148
Thanks so much, Gang-tae.

871
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:24,025
I owe you one.

872
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:34,327
Is he a fool?

873
01:04:35,078 --> 01:04:36,955
Why let her go if he loves her?

874
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:38,998
Because he loves her a lot.

875
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,502
Sometimes, that's why
you must let someone go.

876
01:04:43,628 --> 01:04:45,505
So they broke up
because they love each other?

877
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:47,173
That's complete bullshit.

878
01:04:50,218 --> 01:04:52,095
I will never let you go.

879
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:54,681
Don't be so sure of it.

880
01:04:55,473 --> 01:04:57,100
You never know what could happen.

881
01:04:59,227 --> 01:05:00,728
I'll go check in on Sang-tae.

882
01:05:01,312 --> 01:05:03,273
Be quick.
I'll kill you if you take too long.

883
01:05:23,543 --> 01:05:24,419
Are you serious?

884
01:05:24,794 --> 01:05:27,130
Mr. Moon and Ms. Ko came together?

885
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:30,842
Yes, he must've been
that special someone from the west.

886
01:05:31,134 --> 01:05:33,887
Thanks to them, A-reum and I
made some unforgettable memories.

887
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:34,888
Really?

888
01:05:35,847 --> 01:05:38,600
That means they're seeing each other.

889
01:05:38,683 --> 01:05:39,809
Yes.

890
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:42,103
It might be fun to plan a double wedding
down the road.

891
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,731
-Would you officiate our wedding?
-My gosh.

892
01:05:44,814 --> 01:05:46,190
-Me?
-Yes.

893
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:56,409
It's almost done.

894
01:05:57,118 --> 01:05:59,162
Why didn't you pick up?

895
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:00,330
What?

896
01:06:02,707 --> 01:06:04,834
Oh, my phone is dead.

897
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:06,252
You called?

898
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:08,296
Yes, 4 times. No, 9... It was 17 times.

899
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,673
Why? Did something happen?

900
01:06:14,886 --> 01:06:17,597
Where have you been? Where...

901
01:06:19,432 --> 01:06:20,808
I told you

902
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:22,977
that I had to go to Seoul to see someone.

903
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:25,146
By yourself?

904
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,523
Yes, by myself.

905
01:06:31,903 --> 01:06:33,196
I can change the water for you.

906
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:35,240
No, one must take care of one's own tasks.

907
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:37,242
One must take care of one's own tasks.

908
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:39,494
One must take care of one's own tasks.

909
01:06:54,634 --> 01:06:56,511
Big news! You need to hear this.

910
01:06:58,262 --> 01:07:01,307
Mr. O, please be quiet
when you're inside the hospital.

911
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:04,102
Gosh, whatever. That's not important now.

912
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:06,187
-Hey, follow me.
-Ms. Park.

913
01:07:06,813 --> 01:07:09,941
I'm going to tell you something,
but you two must keep it to yourselves.

914
01:07:19,993 --> 01:07:22,078
I'm starving. What's taking him so long?

915
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:46,227
Dr. Kwon, you're a psychiatrist,

916
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,979
so I can trust
that you're discreet, right?

917
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,689
Yes, sure.

918
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,986
What I'm about to tell you
must stay between us, okay?

919
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:01,409
Mr. Moon Gang-tae and Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
are getting married soon.

920
01:08:01,492 --> 01:08:02,952
-What?
-Seriously, for real.

921
01:08:03,036 --> 01:08:05,705
Apparently, Mr. Joo Jeong-tae
saw them on a trip together.

922
01:08:05,788 --> 01:08:08,666
They even slept in the same room
at a guesthouse, so they're obviously...

923
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:39,447
My gosh, that looks amazing.

924
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:46,204
Did the three of you go on a trip
in a camping car?

925
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:47,955
No.

926
01:08:49,415 --> 01:08:51,334
Then did you, by any chance,

927
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:54,003
run into Mr. Joo Jeong-tae
outside the hospital?

928
01:08:56,839 --> 01:08:59,467
No, I ran into him
in front of the hospital.

929
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:00,760
You're lying.

930
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:07,642
I told you not to lie.

931
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,773
Sang-tae, what's the matter?

932
01:09:17,443 --> 01:09:19,862
Who do you like more?
Me or Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

933
01:09:24,075 --> 01:09:25,034
Why do you ask?

934
01:09:25,118 --> 01:09:27,286
Who do you like more?
Me or Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

935
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,914
My gosh. He likes you more, of course.

936
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:33,876
I want you to answer my question.
Answer my question!

937
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:42,760
Of course,

938
01:09:45,805 --> 01:09:47,098
I like you more.

939
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,689
No, that's a lie.

940
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:58,568
It's a lie. It's all a lie.

941
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:00,194
-No, I mean it.
-It's a lie.

942
01:10:00,278 --> 01:10:01,529
I told you not to lie!

943
01:10:01,612 --> 01:10:05,158
Don't lie to me! It's all a lie.

944
01:10:07,994 --> 01:10:08,995
No.

945
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:11,289
Sang-tae.

946
01:10:12,748 --> 01:10:13,833
I'm not lying.

947
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:21,757
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

948
01:10:22,049 --> 01:10:24,552
I won't do it again, okay?

949
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:26,387
"I want him to die.

950
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:29,974
My brother...

951
01:10:31,184 --> 01:10:33,186
I just want my brother to die!

952
01:10:33,269 --> 01:10:36,063
I just want my brother to die."
You said that.

953
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,859
You said you wanted me gone.

954
01:10:40,276 --> 01:10:43,654
You said to Mom every day
that you wanted me to die.

955
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:46,699
That's why you pushed me into the river
that day.

956
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:49,702
I shouted for help.

957
01:10:50,203 --> 01:10:53,122
I shouted... I kept crying for help,

958
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:54,332
but you ran away.

959
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:56,542
You left me alone in the water
and ran away.

960
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:59,754
You wanted me dead. Every single day...

961
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:03,299
I bet you wanted to kill me.

962
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,344
-No...
-Everyone.

963
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:12,975
Listen, everyone!
He's trying to kill his older brother!

964
01:11:14,227 --> 01:11:16,687
-No.
-Everyone!

965
01:11:17,313 --> 01:11:19,857
He's trying to kill his older brother!

966
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:21,067
No...

967
01:11:22,818 --> 01:11:28,407
Listen, people! He is...
He's trying to kill his older brother!

968
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:29,909
No, that's not true.

969
01:11:30,326 --> 01:11:31,369
No...

970
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:33,829
-No...
-Listen, people!

971
01:11:34,997 --> 01:11:40,586
Everyone,
He's trying to kill his older brother!

972
01:11:41,712 --> 01:11:42,672
-No...
-Everyone, listen.

973
01:11:42,755 --> 01:11:44,924
-No.
-My brother...

974
01:11:45,007 --> 01:11:48,052
Listen,
he's trying to kill his older brother!

975
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:49,136
No, that's not true.

976
01:11:50,638 --> 01:11:53,474
Listen to me.

977
01:11:53,558 --> 01:11:57,645
-Sang-tae, no.
-He's trying to kill his older brother!

978
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,523
It's not true.

979
01:12:00,606 --> 01:12:02,108
No, that's not true.

980
01:12:03,776 --> 01:12:07,989
No, Sang-tae. That's not true.

981
01:12:08,072 --> 01:12:10,366
I'm not lying.

982
01:12:10,783 --> 01:12:12,576
Sang-tae.

IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY

986
01:12:54,577 --> 01:12:55,911
Why did you save me?

987
01:12:56,912 --> 01:12:58,289
You should've just left me to die.

988
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:02,585
Try your best to stay strong. Who knows?

989
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,087
Sang-tae might be the one
to help you one day.

990
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:06,130
I...

991
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:08,591
had a dream.

992
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:09,550
What you just said

993
01:13:10,968 --> 01:13:11,927
sounds like you

994
01:13:12,803 --> 01:13:14,055
begging me to stop you.

995
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:16,849
I miss him.

996
01:13:18,017 --> 01:13:21,228
It seems like you know
a lot about Do Hui-jae.

997
01:13:21,312 --> 01:13:24,315
Should I just kill him?
