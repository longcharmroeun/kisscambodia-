<i>My brother is already a handful.</i>

<i>I'm already having a hard time
bearing with him, so please...</i>

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,034
Please stop stirring up my miserable life.

7
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,121
And get lost.

CHAPTER 11
THE UGLY DUCKLING

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,659
What about Ms. Park Ok-ran?
Where is she now?

10
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,495
What do we do? It looks like she escaped.

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,164
Call the police station nearby. Hurry.

12
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,999
-Come with me.
-Okay.

13
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:51,337
GANG-TAE

14
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,777
You obviously didn't get all dressed up

15
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,613
and come here at this late hour
just for a cup of tea.

16
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,741
What do you want?

17
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:35,923
Darn it.

18
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,184
How nice.

19
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,857
The smell of old books.

20
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,834
These flowers are dead.

21
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,670
You should toss out dead things.

22
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,344
Don't touch my stuff.

23
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,480
What brings you here?

24
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,025
I was worried

25
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,360
that you'd be lonely.

26
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,875
<i>Ko Mun-yeong.</i>

27
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,627
<i>Mun-yeong.</i>

28
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:57,922
Earlier today,

29
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,759
your father tried to kill me.

30
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,262
He called me

31
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,640
a monster.

32
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,477
He said all monsters must be killed.

33
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:15,606
He also said he should've killed
his daughter too that day.

34
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,275
He completely lashed out at me.

35
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,444
You didn't know, did you?

36
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,741
-So what?
-It's just too cruel.

37
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,495
He's a father.
On his daughter's birthday of all days...

38
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,955
Gosh.

39
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,916
How could he say such a thing?

40
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:39,463
So I thought I should come by
to make you feel better

41
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,968
and wish you a happy birthday.

42
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,930
It's lonely to spend a day like this

43
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:50,266
all by yourself.

44
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,686
-But why do you care?
-Because I'm a fan.

45
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:56,730
Your mother.

46
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:58,857
I'm a fan of hers.

47
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:01,860
This is pretty.

48
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,577
I clearly told you

49
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,663
not to touch my stuff.

50
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,672
We're alike.

51
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
I also

52
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,594
hate it when people touch my stuff.

53
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,918
Ko Mun-yeong!

54
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,671
Ko Mun-yeong!

55
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,885
Where...

56
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,565
Ko Mun-yeong.

57
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,570
Moon Gang-tae?

58
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:48,801
Thank goodness.

59
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,470
I'm so glad you're okay.

60
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,100
Thank goodness.

61
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:03,982
Are you all right?

62
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,443
Are you hurt?

63
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,451
-That lady, Park Ok-ran--
-Where is she?

64
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,496
Where is she now?

65
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,417
-She left.
-When? Where did she go?

66
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,211
When did she leave?

67
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,797
Just now.

68
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,054
Did you

69
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,516
come here to catch that escaped patient?

70
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,185
Not because of me?

71
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,939
Not because you missed me?

72
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,992
So you obviously
put your brother before me,

73
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,789
and even that patient
is more important to you than I am.

74
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:07,463
Ko Mun-yeong.

75
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,775
He followed that patient here,

76
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,735
so why the hell did he hug me?

77
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,501
<i>Please.</i>

78
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,712
<i>At least count to three
before you do anything impulsive.</i>

79
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:57,513
-One.
-Oh, no.

80
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,848
Is your hand okay?

81
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,934
-Two.
-You're bleeding.

82
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,852
-My gosh.
-Three.

83
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:08,941
I'm returning it.

84
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,780
Get out.

85
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,203
Should I have just stabbed her with it
and kept her here?

86
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,056
Let's talk.

87
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,344
Why wrap that around my hand?
Did I say it hurt?

88
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,019
It's just a small cut on the palm.
It doesn't even hurt.

89
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,729
"What we have
is an ill-fated relationship.

90
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,732
Please stop stirring up my miserable life.
And get lost."

91
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,693
That nonsense you talked about
was much more...

92
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,613
It was

93
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:41,074
much more hurtful.

94
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:45,913
You said that I'm not an empty can.

95
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,790
Then why are you treating me like one?

96
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,709
I said today
is a very important day to me.

97
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,419
I told you that I didn't want to be alone!

98
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,302
When you can't control yourself,

99
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,596
count to three.

100
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,020
One.

101
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,490
Two.

102
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:31,959
-Three.
-Three.

103
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,886
Happy birthday.

104
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,684
I missed you.

105
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:21,943
Why are you blushing?

106
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,655
I'm... I'm just hot.

107
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,450
It's so hot in here, isn't it?

108
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,706
Your face is all red too.

109
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,339
I'm not feeling well.

110
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:44,883
You're burning up.

111
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,803
Mr. Moon called.

112
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:52,140
It sounds like Ms. Park Ok-ran
stopped by Ms. Ko's place.

113
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,767
What? Why did she go there?

114
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,394
We'll have to find out.

115
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,897
Let the police know
where she was last seen.

116
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,317
Yes, sir. I'll also update you
as soon as we check the security footage.

117
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,070
She may come back late at night,

118
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:06,238
so stay here

119
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,573
and make rounds throughout the night.

120
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,616
-Yes, sir.
-Will do.

121
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,410
Is your head okay?

122
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,621
How could I be okay?
She hit my head with a stone.

123
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,289
This should be processed
as a workplace injury.

124
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,332
All right.

125
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,334
I'll help you file a claim
for the benefits

126
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,336
and also consider
terminating your employment.

127
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,797
-Wait.
-Get home safely, sir.

128
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,714
Get home safely.

129
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,592
Hot. It's hot.

130
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,177
Be careful when touching something hot.

131
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,472
Gosh, it's hot. Be careful.
You must be careful.

132
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,687
Hey, Sang-tae.

133
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,605
Hi, Jae-su.

134
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,359
What? Why are you eating so late?

135
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,027
Are you snacking?

136
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,446
I waited for Gang-tae
to have dinner with him,

137
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,740
but there's an emergency at the hospital.

138
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,452
He has to catch someone,
so he can't come home tonight.

139
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,412
He's been dispatched.

140
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:59,332
That's why I'm here on his behalf.

141
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,668
That looks good.

142
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,339
-Can I have a bite?
-Gosh, no way. This is mine.

143
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:09,342
One bite will turn
into two and three bites.

144
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,344
"He who will steal an egg
will steal an ox."

145
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,846
No way. This is all mine.

146
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,973
Oh, right.

147
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,685
I found this out front.

148
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,520
That's Mang-tae.

149
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,480
-Mang-tae?
-Yes.

150
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,482
You mean, as in Grandpa Mang-tae
from the book?

151
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,444
No, he's not a grandpa.
He's Gang-tae's little brother.

152
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,071
Sang-tae, Gang-tae, and Mang-tae.

153
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:30,989
We're

154
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,700
three brothers.

155
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,285
Goodness.

156
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,204
What the heck?

157
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,582
I can't believe you're calling
this ugly fabric doll your little brother.

158
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,668
I'm the one who's been
following you around for over ten years.

159
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,297
If you want to say you have two brothers,

160
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:48,924
include me.

161
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,552
Jae-su between Sang-tae and Gang-tae.

162
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,805
-Include Jae-su.
-No way, Jae-su.

163
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,225
You're not our brother.

164
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,228
We don't have the same surname
and we're not related.

165
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,772
You're not on our family register,
so we're basically strangers.

166
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:06,399
You're not our family. How dare you.

167
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,985
How dare you...

168
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,613
-Just include me!
-Gosh, no. Don't.

169
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,740
Don't do that when I'm eating hot food.

170
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,617
-Just include me, will you?
-No, Jae-su--

171
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,827
-No, Mang-tae! It's hot!
-Gosh!

172
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,758
Come. I filled the bathtub
with ice-cold water.

173
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:37,973
Ice-cold water? Why?

174
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,599
You need to bring your fever down.

175
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,310
I've seen it in movies.
Get undressed and go in the tub.

176
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,189
You want rose petals in the water?

177
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,651
No, it's okay. Just get me a wet towel.

178
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,538
That lady...

179
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:04,624
Did she escape the hospital?

180
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:07,836
Can I ask you

181
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:11,172
what she said to you?

182
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,428
She said she thought I'd be lonely
and came to wish me a happy birthday.

183
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,972
She also said she's my mom's fan.

184
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:21,308
What else?

185
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,438
She said she nearly died
at the hospital today.

186
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,324
Why did that happen?

187
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,078
Patients often get into a fight like that.

188
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,289
You don't need to worry about it.

189
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,757
This feels nice.

190
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:57,844
What feels nice?

191
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,596
I've never

192
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,976
had someone look after me

193
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,479
when I was sick.

194
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,401
Ju-ri!

195
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,072
Heading out to work?

196
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:43,825
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,162
I should've apologized to you sooner
for the trouble I caused you.

198
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,290
Gosh, we're no strangers.

199
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,167
We're like a family
living under the same roof.

200
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,668
Come on. Don't even worry about it.

201
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:55,879
Here.

202
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,550
-What is this?
-Money for a car wash.

203
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,014
Please accept it.

204
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,479
-So this is how it feels.
-Pardon?

205
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,398
Every time Mun-yeong
got herself in trouble in the past,

206
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,444
I gave people cash
disguised as a box of sweet drinks.

207
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:23,114
This is probably how they felt
upon receiving it.

208
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,368
You reap what you sow.

209
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,878
Let's go out for a meal with this money.

210
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,506
Then I'll call it even.

211
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:03,279
Damn it.

212
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,458
I thought you were gone.

213
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,794
Where would I go?

214
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,587
How's your fever?

215
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,384
-It's gone down.
-In just a day?

216
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,971
You little...
You were faking it, weren't you?

217
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,057
No.

218
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,685
It was lovesickness.

219
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,401
Let's talk.

220
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,620
What did you want to talk to me about?

221
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,794
It's about my brother.

222
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,548
Jeez, that brother of yours.

223
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,175
Sang-tae

224
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,886
has a traumatic memory.

225
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,850
A traumatic memory?

226
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:18,021
That's why we left Seongjin City
when we were little

227
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,482
and had to move as if we're running away
from something every spring.

228
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:23,943
All because of his traumatic memory.

229
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:31,951
My mom

230
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,875
was murdered.

231
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,920
And Sang-tae was the only witness

232
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:46,674
who saw her getting murdered.

233
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,817
The butterfly said it'd kill me as well

234
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,278
if I didn't keep my lips sealed.

235
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,906
It said it'd chase me down

236
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,868
and kill me!

237
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:15,912
<i>We were scared, so we ran away.</i>

238
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,623
<i>I was only 12,</i>

239
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,250
-<i>and there was no adult</i>
-Come on.

240
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:23,002
<i>who could protect us.</i>

241
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,964
That's when it began.

242
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,885
Every spring
when you start seeing butterflies,

243
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,470
Sang-tae

244
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,767
has nightmares about the night
when Mom was killed.

245
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,314
<i>What? Butterflies...</i>

246
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,608
<i>No, those butterflies!</i>

247
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,910
-What? What's going on?
-Butterflies!

248
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,161
-Goodness.
-Butterflies!

249
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,871
-What's the matter?
-Those butterflies...

250
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,790
-Sang-tae.
-Butterflies...

251
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,500
Gosh, those butterflies...

252
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,128
-Butterflies! Those butterflies!
<i>-He says the butterflies will kill him.</i>

253
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:08,131
They said they'll kill me. The butterflies

254
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:10,049
-will kill me!
-<i>And that we must run far away.</i>

255
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,676
They're coming to kill me!

256
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,886
He's been bearing that pain all on his own

257
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,223
for nearly 20 years now.

258
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,395
And that's why

259
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,481
he needs me.

260
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:30,987
But the thing is,

261
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,032
despite that,

262
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:40,538
I keep wanting to spend time with you.

263
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:43,332
You once said

264
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,418
that you don't care about destiny.

265
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,088
If someone shows up when you need them,

266
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,215
you call that destiny.

267
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,303
And I

268
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,597
need you.

269
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,483
I have to stay

270
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,360
by Sang-tae's side,

271
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:17,241
so you just

272
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,328
stay by my side.

273
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:30,922
Sure, why not?

274
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:46,103
SANG-TAE

275
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,566
<i>It is a flower</i>

276
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:52,235
<i>It is a flower</i>

277
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:57,198
-Hey.
-<i>Did you eat?</i>

278
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,992
I had rice
with kimchi soybean sprout soup.

279
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,328
Did you catch the culprit? The culprit.

280
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,706
She's a patient, not a culprit.

281
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,750
<i>Yes, the patient. Did you catch her?</i>

282
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:10,086
No, I couldn't find her.

283
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,047
Oh, no. Then what are you going to do?

284
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:16,008
You don't need to worry about that.

285
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,846
Don't eat dinner without me.
I'll try to be home early.

286
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,931
Okay.

287
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,768
He'll be home early today.

288
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,420
The test will be done in no time,

289
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:51,757
so don't worry about a thing.
I'll see you in a bit.

290
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:54,092
Get going.

291
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:56,512
See you later.

292
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:02,935
Oh, boy.

293
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,731
I hope his brain tumor hasn't come back.

294
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:08,857
I'm worried.

295
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:12,027
It's a miracle that he's managed to
survive in that state for almost 20 years.

296
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:16,448
What did the police say
about Ms. Park Ok-ran?

297
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:19,201
She was last caught on CCTV footage

298
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:21,787
by the exit of a hiking trail
in Mount Oji last night.

299
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,122
They have to investigate
to find out where she went.

300
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:27,751
Really? Then clean up her bed

301
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,753
and send her belongings to the police.

302
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:32,089
We have to admit a patient
on the waiting list.

303
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:35,175
Already? She may come back.

304
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:38,554
No, she won't be able to.

305
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:51,775
Hi.

306
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:00,576
Wait.

307
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,830
We have to clean up Park Ok-ran's bed
and collect her belongings.

308
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:06,665
-Already?
-Yes.

309
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:09,710
Ms. Park said we have to admit a patient
on the waiting list.

310
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:14,965
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>

311
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,134
Is she not coming back?

312
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:20,596
Or can she not come back?

313
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,851
Even when dogs run away,

314
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:29,479
people at least pretend to look for them
for a few days.

315
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:33,984
The head nurse doesn't come across
like that, but she's heartless.

316
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:36,069
The police are looking for her.

317
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,779
I see.

318
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:46,788
NAME: PARK OK-RAN

319
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:48,707
Thank you.

320
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:52,002
You've changed.

321
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:55,047
-Pardon?
-Your smile.

322
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:56,840
It's pretty.

323
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:07,059
I heard Park Ok-ran
was an obscure stage actress in the past.

324
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:09,436
She had multiple plastic surgeries.

325
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,815
I heard it from Yoo Seon-hae,
who shares the room with her.

326
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,860
-Gosh, what is this?
-She said that woman had been

327
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:18,904
acting weird for a couple of months.

328
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,406
Apparently, she said
she had to practice acting

329
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,950
and kept snickering
while looking in the mirror.

330
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:27,579
She also kept memorizing something
all night.

331
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,958
Yoo Seon-hae said she seemed to think
that she was still an actress.

332
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:33,794
She was practicing acting?

333
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,486
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>

334
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,772
I'm so glad I held myself back last night.

335
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:28,492
Damn it!

336
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,243
What? "Damn it"?

337
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:34,706
I see that you're beginning
to show your true colors.

338
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:36,666
I'm sorry, sir.

339
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:40,378
-Where did you sleep last night?
-Pardon me?

340
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:44,966
You looked depressed,
but you now look all happy.

341
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,968
I guess you slept somewhere else
last night.

342
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:51,306
Did you get some action
instead of looking for the patient?

343
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,309
No, sir. That's not what happened.

344
00:32:57,395 --> 00:33:00,232
But why go there?

345
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:04,778
Well...

346
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:08,406
I was very worried and...

347
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,742
To wish her a happy birthday, perhaps?

348
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:15,539
No.

349
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:19,292
That's not why I went there. I just--

350
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,671
No, I'm talking about Ms. Park Ok-ran.

351
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,506
Why did she go there?

352
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,635
There's no way she escaped

353
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:30,846
just to wish Ms. Ko a happy birthday.

354
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,603
I hope that's the case though.

355
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:41,690
I hope Ms. Park went there
to wish her a happy birthday

356
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:45,944
and that

357
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:49,364
nothing will happen to us anymore.

358
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:55,162
I really hope so.

359
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:03,378
And that being said...

360
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:10,552
Sir.

361
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:32,198
Everything from here to here.
To go, please.

362
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,576
Everything?

363
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,416
Everything on that row, ma'am?

364
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,460
While you're getting that ready,

365
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,964
I'd like to speak with your part-timer.

366
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:50,550
Sang-tae.

367
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:53,345
I think Ms. Ko needs to talk to you
about something.

368
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:54,930
Hurry over here and have a seat.

369
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,105
Move back in.

370
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:06,399
We need to get some work done.

371
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,409
This drawing you gave me--

372
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:18,119
I didn't give it to you. I threw it out.

373
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:22,082
Right, this drawing you had tossed out

374
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:24,376
gave me an idea for my next book.

375
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,293
Amazing, right?

376
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:31,258
I'll tell you what I want to write about.

377
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:34,094
These three will set off on a long journey

378
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:36,554
to find something they lost.

379
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:38,098
Oh, that will be fun.

380
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:39,182
Right?

381
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,559
Best friends do think alike.

382
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:45,146
That looks fun. I want it.

383
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:13,300
He said he'd never draw butterflies.
He was stubborn about it,

384
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,636
so I sort of had a hunch,

385
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:21,141
but I didn't know
there was such a shocking story behind it.

386
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:25,562
But why are you telling me all this
out of the blue?

387
00:36:27,564 --> 00:36:28,773
You said one must

388
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:32,694
face one's traumatic memories
to overcome them.

389
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:37,782
Please help Sang-tae

390
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:42,620
so that he can face his trauma.

391
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,582
Do you trust me?

392
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,334
Everyone in this field

393
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,546
says that I'm a quack,
not just a quirky weirdo.

394
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,592
If you're a quack,

395
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:57,969
my brother

396
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:02,015
will know right away.

397
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:10,523
Unilaterally terminating the contract
triples the penalty.

398
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,691
You know that, right?

399
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:14,360
The penalty?
That was not included in the contract.

400
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:15,737
What you see isn't everything.

401
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,450
When it comes to liability
for breach of contract,

402
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:23,995
a verbal agreement based on trust
is enough. It's a tacit rule.

403
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:29,626
-Your face tells me that you do.
-What?

404
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,879
No, I never received anything.

405
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:34,339
Not even the camping car.

406
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:36,716
I provided you with room and board.

407
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,134
Do you know how much that cost me?

408
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:42,430
Either compensate me threefold
or draw my illustrations.

409
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,849
-Your choice.
-My choice?

410
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,604
I need to double that, for Gang-tae.

411
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:50,939
Compensate me sixfold.

412
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:53,817
What? Sixfold?

413
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,330
Hey.

414
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:09,666
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
is such a wonderful person.

415
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:14,254
What's gotten into you?

416
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,341
You know that I love people
who are generous and decisive.

417
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:20,385
You do?

418
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:22,595
<i>Yes, she's totally my type.</i>

419
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,056
Not romantically though.
I'm not saying I'm attracted to her.

420
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,142
You're my number one,
no matter what anyone says.

421
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,564
But how important am I to you?

422
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,149
You're my number three.

423
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,655
What on earth is she up to?

424
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:42,907
-<i>Even if it blooms in the field</i>
-You won't draw my illustrations

425
00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:44,117
-<i>It is a flower</i>
-or pay the penalty.

426
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,702
-So what? You don't care?
-Hello, tree!

427
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:47,912
-Good morning!
-Forget the contract.

428
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,998
-<i>It is a flower</i>
-We're besties. You're my fan.

429
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,708
-<i>It is a flower</i>
-A fan must stay loyal.

430
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,919
-<i>It is a flower</i>
-Sang-tae, a promise

431
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:57,881
isn't something you can take so lightly.
Do you hear me?

432
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,094
Damn it. Moon Sang-tae!

433
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:04,721
You can't have Gang-tae!

434
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,766
Never!

435
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:12,520
Gang-tae isn't some object
we can toss around.

436
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:14,606
That's right. He's my brother.

437
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,024
Exactly, he's just your brother.

438
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:18,484
-He's not yours.
-He's not yours either.

439
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:19,652
Gang-tae is mine.

440
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:21,196
Gang-tae belongs to Gang-tae.

441
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,114
No, he's mine. I'm his big brother.

442
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:24,741
I'm sick of that word, "brother"!

443
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:27,035
You're just a stranger to us. A stranger!

444
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:28,661
-"Brother"!
-Stranger!

445
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:30,455
-I'm so sick of that word.
-Stranger.

446
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:31,498
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

447
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:32,874
-They're fighting.
-Stop swearing.

448
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:34,667
-Old habits...
-Teacher, they're fighting!

449
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:36,169
-die hard.
-No, they're not fighting.

450
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:37,962
-Let's go.
-Hi. Hello!

451
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:39,672
Did you and that lady fight?

452
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:42,008
Yes. No, we didn't really fight.

453
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,801
Why did you two fight?

454
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,846
We didn't fight.
We just had disagreements.

455
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:50,892
I really did my best.

456
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:54,103
How?

457
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:56,814
I tried asking him nicely and
persuading him in an articulate manner.

458
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:59,234
More like threatening him, I'm sure.

459
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:03,571
-Did you guys talk on the phone?
-Must I ask him to know?

460
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:06,241
Then you probably also know
how I feel right now.

461
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:07,659
How do you feel?

462
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:10,036
"Please give me permission
to marry your daughter."

463
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:12,914
I can totally relate to men
who must beg their girlfriends' parents.

464
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,124
-Really?
-Yes, really.

465
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,420
But you know...

466
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:23,424
Without his permission,

467
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,803
we can't live together.

468
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,515
It took my friend, Jae-su,

469
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,268
about ten years
to become close to Sang-tae.

470
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:34,435
Ten years?

471
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:38,481
-Anyway, just wait.
-For ten years? Are you nuts?

472
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:41,192
No. I have to drop these off
at the nurses' station, so wait here.

473
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,028
That little...

474
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:54,038
Did it really take him ten years?

475
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:55,707
No, right? You were joking, right?

476
00:40:56,374 --> 00:40:58,251
-Ten years, my foot.
-Right?

477
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,462
You already got on his bad side,
so it'll take longer.

478
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,342
I definitely cannot wait that long.
No way. I refuse!

479
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:17,979
For Sang-tae...

480
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,981
I'm his only family.

481
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:24,527
He's afraid
that you'd take me away from him

482
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,612
and that he'd be left alone.

483
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,907
-What do I do, then?
-We should earn his trust.

484
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:33,578
-What do you mean?
-You're not taking me away from him.

485
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:36,539
He now has one more person
who will stay by his side.

486
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:40,084
You're not a stranger.
You'll be one of us.

487
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:42,503
Earn his trust.

488
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:47,133
You will, right?

489
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:50,970
I'll try.

490
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:55,308
Also,

491
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:57,769
keep the door locked when you're alone.

492
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:00,646
Do not let strangers into the house.

493
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:02,190
Okay?

494
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,443
Okay, I won't.

495
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:09,822
Good girl.

496
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,377
My gosh, what's all this pizza for?

497
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:30,635
So? How's Mr. Ko doing?

498
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:34,472
The brain tumor has spread deep inside
the frontal lobe.

499
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,392
What did his doctor say?
Can he undergo surgery now?

500
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,436
No, he said it'll be pointless now.

501
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:44,148
My gosh, I feel so bad for Mr. Ko.

502
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,067
Oh, dear.

503
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:08,923
Where are you going?

504
00:43:09,507 --> 00:43:11,175
I have plans. I'm leaving for the day.

505
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,262
Plans? With who?
You're taking the rest of the day off?

506
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:16,889
With Sang-in. I'll see you later.

507
00:43:17,473 --> 00:43:18,307
Wait, just a second.

508
00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:24,105
What? Gosh, no. I don't want that.

509
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:27,442
-Stay still, will you?
-No.

510
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:28,943
You're going on a date,

511
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,529
so you need
to put on some makeup at least.

512
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,781
You'll meet him barefaced?
Are you that confident?

513
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:35,032
Goodness.

514
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:41,122
-How do I look?
-You look so pretty.

515
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:44,709
It looks like spring flowers
have bloomed on your lips.

516
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:47,003
I'll see you at home.

517
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:50,089
Stay out as late as possible.

518
00:44:06,314 --> 00:44:07,607
My gosh, you're wearing makeup.

519
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,152
I wear makeup every day.

520
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:16,073
Right. You look pretty every single day

521
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:18,493
with or without makeup.

522
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,247
Well, can I ask you something
about Mun-yeong?

523
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:27,168
Does she have any family members
other than her dad?

524
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:28,669
Any close relatives?

525
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,341
Had there been an adult
who could look after her,

526
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,260
she would've ended up quite differently.

527
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:38,763
Why do you ask?

528
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:42,391
Are Professor Ko's test results that bad?

529
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:45,436
Has his brain tumor come back?

530
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:49,899
It doesn't look like
he can undergo surgery again.

531
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:55,154
That's unfortunate.

532
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,991
I'll see how she's doing
and find the best time to tell her.

533
00:45:04,956 --> 00:45:06,624
By any chance, did Gang-tae--

534
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,377
-Well, Ju-ri.
-Yes?

535
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:12,296
Enough about Moon Gang-tae
and Ko Mun-yeong.

536
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:15,800
Why don't we talk about Nam Ju-ri
and Lee Sang-in?

537
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:20,471
Let them have fun on their own.

538
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:23,474
There are so many things
I want to know about Nam Ju-ri.

539
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:28,854
Since when did pink lipstick
suit you so well?

540
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,983
And why do you turn into
a different person when you're drunk?

541
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,192
Oh, also...

542
00:45:33,776 --> 00:45:38,531
Who taught you to swear like that?

543
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:42,785
I...

544
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,622
Back in middle school,

545
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:47,665
I see.

546
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:51,127
My dad taught me how to drink.

547
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,004
Then how much can you drink?

548
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:05,433
I must pay threefold.

549
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,102
No, I must pay six times the amount
to get Gang-tae out as well.

550
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:11,022
But all I have is...

551
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:14,609
-Sang-tae.
-Yes.

552
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:17,403
-It's hot. What are you doing in there?
-Yes.

553
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,240
Well...

554
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:37,798
-Did everything go well at the restaurant?
-Yes.

555
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,343
Oh, Jae-su gave me a tip
because we made a lot of money today.

556
00:46:40,426 --> 00:46:41,302
He gave me 30,000 won.

557
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:44,305
Customers give you tips,

558
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,806
bosses give you bonuses.

559
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,808
Yes, I got 30,000 won as a bonus.

560
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,352
I see.

561
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:51,854
Someone must've bought a lot of pizza.

562
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,147
Yes...

563
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,192
Yes. Ms. Ko Mun-yeong. She's rich.

564
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,069
She's filthy rich.

565
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:02,114
Ms. Ko came to the pizzeria? Why?

566
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:04,158
She... She came to the pizzeria
to buy pizza.

567
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,077
She didn't come to the pizzeria
to buy potatoes.

568
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,245
Why would you ask something so obvious?

569
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:13,959
Why are you here?

570
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,756
He was worried about
leaving you here all by yourself,

571
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,175
so I was asked to stay here for a while.

572
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:22,343
Mr. Lee?

573
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,345
No, it was Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

574
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:29,350
Don't just stand there.

575
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:30,935
Come here and sit down.

576
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:41,779
Mr. Moon called and asked Mr. Lee

577
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:44,532
if it'd be okay for me to work here.

578
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,493
He said that?

579
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,037
Mr. Lee was also thrilled
that you're going to start

580
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:52,081
working on your next book.

581
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:56,127
So he wanted me to come here
and support you for the time being.

582
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,461
Is that so?

583
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,549
Feel free to let me know
if you need anything.

584
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,634
I don't really need anything.

585
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:05,970
But I do have a question.

586
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:08,055
Sure. Go ahead.

587
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:12,184
Someone visited me last night

588
00:48:13,102 --> 00:48:14,895
saying she's a fan of my mother.

589
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:17,690
And it just so happened to be

590
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,234
my birthday.

591
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:23,404
Isn't that weird?

592
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,072
No, not at all.

593
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,574
Why?

594
00:48:27,116 --> 00:48:30,369
Back when I used to be a fan of Tony,
an H.O.T member,

595
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:33,581
I congratulated all the birthdays
of his entire family.

596
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:36,584
I bought gifts and waited for him
in front of his accommodation,

597
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,919
and the managers got really angry at me.

598
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:41,881
And after the group disbanded,

599
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:44,592
I went around everywhere
to get a glimpse of them again.

600
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:49,346
Really?

601
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:52,516
But if you were an H.O.T fan,

602
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:54,143
how old are you?

603
00:48:57,897 --> 00:48:59,356
Have a good night.

604
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,653
Are you sure you're younger than me?

605
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:07,573
-"I... I ate breakfast.
-<i>I ate breakfast.</i>

606
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:09,867
-Then I ate lunch.
-<i>Then I ate lunch.</i>

607
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,286
-<i>And I had a small dinner.</i>
-And I had a small dinner.

608
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,871
-<i>So I was hungry at night.</i>
-So I was hungry at night.

609
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:15,790
-<i>Why isn't there anything about me?</i>
-Why isn't there anything about me?"

610
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,374
-<i>What do you mean?</i>
-Sang-tae.

611
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,212
Why does Gil-dong let them live with him
even though he's always

612
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:22,338
angry at them?

613
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,342
That's because he's their guardian.
He's an adult.

614
00:49:26,926 --> 00:49:29,595
But they're not even his family.

615
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:32,723
That's right. They don't have the same
surname, aren't related to each other,

616
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:35,810
and they're not on the same family
register. So they're basically strangers.

617
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:39,814
If they're strangers,

618
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,066
why does he let them live with him?

619
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:45,027
Because he's their guardian.
He's an adult.

620
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:50,241
You're

621
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:52,952
an adult, right?

622
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,669
Moon Sang-tae, 35 years old.

623
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:04,004
Born in 1984, the year of the rat.
I'm younger than I look,

624
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:06,048
but I'm not a child.

625
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,386
Exactly. You're an adult.

626
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,974
An adult like Ko Gil-dong,
who can accept others as a family.

627
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:19,019
Yes.

628
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,945
Sang-tae, do you want to know something?

629
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,115
I'm also

630
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:33,826
trying really hard

631
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,830
to become an adult.

632
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:41,041
You... You can also become an adult.

633
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,085
You... You just need to try hard.

634
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,795
You just need to make an effort.

635
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,763
I'm guessing you'll be done by next week.

636
00:51:02,846 --> 00:51:06,517
Yes, I'm... I'm almost done.

637
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,102
It'll be complete soon. I'll be done.

638
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:12,439
But...

639
00:51:13,065 --> 00:51:16,777
By the way,
how much are you going to pay me?

640
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:20,155
How... How much do you think
you can pay me for this?

641
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,200
I want to get paid the day I finish this.

642
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:26,995
Oh, dear. I don't see any butterflies
in the flower garden.

643
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,462
I... I'm not going to draw
any butterflies.

644
00:51:36,046 --> 00:51:37,881
I told you that I wanted the painting

645
00:51:37,965 --> 00:51:41,051
to look exactly like the garden outside.

646
00:51:41,593 --> 00:51:44,721
There are tons of butterflies outside,
but the mural has none.

647
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:47,182
That means it's not complete.

648
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:48,267
It means you're not done.

649
00:51:48,976 --> 00:51:50,811
I... I don't like butterflies.

650
00:51:50,894 --> 00:51:52,813
I... I don't want to draw butterflies.

651
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:55,399
Then forget it.
But you won't be getting paid.

652
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:56,900
I don't want an incomplete mural.

653
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:00,070
But... But my money...

654
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:01,655
But...

655
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:07,828
This... This is pretty much complete.

656
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:09,580
My money... Gosh.

657
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:12,708
Oh, no.

658
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:18,130
O Ji-wang is a con artist.
He's a liar. That's what he is.

659
00:52:18,755 --> 00:52:21,425
He sounds nice and looks nice,

660
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,218
but he's a liar.

661
00:52:23,302 --> 00:52:25,345
I... I can't trust anyone.

662
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:31,435
Did I keep you waiting?

663
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:33,103
Let's go.

664
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:38,233
Why did you bring all your paints?

665
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:39,735
You're not done with the mural.

666
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,278
I'm not going to do it.

667
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:44,865
Why not?

668
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,035
I... I just don't want to.

669
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,913
Why don't you want to?

670
00:52:51,288 --> 00:52:52,122
You're almost done.

671
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:54,416
No, I don't want to. Forget it.

672
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:57,169
I... I don't want to draw butterflies.
I don't want to do that.

673
00:52:58,337 --> 00:52:59,338
Sang-tae.

674
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:00,923
Can we talk?

675
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:02,382
Stop.

676
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:05,010
Sang-tae.

677
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:06,386
Gosh.

678
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:08,013
Goodness.

679
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,141
Get up.

680
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:16,980
Get up. Let's talk.

681
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:18,815
Let me go!

682
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:22,903
You're not going to draw the mural
or go to the hospital?

683
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:24,988
And why don't you ever want to see
Director O again?

684
00:53:31,245 --> 00:53:33,914
Are you going to avoid answering me
and keep acting like a kid?

685
00:53:33,997 --> 00:53:35,415
I thought you were an adult.

686
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:37,751
Come on. Get up.

687
00:53:39,336 --> 00:53:40,420
I'm going to count to three.

688
00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:41,463
One.

689
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:44,466
Two.

690
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:46,760
-Three.
-Director O is a con artist!

691
00:53:46,843 --> 00:53:49,930
He's a liar! He... He's even worse
than people who do voice phishing.

692
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:52,849
He... He promised to pay me once I'm done.

693
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:54,685
So why... Why won't he pay me?

694
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:56,937
Gosh. Stop running away. I won't let you.

695
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,105
-No.
-Talk to me.

696
00:53:58,188 --> 00:53:59,273
No, let me go.

697
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:00,357
Just talk to me, Sang-tae.

698
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,566
No, I'm going to go. Move.

699
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,277
Stop avoiding it
and tell me what happened.

700
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,278
Let me go!

701
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:05,779
Will you please just talk?

702
00:54:12,035 --> 00:54:12,953
It hurts, right?

703
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:14,663
It hurts when someone hits you,
doesn't it?

704
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:16,748
You hurt me, too. Look at the bite mark.

705
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:18,667
You... You hit me?

706
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,003
You hit your big brother?

707
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:23,130
How dare you hit your big brother?

708
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:24,506
You hurt me, too.

709
00:54:25,215 --> 00:54:26,049
It hurt like crazy

710
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:27,968
when you stabbed me on the head
with a pencil.

711
00:54:28,552 --> 00:54:31,388
When you pushed me and made me hit
a desk, I couldn't even sleep at night.

712
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,808
Do you think I stay quiet
because I enjoy getting hurt?

713
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,686
I'm not going to hold it in anymore.
I'm done doing that!

714
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:40,647
When... When you need to control yourself,
count to three.

715
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:41,982
One, two, three.

716
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:43,108
No, you count!

717
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:44,192
Listen to your big brother!

718
00:54:44,276 --> 00:54:45,610
Then act like one!

719
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:58,665
Wait... Sang-tae, I meant...

720
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:00,542
You... You yelled at me?

721
00:55:01,335 --> 00:55:04,713
How... How dare you yell
at your big brother?

722
00:55:05,297 --> 00:55:07,007
You... You dared to yell at me?

723
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:09,885
How dare you? How... How could you?

724
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:14,931
How could you do that to me?

725
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:16,266
How could you?

726
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:23,482
Stop!

727
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:31,782
Come over here!

728
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:34,201
Come here!

729
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,294
Hey!

730
00:55:54,304 --> 00:55:56,640
Are you about to die soon or something?

731
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:58,141
Is that why you're acting out?

732
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:03,271
I didn't really mind it
when Sang-tae hit me.

733
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,067
But now that I've fought back...

734
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,903
What did I tell you?
It breaks your heart, doesn't it?

735
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:12,572
No.

736
00:56:16,284 --> 00:56:17,619
I feel so relieved.

737
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:27,504
The lunatic virus
is surprisingly powerful.

738
00:56:28,004 --> 00:56:29,464
You've changed so much.

739
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:31,466
Jae-su.

740
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,301
Who are you? Do I know you?

741
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:36,805
This is...

742
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:42,978
who I really am.

743
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:50,944
Moon Gang-tae

744
00:56:51,445 --> 00:56:53,363
belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

745
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:02,456
It's going to sting.

746
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:06,168
Gang-tae isn't my brother anymore.

747
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,836
He's not my brother.

748
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:09,087
Yes, you're right.

749
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:12,048
He shouldn't have scratched you.
That's cheating.

750
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:14,342
I never took him as the type
to fight dirty like this.

751
00:57:14,426 --> 00:57:15,469
He cheated.

752
00:57:15,552 --> 00:57:18,513
I saw him earlier,
and he was a lot more injured.

753
00:57:21,475 --> 00:57:24,394
He's not my little brother anymore.
We're strangers now.

754
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:26,229
We're strangers.

755
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:29,316
-You're strangers?
-Yes.

756
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:31,818
Then...

757
00:57:32,778 --> 00:57:36,156
Mom, why don't you just adopt Gang-tae
as your son?

758
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,034
I'd love to do that.

759
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:40,869
Sang-tae, thank you.

760
00:57:40,952 --> 00:57:42,704
I'll think of him as my son now.

761
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:44,956
No.

762
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:47,667
Never mind. We're strangers.

763
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,816
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

764
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:37,133
<i>Jae-su.</i>

765
00:58:38,343 --> 00:58:40,303
I know you are disappointed,
but try to understand.

766
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:43,723
Me and Sang-tae...

767
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:48,687
It's just been the two of us
for a long time.

768
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,233
We have to learn

769
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:58,238
to socialize with other people.

770
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:00,782
But why does it have to be

771
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:03,910
Ko Mun-yeong?

772
00:59:06,037 --> 00:59:07,163
She's the loneliest person

773
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:09,583
I know.

774
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,628
I'm going to start with her.

775
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:35,817
<i>Call me.</i>

776
00:59:36,443 --> 00:59:37,569
<i>I'm bored.</i>

777
00:59:37,902 --> 00:59:38,737
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

778
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,491
Darn it.

779
00:59:44,075 --> 00:59:46,202
Why does he read my messages
if he isn't going to reply?

780
01:00:03,011 --> 01:00:04,930
Maybe I shouldn't have returned Mang-tae.

781
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:16,376
I told you not to open the door
for strangers.

782
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:18,920
You promised.

783
01:01:19,504 --> 01:01:20,714
Why did you bring this?

784
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:21,923
What are you doing here?

785
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:25,510
You told me you're hungry.

786
01:01:26,594 --> 01:01:27,595
Let's go outside.

787
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:35,020
Are you really not going to tell me?

788
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:36,980
What happened to your face?

789
01:01:40,275 --> 01:01:41,234
I got into a fight.

790
01:01:41,943 --> 01:01:42,777
With a patient?

791
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:46,614
-That will get me fired.
-Then who was it?

792
01:01:47,198 --> 01:01:49,325
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to beat them up.

793
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:54,748
My brother.

794
01:01:55,498 --> 01:01:56,708
Sang-tae?

795
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,418
You beat him up?

796
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:01,087
No, we just had a fight.

797
01:02:01,504 --> 01:02:03,089
He hit me a lot more than I did.

798
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:09,262
Didn't you say we need to let him know
that he'll be getting another friend?

799
01:02:09,345 --> 01:02:10,597
But you just fought with him?

800
01:02:13,058 --> 01:02:14,684
What are you going to do now?

801
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:18,897
I'm still thinking about it.

802
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,941
Weren't you the one who told me
to think before I act?

803
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:24,360
You told me it's not a bad thing
to stick to your instincts.

804
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,533
Just be honest with him.

805
01:02:31,826 --> 01:02:34,078
-What do you mean?
-Tell him you like me

806
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:35,580
and that you can't live without me.

807
01:02:35,663 --> 01:02:36,956
Ask for his understanding.

808
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,208
It's simple.

809
01:02:41,419 --> 01:02:42,462
I...

810
01:02:45,632 --> 01:02:47,050
like Ko Mun-yeong.

811
01:02:54,182 --> 01:02:55,475
I wonder what he'll say

812
01:02:58,102 --> 01:02:59,562
if I tell him that.

813
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:22,544
<i>When will you stop</i>

814
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:27,799
caring about your brother
and start caring about yourself?

815
01:03:30,718 --> 01:03:32,303
Didn't you ever have a dream?

816
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:34,138
Something you wanted to do.

817
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,101
Well...

818
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:40,353
I had about three.

819
01:03:41,896 --> 01:03:43,648
Two of them already came true.

820
01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:45,441
What were they?

821
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,236
I wanted to go on a trip

822
01:03:48,903 --> 01:03:50,321
instead of moving somewhere.

823
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:52,490
And?

824
01:03:55,994 --> 01:03:57,745
I wanted to have a fight with my brother.

825
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:06,880
It's lame, isn't it?

826
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:10,925
But you see,

827
01:04:14,178 --> 01:04:15,471
I had a blast.

828
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:19,893
I think...

829
01:04:21,186 --> 01:04:22,729
I'm finally living a normal life.

830
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,196
What's the dream
that hasn't come true yet?

831
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:38,286
You came running to me today,

832
01:04:38,411 --> 01:04:39,579
so I'll make it come true.

833
01:04:40,622 --> 01:04:41,623
No.

834
01:04:42,457 --> 01:04:43,750
It's too late now.

835
01:04:44,334 --> 01:04:45,668
Why? What is it?

836
01:04:53,343 --> 01:04:54,969
Going to school in a uniform.

837
01:04:56,846 --> 01:04:58,890
-What is this?
-What's that?

838
01:04:58,973 --> 01:05:00,767
Hey, get up.

839
01:05:01,142 --> 01:05:02,727
Eat up.

840
01:05:03,353 --> 01:05:05,063
My gosh, come on.

841
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:17,075
KO MUN-YEONG

842
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:36,594
What? Where are you going?

843
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:38,846
Where are you going? Gang-tae!

844
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:40,348
Where are you going?

845
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:56,364
Hey.

846
01:05:56,781 --> 01:05:59,242
Hey... Excuse me. Hey.

847
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:05,248
Well...

848
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:09,460
-Well--
-Gang-tae!

849
01:06:09,544 --> 01:06:11,087
Did you skip school today?

850
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,005
-Come here.
-No.

851
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:13,965
-I just skipped the self-study time.
-Same thing.

852
01:06:14,048 --> 01:06:16,050
Why do you even bother wearing a uniform?

853
01:06:16,134 --> 01:06:17,969
-Why are you not at work?
-You little punk.

854
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:19,387
What...

855
01:06:26,477 --> 01:06:27,979
Gosh, you're so annoying.

856
01:06:30,231 --> 01:06:31,399
Excuse me.

857
01:06:31,983 --> 01:06:33,860
-Hey, you. The girl with short hair.
-Stop it.

858
01:06:36,988 --> 01:06:38,823
My brother has something to say to you.

859
01:06:38,906 --> 01:06:41,451
-Can you please spare him some time?
-Will you stop?

860
01:06:41,784 --> 01:06:42,785
Stop it.

861
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:45,538
She's coming.

862
01:06:47,832 --> 01:06:48,833
She's coming here.

863
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,545
Be a man. Impress her.

864
01:06:57,342 --> 01:06:58,342
Hey.

865
01:06:59,844 --> 01:07:00,845
I...

866
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:03,264
Well...

867
01:07:03,848 --> 01:07:04,724
I know you.

868
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:07,810
I saw you at school.

869
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:13,566
She knows you.

870
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:16,611
Well...

871
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:17,862
Congratulations.

872
01:07:19,238 --> 01:07:20,364
Good luck.

873
01:07:33,795 --> 01:07:35,088
Sang-tae.

874
01:07:37,882 --> 01:07:38,925
Yes?

875
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:42,595
I...

876
01:07:45,723 --> 01:07:48,267
I like her so much.

877
01:07:57,777 --> 01:07:58,986
I like her.

878
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,124
I like her.

879
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:20,424
What?

880
01:08:35,314 --> 01:08:36,607
"Happy."

881
01:08:39,986 --> 01:08:41,362
He's happy.

882
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:55,585
Gang-tae is...

883
01:08:57,628 --> 01:08:59,464
He's

884
01:09:01,674 --> 01:09:02,758
happy.

885
01:09:05,136 --> 01:09:07,472
Gang... Gang-tae

886
01:09:08,222 --> 01:09:11,893
He's... He's happy.

887
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:13,519
Yes.

888
01:09:15,521 --> 01:09:16,522
That's right.

889
01:09:18,482 --> 01:09:19,484
Yes.

890
01:09:23,321 --> 01:09:24,572
My brother...

891
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:28,451
He's happy.

892
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:38,544
Gang-tae is happy.

893
01:09:40,338 --> 01:09:42,006
Gang-tae is happy.

894
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:46,093
I... I've never seen him like this.
This is the first time.

895
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:47,428
My goodness.

896
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:00,733
Hey, why do you look so tired?

897
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:04,695
Mr. Lee, I don't think
I'm fit for this house.

898
01:10:04,779 --> 01:10:06,280
I have nightmares all night,

899
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:07,823
and I get the creeps.

900
01:10:07,907 --> 01:10:08,908
My entire body aches--

901
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:10,618
My gosh, that's enough.

902
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:12,745
Where's Mun-yeong?

903
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:14,247
She's in her study.

904
01:10:18,417 --> 01:10:22,880
Look at you
sitting in front of your laptop!

905
01:10:23,089 --> 01:10:24,590
It's been so long.

906
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:26,759
What is it going to be about?

907
01:10:26,842 --> 01:10:29,136
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
because I was so excited.

908
01:10:29,428 --> 01:10:32,556
I bet it's going to be an amazing story.

909
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,891
Wait.

910
01:10:35,476 --> 01:10:36,852
Let me get ready first.

911
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,816
I'm ready. Now, tell me. What is it?

912
01:10:42,483 --> 01:10:43,442
Here.

913
01:10:49,532 --> 01:10:51,158
Is this

914
01:10:51,242 --> 01:10:53,995
supposed to be similar to <i>Bumpety Boo</i>?

915
01:10:54,078 --> 01:10:55,413
I don't have the storyline yet.

916
01:10:55,496 --> 01:10:56,914
-What's the title?
-Undecided.

917
01:10:56,998 --> 01:10:58,749
-What's the underlying message?
-Unsure.

918
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,502
-When will it be ready?
-Someday.

919
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:07,967
-So that means you have nothing.
-Probably.

920
01:11:10,636 --> 01:11:12,680
Who's going to be your illustrator?

921
01:11:14,557 --> 01:11:15,850
My best friend.

922
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,094
Please make way.

923
01:12:09,403 --> 01:12:12,531
SANG-TAE

924
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:14,617
-What's--
-<i>Did you eat?</i>

925
01:12:18,162 --> 01:12:19,163
Did you eat?

926
01:12:25,336 --> 01:12:27,630
I couldn't eat
because we had an emergency patient.

927
01:12:28,255 --> 01:12:30,716
Are... Are you hungry?

928
01:12:31,759 --> 01:12:33,386
Yes, I'm starving.

929
01:12:33,803 --> 01:12:36,138
Come to the restaurant
We Are Family by 6 p.m.

930
01:12:36,222 --> 01:12:37,723
Meet me at We Are Family.

931
01:12:47,316 --> 01:12:48,359
Mun-yeong.

932
01:12:51,487 --> 01:12:53,322
-Mun-yeong?
-I'm going to stick to this subject.

933
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:55,616
That's fine.
That's not what I was going to talk about.

934
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,577
About your father...

935
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,001
His brain tumor came back.

936
01:13:07,002 --> 01:13:08,796
It's apparently inoperable.

937
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:11,757
There's nothing they can do to save him.

938
01:13:13,426 --> 01:13:15,344
My dad died a long time ago

939
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,888
when I was 12.

940
01:13:18,764 --> 01:13:22,184
He died already.
All that's left of him is his body.

941
01:13:25,062 --> 01:13:26,063
Mun-yeong.

942
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,817
Your father's brain is damaged.

943
01:13:30,484 --> 01:13:32,778
That is why his memory is all messed up.

944
01:13:33,237 --> 01:13:35,114
His body and mind
isn't functioning together

945
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:36,907
so that's why he acts the way he does.

946
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:40,411
But even so,

947
01:13:42,538 --> 01:13:46,000
he's still your one and only family.

948
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:47,710
"Family"?

949
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:52,089
I'm an orphan.

950
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:56,218
-Mun-yeong.
-Leave. I'm tired.

951
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,800
Where are you?

952
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:39,887
I'm hungry. Let's eat together.

953
01:14:43,724 --> 01:14:45,893
Let me join. I want to go, too.
Where is that restaurant?

954
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:48,687
Why not? Why can't I go?

955
01:15:07,331 --> 01:15:08,541
Wait.

956
01:15:08,624 --> 01:15:11,794
The adult needs to eat first.
Then you can eat.

957
01:15:12,378 --> 01:15:16,006
-Okay.
-Did you wipe your hands?

958
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,509
Did you? Here. Wipe your hands and eat.

959
01:16:07,975 --> 01:16:09,894
ORDER
TOTAL: 26,400 WON

960
01:16:12,146 --> 01:16:14,106
Was... Was it delicious?

961
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:15,024
Are you full?

962
01:16:17,234 --> 01:16:18,068
Yes.

963
01:16:18,652 --> 01:16:19,486
I'm really full.

964
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:22,281
My stomach might explode.

965
01:16:22,364 --> 01:16:24,366
Your... Your stomach shouldn't explode.

966
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:26,785
If your stomach explodes, you'll die.

967
01:16:49,516 --> 01:16:51,352
It... It's your allowance.

968
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:54,271
"Customers give you tips,
bosses give bonuses."

969
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:57,316
And older brothers give allowance.

970
01:16:58,901 --> 01:17:00,277
Overspending is a sin.

971
01:17:00,361 --> 01:17:02,071
Make sure you don't overspend.

972
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:04,031
I'll... I'll give you more if you run out.

973
01:17:04,114 --> 01:17:04,948
Don't worry.

974
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:15,626
Thank you.

975
01:17:16,669 --> 01:17:18,837
I... I won't overspend it.

976
01:17:25,177 --> 01:17:26,887
ORDER
TOTAL: 46,200 WON

977
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:29,682
Buy me dinner, too.

978
01:17:35,062 --> 01:17:35,896
Darn it.

979
01:17:37,982 --> 01:17:38,816
My gosh.

980
01:17:41,026 --> 01:17:42,069
Buy me dinner.

981
01:17:42,152 --> 01:17:44,530
Pay for mine as well. Buy me dinner, too.

982
01:17:44,947 --> 01:17:45,781
Darn it.

983
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:48,158
Why are you leaving me out?
Buy me dinner, too.

984
01:17:48,242 --> 01:17:49,243
Excuse me.

985
01:17:50,494 --> 01:17:52,246
How much does she need to pay?

986
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,753
Then give me an allowance.

987
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:02,297
No one gives me that kind of stuff,

988
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:04,091
and I don't have a family to eat with.

989
01:18:04,216 --> 01:18:05,718
I'm really an orphan now.

990
01:18:15,352 --> 01:18:16,812
Let's go home.

991
01:18:19,481 --> 01:18:20,399
Sang-tae.

992
01:18:24,236 --> 01:18:27,030
I want a big brother like you!

993
01:18:49,595 --> 01:18:51,138
Come on, Gang-tae!

994
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:04,443
Ko Mun-yeong!

995
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:08,655
Ko Mun-yeong...

996
01:19:10,741 --> 01:19:12,242
Mun-yeong, get over here!

997
01:19:13,952 --> 01:19:16,330
Hurry... Hurry up, Mun-yeong.
Aren't you guys coming?

998
01:19:16,413 --> 01:19:18,665
Ko Mun-yeong. Moon Gang-tae.
Let's go. Hurry up.

999
01:19:22,377 --> 01:19:23,212
Hurry...

1000
01:19:48,946 --> 01:19:52,032
<i>Sang-tae, do you know
the fairy tale called </i>The Ugly Duckling<i>?</i>

1001
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:55,536
Yes.

1002
01:19:56,036 --> 01:20:00,165
The... The other ducks are mean
to the ugly duckling.

1003
01:20:00,249 --> 01:20:01,792
They bully him

1004
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,044
because he looks different from them.

1005
01:20:04,628 --> 01:20:06,296
So he gets really lonely

1006
01:20:06,964 --> 01:20:08,757
and leaves his family, right?

1007
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:14,721
Mun-yeong, don't run down the stairs!

1008
01:20:14,805 --> 01:20:17,057
You'll get hurt! It's dangerous!

1009
01:20:17,182 --> 01:20:18,600
Stop running.

1010
01:20:22,437 --> 01:20:24,148
<i>What do you think would've happened</i>

1011
01:20:24,731 --> 01:20:26,984
<i>if the mother duck gave lots of love</i>

1012
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:28,569
<i>to the ugly duckling?</i>

1013
01:20:29,278 --> 01:20:31,738
<i>Then... Then it wouldn't have left.</i>

1014
01:20:34,074 --> 01:20:35,909
<i>If the adult embraces the kids,</i>

1015
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:39,371
<i>the ducks and swans</i>

1016
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:42,916
<i>can all get along
and live together just fine.</i>

1017
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:46,420
Hey, duck. Chickens.

1018
01:20:46,628 --> 01:20:50,007
Don't fight with each other, okay?

1019
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:54,261
Sang-tae.

1020
01:20:55,888 --> 01:20:58,974
Are you an adult
who knows how to embrace others?

1021
01:20:59,683 --> 01:21:00,517
Yes.

1022
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:05,606
I'm... I'm an adult. An adult.

1023
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:07,149
I'm...

1024
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:11,570
I'm an adult like Ko Gil-dong.

A family...

1031
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,153
One, two, three.

1034
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:04,159
I hate kids and animals.

1035
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:05,535
Because they beg for love...

1036
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:07,496
Let go. Let go of me.

<i>Don't let the past trap you.</i>
