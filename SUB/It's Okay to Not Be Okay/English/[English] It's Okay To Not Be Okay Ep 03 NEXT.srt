<font color="#ffff80">OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</font>

5
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:37,148
This happens sometimes when it rains.

6
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,943
I heard everyone was against this hospital

7
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:43,028
being built where a cemetery used to be.

8
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,534
Maybe it's because earthbound spirits here
are all very resentful.

9
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:50,661
Be careful
when you do your rounds at night.

10
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:53,247
I'll let the maintenance team know.

11
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,629
He's fearless.

12
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,592
Yes, the ones in the rooms are fine.

13
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:07,344
But the lights in the lobby
and the reception area are out.

14
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:10,556
Yes, okay.

15
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>Once you wear those shoes,</i>

16
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:16,061
<i>your feet start dancing on their own.</i>

17
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:19,356
<i>And you can never stop dancing</i>

18
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,985
<i>or take off those shoes.</i>

19
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:28,866
<i>Some things can't be torn apart
no matter how hard you try to do so.</i>

20
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,468
<i>I have</i>

21
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:50,971
<i>finally found my red shoes.</i>

22
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:04,443
Why

23
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,154
are you here?

24
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:08,781
Why do you think?

25
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,283
I came because I missed you.

26
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:42,815
<font color="#ffff80">CHAPTER 3 SLEEPING WITCH</font>

27
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,827
I clearly said I didn't want
to cross paths with you ever again.

28
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:58,080
You did say that,
but I never agreed to it.

29
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:08,382
What are you doing?

30
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:10,676
I'm just fascinated.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,178
You grew up to be a great guy.

32
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:17,474
I'd say you didn't just grow,
you went through an evolution.

33
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:22,604
Do you know me?

34
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,149
I want to get to know you better.

35
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:26,608
When do you get off work?

36
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,485
I rushed here on an empty stomach.

37
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,154
I'm freaking starving right now.

38
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,989
Is there a good restaurant
in this tiny town?

39
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,326
What do you want from me?

40
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,537
I know you won't back off
until you get it,

41
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,372
so tell me what you want.
What do you want?

42
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:42,458
"Just take it and leave"?

43
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,126
Yes, if you don't mind.

44
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,003
You.

45
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:48,589
I'll take it and leave.

46
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,841
Moon Gang-tae, what I want is you.

47
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,638
-Why me?
-Because I can't stop wanting you.

48
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:59,266
-But why?
-Because you're so pretty.

49
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:04,646
Well, you know.
Like shoes, clothes, and cars.

50
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,440
When I see something pretty, I want it.

51
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:07,941
And I need to have what I want.

52
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,611
Whether I have to pay for it, steal it,

53
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:11,987
or just take it by force.

54
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,614
What matters is that I make it mine.

55
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:16,367
You don't need some grand reason
to desire something, right?

56
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,336
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

57
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:32,841
The director would like to speak
with the patient's guardian.

58
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:37,930
<font color="#ffff80">HOSPITAL MISSION
IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY</font>

59
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:41,141
We'll have to see how he recovers,

60
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:44,061
but his cognitive functions
were impaired to begin with,

61
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,272
so he may not recognize you now
even though you're his daughter.

62
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,653
You can have a seat here.

63
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:55,989
No, thanks.

64
00:04:56,573 --> 00:05:00,160
Mental disorders accompanied
by brain tumors like your father's case

65
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,037
are difficult to treat.

66
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:05,207
But we can help reduce the symptoms.

67
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,417
Are you kidding me?

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,877
Even if the legendary doctor,
Hua Tuo, is resurrected,

69
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,629
it wouldn't be possible.

70
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,258
His memory is all messed up,

71
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,677
he keeps hearing and seeing things,

72
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:19,138
and he gets scared for no reason.

73
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:22,516
Also, he keeps saying things
that make no sense.

74
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:26,520
His symptoms are really awful, I must say.

75
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,772
Those symptoms remind me
of people who are possessed.

76
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:30,774
Should I hire an exorcist
and hold a ritual?

77
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:37,281
I'll write him a prescription
which will be much more effective

78
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,492
than an exorcism or a talisman.

79
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,012
He looks nothing like her, right?

80
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:02,764
Professor Ko's daughter is very pretty.

81
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,476
I guess she got her looks
from her late mother.

82
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:06,977
His daughter is here?

83
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,605
Is she pretty?
Which celebrity does she look like?

84
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,565
Did you drink again?

85
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,735
If you keep that up,
you'll be stuck here forever.

86
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:17,488
No, I didn't drink.

87
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,033
I'm serious. I didn't drink at all.

88
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:23,577
Here.

89
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:34,004
<font color="#ffff80">OK GROUP THERAPY PROGRAM</font>

90
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:36,423
What is this?

91
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,675
It's the prescription I just mentioned.

92
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,597
It's our hospital's group therapy program.

93
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,933
Have a look.

94
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:49,561
From cooking, art, and music
to meditation and gardening,

95
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:52,231
the program offers all kinds of classes

96
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,565
designed to help treat patients,

97
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,736
except for a class on literature.

98
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:03,116
In psychiatry, balance is very important.

99
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:04,952
So what?

100
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,288
Can you help us out for an hour,
twice a week?

101
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,458
It can be about reading or writing.

102
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:15,420
It doesn't matter. Just think of it as
using your skill sets to do a good deed.

103
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,215
Please teach a class, Ms. Ko.

104
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,177
Well, sir.

105
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,140
The most important part,
the terms and conditions of employment.

106
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,227
Every time you come here to teach,

107
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,729
you can take your father out
for a 30-minute walk.

108
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:36,650
Shouldn't I be suggesting
the terms that I want?

109
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:43,532
This is what I prescribe
to the patient and you, his guardian.

110
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,045
I must say, she's got quite a temper.

111
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,715
You didn't actually think
she'd agree to it, did you?

112
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:03,552
Do you not watch the news?
She's been all over the news.

113
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,888
But she came all the way here
despite what's going on,

114
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:12,269
which tells me that she's after
someone or something that's here.

115
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:21,528
Hey, you're here.

116
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:26,992
Did you see her?
I heard Ko Mun-yeong came by.

117
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,994
Gosh, I heard
she's drop-dead gorgeous in person.

118
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,537
I should've come earlier.

119
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:34,416
-Do you think she left already?
-Who cares? It's none of your business.

120
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,209
What will you do about this?

121
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,295
What about it?

122
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,882
You botched it all up like this.

123
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:43,467
You told me to cut it up

124
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,761
because the patients
could hang themselves with it.

125
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:48,930
I told you to just make a few cuts,
not to cut it into pieces.

126
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,601
Okay, I heard you.
This doesn't even cost much.

127
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,646
I'll just buy a box of it.

128
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:57,189
You're pissing me off.

129
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:00,942
Where are you going?

130
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:03,528
The bathroom.

131
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,884
Just leave it if you're scared
of getting an earful from Ms. Park.

132
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,678
I'll return it later.

133
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,846
Yes, save that for later.
Let's go eat something first.

134
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:33,308
What are you doing here?

135
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,448
You can't come in here. Get out.

136
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:51,326
The guy who just left said
I'd find you here and let me in.

137
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:53,912
-Get out.
-Why?

138
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,497
-Just get out.
-Gosh.

139
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:03,088
Let go of me.

140
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,454
What? You think we should pretend
not to know each other?

141
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,456
That's what your face is telling me.

142
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,208
I'd appreciate that.

143
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:42,544
Sure, it's nothing difficult.

144
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:47,883
How do you and Gang-tae know each other?

145
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:54,055
Why do you ask? That you can't ignore?

146
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,476
That's something I never understood.

147
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:02,981
How can you define a relationship
in just one word?

148
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,910
<i>Every encounter we've had
was awfully dramatic,</i>

149
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:16,244
<i>being an inch away from death.</i>

150
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:21,374
<i>And every moment we crossed paths,
we surprised each other.</i>

151
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,056
If such coincidences, one after another,

152
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:38,183
somehow led us here,

153
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,187
how would you define our relationship?

154
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:48,735
It'd be such a cliché to say
that we're destined for each other.

155
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:49,945
Right?

156
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:17,138
Get in.

157
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,142
I said, get in.

158
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:26,064
Where are you?

159
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,111
I'll call you again later.

160
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:35,782
Don't waste your energy. Just get in.

161
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,242
Let's go eat some meat. I'm hungry.

162
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:40,078
Go by yourself. I have plans for dinner.

163
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,080
Oh, with Sang-tae?

164
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,083
That works out perfectly.

165
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,377
We can have the meet-and-greet today.
Where do you live?

166
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:56,011
I guess bulldozing your way through
like this usually works,

167
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,429
but it'll never work with me.

168
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,600
You're going to play hard to get?

169
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,268
This will be fun.

170
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:05,186
Let's find out
whether you'll give in or not.

171
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:08,857
Okay, fine.

172
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,026
Look at those glaring eyes of yours.

173
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,319
I'll leave you alone today.

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,743
But I'll kidnap you if you
play hard to get next time I see you!

175
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:33,650
Fuck, that scared the crap out of me.

176
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,235
Shut up, you stupid deer!

177
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:37,362
You won't shut up?

178
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,789
<font color="#ffff80">SEONGJIN DEER MILK</font>

179
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,590
-Have a great day.
-Thank you.

180
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:20,238
I thought you were having dinner with her.

181
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:22,198
No, we're not close.

182
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:25,535
And dinner is the only meal
I can have at home,

183
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,370
so I should eat with my brother.

184
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,080
Right.

185
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:33,960
Hey, Jae-su.

186
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,922
I'm in front of the house.
There's Coke in the fridge.

187
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,883
Yes.

188
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,676
Okay.

189
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,277
<font color="#ffff80">BORN IN OJI-GUN, SEONGJIN CITY</font>

190
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,736
This isn't good.

191
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,865
Gosh, she really shouldn't go
to this place.

192
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,450
What place?

193
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:33,913
The cursed castle.

194
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:55,935
<i>It's a mansion Mun-yeong's father built</i>

195
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,771
<i>to celebrate her birth.</i>

196
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:03,151
<i>He built it
in the middle of a remote forest</i>

197
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:07,155
<i>so that his wife could focus
on her writing.</i>

198
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:52,283
It used to be a fancy mansion, and it even
won a grand award for its architecture.

199
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:56,788
But it's turned into ruins.

200
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,414
It's like a haunted house.

201
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:02,168
But she can sell it.
Why hasn't she sold it all this time?

202
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:05,255
Hey, how can she sell it
when it's not sellable?

203
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:08,383
Her mother ended up like that
in that house,

204
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,634
and her father...

205
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,427
Even he ended up like this.

206
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:14,931
Who'd want to buy a house
where so many bad things happened?

207
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,558
"Like that" and "like this"?

208
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,438
What exactly happened to them?

209
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:25,191
Don't pry, or you'll get in trouble.

210
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,111
Okay.

211
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,533
By the way,
why did Ms. Ko go there out of the blue?

212
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:35,785
Right?

213
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,288
I wonder why.

214
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:39,706
What do you think?

215
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:44,586
It's because some idiot
did a background check on someone

216
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:47,422
and showed her that
without even telling me!

217
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,427
I did it because I figured it'd be better

218
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:55,680
than losing my life for not doing the job.

219
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:57,098
What did you say?

220
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:59,642
Gosh, you little...

221
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:02,353
Jeez, seriously. Unbelievable!

222
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,081
Also, he keeps saying things
that make no sense.

223
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:49,001
His symptoms are really awful, I must say.

224
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,815
I'm hungry.

225
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:24,704
Grilled pork belly. It looks delicious!

226
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:32,003
Hey, sweetie.

227
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,129
Open wide.

228
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:37,508
-Oh, my legs.
-My gosh!

229
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:38,968
-Take this.
-Here, I got it.

230
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:41,387
-Gosh, it's hot!
-It's hot. Be careful.

231
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,722
Nice, look at this stew.

232
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:47,185
This soybean paste stew looks so good!

233
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:53,816
I was told I'd live a comfortable life
starting at the age of 60.

234
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,401
It was totally right.

235
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:59,489
Three young men moved into this house
in the middle of nowhere,

236
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,033
and I can even collect rent
every month now.

237
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,619
I live with good people
who bring me money.

238
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:06,746
I got so lucky in my twilight years.

239
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:11,667
I'm renting a semi-basement room
that doesn't get much natural light.

240
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:15,546
It's not fair that I'm paying as much
as they're paying for their rooftop room.

241
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:18,382
You're renting the biggest room
in this house.

242
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,180
Hey, pass me your bowl.

243
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,349
Sure.

244
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:29,477
All right.

245
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:32,897
-Here, have some more.
-My gosh.

246
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,651
That's too much.

247
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:39,153
I have to take a fistful of pills,

248
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:41,280
so I need to save some room.

249
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,202
Eat up.

250
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:48,704
You eat like a bird.
That's why you're so skinny.

251
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:52,333
Don't force him to eat more.
He won't be able to digest the food.

252
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,292
Goodness.

253
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:57,630
Look at you.
Didn't you say you were on a diet?

254
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:05,012
Sang-tae.

255
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,015
Gang-tae has been picked.

256
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:09,892
What? Someone pinched you?
That must've hurt.

257
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:11,394
-Where? Your foot?
-No.

258
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,646
I'm saying
she wants him to be her son-in-law.

259
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:14,897
She's got her eyes on him.

260
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:17,233
What? The eyes? That's very dangerous.

261
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:18,693
Hey, eat up.

262
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:21,612
-Eat. Eat up.
-Eat up.

263
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:24,907
-Hey, don't.
-Don't do that!

264
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:26,367
No! A bug!

265
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:28,411
There's a bug!

266
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:39,463
It's cold.

267
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:53,686
<i>Once upon a time
in a castle in the middle of a deep forest</i>

268
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,940
<i>lived a princess
who had been asleep for many years.</i>

269
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:24,133
<i>"A needle on a spinning wheel
will kill her."</i>

270
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:27,011
<i>That was the curse</i>

271
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,390
<i>the evil witch put on the princess
the day she was born.</i>

272
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:35,770
<i>Frightened, the King burned
every spinning wheel in his kingdom</i>

273
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,813
<i>to avoid the curse,</i>

274
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:42,735
<i>but the princess ended up getting pricked
by a thorn on the rose</i>

275
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,196
<i>given to her by the witch in disguise
and fell asleep.</i>

276
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,173
<i>This fairy tale tells you that</i>

277
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,761
<i>you can never escape your destiny.</i>

278
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,847
<i>Right.</i>

279
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,517
<i>The prince's kiss.</i>

280
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,063
<i>I suppose he could break the curse.</i>

281
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,735
<i>But don't get your hopes up too high.</i>

282
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:30,324
Because

283
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:35,996
I will kill that prince.

284
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:26,797
<i>Save me!</i>

285
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:29,592
<i>Please...</i>

286
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,636
<i>Save me.</i>

287
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:37,099
<i>Please...</i>

288
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,226
<i>Save me.</i>

289
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,356
<i>Save me!</i>

290
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:56,952
<i>When you can't control yourself,</i>

291
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:00,206
<i>cross your arms like this</i>

292
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:02,792
and take turns
tapping on each shoulder like this.

293
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:42,414
Don't cry.

294
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:46,395
<i>Oh, he's here.</i>

295
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:52,735
Is he someone high up?

296
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:55,070
His father is an assemblyman
from this district.

297
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:58,574
Hey, Min-seok.

298
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,077
-Haeng-ja!
-My gosh.

299
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:06,081
From afar,
I thought you were Chow Yun Fat.

300
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,417
-How have you been?
-Well, you know. So-so.

301
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,753
Everything's been good
at the hospital, right?

302
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:12,463
Of course, thanks to you.

303
00:30:12,546 --> 00:30:14,381
-All right, let's go.
-Wait, hang on.

304
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:17,134
Well, I'm here.

305
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:18,969
How come the director
is nowhere to be seen?

306
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,846
Oh, is it because of my sunglasses?

307
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:24,433
Oh, he's in the bathroom?

308
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:27,311
Yong! Where are you?

309
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:28,562
Cheo-yong!

310
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,314
Cheo-yong.

311
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,948
I need it to take a nap.
Without it, I'll have sleep paralysis.

312
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,285
All problems can be sorted out.

313
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:45,496
No, not this.

314
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,873
This one is huge.

315
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:49,750
There are many witnesses,

316
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:52,419
and the rumors are spreading so quickly.

317
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:55,547
Damn it! Why does this country
have to be an IT powerhouse?

318
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:58,133
Stop whining. You're making my head pound.

319
00:30:58,217 --> 00:31:01,262
Hey, I bet you don't want to cry
as much as I do.

320
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:04,765
They're even saying you should be
disqualified as a candidate for the award.

321
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:07,226
And there's an injunction request
against your new book...

322
00:31:09,728 --> 00:31:10,646
<i>Forget it.</i>

323
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,773
Mun-yeong.

324
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,610
Let's just gather some reporters
and cry our eyes out.

325
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:18,362
I mean, you're a great actress.

326
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,322
I've even written your lines.

327
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:22,533
"The stress from the creative process,
the new book,

328
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:24,952
<i>my insomnia, and so on</i>

329
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:27,496
<i>led me to lose grip over my emotions
and make such a mistake--"</i>

330
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:28,789
Use Ko Dae-hwan as an excuse.

331
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,209
Who? You mean, your father?

332
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,752
Write this down.

333
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:35,504
"Ko Mun-yeong disappears.

334
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:40,092
But turns out, she's been looking after
her father with dementia.

335
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:41,677
Will she retire from her career?"

336
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,264
End it with a question
so that it sounds like a possibility.

337
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,851
<font color="#ffff80">RETIRE</font>

338
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,229
Yes.

339
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:56,275
The witch disappears
in the middle of a witch hunt.

340
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:58,610
That's it!

341
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:01,405
The public will want you back.

342
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:06,702
Mun-yeong, great minds think alike!

343
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:09,204
We're such a great team, don't you think?

344
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:11,957
Hello? Hey, hello?

345
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:16,336
Goodness, that heartless woman.

346
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,172
You want to use your father as an excuse?

347
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:21,216
She scares me.

348
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:32,102
<font color="#ffff80">HOW CAN WE HELP?</font>

349
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,501
The show begins now.

350
00:32:57,795 --> 00:33:04,802
<font color="#ffff80">IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY</font>

351
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:15,687
There's a camera in this room.

352
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:17,648
I know.

353
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:21,693
The thought of someone looking at me
intently gets me so excited.

354
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,656
You can put your stuff here.

355
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,117
Why don't you get changed first?

356
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:29,827
You look very cold now.

357
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,955
No, I'm not cold at all.
You're totally mistaken.

358
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,375
What? Manic syndrome?

359
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,336
He comes here every spring
due to his acute manic episodes,

360
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,838
so make sure he doesn't escape.

361
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:44,091
Whenever it rains, he sneaks out
and wanders in the mountains.

362
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,467
He's fast, so he's hard to catch.

363
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:48,595
Gosh, an assemblyman's son
suffers from manic episodes?

364
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:51,181
Does the President never catch a cold?

365
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:53,392
Why does his dad's vocation matter?

366
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:55,686
It's not like his condition
is something he has to hide.

367
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:59,398
You should not deal with patients
with such biased--

368
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:02,192
Okay, I heard you.
I will remember that, ma'am.

369
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,777
What? Ma'am?

370
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:06,280
Hey, I'm not done. Get back here.

371
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:08,490
Hey, that brat... My gosh, look at him.

372
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:10,409
Cha-yong.

373
00:34:10,993 --> 00:34:13,620
Hey, that punk...
He must have lost his mind, right?

374
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:17,749
I'm thinking he might have
oppositional defiant disorder.

375
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:19,751
Yes.

376
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:21,795
Well, you're right.

377
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:24,381
He needs help. I shouldn't be mad at him.

378
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:27,134
Don't get mad at him, Haeng-ja.

379
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:29,303
Hey, Cha-yong!

380
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,224
Have you heard of the place called
Morning Sun?

381
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:38,187
It's a club where you can party
until the sun comes up. Hence the name.

382
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,564
You know, I heard it's the hottest club
at the moment,

383
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,941
so I went there.

384
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,739
The pretty girls and the good music

385
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:52,659
totally lifted my spirits,
so I did something nice.

386
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,329
All right!

387
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,708
Everything's on me, all night!

388
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,793
-Drink all you want!
-Nice!

389
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:11,512
I love spending money on others.

390
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,432
I should become a philanthropist
if I have nothing else to do later on.

391
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:19,520
Anyway, I think the bill came
to about 20 million won that night.

392
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:20,562
But...

393
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:25,609
This credit card
has been reported missing.

394
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,408
My dad totally blindsided me.

395
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,370
I had no choice

396
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:38,455
but to run like fuck.

397
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,643
I just ran into the road
because I had to lose them.

398
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:02,479
Then I got freaking hot
because I had been running for a while.

399
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:05,857
And that's why I took off all my clothes!

400
00:37:03,874 --> 00:37:06,043
And I ended up here again.

401
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,670
How fast can you run 100m?

402
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:11,173
Me? I'm so freaking fast.

403
00:37:11,548 --> 00:37:13,967
See that? About seven seconds, I think.
What about you?

404
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:16,511
Me? Six seconds.

405
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:20,182
What? Do you have four legs?
Are you a cheetah or something?

406
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:21,683
We can have a race if you'd like.

407
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:25,687
I like you.

408
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,398
Shall we go to the counseling room?

409
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:29,983
Let's go.

410
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,276
<font color="#ffff80">COUNSELING ROOM</font>

411
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,113
My gosh. From the back,
I can tell that you work out.

412
00:37:35,197 --> 00:37:37,491
What do you do? I can tell you're ripped.

413
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:38,909
-Min-seok!
-Welcome.

414
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:40,285
Gosh, Min-seok.

415
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:42,746
You know you have to be here by 3 p.m.

416
00:37:44,122 --> 00:37:45,415
Call me when you get here.

417
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,252
What are you up to now?
Are you doodling on your book again?

418
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,590
No, on the dough.

419
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:57,219
Jae-su is actually very rich. Who knew?

420
00:37:57,302 --> 00:37:58,470
What?

421
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:00,555
-Hello.
-Come on in.

422
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,392
Hey, customers. We have customers.

423
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:06,186
Is it Gang-tae? Hang up.

424
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:07,437
What was that sound just now?

425
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:08,980
Hang up. Just hang up!

426
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:11,900
-Hey, where are you?
-He wants me to hang up.

427
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:19,282
Gang-tae!

428
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,327
We have to move the patients
to the therapy room.

429
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,370
All right.

430
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:28,041
By the way, is that really true?

431
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:31,253
We saw on the sign that a free caricature
comes with a full-size pizza.

432
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:33,046
Of course.

433
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,173
Just for a month,
to celebrate our grand opening.

434
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:39,553
Mr. Picasso over there will draw you one
in just ten minutes.

435
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:42,639
Just a moment, please.

436
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:46,226
What do I do?

437
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:47,561
-Sang-tae, they want one.
-Gosh.

438
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:50,772
If Gang-tae finds out,
we'll get kicked out.

439
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,941
I didn't even go to school
and lied to him.

440
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,777
Gosh, he'll kick me out. No doubt!

441
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:57,738
Hey, we've already agreed to this.

442
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:59,364
I'll pay you 10,000 won per caricature.

443
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:01,658
-You said you needed money.
-Yes, I do need money.

444
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:03,410
Yes, you can use your skills
and earn money.

445
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:05,162
The free caricatures
will attract customers.

446
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:06,788
What's the problem?

447
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:12,752
Sang-tae, we're doing a good deed.
Consider it a donation.

448
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:18,550
You're donating your skills.

449
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,012
That is a good deed.

450
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:24,055
Hello.

451
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,519
<font color="#ffff80">THERAPY ROOM</font>

452
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:46,786
I'm Ko Mun-yeong. I'll be teaching
this literature class from now on.

453
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:54,628
She's beautiful.

454
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,884
<font color="#ffff80">FAIRY...</font>

455
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,559
What is a fairy tale?

456
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,313
The story of me marrying IU.

457
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,315
Stop drinking, will you?

458
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:17,901
-He's drunk again.
-He's alcohol-dependent, Ms. Ko.

459
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:20,153
Jeong-tae, you and your drunk talk.

460
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:22,531
-I'm not drunk.
-I call that bullshit.

461
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:25,951
Attention, everyone.

462
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:29,538
A fairy tale is a cruel fantasy
that illustrates

463
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:33,959
the brutality and violence of this world
in a paradoxical manner.

464
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:36,920
What?

465
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,339
-A fantasy?
-What did she say?

466
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:40,840
Shall I give you an example?

467
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:42,717
What does <i>Heungbu and Nolbu</i> teach us?

468
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:46,137
If you're a good person,
you'll win the lottery.

469
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:49,307
-True that.
-Wrong.

470
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:52,686
Heungbu was poor
because he wasn't the eldest son.

471
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,646
It criticizes the primogeniture customs

472
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,731
that allowed the eldest sons
to inherit everything.

473
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:58,984
-Is that so?
-Gosh.

474
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:00,318
What about <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>?

475
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:04,197
Don't discriminate against ugly kids.

476
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:07,659
Wrong. The lesson is, "Raising
someone else's child is unrewarding,

477
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:09,077
so just look after your own."

478
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:11,580
-Oh, right.
-Excuse me, Ms. Ko?

479
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:12,998
What about <i>The Little Mermaid</i>?

480
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:17,002
I know. When you're in love,
you must love that person faithfully

481
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:20,130
even if that means you'll dissolve
into sea foam.

482
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:22,340
-My gosh!
-Oh, my!

483
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:24,676
-My goodness.
-She loved her husband so faithfully

484
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:27,137
that she let him beat her up to a pulp.

485
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,723
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

486
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,349
That I didn't know.

487
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:35,812
It wasn't his fault. Alcohol is to blame.

488
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:40,567
Alcohol is always the problem.

489
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:45,280
Get out if you want to cry.

490
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:55,040
All right. The lesson we can take
from <i>The Little Mermaid</i>

491
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,085
is that karma will bite you hard

492
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,837
if you covet an engaged man.

493
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:05,133
Then what about <i>King Donkey Ears</i>?

494
00:42:05,842 --> 00:42:08,053
Talk behind people's backs
to relieve your stress.

495
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:12,265
-I see.
-Maybe I should do that.

496
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,017
<i>I guess it kind of makes sense.</i>

497
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:20,357
So let me sum up today's class for you.

498
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:23,860
A fairy tale isn't a hallucinogen
that gives us hopes and dreams.

499
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,488
It's a stimulant
that makes us face reality.

500
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,617
So I hope you all read
a lot of fairy tales

501
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:33,912
and wake up from your dreams.

502
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:37,415
Ms. Ko.

503
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,459
Don't look up at the stars
in the beautiful night sky.

504
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,503
Look down at your feet
that are stuck in a filthy sewer.

505
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:45,840
The moment you realize that
and accept your reality...

506
00:42:57,143 --> 00:42:57,978
Let's be happy.

507
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:00,689
Let's all live happy lives.

508
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:08,571
Who's here?

509
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,992
I guess you didn't know
because you weren't at the weekly meeting.

510
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:14,619
The director asked Ms. Ko
to teach literature to our patients

511
00:43:14,703 --> 00:43:17,205
in return for letting her dad
go for a walk every time she visits.

512
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:19,958
What? "A walk"?

513
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,378
I have to say,
the director really is something.

514
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:26,965
He said Ms. Ko must have something here
that she wants.

515
00:43:27,632 --> 00:43:29,300
I guess he was right.

516
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:44,733
How was my first class?

517
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:47,110
How was it?

518
00:43:50,155 --> 00:43:51,364
Do you really believe that?

519
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:53,032
What?

520
00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:56,953
That we'll be fine once we accept reality.

521
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:57,871
Yes.

522
00:43:57,954 --> 00:44:00,999
"This is who I am,
and you are who you are."

523
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:02,250
We just need to accept that.

524
00:44:04,419 --> 00:44:05,837
So what if we're okay with it

525
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:08,631
when the entire world
doesn't think that way?

526
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,633
They all refuse to accept...

527
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,889
Sorry. It was so boring
that I almost fell asleep.

528
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:19,058
Get out so I can turn off the lights.

529
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:32,530
-Just accept it.
-Accept what?

530
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:33,782
That you're not satisfied.

531
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,374
See? I can see your eyes
burning with desire.

532
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:49,172
That's why I like you.
You're arrogant but shallow.

533
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:54,219
I noticed you're always
smiling to the patients.

534
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:57,096
But why are you so cold to me?
You were really passionate that night.

535
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:02,811
What are you talking about?

536
00:45:03,728 --> 00:45:05,480
I dreamt of you a few days ago.

537
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:26,793
You sat me down on my bed
and did this to me.

538
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:39,889
Yes, I'm horny. I admit that.

539
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,058
Lower your voice.

540
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:49,607
Do you want to sleep with me?

541
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,612
What?

542
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,198
She's amazing.

543
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:02,078
Unbelievable.

544
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,872
<font color="#ffff80">UNDER RENOVATION
DO NOT ENTER</font>

545
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:09,460
I told you to stop.

546
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:11,337
I'm sick of your jokes.

547
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:13,965
I have no time to play with you.

548
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:17,385
That means if you had the time,
you'd play along.

549
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,263
Don't jump to conclusions.

550
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:22,265
Why live a boring life?

551
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:26,519
You'll get sick
if you suppress yourself like that.

552
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:29,397
If you want to have fun, then have fun.
I know you want some fun.

553
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,860
What do you know about me?

554
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:35,945
Who are you to act up like this?

555
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:40,408
Hypocrite.

556
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:56,007
Why are you so startled?

557
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,176
It's not like I called you a murderer.

558
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,097
What's that look on your face?

559
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,391
Someone might think it's true.

560
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:10,146
People are all hypocrites.
We all live with a lot of hatred,

561
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:12,106
but we act like that's not the case.

562
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,489
After all, who isn't flawless?

563
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:46,099
Can you be nicer to A-reum?

564
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:47,433
What did I do?

565
00:47:47,725 --> 00:47:52,522
Her depression
has gotten worse these days.

566
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:55,191
Then give her drugs.
There's nothing I can do.

567
00:48:07,745 --> 00:48:09,956
It'll just be a moment.
It'll end even before you know it.

568
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:26,305
Mr. Ko!

569
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:28,433
Mr. Ko, what's wrong?

570
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,479
Ms. Ko?

571
00:48:34,188 --> 00:48:36,107
Hey! Let me go!

572
00:48:36,315 --> 00:48:40,069
I'm totally fine! I'm not crazy!

573
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:41,779
Sang-tae.

574
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:43,823
Sang-tae.

575
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,910
Gang-tae. Gang-tae won't answer his phone.

576
00:48:47,994 --> 00:48:51,289
I... I pressed number three for emergency.
Number three.

577
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:52,623
Number three. Nam Ju-ri.

578
00:48:52,707 --> 00:48:55,126
-You did great. Wait here for a moment.
-Okay.

579
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:01,174
Can you check
Mr. Joo Jeong-tae's test results?

580
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:02,467
Okay.

581
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:08,097
Sang-tae.

582
00:49:10,141 --> 00:49:11,142
Sang-tae.

583
00:49:24,072 --> 00:49:25,323
It's Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

584
00:49:26,908 --> 00:49:28,534
Where did she go?

585
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:31,287
Did you see Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

586
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,591
-Sang-tae.
-Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

587
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:45,760
What are you doing here?
Ju-ri is looking for you.

588
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:49,097
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong was here.
I saw Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

589
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,516
Where did she go? Did you see her?

590
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,392
I bet you were mistaken.
Why would that woman be here?

591
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:55,103
Not "that woman." Writer Ko Mun-yeong.

592
00:49:55,186 --> 00:49:58,481
Yes, why would Ms. Ko be here?
I'm sure you were mistaken.

593
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:00,691
-Let's go. You were mistaken.
-Okay.

594
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:03,528
-You're late.
-I'm sure I saw her here.

595
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:06,114
Sang-tae, once we get there,

596
00:50:07,115 --> 00:50:09,492
-be polite to the director.
-Okay.

597
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,994
Ms. Ko.

598
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,163
Ms. Ko.

599
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,750
You can't leave already.

600
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,502
You need to take
your father out for a walk.

601
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:21,921
-Why would I do that?
-What?

602
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:25,258
I heard that's why you decided
to teach here.

603
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:27,718
The director told me you made a promise.

604
00:50:28,302 --> 00:50:30,847
That's not true. I don't make promises.

605
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:36,769
What the...

606
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,238
<font color="#ffff80">DIRECTOR'S OFFICE</font>

607
00:51:21,105 --> 00:51:22,523
Stegosaurus.

608
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:26,736
It has a huge body,

609
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,821
but it has a tiny brain.

610
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:30,948
It's the dumbest dinosaur
among all dinosaurs.

611
00:51:31,991 --> 00:51:34,535
But it's also very innocent.

612
00:51:37,246 --> 00:51:38,581
What's that guy's name?

613
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:42,001
Ko Gil-dong. His name is Ko Gil-dong.

614
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:55,723
Mr. Moon.

615
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:01,687
This is... This is my favorite book.
This one is my favorite, too.

616
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:04,982
This is my favorite jelly. The green ones
taste like apple. I love them.

617
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:06,901
My hat. I wear it when I draw.

618
00:52:06,984 --> 00:52:09,237
I'm not an artist,
but I wear that when I draw.

619
00:52:09,987 --> 00:52:12,865
He gave this to me as a gift.
He seems to like me.

620
00:52:15,576 --> 00:52:16,869
I love them.

621
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:22,124
Your brother is really good at drawing.

622
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:25,086
He's too talented
to just keep it as a hobby.

623
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:26,587
I can even draw your face.

624
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:29,465
It's 10,000 won per drawing.
You don't need to order pizza.

625
00:52:34,387 --> 00:52:37,431
By any chance, did he mention
anything about butterflies?

626
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,225
"Butterflies"?

627
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:41,185
No.

628
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:44,605
Today's his first day.
I'm sure he'll tell me one day.

629
00:52:51,445 --> 00:52:52,822
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

630
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:56,158
Isn't the outside view beautiful?

631
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:58,369
It's the best thing about our hospital.

632
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,332
But you see, I'd like to move that view
to somewhere else.

633
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:05,584
-Will you help me do that, Sang-tae?
-Yes.

635
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,138
Move it to where?

636
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:20,975
I want to move it here.

637
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:23,519
Sang-tae,

638
00:53:24,186 --> 00:53:26,397
I bet you're talented enough to draw

639
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:29,567
the exact picturesque view
from my office window.

640
00:53:31,736 --> 00:53:32,987
Can you do it?

641
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:35,156
But sir--

642
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:38,075
This is my prescription for him.

643
00:53:38,993 --> 00:53:40,369
How much

644
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,497
are you going to pay?

645
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:45,875
How much... How much money will you pay?

646
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:48,544
-How much will I get paid?
-What?

647
00:53:48,627 --> 00:53:51,130
-Sang-tae--
-I'll do it if you pay me a lot.

648
00:53:51,213 --> 00:53:52,882
How much are you going to pay me?

649
00:53:57,303 --> 00:53:58,637
That depends on your drawing.

650
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:03,476
Sang-tae.

651
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:05,978
How much will I get paid?

652
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,738
Let's see.

653
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,209
Sang-tae, you're rich.

654
00:54:30,169 --> 00:54:31,670
Let me see. How much did you save up?

655
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:35,800
No, no. I won't...
I won't show this to anyone

656
00:54:35,883 --> 00:54:37,468
until I reach my goal.

657
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:40,971
But I'm your brother.

658
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:43,808
To an autistic person,
family members are like close strangers.

659
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:45,393
A close stranger.

660
00:54:50,022 --> 00:54:51,690
So how much do you plan to save up?

661
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:54,276
I need 32,890,000 won.

662
00:54:55,236 --> 00:54:57,405
-What are you going to buy with that?
-I will buy a car.

663
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,365
-A car?
-A car.

664
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:01,534
Why all of a sudden?

665
00:55:02,743 --> 00:55:03,869
A car.

666
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:08,624
-Is that also a secret?
-A car.

667
00:55:12,545 --> 00:55:13,671
Okay, I won't ask.

672
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,078
It's really cheap.

Why do you want this?

674
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:52,543
If we buy that,
we won't have to move every year.

675
00:55:52,626 --> 00:55:54,837
We can run away
even if the butterfly chases us.

676
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:57,923
We don't need to pack up
and move somewhere else.

677
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:01,844
Then... Then the landlord
won't get angry at my brother.

678
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:03,804
We can go anywhere.

679
00:56:08,726 --> 00:56:09,643
Sang-tae.

680
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:14,356
I still need 32,270,000 won more.

681
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,568
Sang-tae.

682
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,490
I don't need a house, car, or money.

683
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:25,451
All I need is you.

684
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:26,452
Hypocrite.

685
00:56:28,621 --> 00:56:29,788
I mean it.

686
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:31,707
You're my everything.

687
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:36,337
It's really hard to make money, you know.

688
00:56:41,592 --> 00:56:44,011
I need 32,890,000 won.

689
00:56:44,637 --> 00:56:46,847
I need three thousand and...

But still, his own son gets treated here.

696
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,109
How could he do that as his dad?

697
00:57:09,734 --> 00:57:12,237
He cares more about his job

Oh, my goodness.

705
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,160
I can hear your heart beating.

Hey!

00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,844

713
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,986
No, I'm just looking.

714
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:39,366
One of my friends
rents out camping cars for a living.

715
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,285
We should rent one
and go on a trip together.

716
00:58:49,501 --> 00:58:51,503
Let's go when we get the same off day.

717
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:56,174
Then I'll check next month's schedule
and...

718
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:58,426
Hey.

719
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:00,053
What? He escaped?

720
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:02,597
When?

721
00:59:03,932 --> 00:59:04,766
Next.

722
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:08,269
He suddenly peed his pants
during consultation.

723
00:59:08,353 --> 00:59:09,688
So I went to get a new gown and...

724
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,565
-Where did he go?
-<i>Well...</i>

725
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:14,651
Hey, wait.

726
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:16,611
Isn't that Ms. Ko Mun-yeong's car?

727
00:59:16,694 --> 00:59:19,197
-Yes, I think so.
-I think you're right.

728
00:59:46,808 --> 00:59:50,395
Is this what people would call
a "teeny-weeny weenie"?

729
00:59:51,563 --> 00:59:52,564
Because it's tiny?

730
00:59:56,443 --> 01:00:00,113
It's... It's cold. That's why it's...

731
01:00:03,324 --> 01:00:04,701
He must be on his way to work.

732
01:00:04,826 --> 01:00:06,244
Great timing. Get in.

733
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:08,037
What?

734
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,956
-Get in.
-Okay.

735
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:21,718
<i>I'm not intimidated or anything,
but let me wear my underwear.</i>

736
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:23,178
<i>You carry around your underwear?</i>

737
01:00:23,261 --> 01:00:25,138
<i>No, don't think of this as my underwear.</i>

Drive faster! Go!

741
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,046
Ju-ri, stop the car.

742
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:09,224

01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,893
-Stop the car!
-Gang-tae, move! It's dangerous!

01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:14,103
There he is.

749
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:29,035
There's... There's someone there.

750
01:01:31,412 --> 01:01:32,872
Hey, stop.

01:01:41,381 --> 01:01:42,382
Wait!

752
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,866

<i>You're different from patients.</i>

756
01:02:24,966 --> 01:02:26,884
It's just best to avoid people like you.

757
01:02:41,816 --> 01:02:44,694
It's a urinating disorder. It's common
among people who suffer from manic--

758
01:02:44,777 --> 01:02:45,820
Shut your mouth.

759
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,617
That crazy bitch.

760
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:52,410
Get out of the car.

761
01:02:55,788 --> 01:02:56,956
You're not running away.

762
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,376
You're not avoiding me either.
I'm impressed.

763
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:03,880
-Get out of the car.
-He wants you out of the car.

764
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:06,716
No! I don't want to go!
I want to go and have fun!

765
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,093
Just get in the car.
Let's go have fun together.

766
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:11,095
Get out of the car right now!

767
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:17,018
Why are you always

768
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:18,436
so angry at me?

769
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:19,979
Because...

770
01:03:22,106 --> 01:03:23,399
you make me get angry.

771
01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:26,235
Why not just ignore me?

772
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:27,654
But you know what?

773
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:30,448
You should always be careful

774
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:32,950
not to be off guard.

775
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:39,332
Let me borrow your car!

776
01:03:45,964 --> 01:03:47,090
Be careful!

777
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,821
He keeps following us!

<i>Drive faster! He's getting near us!</i>

779

Hey! Hey, dude!

01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,630
Pull over!

781
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:29,382
Pull over right now!

782
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,175
I don't want to.

788
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:01,664
Don't vote for candidate number one,
Kwon Man-su!

789
01:05:01,956 --> 01:05:05,001
He's a complete hypocrite,
and he discriminates people!

790
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:08,504
I know him best
because I'm his youngest son!

791

Get out of the way! Move!

799
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,473
Oh my gosh!

800
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,313
That's a lot of chili peppers.

801
01:06:13,694 --> 01:06:14,821
Oh, my goodness!

01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:49,021

-Yes, it's all thanks to you.

808
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,360
Here.

809
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,945
My goodness, you're so kind.

810
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:07,790
Hey, Teeny-weeny.

811
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,085
Let's have fun here.

812
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,553
-I'm Kwon Man-su.
-Thank you.

01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,054

817
01:07:27,852 --> 01:07:29,186
-Thank you in advance.
-Thank you.

818
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,354
-No problem.
-Thank you.

819
01:07:30,438 --> 01:07:31,564
-Enjoy.
-Goodbye.

820
01:07:32,106 --> 01:07:33,316
Hello, everyone!

821
01:07:34,442 --> 01:07:35,943
I'm Kwon Man-su's youngest son!

822
01:07:36,027 --> 01:07:37,361
My name is Kwon Gi-do!

823
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,196
What... What the hell is he doing there?

824
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,032
As you can see, I'm mentally ill!

825
01:07:41,115 --> 01:07:42,575
What is that punk doing there?

826
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,662
Yes, that's right.
I'm the ugly duckling of the family.

827
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:49,957
-Sir.
-My goodness.

828
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:52,043
-My goodness.
-I'm the embarrassment of our family!

829
01:07:54,378 --> 01:07:55,463
Hello?

830
01:07:55,546 --> 01:07:57,298
I'm calling from the park
in Seongjin City.

831
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:08,267
You see, everyone in my family

832
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:12,271
including my parents, siblings,
and my cousins

833
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:15,441
went to Seoul National University
School of Law.

834
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:19,278
I was the only stupid one in my family.

835
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,617
But that's not my fault.

836
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:27,703
I was...

837
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:32,208
I was just born a little dumb.

838
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,382
But he hit me
because I didn't get good grades.

839
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,552
He looked down on me
because I couldn't understand properly.

840
01:08:44,011 --> 01:08:45,638
He locked me up for causing trouble.

841
01:08:54,772 --> 01:08:56,899
I mean, I'm also his child.

842
01:09:00,361 --> 01:09:01,946
But he treated me like I was invisible.

843
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:03,239
I just...

844
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:12,248
I just wanted his attention, you see.

845
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:17,962
I just wanted him to look at me.

846
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,674
So I did tons of crazy stuff
to get his attention.

847
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:27,680
I just ended up going crazy!

848
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:51,412
<i>Look at me, look at me</i>

849
01:09:51,495 --> 01:09:54,749
<i>Look at me</i>

850
01:09:54,832 --> 01:09:58,252
<i>Take a look at number one
Kwon Man-su's son</i>

851
01:09:58,377 --> 01:10:00,921
<i>Kwon Gi-do</i>

852
01:10:52,473 --> 01:10:54,642
He's having so much fun.

853
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:00,439
Don't you agree?

854
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:04,777
Should I just

855
01:11:06,946 --> 01:11:08,114
have fun with you?

856
01:11:17,123 --> 01:11:18,165
Should I do that?

857
01:11:29,844 --> 01:11:31,804
<i>Look at me</i>

858
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,932
<i>Look at me</i>

859
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:38,352
<i>Take a look at number one
Kwon Man-su's son</i>

860
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:25,274
Have you heard of the place called
Morning Sun?

861
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:29,570
It's a club where you can party
until the sun comes up. Hence the name.

862
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:32,198
You know, I heard it's the hottest club
at the moment,

863
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,158
so I went there.

864
01:12:34,241 --> 01:12:35,951
<font color="#ffff80">DO NOT DISTURB</font>

865
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:42,833
The pretty girls and the good music

866
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:45,044
totally lifted my spirits,

867
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,171
so I thought I should do something nice.

868
01:12:47,254 --> 01:12:49,131
Everything's on me, all night!

869
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:51,592
-Eat up! Drink all you want!
-Nice!

870
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,013
You're the best!

871
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,934
I love spending money on others.

872
01:13:00,017 --> 01:13:03,187
Anyway, I think the bill came
to about 20 million won that night.

873
01:13:07,608 --> 01:13:09,109
This credit card
has been reported missing.

874
01:13:09,193 --> 01:13:10,528
What?

875
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,863
My dad totally blindsided me.

876
01:13:12,947 --> 01:13:15,991
I had no choice but to run like fuck.

877
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:19,245
You're too kind.

878
01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:22,122
Don't take your eyes off him.

879
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,335
I just ran into the road
because I had to lose them.

880
01:13:26,544 --> 01:13:29,004
Then I got freaking hot
because I had been running for a while.

881
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:31,715
And that's why I took off all my clothes!

882
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:51,694
And I ended up

883
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:57,866
here again.
