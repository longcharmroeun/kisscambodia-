00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:12,670
Ko Mun-yeong.

4
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:16,716
Let me go.

5
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,427
Please. Let's talk..

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,678
It had three pairs of wings.

7
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:24,557
That mutant butterfly

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,143
is one of a kind.

9
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,649
It's the butterfly brooch
that my mom designed.

10
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:36,486
But what's that butterfly doing

11
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,865
in Sang-tae's mural?

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,410
No.

13
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:47,496
It's not what you think.

14
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:52,793
You should've said that
when I first asked.

15
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:56,756
I'm not running away.

16
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:01,219
So stop following me.

17
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:03,596
I need some time to think on my own.

18
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,724
Let's talk later.

19
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:46,264
Mr. Lee.

20
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:50,768
Can you check up on Mun-yeong?

21
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:55,898
I'll tell you the details in person.

22
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,235
Please do me a favor.

23
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,126
Hello?

24
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:21,424
Over here.

25
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:25,136
He went underneath the sink
and won't come out.

26
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:26,679
What's wrong with him?

27
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,145
What... What is that mommy

28
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:36,314
and baby butterfly doing there?

29
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:38,899
What... What are they doing in my mural?

30
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:40,818
Someone drew them.

31
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,903
No, that's not good.

32
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:43,821
Sang-tae.

33
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,991
Come on out.

34
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:50,578
The... The butterfly that killed my mom
came after me.

35
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:53,247
It... It came after me.

36
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,374
It came all the way here. Oh, no.

37
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:01,672
It's not a mommy

38
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,592
and baby butterfly.

39
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,179
It's a mutated butterfly
that has three pairs of wings.

40
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,765
"A... A mutated butterfly"?

41
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,020
So it's not the butterfly I saw?

42
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:16,937
No.

43
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:21,025
They're mutant butterflies,
but they're actually quite common.

44
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,279
I also saw a few in the garden.

45
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,282
I... I never saw one.

46
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,370
That's probably because
you're scared of butterflies.

47
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:35,373
Someone must've added it to your mural

48
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,209
because it's very interesting and unique.

49
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,629
Why... Why would someone do that
to my mural?

50
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,089
That's so rude.

51
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,424
I know, right?

52
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:49,887
I'll catch that person
and teach that person a lesson.

53
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:54,809
Now, come on out.

54
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,153
It's a different butterfly?

55
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:08,322
Sang-tae.

56
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:10,991
You promised me

57
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:13,577
that you won't run away

58
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,247
even if the butterfly appears.

59
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,791
Yes, I promised.

60
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:21,460
A promise isn't something you
can take so lightly,

61
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:22,920
so I won't run away.

62
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,426
But... But every time I see a butterfly,
I get a headache.

63
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:33,431
If you help me out a little,
I'll be able to overcome it.

64
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:36,559
Okay, I will.

65
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,185
You're amazing, Sang-tae.

66
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:41,522
Sang-tae.

67
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,192
Because of you,
your brother can't go to work,

68
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:47,278
and I can't cook lunch.

69
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,946
You're bothering everyone.

70
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,198
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.

71
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,743
Can you take care of my brother today?

72
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,788
An apology won't cut it.

73
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:01,000
I want you to stay here
and be my assistant for the day.

74
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:01,917
Here.

75
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,798
Will... Will you pay me?

76
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:09,341
That depends on how hard you work.

77
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,510
It... It depends again?

78
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:15,222
I... I need to put down my bag
before I wear this.

79
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:17,766
-Oh, dear. Take it off.
-Oh, dear.

80
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:18,809
Oh, dear.

81
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,235
-Should we erase it?
-Yes.

82
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,570
What are you all doing there?

83
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:36,660
Apparently, Sang-tae wasn't the one
who painted this.

84
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:40,414
He kept shouting, saying he wants it gone,
so we're thinking of erasing it for him.

85
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,917
Yes, you should do that for him.

86
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,720
CHAPTER 14
THE HAND, THE MONKFISH

87
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:57,306
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

88
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:02,561
I saw the butterfly, too.

89
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:06,607
Someone must've done it as a joke
while I was gone on a business trip.

90
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:08,727
Let's check who it was.

91
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,404
What? What's Ms. Park doing there?

92
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,828
<i>You should check out her books
when you have some time.</i>

93
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,122
No, I wouldn't be able
to relate to those stories.

94
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,666
I like cruel and foolish love stories
or horror novels.

95
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,251
Does he like the Mom? Dooly's mom.

96
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:08,919
<i>I gave it to Sang-tae as a gift.</i>

97
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,797
Sang-tae and I have gotten quite close.

98
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,757
Did the three of you go on a trip
in a camping car?

99
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:15,843
My daughter...

100
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:21,015
<i>I have to say,
with all the stuff she's been through,</i>

101
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:23,767
Ms. Ko grew up pretty well.

102
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,326
Where did it go? I'm sure it was here.

103
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,619
Where did it go?

104
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,793
I'm sure it was here.

105
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,255
It was here.

106
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:56,842
<i>Die.</i>

107
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:01,305
Die, you... You monster.

108
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:02,222
<i>You will</i>

109
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,893
end up like your mother.

110
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,396
<i>My mom</i>

111
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,149
was murdered.

112
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,317
That butterfly...

113
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,904
That butterfly killed my mom.

114
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,448
That butterfly killed my mom.

115
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,663
I love you, my daughter.

116
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:29,500
<i>You are my other self.</i>

117
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,942
I'm so sorry.

118
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:59,738
I can't even look at you right now.
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,658
She was right in front of me,

120
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,078
but I had no idea.

121
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,833
I let that woman look after Sang-tae

122
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:16,630
and even thanked her for it.

123
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,343
It's all my fault. Don't blame yourself.

124
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:25,055
Now that we know who Do Hui-jae is,

125
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:27,307
we should focus on finding her
as soon as possible.

126
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,519
I'll ask the police
to start investigating.

127
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,855
You don't need to come to work
for a while.

128
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,857
Just stay with your brother and Ms. Ko.

129
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:42,448
But I wonder why she stayed
in the hospital for such a long time

130
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,203
when there are surveillance cameras
everywhere.

131
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,734
I had such a fun time.

132
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:23,697
Mr. Ko.

133
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:30,037
I...

134
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,040
no longer have

135
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,293
any regrets in life.

136
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,883
You have no regrets?

137
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,103
You told me you loved me.

138
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,150
How can you say that
when you told me you loved me?

139
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,736
You killed the woman you loved.

140
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:08,575
So you have no right
to die in peace, honey.

141
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,164
Don't you have anything to say to me?

142
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:18,669
It's been 20 years.

143
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,589
I've waited for 20 years.

144
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,053
What a pity.

145
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,065
Do you know

146
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,528
why I let you live?

147
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:51,118
Watching you live your life in pain
for such a long time

148
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:56,206
and seeing you die so miserably...

149
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:03,672
felt so exhilarating.

150
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,354
I had such a hard time, you know.

151
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,317
There are surveillance cameras everywhere.

152
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,820
And O Ji-wang, that cunning man,
is very quick-witted.

153
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,530
So I have to say,

154
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,700
it was very thrilling.

155
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,037
No.

156
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,248
No...

157
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,544
Don't do anything

158
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:45,672
to Mun-yeong.

159
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:49,593
You mean our beautiful daughter?

160
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:51,762
She grew up so well, didn't she?

161
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:54,890
You have no idea

162
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:59,353
how hard I tried to take care of her
all those days.

163
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,747
You said you want to die.

164
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,717
Well, let me help you.

165
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:43,814
Let go, you bastard! I'll kill you all!

166
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:44,982
Let go!

167
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,165
You should prove

168
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,835
that you're not a coward.

169
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,514
I put in so much effort
to make sure she became perfect.

170
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,018
But I really don't like

171
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:24,646
how she behaves these days.

172
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:32,571
Do you know what you need to do
to make children obey their parents?

173
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,201
They become extremely obedient

174
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,457
when you take away
what makes them the most happy.

175
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,837
No... Please...

176
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:05,645
Goodbye.

177
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,279
No...

178
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,033
No...

179
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:22,829
Mun-yeong...

180
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:36,384
Mun-yeong.

181
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,512
Mun-yeong.

182
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,435
Mun-yeong.

183
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:48,188
Mun-yeong.

184
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:54,277
Mun-yeong.

185
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,404
-What do you want?
-What?

186
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,408
I was just wondering if you're doing okay.

187
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:02,077
I'm never okay.

188
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,830
You came running here to ask me that?

189
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,625
No, not exactly.

190
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:11,378
I wanted to know
how you're doing with your new book,

191
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:12,879
so I dropped by to check.

192
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,840
I sent you the manuscript
via email this morning.

193
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:17,217
Oh, really?

194
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,012
I can't believe you're already done
with the draft. You're amazing.

195
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:24,724
You really do get things done quickly
once you start concentrating.

196
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:27,018
What do you think? Is it fun?

197
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:28,270
Is it a masterpiece?

198
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,444
All my works are a masterpiece.

199
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,281
Yes, right.

200
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,324
You should go.

201
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,411
I stayed up all night to finish it,
so I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.

202
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,330
Okay. You did great.

203
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,791
Get some sleep. I'll be off now.

204
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,058
Hey.

205
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:08,143
Goodness.

206
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,438
No, she's not okay at all.
It looks really bad.

207
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,774
She's never looked at me
with a smile on her face.

208
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,527
I have a bad feeling about this.

209
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:20,071
I'll wait right here.

210
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,115
So come and tell me what happened.

211
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,159
Okay.

212
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,369
I'll be right there.

213
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,457
Gang-tae.

214
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,377
I... I made 30,000 won today
for working part-time.

215
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,046
No, this is my snack.

216
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,715
Here. It's your allowance.
It's 10,000 won.

217
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,259
And here's 10,000 won for Mun-yeong.

218
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:42,385
This is mine.

219
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:46,056
It's okay. You can have it all.

220
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,558
You don't want allowance?

221
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,066
Sang-tae, let me give you a ride.

222
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,653
Can you stay at the rooftop house
for a while?

223
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:03,406
All... All by myself? Why?

224
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,494
Did... Did you guys fight?

225
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,789
You... You fought with Mun-yeong again,
didn't you?

226
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:13,083
Yes.

227
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,586
I made a mistake.

228
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,130
So she's really angry.

229
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:21,675
I need to ask her to forgive me.

230
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,427
I... I told you guys not to fight.

231
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:28,181
Did I or did I not tell you
that it's better to kiss than to fight?

232
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,270
I'll call you after we make up.

233
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:35,272
Let's go.

234
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:40,402
Just... Just say you're sorry.

235
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:42,821
Be... Be polite. You need to be polite.

236
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,282
If you're polite,
you won't get scolded as much.

237
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,491
Okay.

238
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,411
FIRST FLOOR NURSES' STATION

239
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:52,706
I wonder who drew that butterfly
on the wall.

240
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:54,499
Mr. O.

241
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,877
When is Ms. Park coming back
from her vacation?

242
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,630
I hope she never comes back.

243
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,466
She took five days off.

244
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,473
Don't you think she might be burned-out

245
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,143
because of what happened
to Mr. Ko Dae-hwan?

246
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:16,479
I'm not sure.

247
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,191
Gosh, how strange.

248
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,110
FIRST FLOOR LOBBY STAIRWAY

249
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,529
Why can't I find the CCTV footage
of the lobby stairway?

250
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:29,075
I had to send the video file somewhere,
so I moved it to a flash drive.

251
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,453
-Who is it for?
-You don't need to know.

252
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,955
Ms. Nam, can we talk?

253
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:36,291
Okay.

254
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:39,961
File her resignation?

255
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,922
Why? Is Ms. Park sick?

256
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,344
You'll soon find out why.

257
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,804
I know it's going to be hard,

258
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,059
but I'd like you to oversee the nurses

259
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,646
since you've been
working here the longest.

260
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,775
And make sure the patients
don't get stirred up by this.

261
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:03,985
Okay.

262
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:07,030
My goodness.

263
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,282
Thank you.

264
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:12,869
Director O.

265
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:15,872
Yes?

266
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,125
If something's bothering you,

267
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,921
you should drink and talk with my mom
like you did in the past.

268
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,674
Don't just keep it to yourself.

269
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,636
I'll do that as much as I want

270
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,930
once I become jobless soon.

271
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,563
"Jobless"?

272
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,150
Is he planning to retire?

273
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,042
I can't believe this.

274
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,712
How could there be
such an ill-fated relationship?

275
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,093
Do you think we are ill-fated?

276
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:12,345
Then what else would you call this?

277
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,642
Don't tell me you're going to stay
with Mun-yeong

278
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,979
even after you found out what happened.

279
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:22,647
I am.

280
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:25,942
Mun-yeong is...

281
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,028
She's just Ko Mun-yeong to me.

282
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,489
Not Do Hui-jae's daughter.

283
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:46,796
<i>Do Hui-jae</i>

284
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:49,757
was born into a prestigious family
of doctors.

285
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:53,094
But for some reason,

286
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,138
she dropped out of med school
on her third year

287
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:57,182
and picked up a pen instead of a scalpel.

288
00:21:57,765 --> 00:22:00,560
After she got married,
she cut ties with everyone in her family,

289
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,938
stayed in this castle,
and did nothing but write.

290
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:09,235
Goodness.
I've known Mun-yeong for ten years.

291
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:12,655
But this is all I know.

292
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:17,160
She went through
such a terrible childhood,

293
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:20,580
but people from publishing companies
bothered her

294
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,123
day and night.

295
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,213
They wanted publishing rights
for the final book

296
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:30,089
of the series her mother wrote,

297
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,509
<i>The Murder of the Witch of the West</i>.

298
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:34,886
They were like a bunch of pests.

299
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:38,389
What happened to the last book?

300
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,684
As you already know,
it never got published.

301
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:45,730
The final draft just disappeared.

302
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:57,427
Mun-yeong.

303
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,724
Did my mom...

304
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,521
really kill...

305
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,570
your mother?

306
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:21,784
The butterfly that tormented your brother
all his life

307
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,538
and made your life miserable...

308
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:32,003
Was that really my mom?

309
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,189
It's not true, right?

310
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:57,070
I'm mistaken, right?

311
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,783
That can't be true.

312
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:18,257
Since when did you know?

313
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:23,346
I only recently found out.

314
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:47,870
Mun-yeong.

315
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:50,123
Listen carefully.

316
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,251
You're not like your mom.

317
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:58,381
No matter what happens,

318
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,134
I won't leave you.

319
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:05,847
To me,

320
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,143
you're just Ko Mun-yeong, the girl I liked

321
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:12,770
ever since I was a boy.

322
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:24,282
Hypocrite.

323
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:42,725
Gosh, this sly fox
is ignoring my calls again.

324
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,603
Jae-su, have some instant noodles.

325
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:48,731
Sang-tae.

326
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:52,193
Are you sure Gang-tae sent you here

327
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:55,196
because Ko Mun-yeong is pissed at him?

328
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,949
I mean, that sounds like a big fat lie.

329
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:02,578
The soft-boiled egg is for you,
the hard-boiled egg is for me.

330
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:12,088
I feel like they sent you here

331
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:16,300
so they could spend time
doing intimate and romantic stuff

332
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:19,929
while you're gone.

333
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:22,306
Jae-su.

334
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,225
Right? Do you agree?

335
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,104
She looked sad. It was a sad expression.

336
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:29,980
What?

337
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:33,859
Mun-yeong's face...

338
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:38,531
<i>The expression on her face...</i>

339
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:41,867
She was scared.

340
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:44,662
She was sad.

341
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:48,416
Why?

342
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,460
Why did she look that way?

343
00:28:57,508 --> 00:28:58,801
What brings you here?

344
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:03,264
Ju-ri asked me to check up on you.

345
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:06,100
She told me you seem to be
going through something.

346
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:07,351
My goodness.

347
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:12,356
She must've learned a few things
while working at the psychiatric hospital.

348
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:16,360
What is it?
Are you really going to retire?

349
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:20,114
A part of me wants to, and a part of me
feels like I'll be asked to.

350
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:25,369
I can't seem to do anything
after having been betrayed

351
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:28,956
by someone I really trusted.

352
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,918
You say you can't do anything,
but you look like you're doing fine.

353
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:34,753
What happened?

354
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:40,593
I put on airs,
thinking that I knew everything.

355
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,053
I kept Ms. Ko and Sang-tae here,

356
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,182
thinking that this place

357
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,934
will help them heal and get better.

358
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,811
But it only ended up hurting them.

359
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:52,938
What should I do, Sun-deok?

360
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:55,191
I feel so bad for them.

361
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,404
Gosh, I thought I should know better
at this age.

362
00:30:03,324 --> 00:30:06,202
Adults can't always be right.

363
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:10,289
We make mistakes until the day we die.

364
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,959
You can't always save people
just because you're a doctor.

365
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:15,252
You're not Jesus Christ.

366
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:21,300
"It's okay to not be okay."

367
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,260
It says it right there.

368
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:26,722
Sun-deok.

369
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,643
Do you want to be the next director?

370
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,189
My goodness. Next director, my ass.

371
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,247
-I'm home.
-Hey, welcome home.

372
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:55,542
Let's have rice balls for dinner tonight.

373
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:58,003
That sounds great.

374
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:01,423
But are you making rice balls
for volunteer work or something?

375
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:02,383
Why are there so many?

376
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:05,678
Once we're done,
we just need to put them in the freezer.

377
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:07,805
And whenever you get hungry,
just microwave them.

378
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:10,182
It's the best
when you can't be bothered to cook.

379
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:14,478
I need to deliver these
to Ms. Ko's place tomorrow.

380
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:18,357
What? Why... Why would you go there?

381
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,402
I heard Sang-tae will be
staying at the rooftop house for a while.

382
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,029
That obviously means

383
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:28,450
something is going on
between Gang-tae and Mun-yeong.

384
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,329
And I'm pretty sure
they'll skip their meals.

385
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:35,124
I don't know what's going on,

386
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:36,667
but when you're having a hard time,

387
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,004
food is what gets you going,
not your mentality.

388
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:45,592
Ma'am...

389
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:51,807
I... I respect you so much.
I really love you.

390
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:53,475
What's wrong with him?

391
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:56,812
Either eat your food, cry,

392
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:59,815
or tell her that you like her.
Just do one.

393
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:06,071
It's delicious.

394
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:09,283
Here.

395
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,590
Can we talk when you're done eating?

396
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:28,344
Sure, of course.

397
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:37,978
Can I come in?

398
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:38,937
Yes.

399
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,360
Take a seat.

400
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:45,694
Oh, okay.

401
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:49,490
My gosh, I'm getting all nervous
for some reason.

402
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:52,326
Yes, please sit down.

403
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:54,411
What did you want to talk about?

404
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:58,707
Well, do you think it'll be okay?

405
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,251
Pardon? What do you mean?

406
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:02,836
Well,

407
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,548
it was weird to just leave
the hospital like that this morning.

408
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:08,801
I keep calling, but there's no answer.

409
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:11,845
I'm just really worried.

410
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:13,680
Do you know what's going on?

411
00:33:13,764 --> 00:33:17,851
Well, I don't think you need
to be worried.

412
00:33:18,644 --> 00:33:20,062
How could I not worry?

413
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,021
Ju-ri.

414
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:24,066
Enough already.

415
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,902
-Sorry?
-How much longer

416
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,071
will you go on about Moon Gang-tae?

417
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:30,864
I mean, I get it.

418
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,826
Whenever I think about him,
even I can't help but worry,

419
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:35,869
and my heart aches for him.

420
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:36,787
No.

421
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:38,747
I'm talking about Mun-yeong.

422
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:44,712
I can't stop worrying about her.

423
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,342
I really like you.

424
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,514
Right. To be honest, I also

425
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,974
like...

426
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,435
Mun-yeong.

427
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:06,859
My gosh, how lovely.

428
00:34:08,277 --> 00:34:09,736
The friendship between you two is...

429
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:14,199
Oh, gosh. What I ate earlier is giving me
an upset stomach.

430
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:16,618
Please excuse me.

431
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:18,412
Get some rest.

432
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:36,096
<i>Hey, is everything okay?</i>

433
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,308
<i>Call me if you're bored.</i>

434
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:55,574
JU-RI

435
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:06,960
I was devastated

436
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:09,546
just like you are now.

437
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:16,970
I kept denying it
because I just didn't want to believe it.

438
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:20,724
"Why is it

439
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,604
that things like this only happen to me?"

440
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,109
I deeply resented it.

441
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:37,991
But none of that matters.

442
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:41,286
When I see you

443
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:46,750
smile at me,

444
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,214
I forget everything else.

445
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:56,426
The butterfly

446
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,264
and even my mom.

447
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:03,308
I forget everything else

448
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:08,856
except for the two of us.

449
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:13,986
You see, Mun-yeong...

450
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:17,531
You didn't do anything wrong.

451
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:21,243
That goes for all of us.

452
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:28,500
We did nothing wrong.

453
00:36:59,156 --> 00:37:02,701
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

454
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:15,547
Do you want to grab a drink with me?
It's been a while.

455
00:37:16,256 --> 00:37:18,175
No, I don't want to drink
with an old fart.

456
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,595
Must you talk so rudely to your father?

457
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,182
What's going on? What's gotten into you?

458
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:28,560
Hey, you never spend time with me.

459
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,856
Since when did you care about me?

460
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,566
When I pestered you to hang out with me,

461
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,234
you always spent time with your patients.

462
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:39,738
I tend to neglect those
who are close to me, you know.

463
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:42,658
Cut me some slack.

464
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:51,416
What do you want? Soju or beer?

465
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:56,213
<i>Makgeolli.</i>

466
00:37:57,714 --> 00:37:58,799
Sure, whatever.

468
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:10,602
I'm sorry.

469
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:25,534
<i>I have something</i>

470
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:32,791
<i>To say to you</i>

471
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:39,673

00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:13,874
<i>My heart full of love</i>

477
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:21,006
<i>If it is for you</i>

00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:26,720
<i>There is nothing I cannot do</i>

479
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:34,478
<i>I will present to you the stars</i>

480
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:40,776
<i>So that you can hold them in your hands</i>

481
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:47,824
<i>I have something</i>

482
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:54,706
<i>To give you</i>

<i>To give you tonight</i>

485
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,168
Jeez, Jae-su is killing me.

486
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:42,879
He's been snoring nonstop. So loud!

487
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:44,798
Gosh.

488
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,304
What?

489
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,975
No calls?

490
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:00,730
Have they not made up yet?

491
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:05,652
They'd better make up soon
so that I can go home.

492
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:19,916

Gosh, should I just stop by her place?

495
00:41:31,344 --> 00:41:33,722
Ju-ri, I'm going to order some coffee.

496
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:36,224
-Do you want some coffee too?
-I want an iced Americano coffee.

497
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:37,893
Oh, I'll get a latte.

498
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:44,774
An iced Americano coffee and a latte.

499
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:46,568
Done.

500
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:52,782
I haven't seen Mr. Moon since yesterday.

501
00:41:53,366 --> 00:41:55,035
He took some time off.

502
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:55,952
What?

503
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,245
Out of the blue?

504
00:41:58,121 --> 00:42:00,206
-Really?
-Why do you ask?

505
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:07,047
Because of what happened a while ago,

506
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:10,175
I wanted to treat him to a nice meal
or something.

507
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:12,427
You can do that when he's back.

508
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:19,809
By the way, did anyone call for me?

509
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,978
Who?

510
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:24,773
Your father?

511
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:26,358
Yes.

512
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,819
What would you like us to do if he calls?

513
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:34,532
Well...

514
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:37,244
I'll talk to him.

515
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:39,037
-Okay, got it.
-Thanks.

516
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,164
Have a good day.

517
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,125
Gosh.

518
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:48,797
I hope she's not thinking
of donating her liver to him.

519
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:51,091
Who knows?

520
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,304
By the way, why did Mr. Moon
suddenly ask for time off?

521
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,026
Ko Mun-yeong.

522
00:43:12,904 --> 00:43:14,072
Let me in.

523
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,350
Some strange things

524
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:46,104
have happened around your father.

525
00:43:46,604 --> 00:43:48,023
That's how I found out about it.

526
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,276
The fact that your mother

527
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:53,528
is alive.

528
00:43:55,822 --> 00:43:56,906
Park Ok-ran.

529
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,285
Is that patient my mom?

530
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,079
Is that why

531
00:44:04,164 --> 00:44:05,957
you came to me that night?

532
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,834
No.

533
00:44:11,504 --> 00:44:12,380
It's

534
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:16,009
the head nurse from the hospital.

535
00:44:17,135 --> 00:44:17,969
What?

536
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:20,889
Park Haeng-ja.

537
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:24,059
Yesterday,

538
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:28,271
she drew the butterfly on Sang-tae's mural

539
00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:30,857
and disappeared.

540
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:32,817
That can't be.

541
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:35,403
That woman is my mom?

542
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:38,031
I know that almost two decades
have passed,

543
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:40,909
but even if she'd had plastic surgery
all over her face,

544
00:44:42,952 --> 00:44:44,829
I would've recognized her.

545
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:51,002
Both your father

546
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:53,838
and Director O

547
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:57,842
have known her for so long

548
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:02,138
but had no idea.

549
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:07,852
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

550
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:11,940
The director would like to speak
with the patient's guardian.

551
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:17,153
No way.

552
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,450
The butterfly brooch in the basement
is gone too.

553
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:24,786
I'm sure it was there.

554
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:27,372
That means Mom was here.

555
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:29,874
She's been watching Dad

556
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,085
as well as us, right by our side.

557
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:33,878
She's been watching everything.

558
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:36,714
Leave! Get out of this house immediately.

559
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:38,007
Get out! Now!

560
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:39,300
Ko Mun-yeong.

561
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:43,972
I will never leave you
when you're here all alone.

562
00:45:44,514 --> 00:45:45,932
I promised I'd protect you.

563
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:47,517
No, you can't protect me.

564
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,811
So go protect your brother. Please!

565
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:52,063
Leave! Please!

566
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:53,648
Get out!

567
00:45:57,735 --> 00:45:59,529
Please run...

568
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,908
How is this possible...

569
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,786
Please, I beg you.

570
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:09,205
Please.

571
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:41,863
Hey, it's... It's me, your brother.

572
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,867
Is... Is Mun-yeong okay?

573
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:50,288
Is she still really mad at you?

574
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,083
You guys haven't made up yet?

575
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:02,383
Mun-yeong

576
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:05,637
is not feeling well.

577
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:07,764
She's not feeling well?

578
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:10,600
What's wrong with her?
Is she feeling sick?

579
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:15,146
When you're in physical pain, you cry.

580
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,483
But if your heart is aching,
you whimper like a dog when you sleep.

581
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:23,404
Is... Is she whimpering like that?

582
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:25,323
Yes.

583
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:28,785
I hear those whimpers.

584
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:31,621
Oh, no. What do we do?

585
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:36,501
She's not been let off the leash?

586
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:42,298
You can...
You can just cut it off for her.

587
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:45,551
-Sang-tae.
<i>-Yes?</i>

588
00:47:47,595 --> 00:47:48,596
Sang-tae.

589
00:47:50,056 --> 00:47:50,890
Hey.

590
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:53,726
Are you... Are you crying?

591
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,314
No.

592
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:01,025
I'm okay.

593
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:04,404
She'll be fine,

594
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:07,031
so don't worry.

595
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:31,855
I'll deliver...

596
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:34,691
I'll... I'll go.

597
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:36,902
Would you?

598
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:39,863
But you said you can't go there
until Gang-tae calls you.

599
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:41,532
That's right. You don't have to come.

600
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:43,867
I'll go with Seung-jae.
We'll be back in no time.

601
00:48:44,993 --> 00:48:46,078
I have work to do.

602
00:48:46,161 --> 00:48:49,164
No, I... I have to go there.

603
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:52,584
Ms. Kang,
do you know how to make porridge?

604
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:54,294
The kind that people eat when they're ill?

605
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:55,921
Porridge? Why?

606
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:58,382
-Enjoy your coffee.
-Thank you.

607
00:48:58,465 --> 00:48:59,883
Thank you.

608
00:49:00,259 --> 00:49:01,260
Thanks for the coffee.

609
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:07,141
How come I haven't seen Mr. Moon
for the last couple of days?

610
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:09,393
-He took some time off.
-I see.

611
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:12,187
I wanted to brag about these to him.

612
00:49:14,439 --> 00:49:17,818
My gosh, Ms. Lee A-reum is so pretty.

613
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:19,903
Is she doing well in the US?

614
00:49:20,487 --> 00:49:23,115
I want to be discharged soon
so that I can go see her.

615
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:26,577
Oh, please let me know
when Mr. Moon is back.

616
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:35,919
Mr. Moon is so popular
among all the patients.

617
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:39,840
Right? Ju-ri also had
the biggest crush on him, you know.

618
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:42,509
Excuse me. We're from
the police department.

619
00:49:43,218 --> 00:49:44,636
We're here to speak with Director O.

620
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:47,848
Come with me. This way, please.

621
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:52,895
What's going on?
What are the police doing here?

622
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:56,273
Are they here because of Ms. Park Ok-ran?

623
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:07,534
Sang-tae. Slow down.

624
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:08,869
Wait up. Be careful!

625
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:10,871
Jeez.

626
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:13,624
Sang-tae!

627
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:22,341
Why did you bring Sang-tae?
He'll get all worried.

628
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,093
I always act like I believe your lies,

629
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:29,348
but not this time.
I can't let you get away with this.

630
00:50:31,058 --> 00:50:32,226
What do you mean?

631
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:35,062
Just put it away. Let's get out of here.

632
00:50:35,562 --> 00:50:37,314
I feel smothered here.

633
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:51,912
Mun-yeong, are you feeling sick?

634
00:50:54,748 --> 00:50:56,208
Aren't you hungry at all?

635
00:50:57,042 --> 00:51:00,087
I... I brought you some porridge.

636
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,506
This isn't store-bought.

637
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:04,758
Ms. Kang made this veggie porridge.

638
00:51:06,301 --> 00:51:07,302
Leave.

639
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:10,013
You should leave, Sang-tae.

640
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:14,226
You need to have some porridge
to get well soon.

641
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:17,271
You like quail eggs, Mun-yeong.

642
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:20,440
I'll feed you, okay?

643
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,318
You're not feeling well today,

644
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:26,780
so it's okay to be fed like a little baby.

645
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:30,492
Sang-tae.

646
00:51:31,618 --> 00:51:32,619
Yes?

647
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:35,122
I'm sorry.

648
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,874
It's my fault.

649
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:40,294
Forgive me.

650
00:51:43,964 --> 00:51:44,840
Forgive you?

651
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:49,970
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

652
00:51:51,638 --> 00:51:56,268
If you want to apologize for something,
you have to look at the person and say it.

653
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:59,479
It's rude to just say sorry
without even looking at the person.

654
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:26,048
Here, have some.

655
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:37,684
Forgive me.

656
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:42,731
Okay. I'll forgive you if you eat this.
Here.

657
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,199
My arm is getting tired, Mun-yeong.
Come on. Have some.

658
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:59,664
Yes! Good girl.

659
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:02,000
Look at you. You seem to like it.

660
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:04,461
My gosh, you're such a good girl.

661
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:08,757
How about just three more spoons?
Just three more, okay?

662
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:13,220
When you're feeling sick,
it's very important to chew well

663
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:14,763
to make sure you can digest it.

664
00:53:14,846 --> 00:53:16,765
Mun-yeong, you're such a good girl.

665
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:20,394
Here. Good job.

666
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:26,441
Don't fight with Gang-tae.

667
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:29,277
You two should just make up.

668
00:53:31,863 --> 00:53:34,199
A kiss is better than a fight.

669
00:53:34,282 --> 00:53:35,242
Okay?

670
00:53:45,043 --> 00:53:47,045
Don't cry.

671
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,090
I guess you're feeling very ill,
Mun-yeong.

672
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:53,635
You must've been feeling really ill.

673
00:53:54,302 --> 00:53:55,262
I'll give you some more.

674
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:58,348
I'm sorry, Sang-tae.

675
00:53:58,432 --> 00:53:59,891
All right. You ate this,

676
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:01,643
so I will forgive you.

677
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:04,521
Just two... Two more spoons.

678
00:54:04,604 --> 00:54:06,314
Good girl.

679
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:19,411
So that butterfly

680
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:22,414
was drawn on Sang-tae's mural.

681
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:24,416
Ko Mun-yeong

682
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:27,002
freaked out and ran away
as soon as she saw that,

683
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,630
and you've been trying to look after her

684
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:33,091
all by yourself,
looking utterly distraught.

685
00:54:42,476 --> 00:54:43,560
Is the butterfly

686
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:50,275
her mother?

687
00:54:57,324 --> 00:54:59,993
That was the conclusion I arrived at
after racking my brain all night.

688
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:02,704
I guess I'm right.

689
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,710
-Don't tell Sang-tae--
-Of course I won't, dude.

690
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:11,213
I'm not that dumb.

691
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:16,593
Thanks.

692
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:20,555
And I'm sorry.

693
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:24,684
Gang-tae.

694
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:26,436
Yes?

695
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:27,979
Just accept it.

696
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:30,649
Then you'll feel much more at ease.

697
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:31,942
Accept what?

698
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:34,528
The fact that you're weak.

699
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:45,455
You're not strong at all.

700
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,332
You're a total weakling.

701
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,210
Both you and that woman, Ko Mun-yeong.

702
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:53,547
It's always those who are weak
that act all tough.

703
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:54,965
I can't stand it.

704
00:55:56,383 --> 00:55:57,884
Since you're so weak,

705
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,097
you can't just walk away from weak people.

706
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,184
You want to lean on them, and vice versa.

707
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:09,062
That's why weaklings are
attracted to each other like magnets.

708
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:12,524
So you'd better stick together.

709
00:56:13,525 --> 00:56:16,903
You weaklings should join forces
and stick together.

710
00:56:19,155 --> 00:56:20,949
Then you guys will become invincible.

711
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:27,122
I'm sure you've heard of the saying,

712
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:30,875
"United we stand,

713
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,920
divided we are dead meat."

714
00:56:37,257 --> 00:56:38,800
President Kim Dae-jung said that.

715
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,059
President Rhee Syng-man.

716
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:49,936
Not President Kim Dae-jung.

717
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:54,316
Oh, is that right?

718
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,318
I guess I was wrong again.

719
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:16,171
She had five spoons of the porridge.
Five spoons.

720
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:18,256
I fed her.

721
00:57:20,216 --> 00:57:21,217
Thank you.

722
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:23,553
You're the best, Sang-tae.

723
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:27,265
By the way,
did Mun-yeong do something very bad?

724
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:28,683
What?

725
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:31,519
She kept saying sorry.

726
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:35,315
She kept crying, asking me to forgive her.

727
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:39,361
I said to her that
I'd forgive her if she ate the porridge,

728
00:57:39,444 --> 00:57:40,445
and she did.

729
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:43,281
So I forgave her.

730
00:57:48,995 --> 00:57:50,121
Really?

731
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:52,040
Yes, I gave her my forgiveness.

732
00:57:52,624 --> 00:57:53,667
You did?

733
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:01,758
By the way,

734
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:04,761
are you feeling sick too?

735
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,934
Sang-tae.

736
00:58:14,813 --> 00:58:16,314
Give me a hug.

737
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:20,527
Come here.

738
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,284
And...

739
00:58:30,078 --> 00:58:31,454
pat me on the back.

740
00:58:32,914 --> 00:58:33,998
Okay.

741
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:39,921
Sang-tae.

742
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,464
Yes?

743
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,968
I'm scared.

744
00:58:45,176 --> 00:58:47,887
What? You're scared?

745
00:58:47,971 --> 00:58:51,349
That's because you're the younger one.
The little brother.

746
00:58:55,562 --> 00:58:57,272
Will you protect us?

747
00:58:57,355 --> 00:59:01,443
I'm older than you guys,
so I'll protect you both.

748
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:03,862
I'm your guardian.

749
00:59:08,074 --> 00:59:09,159
I'm relieved.

750
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:14,622
Thank goodness
I have a big brother like you.

751
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:34,225
You'd better not ignore my calls.
I'll be really mad.

752
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:35,226
Okay, I won't.

753
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,395
Call me when Mun-yeong is feeling better.

754
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:38,938
She needs to check my homework.

755
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:40,356
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

756
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,900
-Bye.
-Get back safely.

757
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:42,984
All right.

758
01:00:27,112 --> 01:00:30,490
<i>THE HAND, THE MONKFISH</i>

759
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:42,585
<i>"Once upon a time,</i>

760
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:44,587
<i>a beautiful baby girl</i>

761
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:47,966
<i>was born into a wealthy family.</i>

762
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:53,471
<i>She was as beautiful
and flawless as magnolias.</i>

763
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:55,849
<i>Her mother loved her so much</i>

764
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:59,227
<i>that she pledged she'd do anything
for her baby.</i>

765
01:01:00,228 --> 01:01:03,815
<i>She said she would even present to her
the sun and the moon.</i>

766
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:09,612
<i>When the baby started eating solid foods,</i>

767
01:01:10,822 --> 01:01:13,116
<i>her mother was thrilled.</i>

768
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:16,244
<i>'My sweet child.</i>

769
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,123
<i>I will feed you
everything you want to eat.</i>

770
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,750
<i>Open your mouth wide.</i>

771
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:26,379
Like this.'

772
01:01:30,842 --> 01:01:32,927
<i>When the baby started walking,</i>

773
01:01:33,553 --> 01:01:35,763
<i>her mother ran hurriedly to where she was.</i>

774
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:38,600
<i>'My sweet child.</i>

775
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:41,311
<i>I will carry you.</i>

776
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:45,023
<i>Come on. Hop on my back.'</i>

777
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:49,903
After raising the baby
by always providing her

778
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,865
with everything she needed,
the mother said this.

779
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,202
<i>'My beloved child.</i>

780
01:01:59,746 --> 01:02:02,165
<i>I need some rest now.</i>

781
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:05,084
<i>Can you</i>

782
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:08,421
<i>get me some food?'</i>

783
01:02:10,757 --> 01:02:12,926
<i>Then the child spoke.</i>

784
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:18,598
<i>'Mom, I have no hands.</i>

785
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:22,393
<i>I never used them,</i>

786
01:02:23,228 --> 01:02:24,896
<i>so they've vanished.'</i>

787
01:02:27,899 --> 01:02:29,734
<i>'Then my sweet child,</i>

788
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:32,987
<i>can you carry me on your back?</i>

789
01:02:34,864 --> 01:02:36,449
<i>My legs hurt.'</i>

790
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:40,161
<i>Then the child said this.</i>

791
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:46,793
<i>'Mom, I have no feet.</i>

792
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:50,505
<i>You always carried me on your back,</i>

793
01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:54,175
<i>so I've never even stepped on the ground.</i>

794
01:02:55,927 --> 01:03:00,098
<i>But instead, I have a huge mouth.'</i>

795
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:07,188
<i>And she opened her humongous mouth.</i>

796
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:14,445
<i>Then the mother shouted in anger.</i>

797
01:03:16,489 --> 01:03:20,827
<i>'You weren't my perfect baby after all.</i>

798
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:23,705
<i>You're like a useless monkfish.</i>

799
01:03:25,623 --> 01:03:27,458
<i>All you can do is eat what I feed you.</i>

800
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:30,253
<i>You can't do anything on your own.
You're an utter failure.'</i>

801
01:03:32,755 --> 01:03:37,468
<i>Then the mother threw the baby
into the faraway sea.</i>

802
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,768
<i>Ever since that day,
it's been said that fishermen can hear</i>

803
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,898
<i>a baby's cry on spooky, windy days
out on the sea.</i>

804
01:03:55,486 --> 01:03:56,529
<i>'Mom.</i>

805
01:03:58,364 --> 01:03:59,615
<i>Mom.</i>

806
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:03,703
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

807
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,081
<i>Please</i>

808
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:10,001

812
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:42,533
<i>This book was your only failure,</i>

813
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:45,495
<i>but it's my favorite one
out of everything you've written.</i>

814
01:04:47,705 --> 01:04:50,541
<i>Since you're a writer too,
I'm sure you're well aware of this.</i>

It's been a while.

820
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:40,735
I know I owe you one.

01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:50,328
I'll give you something to write about.
It's been too long.

823
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:53,623
Mr. Lee!

824
01:06:54,332 --> 01:06:56,083
We have a huge problem!

825
01:06:57,835 --> 01:06:58,878
Mr. Lee!

826
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:01,797
Lee Sang-in!

827
01:07:02,882 --> 01:07:03,799
Sang-in!

828
01:07:10,348 --> 01:07:11,557
Hey, Mun-yeong.

829
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:14,393
What is it?

830
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:15,978
What?

831
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:18,856
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST</i>
TO BE RELEASED SOON

832
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:22,068
Darn it. What the heck is going on?

833
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:26,781
SANGSANGESANG WILL PUBLISH
<i>THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 10</i>

834
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:30,159
What do we do, Mr. Lee?

835
01:07:30,243 --> 01:07:34,205
Everyone is calling me to ask
if we're actually publishing

836
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:35,790
the final book of the series.

837
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:37,959
Who published
the first article about this?

838
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,128
The newspaper company
Suicide Bomber is signed with.

839
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:42,255
Suicide Bomber?

840
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:44,548
Isn't he the critic
Mun-yeong pushed down the stairs?

841
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:48,386
Just answer the calls.

842
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:49,887
Tell everyone that it's true.

843
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:54,517
Have you lost your mind?

844
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,186
You'll go to jail if you get caught
for telling such a lie.

845
01:07:57,895 --> 01:07:59,355
Please don't make a mess
you can't clean up.

846
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:02,233
I'll take care of everything,
so just do as I say.

847
01:08:02,316 --> 01:08:03,526
I have to go see Mun-yeong.

848
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:07,572
Damn it. This is nuts, Mun-yeong!

849
01:08:34,932 --> 01:08:36,225
Come to me.

850
01:08:37,893 --> 01:08:38,769
Mom.

851
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:43,816

01:08:50,156 --> 01:08:51,282
MR. LEE

853
01:08:54,285 --> 01:08:55,286
Hello.

854
01:08:56,954 --> 01:08:58,122
I read the article.

855
01:09:07,506 --> 01:09:08,507
My gosh.

856
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,385
Yes, hello.

857
01:09:13,346 --> 01:09:14,680
Hello!

858
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,229
How have you been?

859
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:23,689
Well, pretty good.

860
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:26,859
Ms. Park, you look so beautiful today.

861
01:09:26,942 --> 01:09:30,738
You... You look like a different person.

862
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:31,822
Really?

863
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,826
I bet you didn't recognize me.

864
01:09:36,952 --> 01:09:37,912
No, I didn't.

865
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:43,167
That's right.
I'm a different person today.

866
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:52,426
MY BROTHER

867
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:18,536
SANG-TAE

868
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,264
Hey, why... Just why?

869
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:41,225
What's with that crazy article?
What were you thinking?

870
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:42,768
Why cause trouble?

871
01:10:43,394 --> 01:10:44,353
You know

872
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:47,314
that I'm not the type to wait patiently.

873
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:49,567
I know

874
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,778
exactly what to do to provoke my mom

875
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:54,780
and have her come to me.

876
01:10:56,198 --> 01:10:57,491
Mun-yeong, please.

877
01:10:59,577 --> 01:11:00,578
Gang-tae

878
01:11:02,037 --> 01:11:03,038
can't catch the butterfly

879
01:11:04,623 --> 01:11:05,499
because he is

880
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:07,626
a coward.

881
01:11:09,044 --> 01:11:10,337
I have to do it.

882
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,299
Yes, you're right.

883
01:11:14,592 --> 01:11:17,094
Do Hui-jae contacted me.

884
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:21,766
-She told me to bring the manuscript.
-To where?

885
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:23,726
I'll meet her alone. You just stay here--

886
01:11:23,809 --> 01:11:26,562
No, she's after me.

887
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,148
Where are you meeting her?

888
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:32,151
-Mun-yeong.
-I asked you where you're meeting her.

889
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:34,820
Sang-tae!

890
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,126
SANG-TAE

891
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,337
-Sang-tae, where are you--
-<i>Oh, Mr. Moon.</i>

892
01:11:58,093 --> 01:12:00,971
<i>You're always looking for your brother.</i>

893
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:03,682
Sang-tae.

894
01:12:04,934 --> 01:12:05,935
Sang-tae.

895
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:08,437
Sang-tae.

896
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:09,897
Sang-tae!

897
01:12:10,147 --> 01:12:11,273
<i>Sang-tae!</i>

898
01:12:12,233 --> 01:12:13,484
If you hurt him,

899
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:15,903
I will not forgive you.

900
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:19,782
Only those who did something wrong
seek forgiveness.

901
01:12:19,865 --> 01:12:21,826
I didn't do anything wrong.

902
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,078
Where can I meet you?

903
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:27,081
The cursed castle.

904
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,854
<i>Are you really going to be okay
on your own?</i>

905
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:50,938
Yes.

906
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:53,315
Please take Mun-yeong

907
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:55,609
somewhere far away.

908
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,695
<i>Take her as far as you can go.</i>

909
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,365
So where are you supposed to meet her?

910
01:13:01,907 --> 01:13:02,741
What?

911
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:04,868
We're almost there.

912
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:09,498
Where are you meeting her?

913
01:13:21,677 --> 01:13:22,511
Stop the car.

914
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:25,598
I said, stop the car. Now!

915
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:28,225
Ko Mun-yeong,
please listen to me this time.

916
01:13:28,309 --> 01:13:29,560
You must not go there.

917
01:13:29,643 --> 01:13:32,146
-Stop the car. I said, stop!
-Mun-yeong!

918
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:34,815
Gang-tae is there alone.

919
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,609
He's there all alone!

920
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,944
-Pull over. Now.
-Mun-yeong, don't do this.

921
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,030
-I said, pull over!
-Mun-yeong!

922
01:13:41,113 --> 01:13:42,489
<i>Pull over! Now!</i>

923
01:13:42,573 --> 01:13:43,699

926
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:17,376
Sang-tae.

927
01:15:19,586 --> 01:15:21,255
Sang-tae.

928
01:15:21,839 --> 01:15:22,840
Sang-tae!

929
01:15:23,173 --> 01:15:24,049
