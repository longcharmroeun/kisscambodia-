00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,680
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,640
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,019
What did you expect?

4
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,189
For me to wait endlessly for the painting?

5
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,150
You must think it's your time
that you're wasting,

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,485
but it's actually mine.

7
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,487
And you're what? "Disappointed"?

8
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,255
What was that?

9
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,633
It's all on you.

10
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,642
That was my painting.

11
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,352
-I'm the painter.
-I know that.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,645
No, you don't.

13
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,774
It's mine.

14
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,486
Until the moment I hand it over to you,

15
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,823
it's mine.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,458
-Have you lost it?
-I've had it with you.

17
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,965
How dare you.

18
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,009
Who are you to decide that?

19
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,928
Who are you

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,473
to expect anything
or to be disappointed in me?

21
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,559
Who are you to treat me
like a vending machine?

22
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
Someone who can make or break you.

23
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,645
That was rhetorical.

24
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,689
I'm teaching you that I'm a human too.

25
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,608
You're teaching me?
And stop speaking causally to me.

26
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,986
Will doing so offend you less?

27
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,822
No, I'm telling you to watch your manners
despite the situation.

28
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,616
My bad.

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,036
How could I expect
a peasant like you to do that?

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,170
Is this how you always are?

31
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,213
You don't know me enough to say that.

32
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,966
Is this normal for the people
who live in your world?

33
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,304
You try to control the people you need
and throw away those you can't control.

34
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,015
Would I have been this way
had you done well?

35
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,267
Are you sure it isn't because
you hate to lose?

36
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,394
Is it fun to live like that?

37
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,859
What's there not to enjoy?

38
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,485
Isn't life about having fun?

39
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,237
I'm sure it is.

40
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,458
It'd be even more fun
if you ended up broke.

41
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,172
Without someone like me
who sees the value in your painting,

42
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,132
you'd be too broke to buy any supplies

43
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,761
and you'd be lost without a purpose.

44
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,514
You won't be able to paint in the end.

45
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,642
Fine.

46
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,937
If I can't have you,
I'd rather see you burn.

47
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,904
Don't let what I said get to you.

48
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,782
Don't lose that attitude of yours.

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,248
I had no idea you'd be this way.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,293
All I wanted

51
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,675
was to talk to you about paintings,

52
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,093
that's all.

53
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,179
Ms. Seo,

54
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,683
you're the worst.

55
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,821
This is what you get when you expect more
from a business transaction.

56
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,616
I hope you learned from it.

57
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,963
You lame jerk.

58
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,554
EPISODE 10

59
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,139
Damn it!

60
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,186
Damn it.

61
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,482
Mr. Jeong, it's me.

62
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,486
Collect portfolios of artists
that aren't signed with any galleries.

63
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,866
And draw up a contract for purchase

64
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,659
with a deadline clearly stated.

65
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,306
Not having meals regularly
and only drinking juice

66
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,266
is a problem.

67
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,729
As if that's my only issue.

68
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,922
Yeong-hwa, just a second.

69
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,966
Hi. What can I do for you?

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,718
You're late on your rent.

71
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,847
Right.

72
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
Mr. Jeong, where are my jelly beans?

73
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,321
Did you hide them
so that I'd die of a low sugar?

74
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,116
<i>I've rationed them
to stop you from eating them all at once.</i>

75
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,534
<i>I'll get them for you.</i>

76
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,828
But they're more enjoyable that way.

77
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,047
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WON

78
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,191
<i>Could you please return my 500,000 won…</i>

79
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,535
I have to choose between pride and rent.

80
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,621
Pride or rent?

81
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,003
Why on earth did I put
that envelope in there?

82
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,880
Unbelievable.

83
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,516
WHEN DID YOU BECOME BROTHERS?

84
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,229
Seriously?

85
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,772
What the…

86
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,192
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS

87
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,489
If you want to sue him, you can call me.

88
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,416
XW ENTERTAINMENT

89
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,226
Hello, is this Mr. Kim Myung-su?

90
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,603
You're Seo Tae-woong's manager, right?

91
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,815
No, I'm not calling to press charges.

92
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,903
Can you just tell him
to stop following me on social media?

93
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,990
Who the hell is this prick?

94
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,160
What is it? A prank call?

95
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:00,248
No, someone wanted me to tell you
to stop following him on social media.

96
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,209
And why are you telling me that?

97
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,044
Because I'm your manager.

98
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,130
Just who is it that you're following?

99
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,007
How should I know?

100
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,345
This is a weird neighborhood.

101
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,309
Wow, what an asshole.

102
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,438
Myung-su! How old is old enough?

103
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,941
Hold on. Mr. Old Enough?

104
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,945
So it really is him.

105
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,633
This is Dan-ah.

106
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,219
What's she doing here?

107
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,683
"Just when the view of the school
was getting boring…"

108
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,111
-Are you off to somewhere?
-Yes, I am.

109
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,988
We need to go back and pack.

110
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,699
Why should I when our schedule is over?

111
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,327
We leave for the countryside tomorrow
and I'm the leader.

112
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,411
How long is it for?

113
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,579
Only three nights.

114
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,498
You've got to be kidding me!

115
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,051
Head inside then.

116
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,638
-Thank you for today.
-But you did all the work.

117
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,556
I'll wire your wage into your account.

118
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,350
Be generous, please.

119
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,226
Sure.

120
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,021
-Head inside.
-Seon-gyeom.

121
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,817
You ran for Annam City Hall,

122
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,613
so how did you end
your contract with them?

123
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,198
My agency did.

124
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,534
All I did was send back
the paperwork I received

125
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,244
after signing them.

126
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,247
I'm clueless about this stuff.

127
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,083
What did your team say?

128
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,835
Your contract doesn't end for a while.

129
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,004
Right. Quite a long while, actually.

130
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,800
The coach said we should talk
once I've somewhat recovered,

131
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,468
so I'll be seeing him soon.

132
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,224
-Woo-sik.
-Yes?

133
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,769
Imagine yourself on a track.

134
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,606
We only have to make a decision
when we're at the starting line.

135
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,738
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you anything.

136
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,742
You're more daring
than people think, you know.

137
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,746
Right. Well, have a safe trip back.

138
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,081
I'll head inside.

139
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:12,231
GENERAL MANAGER JEONG JI-HYUN

140
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,616
Mr. Jeong, this is Ki Seon-gyeom.

141
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,161
When would Ms. Seo be free tomorrow?

142
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,876
Right, I'll be there on time.

143
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,919
Sure.

144
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,479
LEE YEONG-HWA

145
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,898
Hello?

146
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,400
No, I'm not busy.

147
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,612
Right now?

148
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,333
You called me to have a drink?

149
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,751
No, because I'm depressed.

150
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,508
How's this place?

151
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,510
Nice, right?

152
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,220
It's cold.

153
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,765
I love it here.
The night view is incredible

154
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,934
and the rent is low
considering what it offers.

155
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,895
However, it'll be my last month here.

156
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,106
I wasn't able to pay my rent, you see.

157
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,900
If I ask my mom for the money,

158
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,528
she'll tell me to move into
a dorm instead.

159
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,655
I can't think of a way

160
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,074
to quickly come up with 300,000 won.

161
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,993
And it's not like
I can get a roommate this fast.

162
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,459
Oh, these? I bought them a while back.

163
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,173
Did you call me here to ask me for money?

164
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,594
Seon-gyeom, could you let me
serve you for a month?

165
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,931
Give me that chance
and I'll make sure you live like a King.

166
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,600
-For free?
-Well,

167
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,894
just pay the rest of my rent

168
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,980
and everything else will be for free.

169
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,731
For free!

170
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,362
What's your account number?

171
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,782
You'll just lend me the money?
This easily?

172
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,867
Yes.

173
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,746
Seon-gyeom, my gosh.

174
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,082
Thank you so much.

175
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,333
Account number.

176
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,794
All my friends were in a tight spot too,

177
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,588
so I had no one else to turn to.

178
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,342
But you've turned down the suggestion
for us to live together so fast.

179
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,609
Has Ms. Seo Dan-ah
ever walked all over you before?

180
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,864
Not in a way that I felt
like she was abusing her power.

181
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,950
Why did I think that way then?

182
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,078
-Am I that lame?
-<i>I'm home.</i>

183
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,538
Are you home?

184
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,750
Hey, you're home. I'm here.

185
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,171
-You're not.
-I am.

186
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,720
We should go grocery shopping.

187
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,932
We're out of food,
so what have you been eating?

188
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,141
Well…

189
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,521
Get up.

190
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,440
-We're going out.
-For a walk?

191
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,693
I'll take you out for a walk
and let you help me cook.

192
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,403
You're the best.

193
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,158
Get me the sesame seeds.

194
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,243
Right, sure.

195
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,331
It's not like you to be out of a job.

196
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,874
But I just got back to Seoul.

197
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,919
That was just part time.
I'm talking about your day job.

198
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,837
I was offered a project,

199
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,382
but I turned it down
since it involved transcription.

200
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,927
I'd kill for a horror film, you know.

201
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,679
Even if it was written by Aaron Sorkin?

202
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,014
Must you be that cruel?

203
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,350
What's that though? Honey?

204
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,811
He left it behind.

205
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,646
For us to enjoy?

206
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,607
-So the spring onions--
-I'll chop them.

207
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,568
Gosh.

208
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,411
May,

209
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,249
I feel like such a loser.

210
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,170
I never once truly told him
how I felt about him

211
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,048
all because I was too scared
of being rejected

212
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,508
and never seeing him again,

213
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:54,096
but I was waiting for him
to say it first nonetheless.

214
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,390
It's too bland.

215
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,019
I thought about all the issues we faced

216
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,230
and they'd all be resolved
if we were dating.

217
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,525
Everything would be natural then,
but I was too scared of losing him

218
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,695
-that I didn't dare to make a move.
-See how it tastes.

219
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,612
No.

220
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,242
-Is it salty?
-No, it's delicious.

221
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,746
May, come on. Hear me out, will you?

222
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,497
I'm dead serious!

223
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,959
Then why are you saying it to me
and not to him?

224
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,420
Stop confessing to me and call him.

225
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,838
He left his honey behind.

226
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,339
That could be your excuse.

227
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,051
Gosh, why didn't I think of that?

228
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,427
Goodness.

229
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,096
Should I just go and tell him how I feel?

230
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,392
I, you… We'll go steady as of today.

231
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,270
-What if he rejects me?
-If he does, will you back off?

232
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,315
-No, I'll fight to the death.
-You shouldn't do that.

233
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,317
Let me see.

234
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,446
Tell him how you feel.
How else can you move forward?

235
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,114
Right.

236
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,617
So…

237
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,339
Drink that,

238
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,299
and we'll go steady.

239
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,846
What if I don't?

240
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,389
Then it's over between us…

241
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,475
forever.

242
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,914
Why is your scenario so pessimistic?

243
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,583
That must've been
my subconscious speaking.

244
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,669
Let me try again.

245
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,717
You're saying you like me?

246
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,261
After all this time?

247
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,597
After…

248
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,145
the way you hurt me?

249
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,565
Why on earth are you crying?

250
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,400
You're putting me in a spot.

251
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,364
Why did you do this to me?

252
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,158
Tell me.

253
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,909
Just why?

254
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,080
Why are you acting like
I did something so cruel?

255
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,957
You hurt me too, you know.

256
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,131
Why must it always be
at night and at a bar?

257
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,674
Can't you say it sober?

258
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,968
You're right.

259
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,804
We should meet in broad daylight
when we're both sober.

260
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,265
Is there a guarantee

261
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,893
that he'll come if I ask him to meet me?

262
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,145
How should I know?

263
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,647
He might not want the honey back.

264
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,529
<i>Hi. I'm the guy who wrote about
the girl I've been flirting with.</i>

265
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,657
<i>If you don't know the full story,
go and read the previous post.</i>

266
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,659
<i>I'll just skip the honorifics.</i>

267
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,078
<i>You know how I moved in with her
for a while?</i>

268
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,539
<i>She wants to meet up
to return a jar of honey.</i>

269
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,959
<i>I think she's going to ask me out.
What should I wear?</i>

270
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,628
<i>I want to make her lose interest.</i>

271
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,588
<i>But then again, I won't be going.</i>

272
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,007
Hey!

273
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>You've gone too far.</i>

274
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,098
Cut it out and just call him.

275
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,184
I don't think I can.

276
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,646
Do it. I'm going to make <i>kkakdugi</i>,
so slice them into cubes.

277
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,605
Got it.

278
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,451
Hello? Hey, why did you leave
your jar of honey?

279
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,994
You took everything else.

280
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,955
Let's meet so I can give it back.
It seemed important.

281
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,458
What do I do?

282
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,630
My hands stink of green onions.
What should I do?

283
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,049
-Wash your hands with toothpaste.
-Then they'll smell like toothpaste.

284
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,218
Then slice the green onions
for the <i>kkakdugi</i>.

285
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,427
Okay.

286
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,058
Who was that? Was it voice phishing?

287
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,227
She wants to meet.

288
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,980
Right now? Who was it?
Was it voice phishing?

289
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,815
It was Ms. Oh.

290
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,818
But she didn't say when.

291
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,903
-Then when?
-I don't know.

292
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,781
What a weird conversation.

293
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,829
Just call her back, Seon-gyeom.

294
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,247
You guys are close enough.

295
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,458
Well, are we?

296
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,252
How would I know?

297
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,093
May! He's calling me!

298
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,971
Is he rejecting me already?
I didn't even do anything.

299
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,931
He's probably calling to ask when to meet.

300
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,350
You just hung up
after asking him to meet up.

301
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,768
Right. I hope so.

302
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,771
You're rarely sane these days.

303
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,898
I'm 29. I'm at that age.

304
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,483
You're at the peak of insanity.

305
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,277
Thanks for reminding me.

306
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,489
Gosh, you're making me go nuts.

307
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,117
Just answer the phone
and slice the rest of the radish.

308
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,618
Must I repeat myself?

309
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,830
I don't think I can pick up.

310
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,956
What?

311
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,834
KI SEON-GYEOM

312
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,919
He hung up.

313
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,468
<i>Let's meet the day after tomorrow
at the park at 2:00 p.m.</i>

314
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,887
<i>If you read this, please reply with a dot.</i>

315
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,100
She texted you instead?

316
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,896
Gosh, I didn't take Mi-joo
to be such a wuss.

317
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:44,071
Seon-gyeom, I like Mi-joo a lot.

318
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,656
I mustered up my courage
to side with you instead.

319
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,871
"Courage"?

320
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,500
Did I make her do it again?

321
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,044
Why? Do you need courage?

322
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,298
Should I give you some of mine?
I won't be needing it for a while.

323
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,633
No, it's okay.

324
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,720
In the past, I would have envied you
for being able to fix a date with someone.

325
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,181
But now that it's over,
I'm not that jealous.

326
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,810
But, hey.
Is something up between the two of you?

327
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,939
It's mostly me.

328
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,358
Hey, Mr. Mostly Me.

329
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,276
What's the problem, mostly?

330
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,237
I'm boring.

331
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,571
I think you're funny.

332
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,617
I don't know how to share

333
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,370
or what to give to people.

334
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,497
Are you sure?

335
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,624
But what's that?

336
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,919
What does it look like to you?

337
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,463
Art.

338
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,424
Okay.

339
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,051
Then art it is.

340
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,010
Just like that?

341
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,806
People need to think it's art
in order for it to become one.

342
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,308
By the way,
you should speak to me casually.

343
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,602
I know. I already am.

344
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,939
So you really don't share.

345
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,241
Seon-gyeom.

346
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,660
You came early.
Ms. Seo is still in a meeting.

347
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,036
I'll wait.

348
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,168
Seon-gyeom, what brings you here?

349
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,335
I came to meet Ms. Seo.

350
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,380
Will you take a look at this?

351
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,257
We got the sample pamphlets
for the charity run.

352
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,426
The event that Ms. Seo holds every year?

353
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,803
Which one of these look better?

354
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,013
I'll consider your vote.

355
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,890
I don't know much about art.

356
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,392
Which means you'll just simply choose
the better one.

357
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,563
This one.

358
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,440
You really have a good eye.

359
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,943
Mr. Jeong, take a look at the samples
for the charity run.

360
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,654
-Which one do you prefer?
-I will choose

361
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,073
the one that Ms. Seo chooses.

362
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,074
Okay then.

363
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,702
Why are you meeting Ms. Seo?

364
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,870
Did she call you here?

365
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,789
But your contract with her has ended.

366
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,750
I called and asked for a meeting.

367
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,962
There's a natural gift you have,
but I bet you don't know what it is.

368
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,299
You motivate people.

369
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:15,931
When you said I have a gift earlier,
did you really mean it?

370
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,224
What?

371
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,517
Oh, that?

372
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,895
I said that because you also motivated me

373
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,606
while you merely
focused on your career for two years.

374
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,567
I didn't know that.

375
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,528
Now that you do,
you should put your gift to good use.

376
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,995
Why does he want to meet
at a comic book store? We're not kids.

377
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,249
Apparently,
Chairman Seo likes comic books.

378
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,251
I guess beggars can't be choosers.

379
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,711
He's here.

380
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,880
You came early.

381
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,965
Yes.

382
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,052
It's my first time at a comic book store,
so I was looking around.

383
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,013
Why don't you recommend me a book?

384
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,559
I'm not quite sure
if you'll enjoy the stuff I read.

385
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,520
Start with the famous ones.

386
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,689
They're over there in that corner.

387
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,691
What kind of stuff do you read?

388
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,820
This guy is the problem.

389
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,906
He causes trouble everywhere he goes.

390
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,952
He has four daughters?

391
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,996
Gosh, I envy him.

392
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,582
Come to think of it,

393
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,128
you haven't gotten back to me
about your daughter's marriage.

394
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,798
I've actually been wondering
what your son is doing these days.

395
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,426
He's taking a break.

396
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,512
It's important for athletes
to get some time off.

397
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,598
"A break."

398
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,810
My daughter's always busy with work.

399
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,979
But Seon-gyeom is taking a break?

400
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,690
This is why I don't push her
to get married

401
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,358
although it's what I want.

402
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,485
She works at both the head office
and the agency.

403
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,029
And a yearly charity event.

404
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,114
She even runs herself to donate money.

405
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,076
I should tell my son to attend the event
with his track and field team.

406
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,870
Is he the coach?

407
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,999
There's a team he's been coaching
for years as a charity.

408
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,795
I told him he should coach the team
to bring up national athletes.

409
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,632
I can easily help them become
a local team.

410
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,968
I really envy that about you.

411
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,636
Both your kids are honorable.

412
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
My goodness, I envy you

413
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,934
for having two kids
that are both smart and successful.

414
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,396
The kimchi fried rice is here.
Where do you want it?

415
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,731
It's his.

416
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
Here.

417
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,071
-Enjoy.
-When will the <i>ramyeon</i> be ready?

418
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,035
Seon-gyeom,
you look like you're doing great.

419
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,537
You know I only have 20 minutes, right?

420
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,039
That's fine with me.

421
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,962
Should I register your fingerprint again?
I heard you complained.

422
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,465
I complained?

423
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,800
Isn't that why you're here?

424
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,973
I finally get why people always thought

425
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,975
I was arrogant.

426
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,395
You finally got that?

427
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,771
Thank you.

428
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,817
I think I finally get what it was

429
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,362
that you did for me
while I was busy pulling myself together.

430
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,199
Back then, I wasn't able to realize
that I was getting a lot of support.

431
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,455
That's our job, and we're good at it.

432
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,166
Is that what you came here to tell me?

433
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,837
I just felt a little frustrated.

434
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,630
And I wanted to talk.

435
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,590
You can be a little frustrating.

436
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,300
It's about Woo-sik.

437
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,928
-Who's that?
-The guy you helped.

438
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,096
Oh, him.

439
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,724
I heard he left the training center.

440
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,892
That means he's no longer
a national athlete.

441
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,686
Is he back to his old team?

442
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,938
They will either advise him
to transfer teams

443
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,732
or just let him stay out of loyalty.

444
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,776
What do you think?

445
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,697
He's a hot potato. A nuisance.

446
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,909
It's too burdensome.
He definitely got on the coach's bad side

447
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,871
since the coach would have been held
responsible for the mess.

448
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,249
They do hate being
at the center of controversy.

449
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,334
Although he was a whistleblower,

450
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,421
they can't kick him out
because he was the victim.

451
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,048
Plus, they have an image to keep up.

452
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,676
Do you think he can at least
transfer to a different team?

453
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,389
Obviously not. Whoever takes him in
will just do so to keep him on the bench.

454
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,558
Don't agencies

455
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,269
also help athletes find a new team?

456
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,565
Don't tell me you think other athletes
deserve to be treated just like you.

457
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,524
Why not?

458
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,278
I get that you're fair, but think again.
Do you really not know?

459
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,281
Is it because of my background?

460
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,116
Not everyone has what you have.

461
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,118
Your family is famous, you're handsome,

462
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,287
and you always got
the second-highest record.

463
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,413
But what about Woo-sik?

464
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,291
What does he have to offer?

465
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,794
His talent, of course.

466
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,797
In the end, the team just wants
the best record and a medal.

467
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,757
It's easy to say, but he's injured.

468
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,343
Can you guarantee
that he'll fully recover?

469
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,888
He might even be better than before.

470
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,766
He endured the rocky patch,

471
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,310
and now he can fully focus on training.

472
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,062
How about a different sport?

473
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,482
If he's good at running marathons,
Seomyung could sponsor him.

474
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,819
You want him to run marathons?
So the cameras can catch him

475
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,154
running with your company's logo?

476
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,115
That's what sponsorships are.

477
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,742
A sprint is only 100m long.

478
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,993
Yes.

479
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,704
It only lasts ten seconds.

480
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,706
But you sometimes even get eliminated

481
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,334
just for starting too early by accident.

482
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,338
What a ridiculous sport.
Who makes money from that?

483
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,173
The athletes should.

484
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,428
I was right.
You care more about the athletes than me.

485
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,020
How do you think we can convince
another team to take him in?

486
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,273
A victim who got kicked out.

487
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,568
You love being a good person.

488
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,196
You'd be a strategic philanthropist
who helped a hopeless athlete

489
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,489
get a second chance.

490
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,618
I like how it sounds.

491
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:15,164
But what's the point in doing this
when he was willing to risk it all?

492
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,624
Isn't this what you want?

493
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,167
Yes, it is.

494
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,421
That's why I came here.

495
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,801
It's not an easy topic.

496
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,306
Then let's be careful about it.

497
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,687
Thanks for the talk.

498
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,188
I'll see you then.

499
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,659
Are you upset?

500
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,456
No.

501
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,052
It's not just you and me.

502
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,888
Seon-gyeom will also be there
with the kids from that school.

503
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,723
The one he volunteers at.

504
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,601
<i>Stop giving him such a hard time.</i>

505
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,020
It's a charity event.

506
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,813
Can't you just go without me?

507
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,107
No, I can't.

508
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,235
What's the point of going there
without you?

509
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,154
Then don't go.

510
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,823
The charity is being held by Dan-ah.

511
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,116
Can't you just make time?

512
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,036
I don't want to make time
because I feel like it's for you.

513
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,791
Ji-woo, you need to start shooting now.

514
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,294
Okay, I'll be right there.

515
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,837
Let's hang up. I need to work.

516
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,885
Gosh, when in the world
is your acting going to get better?

517
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,847
Ji-woo, it hurts my conscience
every time I do this.

518
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,016
From now on,
forget that you have a conscience.

519
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,019
Gosh, what kind of nonsense
is he up to this time?

520
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,854
Your husband?

521
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,441
He's trying hard to set our son up
with a girl from a rich family.

522
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,403
Is your son no longer dating Tae-ri?

523
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,864
Is he dating Tae-ri?

524
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,827
Why would she date him?

525
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,620
ART, PHYSICAL EDUCATION

526
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:44,147
SCHOOL LIBRARY

527
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,629
-Here.
-Okay.

528
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,049
Let me check if there are any free seats.

529
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,968
Here. Please write down
what you're going to watch.

530
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:25,521
<i>JERRY MAGUIRE</i>

531
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,954
Tomorrow's the big day.

532
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,987
I wanted to give this back to you.

533
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,029
Right.

534
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,006
Yesterday, I watched <i>Jerry Maguire</i>.

535
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,632
Was it fun?

536
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,551
No, it wasn't.

537
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,677
I see.

538
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,973
But it made me feel warm inside.

539
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,144
I thought about why,

540
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,565
and it was because that's how I felt
when you described it to me.

541
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,362
How was the movie?

542
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,157
The male lead

543
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,494
couldn't seem to stand
his failures in life.

544
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,041
He even ended up hurting the only person
who stayed by his side.

545
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,086
And he realized that person's value
once it was too late.

546
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,551
But it kind of reminded me of myself.

547
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,389
I was scared that things might end

548
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,351
between us

549
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,103
the closer we got.

550
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:21,280
Your affection for me
gives me meaning and value.

551
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,623
But I wasn't sure
if you had feelings for me

552
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,460
the same way I do about you.

553
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,715
I wonder if you also want to hold my hand,

554
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,717
hug me

555
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,553
and kiss me.

556
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,515
I wasn't quite sure of that.

557
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,226
Because I do.

558
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,234
Please don't hate me.

559
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,824
-You're jumping from subject to subject.
-Did I?

560
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,826
I'm sorry.

561
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,476
That's my answer.

562
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,772
Then can I keep doing it?

563
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,607
What? Doing me a favor and liking me?

564
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,192
No, just liking you.

565
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,154
Will you stop if I say no?

566
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,407
Will you?

567
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,742
No.

568
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,702
I want to keep going.

569
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,370
That's what I want.

570
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,540
Then go ahead. You have my permission.

571
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,208
Really?

572
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,920
Thank goodness.

573
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,633
To be honest, I was really worried

574
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,303
that I might have hurt you that day.

575
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,182
I don't want to be
your one-month girlfriend.

576
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,267
But I can't do it alone, so help me out.

577
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,853
You help people for no reason.

578
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,105
Now you'll do even better
that you have a reason.

579
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,566
I'll try my best.

580
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,707
Do you think you'll be hungry soon?

581
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,042
Yes, I should be.

582
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,335
Right.

583
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,519
Don't you think it's ready now?

584
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,312
Probably.

585
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,139
The weather's nice today.

586
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,223
It is.

587
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,518
How have you been doing recently?

588
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,187
I've been doing well.

589
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,772
Me too.

590
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,277
I met with Ms. Seo and Woo-sik.

591
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,946
It seemed like he was preparing
for a civil service exam.

592
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,906
How did you know?

593
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,366
I met with him as well.

594
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,327
Is he really going to do it?
It won't be easy.

595
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,080
He's probably undecided.

596
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,708
I submitted my resignation letter,

597
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,836
but he was just about to be
forced into resignation.

598
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,006
You make it sound like
he has an office job.

599
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,594
He does.
It's like that when you're in a team.

600
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,345
You're right.

601
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,017
I think being a professional is hard
no matter what line of work it is.

602
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,439
I thought I'd be able to watch
all my favorite movies

603
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,191
and make money as a translator.

604
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,610
But now that I am one,

605
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:33,032
I've realized that some movies
can be boring as well.

606
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,160
I've never been entertained
by a movie before.

607
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:43,751
What's fortunate is that I began this job
because I enjoyed it.

608
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,085
That's one good thing.

609
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,172
And that I still enjoy this job.

610
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,259
But there are days when things
just don't go my way.

611
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,720
I have to look up words
that I already know

612
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,598
or listen to the same line repeatedly
and still not get it.

613
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,393
I must have been prejudiced.
You looked happy when working.

614
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,562
I feel the same way.

615
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,815
Athletes look passionate,
so I thought that was always the case.

616
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,276
As if they were solely motivated
by their dreams.

617
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,070
That's not the case most of the time.

618
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,657
They get paid to participate
in tournaments,

619
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,202
so they just participate
for the money and not run.

620
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,964
I thought you didn't run that time
due to the given circumstances.

621
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,841
Are you allowed to not run at all?

622
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,219
The winner is already decided.

623
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,887
So during the preliminaries,

624
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,014
you don't run if it doesn't look hopeful.

625
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,102
That moment when you refused to run

626
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,688
seemed like a scene from a movie.

627
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,902
Doesn't this remind you of Yeong-hwa?

628
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,654
No, not at all.

629
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,114
It doesn't remind me of him.

630
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,741
Who is Lee Yeong-hwa?
I don't even remember him.

631
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,828
Where are you headed? I'll drop you off.

632
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,331
No, let me drop you off
wherever it may be.

633
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,419
-No, let me.
-No. Let's go.

634
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,886
This is me.

635
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,347
Did you move to our neighborhood?

636
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,767
-You really are full of surprises.
-It's Yeong-hwa's house.

637
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,811
This time, it's his house?

638
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,315
-Are you a nomad or something?
-No, I'm not.

639
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,359
It's nice that you live nearby.

640
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,236
Is it?

641
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,742
Of course. Since you live nearby,

642
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,328
we'll be closer. And…

643
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,913
You get it, right?

644
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,832
Then should I do that?

645
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,378
Thank you for walking me home.
You should go.

646
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,592
Come to think of it,
I've never watched you go home safely.

647
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,928
-And I feel terrible about that.
-Don't be.

648
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,889
I'll treat you well.

649
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,600
I have so much fun when I'm with you.

650
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,520
-You should go.
-Okay.

651
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,692
You should let me know when
you're going to bed or doing something.

652
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,070
Bye.

653
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,076
I'll treat you well.

654
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,787
I'm going to spoil you.

655
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,208
Are we going to speak casually now?

656
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,001
-Should we?
-No.

657
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,212
Okay.

658
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,214
We argue enough as it is.

659
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,716
I can't imagine how we'll be
if we started doing that.

660
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,595
I'm really leaving now.
You better text me.

661
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,724
Bye.

662
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,235
Love is crazy. Romance is crazy.

663
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,613
My homework's due tomorrow.

664
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,783
-Hey, why are you here?
-I'm so worried.

665
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,703
Why are you carrying this around?
I'm not taking it back.

666
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,873
I can't help but worry.

667
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,500
About this?

668
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,461
It's better for me to do so,

669
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,713
so why did she offer
to walk me home instead?

670
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,924
Does she even know how far I live?

671
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,301
If she walked me back,
she'd have to take a cab.

672
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,303
Then I'd be worried about that

673
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,472
since it could be dangerous to ride a cab.

674
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,766
Thank goodness I knew about your house.

675
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,185
Why are you so worried about?

676
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,645
You've never been this chatty.

677
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,606
Of course, I'm worried. It's so cold.

678
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,278
Are you still up for living together
for a month?

679
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,908
I thought you refused
after wiring me the money.

680
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,036
Let's say I paid the monthly rent
in advance.

681
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,126
That does lessen the burden,
but why out of the blue?

682
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,421
It'll be more convenient to walk me home,
and I could do the same.

683
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,673
Okay, it's solved then.

684
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,967
This is it.

685
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,511
I'm so lost.

686
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,055
But okay.

687
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,392
-There are no muggers here, right?
-No.

688
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,603
Why does it get dark so soon?

689
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,862
<i>So about that gun…</i>

690
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,406
Is it even worth owning when it's fake?

691
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,288
Since I've found the real deal,
you'll stay here for the time being.

692
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,931
Why am I not that excited?

693
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,266
Do you not like it?

694
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,694
No.

695
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,323
It's not the photo. I think it's just me.

696
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,701
No. I'll be seeing Eun-bi soon.

697
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,205
I want to be happy and excited.
This is so exciting!

698
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,002
KI SEON-GYEOM

699
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,632
Ta-da. Didn't I pick the best one?
I wanted to show you this.

700
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,593
You're making me hate you
even though I've never liked you.

701
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,345
Where are you looking? Look here.

702
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,473
Why have you become so thin?

703
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,851
-Are you even eating properly?
-Don't act like you care.

704
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,229
I should take care of my athlete.

705
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,358
How could you discard him
as soon as I signed up? Is he an object?

706
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,069
-And what? "My athlete"?
-He didn't care.

707
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,990
He never cares about himself,
so I should get mad…

708
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,077
Did he see that himself?

709
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,374
I didn't know such siblings existed.
Are all biological siblings like that?

710
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,544
I didn't know someone could be sarcastic
in this kind of way.

711
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,463
I'm serious.
I'm fascinated by how different we are.

712
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,383
Seon-gyeom and I are kindhearted.

713
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,427
You're just downright obnoxious.

714
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,181
If I was obnoxious,

715
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,726
do you think I'd host charity runs
every year?

716
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,144
I'm a benevolent person.

717
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,521
It's not charity if you're doing it
to look good.

718
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,443
Why don't you try being
benevolent as well?

719
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,694
It's a half-marathon.

720
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,822
I don't have time to run 21km.

721
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,908
We haven't scheduled
all the advertisements yet.

722
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,785
I'm sick of being the best.

723
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,704
I wanted to retire and relax,

724
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,039
but I'm too busy.

725
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,791
You're not retiring.
Our journey has just begun.

726
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,212
Being Seon-gyeom's shield for a bit longer
won't kill me.

727
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,382
I'm considering being at the top
for a bit longer.

728
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,801
He was my shield for a long time too.

729
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,599
If you're going to be a shield,
you should at least look pretty.

730
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,435
You've done worse before.

731
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,563
Don't look at them.

732
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,733
Pick the clothes you want
from the new batch.

733
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,527
Now I know what you've been wearing
in the past.

734
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,655
I hate you so much.

735
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,157
It's okay. I'll like you instead.

736
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,016
What was that?

737
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,560
It's all on you.

738
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,562
Damn it.

739
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,358
I was happy to see Eun-bi's photo,
so why am I thinking about him again?

740
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,736
No.

741
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,239
I had a good day.

742
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,326
I was in a great mood today.

743
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,579
Right, it was a good day.

744
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,040
Damn it. No.

745
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,339
I faked it. I forced myself to be happy.

746
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,718
It was all because of you.

747
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,685
Ma'am, are you sure you want to go there?

748
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,687
Perhaps, you should go
to your regular bar.

749
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,981
Reading won't help me sleep tonight.

750
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,399
Books can't talk.

751
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,915
Did you book an appointment
with the owner?

752
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,418
I'm just the deliveryman.

753
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,923
May, the food just arrived.

754
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,384
I'll eat alone.

755
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,595
Don't you smell chicken?

756
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,806
Why do you have that? Just give it to me.

757
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,769
I'll be having my first chicken tonight.

758
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,562
Give it to me, and buy your own.

759
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,399
How did you know where I live?
And what's with that outfit?

760
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,026
I wouldn't go out like that ever.

761
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,528
Shouldn't you invite me in?

762
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,905
But you're not my guest.

763
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,283
Just take that with you.

764
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,454
I'm already irritated.
Please don't make it worse.

765
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:26,249
I see. Cheer up. You can do it.

766
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,756
I've never been rejected like this.

767
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,175
You left me hanging out here.

768
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,968
-You're very--
-Charming?

769
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,012
I almost became special to you.

770
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,559
It's cute.

771
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,937
Where's Seon-gyeom?

772
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,105
Why are you here?

773
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,649
Because I want to drink.

774
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,192
Do you not have any friends?

775
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,069
Is this your way of making friends?

776
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,571
Were you drinking by yourself? Bad news?

777
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,574
-Good news.
-Then you should have whiskey.

778
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,244
I don't see the point
in drinking expensive liquor.

779
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,498
It's worth its price.
Do you have an on-the-rock glass?

780
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,255
No. Use this.

781
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,844
Do you at least have a transparent one?

782
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,179
It doesn't have to be glass.
Plastic's fine.

783
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,565
Next time, bring your own.

784
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,609
So there's a next time?

785
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,071
You do know you sound
like a psychopath, right?

786
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,117
Someone told me
that I have no sense of empathy.

787
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,119
I agree. It's more convenient.

788
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,620
Why do I need to empathize?

789
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,418
Because you're concerned and worried.

790
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,211
Is something wrong with you?

791
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,380
You also use your brain for empathy.

792
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,257
There must be a loose screw up there.

793
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,801
That's a bit harsh.

794
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,304
God, I'm seriously hurt.

795
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,390
I'm a very kindhearted person,
so why do people--

796
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,100
That's not what I meant, you sociopath.

797
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,228
Exactly. Many people have said that to me,

798
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,188
so why does it bother me this time?

799
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,691
That's not it either.
This is so frustrating.

800
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,027
Can you please stop talking
out of context?

801
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,292
Do you want this?

802
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,671
I've never tried soju.
I'm picky about what I eat and drink.

803
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,298
Never mind, then.

804
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,469
Give me a glass. Let me try it.

805
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,472
It should be fine If you lasted this long
without being sick.

806
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,808
I get sick every time.

807
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,606
First glass, bottoms up.

808
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,578
Why did you get rid of Seon-gyeom?

809
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:12,123
I didn't. He left because it was time.

810
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,833
Is that why you came?

811
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,585
I told you I'm here to drink.

812
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,588
There must be a reason why
you came all the way here.

813
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,677
I thought you would know.

814
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,847
-What do you mean?
-Because you're a peasant like him.

815
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,061
Get out.

816
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,065
-This is savory.
-I said, get out.

817
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,608
Hear me out.

818
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,279
He…

819
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:49,160
ruined my painting and blamed it on me
when I clearly saw him do it.

820
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,790
He must have been furious.

821
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,876
-Stop incriminating yourself with words.
-How's that even possible?

822
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,171
You'd be shocked to hear
what words can do.

823
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,298
Let's forget about what's already ruined.

824
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,845
Imagine that you've entrusted something
to me.

825
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,724
When would you be the most upset
to get it back?

826
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,227
This Again?
Why do you want him to be upset?

827
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,354
-Because he ruined my mood.
-Is it a revenge?

828
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:20,316
-No. That'd be admitting that I care.
-And you obviously are.

829
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,070
Who is it?

830
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,615
<i>I'm going to bed. Goodnight.</i>

831
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,036
What? He actually did it.

832
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,370
He's so adorable.

833
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,167
Let's see. "Goodnight"?

834
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,128
-I really…
-That sounds insincere.

835
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,507
-I really liked him.
-"Sweet dreams…"

836
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,301
No.

837
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:49,095
-You don't dream when you sleep well.
-It's not everyday

838
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,930
that I open myself up like that.

839
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,807
"Have a good day

840
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,851
-tomorrow."
-So when I like something,

841
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,770
-I like it forever.
-Send.

842
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,938
Just like soccer.

843
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,983
"Have a good day tomorrow."
It's nice and natural.

844
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,402
I still regret it to this day.

845
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,323
I should've forgotten about him by now,
but I'm obsessed.

846
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,536
-What should I do?
-You should go home.

847
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,706
My god.

848
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,167
She's unbelievable.

849
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,879
You should go home. Excuse me.

850
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,672
Damn it.

851
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,343
Come on.

852
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,013
Gosh.

853
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,684
She's pretty even when she sleeps.

854
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,574
What?

855
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,785
When did she leave?

856
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:08,049
The dining table feels empty
without Myeong-min.

857
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,302
It's nice and quiet.

858
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,764
Is work going well?

859
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,851
-Yes.
-What about the charity event?

860
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,187
Of course. I'm in charge.

861
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,690
You were never interested in that.

862
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,025
Are you going to run again?

863
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,904
It'd look insincere
if the host didn't participate.

864
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,491
Take good care of your health.
Don't overdo it.

865
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,035
I'm worried about you.

866
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,209
Don't treat me like a patient.
I haven't been sick in ages.

867
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,432
God.

868
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,769
If I ever drink soju again…

869
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,731
I'll drink just a little from now on.

870
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,538
It's honey water.
You looked like you needed it.

871
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,833
If it's from that, just throw it all away.

872
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,794
Have you gathered the portfolios yet?

873
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,339
I'll finish up by this week.

874
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:33,176
Hurry up and look into it.
There are probably many others like him.

875
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,386
No, there have to be.

876
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,850
I should make the next person
sign a contract to tie them down.

877
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,019
Should I get it notarized?

878
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,146
Ms. Seo.

879
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,525
Didn't you need Lee Yeong-hwa
because Director Seo

880
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,276
replaced a painting that was yours?

881
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,279
-That's right.
-However,

882
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,658
you now seem to be looking for a painting
because of him.

883
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,788
Then should I look for someone
who has a similar style?

884
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,295
No.

885
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,177
Return this to him.

886
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,681
Tell him I don't need compensation
and to never bother me again.

887
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,934
Yes, ma'am.

888
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,911
How did you know I'd be here?

889
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,456
Wait. Even if you knew,
you shouldn't have come.

890
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,376
I came here myself
because I couldn't reach you.

891
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,547
That's right. I blocked your number.

892
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,382
Ms. Seo wanted to return this.

893
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,640
She doesn't need compensation

894
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,560
and doesn't want you to bother her again.

895
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,687
Don't you have her personal number?

896
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,399
Please erase it in front of me.

897
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,278
She even sent you to cut ties with me.

898
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,408
This wouldn't have happened
had you not drew anything.

899
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,245
Would you have done that
if she acknowledged your talent?

900
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,333
Fine. I don't need her number
when I can't even reach her.

901
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,877
Look. This is her.

902
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,672
Delete. Done, right? It's over.

903
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,382
Don't bother me again.

904
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,178
What a way to ruin my day.

905
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,601
Earning money isn't easy.

906
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,145
What brings you here?

907
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,148
I thought I'd pay a visit.

908
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,651
-Where's Ms. Seo?
-She's swimming.

909
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,778
She doesn't like to be bothered
when swimming.

910
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,197
I was free today, so I came to say hi.

911
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,948
Eun-bi joined your agency.

912
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,533
I wasn't there for her back then

913
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,661
so I wanted to start
showing her some support.

914
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,829
-Is it too late for that?
-What if it is?

915
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,373
They're always going to be kids to us.

916
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,749
You're right.

917
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,085
I don't have time to wait.

918
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,671
I got to see you, so I'll get going.
Have some snacks.

919
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,507
One minute.

920
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,848
Are you discarding it?

921
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,476
I'm not trying to offend you at all.

922
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,687
Why would I be offended?

923
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,564
If Seon-gyeom accepted it,
I have nothing to say.

924
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,900
It came out nicely.

925
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,529
He visited recently
and seemed to be doing well.

926
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,408
Yes. I met with him as well.

927
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,120
He seemed fine on the outside,
but who knows how he is inside?

928
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,871
You two must be bonding more.

929
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:54,627
I'm thinking about acting like a mom
every now and then. Just like today.

930
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,089
YEONCHEON CITY HALL TRACK AND FIELD TEAM

931
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,687
Sit down.

932
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,862
I'll try to prevent you
from paying a penalty, so pick one.

933
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,032
You just need to sign
the contract termination form.

934
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,035
If you've found a new team,
fill in that transfer agreement.

935
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,122
Once you hand it to me,
I just need to sign it.

936
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,832
TRANSFER AGREEMENT

937
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,084
Would anyone accept me?

938
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,546
Hey, do you have to find a team?

939
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:42,633
I know that money is on the line,
but you could train alone.

940
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,514
Why would I continue doing this
if I'm going to do it alone?

941
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,391
Not if you enjoy it.

942
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,353
Was there ever an athlete in this country

943
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,691
who ran just because they liked it
and were good at it?

944
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,818
You should have kept quiet then.

945
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,447
You're good at that.

946
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,409
Should I have?

947
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,538
Had I done that,

948
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,126
I wouldn't have been here today.

949
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,547
Are you threatening me?

950
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,468
I hate to see your talent
go to waste at such a young age.

951
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,930
What does being young mean?
It means you can always start afresh.

952
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,809
But whenever I see you again,
I'll be reminded of my mistake.

953
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,937
Have you ever considered
how tormenting that would be for me?

954
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,982
I'm sorry.

955
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,781
It's all in the past.
You should let it go.

956
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,783
Woo-sik.

957
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,411
Shouldn't you start afresh?

958
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,379
Did you meet with the coach?

959
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,842
Grandma, should I become a civil servant?

960
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,677
Sure.

961
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,347
Or since I'm handsome,
should I become a celebrity?

962
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,807
Sure.

963
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:20,189
You should live a long and healthy life,
okay?

964
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:24,652
I've already lived long enough. It's okay.

965
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,196
You should take care
of your health instead.

967
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,171
<i>Good morning.
What are you up to? Have you eaten?</i>

968
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,425
<i>Come and eat whenever you're hungry.</i>

969
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,684
<i>I will.</i>

970
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:08,946
<i>Seon-gyeom, I've submitted the documents.</i>

971
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,116
<i>He allowed me to terminate the contract
without paying the penalty.</i>

972
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,161
<i>Thank you for hearing me out.</i>

973
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,580
<i>Don't worry about me. Let's meet again.</i>

974
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,653
Woo-sik.

975
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,490
Kim Woo-sik.

976
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,665
-Are you okay?
-Seon-gyeom.

977
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,583
Let's talk next time. Not today.

978
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,254
Kim Woo-sik.

979
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,924
Please. Please don't come near me.

980
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:11,634
I…

981
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,345
I don't want to be swayed.

982
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,223
So don't come.

983
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,236
I had already decided

984
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,489
to quit running.

985
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,994
I was able to see you…

986
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,081
because I stuck with my decision.

987
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,543
That was why…

988
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,547
That was why it was possible.

989
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,180
How does it feel to run again?

990
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,647
It really…

991
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,776
hurts. It's difficult.

992
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,864
I don't think I can do it.

993
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,660
To be honest,

994
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,456
the track isn't the only problem.

995
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,793
There are many issues.

996
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:35,342
I'm not just an injured athlete.

997
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,764
I'm hurting inside as well.

998
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,605
I'm the problem.

999
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,235
For ten years…

1000
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,447
I've dedicated ten years to this.

1001
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,078
What if my record isn't as good as before?

1002
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,083
What should I do then?

1003
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:10,503
What should I do?

1004
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,381
That terrifies me the most.

1005
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,469
I'm scared.

1006
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,433
Why are you saying that here?

1007
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,314
Save it for the track.

1008
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,030
Try it first. If it doesn't work,

1009
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,659
you can give up then.

1010
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:45,955
Woo-sik.

1011
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,542
I'll become that person.

1012
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,837
I'll be the one to help you

1013
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,756
if you put your trust in me.

1014
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,845
But for today,

1015
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,349
let's get you back on your feet.

1016
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:56,150
<i>Why does he keep smiling like that?
He'll be the death of me.</i>

1017
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,861
Do you like me?

1018
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,988
<i>Does that change anything?
It's already over for me.</i>

1019
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:02,281
It's 21km!

1020
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,617
What? You said you wanted to run with me.

1021
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,535
<i>I said I wanted to participate with you.</i>

1022
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,622
You looked great.
It was a heartwarming moment.

1023
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,166
It's adorable. My gosh.

1024
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,127
-<i>Were you thinking about me?</i>
-Do you want to hold hands?

1025
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,213
<i>Why do you keep talking to me
about this stuff?</i>

1026
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,465
Stop already.
It makes me feel like we're really close.

1027
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,382
<i>What's this?</i>

1028
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,717
Try painting, kid.

1029
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,053
Seriously?
Did you take classes to be this arrogant?

1030
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,179
I must be naturally gifted.

1031
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,932
<i>Forget the painting.
I need to watch you paint.</i>

1032
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,227
-Don't disappear.
-I won't.

1033
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,062
<i>I'll be here forever.</i>

1034
