Call out to someone
who can be here for you from now on

00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,574
whenever you're sick or struggling.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,875
Ki Seon-gyeom.

6
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,216
Ki Seon…

7
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,551
Gyeom.

8
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,764
Why is your name so hard to pronounce?

9
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,525
I called your name.

10
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,950
You need to hold my hand.

EPISODE 9

12
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,753
SAMIL PHARMACY

13
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,931
Gosh, I'm a mess.

14
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,809
So this is how he saw me yesterday?

15
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,315
We haven't met in a while.

16
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,220
My goodness.

17
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,310
Don't you think you should at least
look half-decent, Mi-joo?

18
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,110
How beautiful.

19
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,077
We slept really well yesterday
thanks to you.

20
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,955
-We really had a good night's sleep.
-I'm glad.

21
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,836
I wasn't sure about this yesterday,

22
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,213
but I think it's him.

23
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,631
Isn't he Yook Ji-woo's son?

24
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,841
-What if he is?
-Then it'd be cool.

25
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,136
Who cares whose son he is?

26
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,350
He just needs to eat and drive well.
That's all that matters.

27
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,228
-Mi-joo, you're here.
-Hey.

28
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,815
I have to say, it's nice to see you.

29
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,568
You should be.
I'm the closest person to you here.

30
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,445
I'm surprised you said that though.
I'm proud.

31
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,156
Aren't I too old for you to be
proud of me?

32
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,784
Shall we eat breakfast together?

33
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,869
-I'm a morning person.
-Sure.

34
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,211
How do you feel?

35
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,881
You do look a lot better
than you did yesterday.

36
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,593
I probably look prettier than yesterday
since I'm wearing makeup.

37
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,304
You were just as pretty yesterday.

38
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,562
You must love <i>japchae</i>.
You brought a big pile.

39
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,817
I used to love our housekeeper's
<i>japchae </i>when I was young.

40
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,068
I see.

41
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,241
By the way, why did you bring
so many different menus all at once?

42
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,827
Because I don't want to go twice.

43
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,662
Then why didn't you bring any <i>japchae</i>?

44
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,205
Don't you like it?

45
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,374
I got really sick
after eating it as a kid,

46
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,917
and I've never had it since.

47
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,004
You should make sure you're full.
You need to work today.

48
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,136
It turns out I came
without knowing much about the job.

49
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm sorry. We were in a real rush.

50
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,227
Did Hui-jin fill you up on the details?

51
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,231
What if they kidnapped you
and put you on a fishing boat?

52
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,650
I came because you were here.

53
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,239
Were you angry I called?

54
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,325
Not at all.

55
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,535
This time, I didn't miss my chance.

56
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,621
-To do what?
-To treat you well.

57
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,500
Isn't this my chance?

58
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,960
<i>Treat me well, then.</i>

59
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,135
We're currently shooting
an American indie film.

60
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,138
Their goal is to enter
the Sundance Film Festival.

61
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,474
Half of all the staff are Korean.

62
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,019
The director is Korean American
and so are most of the actors.

63
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,523
And if you look over there,
he's James, our main lead.

64
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,858
He's a pretty famous SAG actor.

65
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,112
But you wouldn't know.

66
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,656
Of course not.

67
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,576
Here they come.

68
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,621
So, did you enjoy your meal?

69
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,248
Yes, very much though. Thank you.

70
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,000
He's James, the man I told you about.

71
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,420
James, this is Seon-gyeom,
your boyfriend's personal driver.

72
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,674
Hello. Ki Seon-gyeom.

73
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,093
It's very nice to meet you.

74
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,055
Mi-joo, you're playing
a very dangerous game here.

75
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,723
What?

76
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,810
You're cute. He's hot.

77
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,353
He doesn't like drive stick,
does he?

78
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,232
-You don't have to answer that.
-Okay, see you in a bit.

79
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,361
James might ask for a ride as well.

80
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,238
Should I be careful of anything?

81
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,323
Just make sure
the navigation volume is off.

82
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,410
They wanted a non-English speaking driver
so they could talk comfortably.

83
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,203
So they won't talk to you or anything.

84
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,747
Don't be intimidated
because you don't speak English.

85
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,207
And don't get scared.

86
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,295
But why am I so worried?
It's like you're a little kid.

87
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,047
I'm a grown man. You don't need to worry.

88
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,758
No, you're not. Let's go.

89
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,761
Do I look that childish to you?

90
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,694
Was everything okay?

91
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,906
Everything was wonderful.
He's a excellent driver.

92
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,157
Do you like him?

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,785
We'll prepare for scene 26 first.
Wardrobe and makeup is there

94
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,246
-And, we'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, thank you very much.

95
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,165
-See you. Thank you.
-Let's set-up.

96
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,253
He says you're a great driver.

97
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm not a horrible driver like someone.

98
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,008
-Whatever.
-What do I need to do now?

99
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,844
You need to wait for the actor to finish.

100
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,305
The main job of a driver is to wait.

101
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,556
I'll be off now.

102
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,031
Scene four, take two.

103
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,658
Action.

104
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,183
Seon-gyeom, here you go.

105
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,187
-Are you doing okay?
-Yes.

106
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,401
-Were you about to draw?
-I bought it so I could use it as a diary,

107
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
but I don't know what to write.

108
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,283
People normally write diaries
at the end of the day.

109
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,286
I'm sure there's not much to write
since it's early in the morning.

110
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,831
Then I'll write about
what happened yesterday.

111
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,000
Forget that. Give me your cell phone.

112
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,967
Unlock it for me.

113
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,094
Unlock it.

114
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,182
There are apps where you can watch movies.

115
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,435
I'll be nice and let you use my ID.

116
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,730
Watching a movie is
the best way to kill time. Here.

117
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,524
I'll leave you alone. Go ahead and enjoy.

118
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,234
-You're leaving again?
-Yes.

119
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,279
I came during my break
just in case you might be bored.

120
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,407
I'll come back if I have time again.
Anyway, enjoy.

121
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,181
<i>I came to an unfamiliar place.</i>

122
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,308
<i>Mi-joo was sick.</i>

123
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,360
Thank you.

124
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,947
You had two cups of kiwi juice.
Are you constipated?

125
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,115
Whatever.

126
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,788
You drew this for 50 minutes?

127
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,539
You told me to draw if I didn't get it.

128
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,875
You didn't solve anything else.

129
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,211
You always tell me
to move onto the stuff I know.

130
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,923
Then I'll give you more time.
Try solving what you didn't solve.

131
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,217
-What's with your face?
-What about it? Am I too handsome?

132
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,636
-Are you like this at school?
-Being handsome?

133
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,473
-You must have a lot of schoolwork.
-What happened to your face?

134
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,393
I sparred a couple of days ago.

135
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,229
I sparred with someone
above my weight class.

136
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,982
I don't get why
I'm still a college student.

137
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,610
I'm so busy with exams and assignments.

138
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,570
It'll get a lot worse once you graduate.

139
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,698
I guess not all college students
drink and have fun.

140
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,158
No, not exactly.

141
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,244
Why did I enroll in a film class?

142
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,497
-"What is a synopsis?"
-You went over your head.

143
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,791
Don't ask me. Only the old me would know.

144
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,418
He probably thought he could do anything.

145
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,295
I'll review your synopsis for free.

146
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,047
What was the genre? A thriller?

147
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,007
-I changed it to romance.
-How far are you done?

148
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,637
You're only asking
because you don't want to study.

149
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,973
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

150
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,309
It's pouring cats and dogs.

151
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,104
<i>The male lead, who's being chased,
is walking with an umbrella.</i>

152
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,314
Why is he being chased if it's a romance?

153
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,899
And where did he get the umbrella?

154
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,532
<i>Is he allowed to steal like that?</i>

155
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,284
<i>Listen. Just as he's about to leave,</i>

156
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:29,039
<i>someone suddenly jumps underneath
the umbrella like a scene from a movie.</i>

157
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,544
<i>And I'm guessing she slowly looks up.</i>

158
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,297
<i>How did you know that?</i>

159
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,424
<i>Are you allowed to plagiarize?</i>

160
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,842
<i>It's from</i> Temptation of Wolves.

161
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,553
What?

162
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,555
<i>That story already exists?</i>

163
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,268
Gosh, no wonder it felt really familiar.

164
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,645
I have to start all over again.

165
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,859
You don't know the agony of writing.

166
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,111
You're the one who doesn't know.

167
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,113
Is plagiarism the only thing
you're good at?

168
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,781
Last time, you copied <i>The Wailing</i>.

169
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,826
Gosh, I should be paid
for giving you advice.

170
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
But I'm paying you to teach me.

171
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,622
It's not your money. Break time is over.

172
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,290
I'll give you time to solve it.

173
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,542
Do you really not like anyone?

174
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,173
Just solve the question.

175
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,510
Are you finally going to experience
your first love?

176
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,305
-How would you define "first love"?
-You can't define love.

177
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,932
Then I guess I won't either.

178
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,266
Every girl will be my first.

179
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,853
-What a scumbag.
-What do you want from me?

180
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,897
Exactly.

181
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,107
I mean, what about Ye-jun?

182
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,365
-What about him?
-I thought you guys were dating.

183
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
-Do you still watch that kind of stuff?
-What?

184
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,538
No, I don't.

185
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,541
But you keep looking at guys that way.
Just solve the question.

186
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,297
Next time, we're going to focus on class,
so brace yourself.

187
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,632
No, we won't.

188
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,805
Do you want pocket money?

189
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,643
-You never refuse.
-Thank you.

190
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,189
Tell Mom I'm gone. See you.

191
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,983
Seriously? Only 10,000 won?

192
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,613
Apparently, she's the best fighter
at the gym. Do you think it's a lie?

193
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,199
But it hasn't even been two years
since she started boxing again.

194
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,076
Exactly. It might be a lie.

195
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,829
-Are you heading home?
-Yes, I have to paint.

196
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,205
-What about you?
-Me?

197
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,083
I'm drinking tonight.

198
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,378
I'll kill time at your place before I go.

199
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,797
Go home and kill time there.

200
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,676
That's for when it's dark outside.
Now isn't the time to go home.

201
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,682
Seon-gyeom. Here.

202
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,476
-What are you doing?
-It's so hard to write a diary.

203
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,438
Why is it so hard? It's not homework.

204
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,690
I don't think I'm good at writing.

205
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,943
It's not like you'll show anyone.
It's for yourself.

206
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,742
A diary is something private.
People write it for themselves.

207
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,828
-Who are you trying to impress?
-You're right.

208
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,624
So don't try to make it sound fancy
or eloquent.

209
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,584
Just be honest, okay?

210
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,836
Is that the secret to writing a diary?

211
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,923
It's no secret. It's just basic knowledge.

212
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,842
And I gave you my ID
so you could watch a movie.

213
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,677
But why are you struggling with that?

214
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,597
There were so many,
so I couldn't decide what to watch.

215
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,309
You have a point. Here. Take this.

216
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,437
I'll come back later.

217
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,991
<i>I learned how to write a diary.</i>

218
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>It feels nice.</i>

219
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,623
I LEARNED HOW TO WRITE A DIARY
IT FEELS NICE

220
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,256
<i>I met James and Bruno.</i>

221
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,925
<i>It's hard to talk to them.</i>

222
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,553
<i>I was frustrated.</i>

223
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,185
<i>I came to an unfamiliar place.</i>

224
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,729
<i>Mi-joo was sick.</i>

225
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:39,331
I CAME TO AN UNFAMILIAR PLACE
MI-JOO WAS SICK

226
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,582
<i>I was scared.</i>

227
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,853
What are you painting? Is it for school?

228
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,979
It's for a client.

229
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,278
Ye-jun.

230
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,240
What kind of painting do you think
deserves to be hung in a gallery?

231
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,204
<i>The Last Supper, Mona Lisa,
The Starry Night,</i>

232
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,415
and Munch?

233
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,419
You mean, <i>The Scream of Nature</i>.

234
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,379
Munch is the artist's name.

235
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,424
Maybe she asked me for too much.

236
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,634
You never know

237
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,013
when you might come across
a great opportunity.

238
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,600
But the more I think about it,
the more confused I get.

239
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,853
I don't know what it is I want to paint,

240
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,690
when it will end, and if it ever will.

241
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,984
How do you know when it will end?

242
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,944
-Can you tell?
-When it's almost done.

243
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,738
When is that?

244
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,201
Sometimes, I never get that feeling
no matter how hard I try.

245
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,620
But sometimes, I feel it in just one day.

246
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,039
And then, I make a few changes
here and there.

247
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,833
Why did you meet Ms. Seo?

248
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,128
-You saw us?
-No, I heard it.

249
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,297
Everyone kept saying

250
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,549
they saw you with her
when she came to school.

251
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,011
How do they know her?

252
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,517
Every business student knows
the family members of Seomyung Group.

253
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,520
She's not just the president
of a small agency.

254
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,940
The person you were with
is an executive director at Seomyung.

255
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,316
"An executive director"?

256
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,735
And most of the stuff you eat and use

257
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,946
is made by Seomyung.

258
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,075
Was Ms. Seo your Rapunzel?

259
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,829
Then what does that make you?

260
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,248
Me? Lee Yeong-hwa.

261
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,501
Good to know you're not the prince.

262
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,003
I do look like one though.

263
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,181
I don't know either,

264
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,642
but your painting was dark and unsettling.

265
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,438
I can't stop thinking about that.

266
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,566
Why is it so frustrating?

267
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,824
Hello.

268
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,875
You ran again?

269
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,377
Yes.

270
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,255
I run to live. You know I'm weak.

271
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,965
Is everything okay?

272
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,094
A worker was injured
at a Seomyung Electronics factory.

273
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,387
And to take care of the issue,

274
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,140
Director Seo went
to check on what happened.

275
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,602
Seomyung isn't a small company.

276
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,231
Is he going there to put on a show
because he majored in engineering?

277
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,150
But the thing is…

278
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,736
Just because we're a big firm
doesn't mean we can ignore this.

279
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,697
Where is the factory again?
I'm going to take care of this.

280
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,367
Instead of going to the factory,
he went to the hospital.

281
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,496
Do you think he does that on purpose
to get attention?

282
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,624
Then I guess he's not at the office.

283
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,792
Get to work then.

284
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,143
-Hello?
-<i>Seon-gyeom, where are you?</i>

285
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,521
Me? In front of a fridge.

286
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,690
A fridge, you say?

287
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,985
Sounds refreshing.

288
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,240
Is there no way of correcting
the way you talk?

289
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,868
Forget it.

290
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,079
And where is this fridge?

291
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,135
Ms. Ki gave us her feedback.

292
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,971
She hates all the clothes.

293
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,222
I agreed to send new ones.

294
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,768
Who knew that Eun-bi
was picky with clothes?

295
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,062
Why did you take down Seon-gyeom's photo?

296
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,147
I'm just making room for something else.

297
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,651
When will Eun-bi's photo get here?

298
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,447
Soon.

299
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,244
-Dad.
-Oh, hey.

300
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,580
You're here early.
The game doesn't begin until later.

301
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,833
You're the best daughter ever.

302
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,044
I'd rather not be late
and receive a penalty.

303
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,339
I'm always grateful for
you entertaining my friends.

304
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,342
Who knew you had friends
who needed a golfing buddy in me?

305
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,806
I'm worried about not playing well
due to my stiff wrist today.

306
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,726
If that's the case,
take it easy out on the field.

307
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,896
So how are things between you and Ryan?

308
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,774
You're not to touch him.
He's too fragile for that.

309
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,861
Despite signing with Ms. Seo,

310
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,405
I agreed to all these
golfing events with you.

311
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,367
I stayed true to my word, so you will too.

312
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,787
I think signing with her
was a good choice.

313
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,667
I mean, she might become
your sisters-in-law someday.

314
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,628
Are you seriously going
to marry Seon-gyeom off to her?

315
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,882
-This isn't the Middle Ages.
-Of course.

316
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,176
A minor detail has been bothering me,

317
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,347
but I think it's just a phase.

318
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,350
That being said, it's best
not to ruffle any feathers.

319
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,687
You must be relieved
thinking that it's just a phase.

320
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,941
Anyway, I won't be
going easy on anyone today.

321
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,851
I'm sorry,
but we're in the middle of filming.

322
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,604
-Could you turn off the engine?
-Sure. I'm sorry.

323
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,357
-Thank you.
-Just a second.

324
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,071
Is this man currently here?

325
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,364
He's not answering his phone.

326
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,954
-Are you asking me if I've seen you?
-What?

327
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,624
I mean him. The big-eyed one.

328
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,837
Follow me.

329
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,142
<i>Yeong-il said he'll be here.
Why he decided to though…</i>

330
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,770
-What's that?
-My journal.

331
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,398
Don't look.

332
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,358
Then don't write in it in front of me.

333
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,861
I couldn't care less.

334
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,493
It's my only way of dealing with stress.

335
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,537
Tell Coach for all I care.

336
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,374
Just be careful on that thing.

337
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,211
What are you doing here?

338
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,923
-I hear they're filming a movie.
-I'm part-timing as a driver.

339
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,676
You're working part-time
near the training center?

340
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,180
-Is this a protest or something?
-I only found out

341
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,140
after I got here.

342
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,435
But you still didn't come to see me.

343
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,562
You made me come to you instead.

344
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,106
Are you here to nag?

345
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,901
I'm making use of the occasion.

346
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,279
The sight of you makes my blood boil.

347
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,663
Who's he?

348
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,505
-My friend.
-You have friends?

349
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,299
Goodness.

350
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,135
-Hello.
-Hi.

351
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,180
Who's she?

352
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,016
The translator who accompanied me in Jeju.

353
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,853
You might not recall
since it was over a month ago.

354
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,272
I'm sorry.

355
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,567
I must not remember

356
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,778
-because he made such a mess then.
-Right.

357
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,072
I'm Kwon Yeong-il.

358
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,865
I'm Oh Mi-joo.

359
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,826
-Hey, handsome.
-Handsome. That's you.

360
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,537
He doesn't speak English. What do you need?

361
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,874
I'd like to go back to the hotel
and get some sleep.

362
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,335
-Okay, I'll tell him to take you back.
-Thank you.

363
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,879
He wants to get some sleep at the hotel.

364
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,298
-I'll get going.
-Sure.

365
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,846
See you.

366
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,146
I doubt it'll take too long.

367
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,107
Right.

368
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,068
-Thank you for this.
-Sure.

369
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,532
So what's your relationship
with Seon-gyeom?

370
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,576
I'm not sure.

371
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,371
I don't know what we are either.

372
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,749
The job in Jeju ended a month ago.

373
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,963
You've stuck around for over a month
when he's Mr. One Month.

374
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,923
"Mr. One Month"?

375
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,550
I mean, Seon-gyeom.

376
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:38,722
Most girls don't last a month
chasing him around because he's boring.

377
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,978
Do you always keep track
of who lasts a month and such?

378
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,983
Why do people say he's a bore though?
I find him funny.

379
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,985
Frankly speaking,

380
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,448
Seon-gyeom must have felt the same way
towards the girls around him

381
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,158
who left after a month.

382
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,206
Mi-joo. I'm sorry,
but can you go to the convenience store?

383
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,167
-We're out of coffee.
-Sure thing.

384
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,836
I--

385
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,380
You may go.
Seon-gyeom will be back soon anyway.

386
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,382
-I'll get going then.
-Sure.

387
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,134
Coming!

388
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,232
"Mr. One Month"?

389
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,615
Is this a promising industry?

390
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,367
Would it be?

391
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,494
You were in great shape

392
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,371
and practiced hard for the race.

393
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,166
Just come back to being an athlete.

394
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,336
It must seem easy
since it's not your business.

395
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,715
Without you, I'm all alone.

396
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,885
Then you'll keep winning first place.

397
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,262
Maybe it was your presence
that motivated me.

398
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,350
You constantly winning first place
is how I always came in second.

399
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,190
If you constantly won
and were the record-holder,

400
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,942
would track have been more popular?

401
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,031
Being handsome and all.

402
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,996
-You?
-Annoying jerk.

403
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,957
Did you really have to ask that?

404
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,875
I mean, you.

405
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,046
How's your personal record?

406
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,299
Don't ask.

407
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,718
-So it's the same.
-It's not.

408
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,180
Now that you and Woo-sik are gone,

409
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,765
I'm racing against myself.

410
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,934
The hardest one to beat is…

411
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,893
As if you'd know.

412
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,563
Guys,

413
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,898
you're too far apart.

414
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,735
Come closer.

415
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,695
You come closer.

416
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,947
No, you.

417
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,159
Yeong-il, I think it'll be better
for you to move.

418
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,036
Why are you taking his side?

419
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,872
The table behind you ruins the photo.

420
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,208
Come on.

421
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,548
-Are we good?
-Sure. Here we go.

422
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,801
One, two, three!

423
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,724
For years, I was clueless
about what was going on.

424
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,102
He was smiling all the time,

425
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,063
so I figured he was happy.

426
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,650
I wonder how his recovery is coming along.

427
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,237
It has to go well,

428
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,491
so that he can run again
and stick it to everyone.

429
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,874
What?

430
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,959
I'm surprised.

431
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,171
I've never known you to talk like that.

432
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,881
I've always wanted to.

433
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,595
I'd like to tell him
that I'd handle all obstacles

434
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,807
so that he can be free to just run.

435
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,477
Do you remember Seong-geun?

436
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,647
He runs an academy in Noryangjin.

437
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,482
I don't recall.

438
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,735
-What about me?
-Well, you're right here.

439
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,866
He retired at the age of 37

440
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,452
due to Achilles tendinitis.

441
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,746
Unless it's that serious,

442
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,792
Woo-sik will still have a chance to run.

443
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,920
Right.

444
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,185
You just took what I put in the schedule.

445
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,855
Look, I have certain guarantees when
it came to this schedule.

446
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,231
You don't get just to change them.

447
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,400
I can change whatever I want.
I'm the cinematographer!

448
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,610
I don't care who you are.
That's not how this works.

449
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,821
-That's exactly how it works.
-Fine!

450
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,282
-Garrison!
-James.

451
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,658
What's the problem?

452
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,869
Are you sure you can guarantee this?

453
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,787
-About your upcoming schedule.
-Yes.

454
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,324
-Please...
-No! There is no guarantee.

455
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:17,081
-What are you talking about?
-Wait!

456
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,043
I'm trying to translate. Let me finish.

457
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,670
He already signed the contract,

458
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,256
so what's this about
wanting a new "guarantee"?

459
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,008
The funding hasn't even been finalized.

460
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,593
-There is no guarantee.
-That's--

461
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,595
-No guarantee?
-No.

462
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,721
-I'm out.
-James!

463
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,931
Why is James changing his mind?

464
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,391
Are you kidding me?

465
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,561
The "guarantee" he mentioned
was about the duration of this project.

466
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,605
It had nothing to do with his payment.

467
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,523
The "guarantee" you mentioned
is broken English.

468
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,859
It's not a term you can
just throw about like that.

469
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,028
Broken English?
Are you trying to belittle me?

470
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,573
No, that's hardly the case.
I'm saying you should use words correctly.

471
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,285
You still should've taken my side though.
You're Korean, aren't you?

472
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,747
Why does that matter
when we're trying to be professionals?

473
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,873
James!

474
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,128
James. Please listen to me.

475
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,131
I know you're upset,
but this is all a misunderstanding.

476
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,299
Please.

477
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,343
James?

478
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,303
What's going on?

479
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,722
James is very upset.

480
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,432
Don't be offended if he snaps.

481
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,644
I wouldn't even know
if he's snapping at me anyway.

482
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,647
I'm glad you can't speak English.

483
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,774
Please take good care of him.

484
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,150
Drop him off at the hotel

485
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,736
and Hui-jin will take it from there.

486
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,743
You too.

487
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,038
Don't worry too much.

488
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,540
Sure.

489
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,218
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

490
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,262
Mi-joo, we're in big trouble!

491
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,307
James wasn't answering,
so I went up to check on him,

492
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,809
but he already checked out.

493
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,769
I think he left with his boyfriend.

494
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,145
-What?
-Hold on.

495
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,943
Wipe that look off your face.
I'm the one who wants to cry.

496
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,737
I should applaud your solid acting.

497
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,280
He's not at the train station.

498
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,534
-We've yet to locate him. I'm sorry.
-What?

499
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,202
Didn't you tell him
about today's schedule?

500
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:20,123
I made today's filming schedule clear

501
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,833
but James must not have been pleased.

502
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,835
Jesus Christ.

503
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,129
But the director will be here soon!

504
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,964
Give me my phone.

505
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,886
Higher-ups will be visiting the set today.
Some day they chose.

506
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,225
What do you mean you can't find James?

507
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,519
What did you do to him?
Who's responsible?

508
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,938
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

509
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,035
Why on earth weren't you reachable?

510
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,078
James?

511
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,080
I thought I was to
drive quickly to the set,

512
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,665
so I was too busy to check my phone.

513
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,127
He must have forgotten he asked for
a non-English speaking driver.

514
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,047
You're here, and that's all that matters.

515
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,339
James!

516
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,134
What are we doing back here?

517
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,011
I told you to take us to the station.

518
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,013
Okay.

519
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,726
You know, this film
maybe just a way for you to make a living,

520
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,936
but this is an incredibly important work
we're doing here.

521
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,563
Especially for Korean immigrants.

522
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,690
Is this how you do things around here?

523
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,194
Are you so narrow-minded
because of how your tiny country is?

524
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,030
You've got to be kidding me.

525
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,283
What? Are you not going to translate?

526
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,664
Just because they can't speak English,

527
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,501
doesn't mean
you can say whatever you want.

528
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,544
And anyway, aren't you the one

529
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,589
who forced us to keep shooting
without the actor's approval?

530
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,466
None of us violated the contract.

531
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,926
-You did.
-Fuck.

532
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,427
-What?
-Oops.

533
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,847
Did you hear that?
Do you want me to say it louder?

534
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,932
Fuck you.

535
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,476
Fuck you too, you punk.

536
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,686
-Hey, fuck you.
-What?

537
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,022
Don't you think you're out of line?

538
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,899
This bastard started swearing at me.

539
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,943
Hey, fuck you!

540
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,611
You're also out of line.

541
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,029
She's very good.

542
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,698
Ms. Oh! Are you crazy?

543
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,326
He cursed at me first. You saw him.

544
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,454
How is "fuck" a curse word?
It's only an exclamation.

545
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,832
People use it to express their emotions.

546
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,210
"Gosh, I'm so upset, fuck." Like that.

547
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,920
-Apologize to him.
-What?

548
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,963
Apologize.

549
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,881
-I'm sorry.
-What's she saying?

550
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,925
-I'm really sorry about this situation.
-The mayor's here!

551
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,222
Goodness, you're here.

552
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,182
What's with the commotion?

553
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,476
We were only rehearsing
for the next scene.

554
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,020
Even rehearsals should be kept real.

555
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,356
I must be interrupting
your rehearsal then.

556
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,482
Hardly.

557
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,402
Goodness. Assemblyman Ki, hello.

558
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,780
I'm Julie Yeom,
the chief producer of this movie.

559
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,533
-I'm Ki Jeong-do.
-It's a pleasure.

560
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,077
Sorry for the intrusion!

561
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,705
Could anyone translate for me?

562
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,832
Don't you worry, sir. I'm here for you.

563
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,542
Please meet our cinematographer.

564
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,211
It's been a while Ms. Translator.

565
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,927
I'd like to meet the staff,

566
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,096
so can you translate?

567
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,311
Sure.

568
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:34,233
I heard you're waiting for the city
to approve the additional funding.

569
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,403
Without that support,

570
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,156
the production company
will have to cover all costs.

571
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,742
Yes, that's what I heard.

572
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,290
I'll push for the additional funding
to be approved.

573
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,209
You will?

574
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,295
You might be a passing moment
in my son's life,

575
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,422
but I should still value
your companionship.

576
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,091
"A passing moment"?

577
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,677
I apologize for what happened
at the cinema.

578
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,804
I hope I didn't upset you too much.

579
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,432
I'm good.

580
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,186
What have you been up to?

581
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,064
Are you following your mom's footsteps?

582
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,607
I'm here as a driver.

583
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,652
Out of all the jobs
required on a movie set?

584
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,404
All you can do is drive people around?

585
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,324
-Say that again.
-Please just leave.

586
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,457
Fine, I will. I'll see you in Seoul, son.

587
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,134
Now I feel like I owe him, which I hate.

588
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,597
I just can't tell what he's up to.

589
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,684
I doubt he has an ulterior motive.

590
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,185
He's here to do his job.

591
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,730
Ms. Oh, we need to talk.

592
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,899
I guess it's time.

593
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,444
I'm off to get an earful.

594
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,743
I'm sorry.

595
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,541
I have a lot to say,
but I'll cut it short.

596
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,334
Pack up and disappear.

597
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,755
This isn't coming from me.

598
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,717
The cinematographer
wants you out of his sight.

599
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,802
Then who will translate--

600
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,221
There are many others who can take over.

601
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,974
Don't act like you're irreplaceable.

602
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,270
Your gig ends tomorrow anyway,
so just get lost a day earlier.

603
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,858
Message delivered.

604
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,498
Are you all right?

605
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,626
How am I supposed to translate "Fuck you"?

606
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,004
I've translated it dozens of times,

607
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,506
but it's still nothing but a curse word.

608
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,591
It is.

609
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,386
Something urgent came up at the office
and I need to head back today.

610
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,222
I'm sorry for leaving you here alone.

611
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,933
It all ends tomorrow anyway.

612
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,603
You should go.
How will you get to the station though?

613
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,148
You may not know this,
but there's something called a taxi.

614
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,734
Right, of course. You should get going.

615
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,736
I'll see you back at home.

616
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,556
I must be crazy.

617
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,321
What are you doing?

618
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,657
Nothing.

619
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,244
I'm just next to you.

620
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,330
Right.

621
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,465
Just let me drink myself to death.

622
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,134
You don't want me to?

623
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,218
No.

624
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,639
What?

625
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,767
You brought glasses?

626
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,061
Here.

627
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,563
Gosh.

628
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,991
What is that?

629
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,326
Is this semi-dried herring?

630
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,703
You need to eat too.

631
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,371
Thanks.

632
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,415
You can eat this, right?

633
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,084
Of course. I can never get enough of it.

634
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,170
I'm glad.

635
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,631
Gosh.

636
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,304
Thank you for driving around today.

637
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,726
You're even taking care of a drunk
like me. Thank you.

638
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,524
You came here without knowing anything,
but you've been doing so well.

639
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,151
You even moved us to a hotel.

640
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,320
Everyone's so grateful.

641
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,490
You'll be included in the credits
as a driver.

642
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,658
Your name's not easy to spell,

643
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,286
so I should tell them to double-check.

644
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,249
Will you be included as well?

645
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,046
Then we'll both be included.

646
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,798
I like that.

647
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,012
Once you see the credits,

648
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,434
you'll realize why you put up
with so much.

649
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,812
Names of others who were in the same boat
will show up as well.

650
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,565
You'll know how exhausting
and strenuous it was.

651
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,819
It must've been difficult

652
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,573
to relay all sorts of messages.

653
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:22,122
I'm always careful about the messages
I relay.

654
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,708
But others are so lucky.

655
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:29,046
They secure us our funding, act racist,

656
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,006
and even fire people with just one word.

657
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,595
How did you know you had to bring
James back?

658
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,056
It looked like he was bailing,
so I just brought him back.

659
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,683
I thought you didn't speak English.

660
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,518
I never said that.

661
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,480
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

662
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,530
Should I just go back to Seoul today?

663
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,241
-Should I just get lost?
-Yes.

664
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,910
-You want me to get lost?
-Yes.

665
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,039
Don't do anything you don't want to do.

666
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,421
I thought I'd be the one
to say this for once.

667
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,390
But…

668
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,729
why do I suddenly feel like
I could do anything?

669
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,483
That's usually not the case,

670
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,446
but I feel like I can this time.

671
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,830
You really do have
a positive influence on people.

672
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,457
You do for me.

673
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,127
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thanks.

674
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,211
Okay.

675
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,391
What is this?

676
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,101
A snack.

677
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,162
Is it good?

678
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,132
Garrison, I'm sorry
about what happened yesterday.

679
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,593
Just let me finish my work and go.

680
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,261
And, today is my last day anyway.

681
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,013
Whatever.

682
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,684
Sure, just ignore me.

683
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,186
I'll just do my job regardless.

684
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,739
Hey.

685
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,283
Thank you.

686
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,370
Why are you out of it?

687
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,997
Everyone here is out of it.

688
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,583
But you were especially out of it.

689
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,504
-Have you finished your modern art report?
-I submitted it last time.

690
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,714
No, the final one.

691
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,593
I see that you haven't.

692
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,345
Why did you even have that
as your status message then?

693
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,180
I'm done for.

694
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,932
Why do humans live?

695
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,892
Is it okay for us to exist?

696
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,562
Maybe it's because I drew two

697
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,355
when I can barely finish one.

698
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,023
Why am I so full of myself?

699
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,025
Those all-nighters have made you insane.

700
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,485
Did you ever have someone

701
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,114
find something
that you hid in your painting?

702
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,992
A prep school teacher once found out
that I had made mistakes

703
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,577
and tried to cover them up.

704
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,871
She caught me countless times.

705
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,205
What did you do?

706
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,915
I did what she told me to do.

707
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,917
There was nothing else I could do.

708
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,336
I see.

709
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,881
This was my first time.

710
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,476
Everyone,
leave your equipment here.

711
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,269
We'll take an hour long break.

712
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,271
Be back here by 4 p.m., okay?

713
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,606
Mi-joo!

714
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,982
-Rest for an hour.
-Mi-joo!

715
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,192
Come back by 4 p.m.

716
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,194
Mi-joo!

717
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,905
Why are you leaving
without saying goodbye?

718
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,741
You looked so busy,
so I was going to leave quietly.

719
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,659
That hurts my feelings.

720
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,495
We're going to end early today,

721
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,914
so have some snow crabs
and visit the ocean.

722
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,667
I will. I'm going to sightsee too.
I'll be the one to wait today.

723
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,669
Thank you for everything.

724
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,297
We even managed to secure the funding.

725
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,674
Come to the after-party.
Let's have some meat.

726
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,051
Of course.

727
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,226
You were an outstanding comrade.

728
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,770
Good luck with the filming back in Seoul.

729
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,855
Thank you for this fun opportunity.

730
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,315
Don't mention it.

731
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,983
I'll see you back in Seoul.

732
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,277
Bye. See you.

733
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,780
Cheer up.

734
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,157
Hurry and go.

735
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,152
-You're done already?
-Yes.

736
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,946
How did you know I'd be here?

737
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,992
The female staff members talked
about how you were always running here.

738
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,952
At times, they couldn't find you here.

739
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,203
You're quite popular.

740
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,498
Even Yeong-il came all the way here
to see you.

741
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,750
He must like you a lot.

742
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,168
I probably like him more.

743
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,006
I used to follow him around
when I was an athlete.

744
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,552
What? Hold on. What you just said
could cause a big misunderstanding.

745
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,804
-You followed him around?
-Yes.

746
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,765
He was the sole runner
I couldn't catch up to.

747
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,977
Oh, as a runner. You're talking
about the running record, right?

748
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,228
You startled me.

749
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,938
Do you want to know something?

750
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,317
The lanes we run on are chosen by a draw.

751
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,527
That only happens for the top runners.

752
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:29,197
But Yeong-il always got the same lane.

753
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,450
Even God helped him come first place.

754
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,993
You're lying.

755
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,245
I'm not. The lanes are picked randomly.

756
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,664
It was always so random for me,

757
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,542
but he was always the top runner
in the same lane.

758
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,087
I thought that was fascinating.
Didn't you?

759
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,425
I'm more fascinated by this moment.

760
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,224
I've made a wise decision to wait for you.

761
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,069
The ocean looks so beautiful.

762
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,062
Should we meet at the parking lot
after you finish packing?

763
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,480
One minute.

764
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,649
Wait here for a moment.

765
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,240
Here. Take it.

766
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,911
Those shoes are made for people
with high arches.

767
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,539
It'll be easier for you to run.

768
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,041
That is, if you're still going to.

769
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,962
But why are you suddenly giving me a gift?

770
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,423
For letting me stay with you.

771
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,924
What?

772
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,844
I've already moved all my stuff.

773
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,971
I've cleaned the house
and done the laundry.

774
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,973
You can just go in and rest.

775
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,976
That wasn't what I meant.

776
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,354
Why are you telling me that now?

777
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,773
We've been together for days.

778
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,401
I actually thought it was the right time
to say this.

779
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,737
I was going to tell you
after your work was done.

780
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,282
It's just too perfect of a timing
that I have nothing to say.

781
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,744
Whenever I feel closer to you,

782
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,164
it feels as though you push me right back.

783
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,756
You didn't seem to like it
when I said you put up walls,

784
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,799
so I'm rewording it.

785
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,968
I'm not upset, so don't take it
the wrong way.

786
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,180
But I told you
that I don't put up any walls.

787
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:02,517
Then why do I feel like I'm outside
an invisible wall right now?

788
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:08,315
I don't want you to be outside those walls
that I didn't even put up.

789
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,400
Likewise.

790
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,336
If I've become too boring,

791
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,838
then tell me so.

792
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,925
It's just that when I'm with you,

793
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,595
I feel left out

794
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,599
during the most important moments.

795
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,686
And that feeling doesn't happen
on its own.

796
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,985
I hate this.

797
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,429
I don't mean that I hate you.

798
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,602
I just sounded too pathetic and hated it.

799
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,110
So don't hate me for it.

800
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,529
I don't.

801
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,077
I've been doing that thing

802
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,580
you asked me to.

803
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,959
You asked me to like you.

804
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,213
Can you…

805
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,633
like me?

806
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,929
Oh, that…

807
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,312
I wasn't asking you for a favor.
I was mustering up my courage.

808
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,195
I don't think we should leave together.

809
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,740
I'm afraid I might say something
I shouldn't.

810
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,726
Hey, Woo-sik.

811
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,895
<i>Seon-gyeom, have you been well?</i>

812
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,272
<i>Are you driving right now?</i>

813
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,857
Yes.

814
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,651
How have you been?

815
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,861
<i>I've just been missing you.</i>

816
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,281
Should we meet tomorrow?

817
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,326
<i>I have cleaning to do with my grandma.</i>

818
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,121
Tell her to rest at home. I'll go instead.

819
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,956
<i>Yes, I'll do that.</i>

820
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,417
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

821
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,678
Woo-sik.

822
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,888
<i>Yes, Seon-gyeom?</i>

823
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,641
-I'm sorry.
<i>-Sorry?</i>

824
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,269
That you had to muster up the courage.

825
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,564
<i>Don't say that.</i>

826
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,524
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

827
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,325
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

828
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,921
So this was why I felt suffocated.

829
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,968
I was pining for her.

830
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,222
I've missed you too.

831
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,475
Guess how much I missed you.

832
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,773
Despite giving you so much time,

833
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,109
you haven't updated me
on the progress of my painting.

834
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,071
Right. It was because of the painting.

835
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,031
I see.

836
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,242
You should hurry since I've agreed
to display your painting

837
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,452
at the art museum.

838
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,372
I'm juggling exams, assignments,
and your painting right now.

839
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,665
I want to excel at all of them.

840
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,418
You're blaming the delay
on your schoolwork?

841
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,546
Then you shouldn't have been a student.

842
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,757
I'm exhausted right now,
so let's talk again.

843
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,925
What did you say?

844
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,345
I'm exhausted.

845
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,180
You're exhausted, so what?

846
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,099
Do you want me to buy you ginseng?

847
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,059
You have garbage empathic skills.

848
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,227
Garbage?

849
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,108
Am I at least recyclable? That matters.

850
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,819
You must really love the Earth.

851
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,780
This is where I live.
I should take good care of it.

852
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,365
Do you support polar bears too?

853
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,535
Yes, I do. Dolphins as well.
You should too.

854
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,913
You're cute.

855
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,874
Goodbye.

856
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,334
What are you doing?

857
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,753
What did you just say?

858
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,132
I need to go back to school.

859
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,758
No, what did you just say?

860
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,803
I don't think you gave me a single answer.

861
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,805
You don't make me want to.

862
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,558
Hey, kid. Hey.

863
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,085
What a rude asshole.

864
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,298
You have no manners, do you?

865
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,183
What was that?

866
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,081
Mr. Jeong, it's me.

867
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,967
It's such a hassle to get some drinks,
don't you think so?

868
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,429
Maybe you should quit drinking
or just move out.

869
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,307
Don't be absurd.
I need to get on the chairman's good side

870
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,683
to get as much as I can from him.

871
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,604
Am I cute?

872
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,736
Why aren't you answering?

873
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,322
The same bar as usual?

874
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,823
Why aren't you…

875
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,952
Why are you doing this to me?

876
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,537
I've always been this way.

877
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:20,098
TOGETHER WITH ATOZ

878
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,182
Are you feeling down?

879
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,309
Yes. Why do you ask?

880
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,979
Because you look nice,
but you're not taking any photos.

881
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,357
I don't like my face.

882
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,609
I do.

883
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,737
I don't like your face either.

884
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,950
What the hell?

885
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:42,453
Gosh, he made a post
throwing shade at me again.

886
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,163
What? Let me see.

887
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,712
YUCK, ARE THEY RHYMERS
OR STRIPPING MALES?

888
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,506
This stupid, passion-fruit-looking punk!

889
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,091
Is he still on your back?

890
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,510
He criticized our entire group this time.

891
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,846
Why is he so diligent?

892
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,515
Is it a crime for an underground rapper
to join a boyband?

893
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,267
He's been at it for years!

894
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,352
Get out of there, asshole!

895
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,230
Watch your language.

896
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,857
Don't respond. Just ignore him.

897
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,443
They're currently discussing your debut,

898
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,236
so keep it on the down low.

899
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,322
A debut? He can rap
since he's the main rapper,

900
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,656
but what about me?

901
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,409
-You can look pretty.
-I already am.

902
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,912
Then look pretty
and chop some green onions today.

903
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,208
Okay, I'll begin the live broadcast.

904
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,587
ENJOY THIS MOMENT WITH ATOZ

905
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,713
Go!

906
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,714
Two, three.

907
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,883
-Hello, Alphabet!
-Hello, Alphabet!

908
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,111
Woo-sik, your window is squeaky clean.

909
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,613
Why can't I do it?

910
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,741
Gosh, let me see that.

911
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,743
Here.

912
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:08,456
Wipe in one direction
to avoid leaving any smears.

913
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,710
So you developed your back muscles
for this.

914
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,504
-It's worthwhile.
-And my deltoids too.

915
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,423
I'm cleaning a studio tomorrow,
so it'll be easier.

916
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,092
What bad timing.

917
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,636
I tend to be bad with timing.

918
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,681
-You're working tomorrow too?
-Yes.

919
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,683
I help out quite often these days.

920
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:31,854
I want to get lessons.
I can't seem to practice on my own.

921
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,318
<i>What have you been up to?</i>

922
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,238
Up until recently, I was a driver.

923
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,157
Is that why you were in the countryside?

924
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,786
I heard from Yeong-il that you two met.

925
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,414
Do you guys keep in touch?

926
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,041
He calls me every now and then.

927
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:57,296
Thank you so much for allowing me

928
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,173
to stay at the hotel.

929
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,217
Where have you been staying?

930
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,265
I lived with Ms. Oh for a while.

931
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,228
What? You two moved in
before getting married?

932
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,564
-Did you propose already?
-"Propose"?

933
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,067
Seon-gyeom.
Fate must have brought us together.

934
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,277
Will you marry me?

935
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,447
No, someone else proposed to me.

936
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,993
Seon-gyeom! Why do you have
so many women around you?

937
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,411
Did you end it with Choi Tae-ri?

938
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,205
That was ages ago.

939
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,625
How are you feeling?

940
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,836
I feel carefree.

941
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,796
I spoke my mind.

942
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,883
I wonder why I was so frightened
back then.

943
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,261
I think I'm finding myself.

944
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,181
I tend to be happy-go-lucky.

945
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,891
Very much so.

946
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,645
No matter what sports I play,

947
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,732
people will always see me
as a whistleblower.

948
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,151
Then I'll wonder if I should choose
a different path

949
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,486
where I wouldn't be shunned.

950
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,239
I think my grandma would be happier
if I became a civil servant.

951
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,619
I'd like you to think more about yourself.

952
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:14,957
You seem to think more about others
than yourself

953
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,919
when they're of no help to you.

954
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,338
Is that what you did?

955
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,426
Of course, I want to continue
playing sports.

956
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,053
But…

957
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,847
I don't think I should.

958
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,099
I thought you were finding yourself.

959
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,228
Look further. And put yourself first.

960
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,319
I'll try that.

961
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:51,661
When it comes to my own issues,
I have trouble being objective too.

962
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,288
But let's talk about it together.

963
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,165
Two is better than one, don't you think?

964
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,210
Do you truly think so?

965
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,503
You don't like me, do you?

966
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,675
No.

967
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,177
Don't drink this.

968
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,180
These are mine. Don't eat this either.

969
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,812
CHILAN MOUNTAIN BEEKEEPING

970
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,606
That's right.

971
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,109
Food isn't to blame.

972
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,237
This honey did nothing wrong.

973
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,411
I know it isn't to blame,

974
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,329
but should I just get rid of it?

975
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,539
Ms. Seo.

976
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,418
I'm sorry.

977
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,462
I've found out where Director Seo
is hospitalized.

978
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,381
What took you so long to find that out?

979
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,091
Was it that top secret?

980
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,679
Did he lose his legs or something?

981
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,972
Is that why?

982
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,684
It was top secret
because his legs were just fine.

983
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,228
He knew how you'd react if you found out.

984
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,355
How did he know something I didn't know?

985
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,361
We sure love each other greatly.

986
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,041
I heard you got hurt.

987
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,419
Did you tell her that I was here?

988
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,004
Come closer.

989
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,965
-I said it was top secret.
-There you go, blaming others again.

990
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,718
Aren't you happy to see me here
despite my busy schedule?

991
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:34,388
How could I be when you entered
with a smile on your face?

992
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,519
I guess your legs weren't broken
after all.

993
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,939
Go find a new painting
if you have so much time.

994
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,067
Last time, you sounded like
you'd do that immediately,

995
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,318
but mine's still there.

996
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,446
Oh, that's what you're talking about?

997
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,156
I forgot about it since it was so trivial.

998
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,115
Forgot, my ass.

999
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,202
If you can't do it,
just admit that I have an eye for art.

1000
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,453
It's about time

1001
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,916
you grew up, Dan-ah.

1002
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,295
Right. Here's your gift.

1003
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,965
Get this away from me!

1004
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,424
Flowers…

1005
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,346
Why did you tell her where I was?
I told you it was top secret.

1006
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,722
You idiot!

1007
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,599
Throw that away!

1008
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,348
Why does he have to open his mouth
and make a clown of himself?

1009
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,861
Ms. Seo.

1010
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,534
What did you do to have everyone
on campus know who you are?

1011
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,539
I roughly told them how you looked,
and they told me you'd be here.

1012
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,874
How kind of them.

1013
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,917
I see.

1014
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,336
Why do I always have to look for you?

1015
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,671
What?

1016
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,217
You should've called. You have a phone.

1017
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,928
I was too upset to remember
that I had saved your number.

1018
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,473
Is this my painting?

1019
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,479
It must be that assignment of yours.

1020
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:47,938
Give me mine right now.

1021
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,440
I'm not a vending machine.

1022
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:50,524
Why not?

1023
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,570
You had plenty of chances to be an artist.

1024
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,739
I was humiliated by that bastard

1025
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,783
because you didn't give me
my painting on time.

1026
01:07:58,866 --> 01:07:59,909
"That bastard"?

1027
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,080
-Which bastard?
-The one I was going to

1028
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,539
humiliate with your painting.

1029
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,210
Were you going to

1030
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,421
use my painting to save face?

1031
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,509
Why? Can't I?

1032
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,761
We'll both be achieving our goals.

1033
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,892
I must have expected better from you,
seeing how disappointed I am.

1034
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,018
You do that.

1035
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,105
I don't care what you do.
I just want the painting.

1036
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,565
-Behind every painting is a painter.
-You're in front of it.

1037
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,744
You can just forget about all this
if you're going to keep this up.

1038
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,080
I have many other vending machines.

1039
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,340
Why do you make me say this?

1040
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,716
What did you expect?

1041
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,844
For me to wait endlessly for the painting?

1042
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,929
You must think it's your time
that you're wasting,

1043
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,556
but it's actually mine.

1044
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,516
And you're what? "Disappointed"?

1045
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,243
What was that?

1046
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,037
It's all on you.

1047
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,257
That was my painting.

1048
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,092
-I'm the painter.
-I know that.

1049
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,218
No, you don't.

1050
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,809
It's mine.

1051
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,355
Until the moment I hand it over to you,

1052
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:56,984
it's mine.

1053
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,948
<i>Should I just go and tell him how I feel?</i>

1054
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,241
<i>We'll go steady as of today.</i>

1055
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,034
I don't think I can.

1056
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,037
I didn't take Mi-joo to be such a wuss.

1057
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,957
Tell him how you feel.
How else can you move forward?

1058
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,709
<i>-Is something up between the two of you?
-It's mostly me.</i>

1059
01:10:55,793 --> 01:11:00,506
<i>I don't know how to share
or what to give to people.</i>

1060
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,259
-But what's that?
-I thought you would know.

1061
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,885
-What do you mean?
-Because you're a peasant like him.

1062
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,220
Get out.

1063
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,138
Did you move to our neighborhood?

1064
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,807
<i>You really are full of surprises.</i>

1065
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,518
Has Ms. Seo ever
walked all over you before?

1066
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,644
<i>I'm going to spoil you.</i>

1067
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:16,105
-Are we going to speak casually now?
-Should we?

1068
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,564
-No.
-Okay.

1069
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:21,110
I wasn't sure if you had feelings for me
Because I do.

1070
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,028
<i>Please don't hate me.</i>

1071
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:27,280
