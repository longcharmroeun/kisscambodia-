1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,805
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,724
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,730
Is it really over for you?

4
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,401
You said it was.

5
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,529
-Says who?
-I can choose to do as I please.

6
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,534
Don't end it.

7
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,172
Are you a kid?

8
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,382
Why are you being so childish?

9
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,596
Have I grown on you or something?

10
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,597
I guess so.

11
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,228
I guess you were

12
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,148
behind the painting after all.

13
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,206
What the hell? Are you crying?

14
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,959
Why…

15
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,884
You told me to stop.

16
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,889
I was told to stop thinking about you

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,142
and expecting anything from you.

18
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,562
So why are you now doing this to me?

19
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,649
If cooperating is tough,
at least leave me be.

20
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,946
Who are you to now say
that I should stop moving on?

21
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,909
You're not drawn to me,
but my choice to not like you anymore.

22
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,914
Is that how it goes?

23
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,499
You're seriously agreeing to that?

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,212
Your claim seemed too logical
to argue against.

25
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,296
Of course.

26
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,882
This is exactly who you are.

27
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,468
This was wrong right from the start.

28
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,929
You had your man-servant drag me here.

29
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,180
Drag you?

30
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,475
You locked me up, tortured me,
told me not to smile, but then to smile.

31
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,268
Does that door even open?

32
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,437
Is Mr. Jeong guarding the door?

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,856
I'm the lunatic
for taking this long to be scared.

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,359
Even at this moment, you terrify me.

35
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,861
-You're going crazy.
-I've long been crazy thanks to someone.

36
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,405
Are you blaming me for your weak heart?

37
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,119
The door isn't locked nor is it guarded.

38
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,541
Goodbye.

39
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,293
You can't just leave like this.

40
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,378
Let go.

41
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,969
-Hey kid, wait.
-Stop messing with my feelings!

42
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,306
Do you really want to see me go crazy?

43
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,600
No.

44
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,937
Then why be like this
after saying it's over?

45
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,939
I now want you again.

46
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,363
So--

47
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,407
Okay, fine.

48
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,575
Then,

49
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,495
let me at least take you home.
Will that be okay?

50
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,290
You're in no shape to get home alone.

51
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,422
Have you eaten? Aren't you hungry?

52
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,009
EPISODE 12

53
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,302
Please enjoy.

54
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,720
Thanks.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,648
Aren't you having any?

56
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,859
Me?

57
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,236
No, I'm good. Please dig in.

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,906
-Can I have the other stick?
-The stick?

59
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,911
You mean the drumstick?

60
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,955
Sure, go ahead. Help yourself.

61
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,215
Just so you know, I'm buying this,

62
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,178
so it's time you answered me.

63
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,888
Answer what?

64
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,766
Will you end it or--

65
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,768
Even animals are allowed to eat in peace.

66
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,482
Okay, fine. Dig in.
Have the wings as well.

67
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,942
I don't like wings.

68
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,658
Can we order more drumsticks?

69
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,455
Thank you for the chicken.

70
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,582
Don't you dare walk away.

71
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,335
I won't be able to sleep
if you leave like this.

72
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,586
Good.

73
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,259
Damn, he walks fast.

74
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,763
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

75
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,890
Mr. Jeong easily found out where I lived.

76
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,642
Man, that was the scariest.

77
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,852
Is it because Mr. Jeong looks scary?

78
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,105
What's scary is how
he tracked down my address.

79
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,273
I won't send him to you again then.

80
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,526
Who's to say you won't kidnap me
and lock me up?

81
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,819
You can drive. How's that?

82
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,530
-My license is just for show.
-Then why get it?

83
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,494
Let's grab a cab then.

84
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,248
I want to go for a drive.

85
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,249
Sure.

86
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,419
-What?
-Don't you want to?

87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,503
Bye.

88
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,256
Fine. We'll go for a drive.

89
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,967
Isn't that why you brought your car?

90
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,261
With a kid like you? In your dreams.

91
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,097
He must have been furious.

92
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,723
Stop incriminating yourself with words.

93
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,185
Words can never be unsaid.

94
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,979
All I can do is make up for them.

95
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,863
Thanks for getting back to me so fast.

96
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,824
You'll do it. I know you will.
Say that you will.

97
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,159
What on earth is this?

98
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,412
Gosh, you're adorable when you beg.

99
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,746
Seriously?

100
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,874
Who am I to turn down
such an adorable friend?

101
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,333
Isn't it because he's cute?

102
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,336
He is, but what does that
have to do with anything?

103
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,803
You two saw a movie together

104
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,805
and he'll buy dinner sometime.

105
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,933
-My gosh.
-<i>I enjoyed the movie.</i>

106
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,852
<i>Let me buy you dinner sometime.</i>

107
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,063
He didn't leave a name.
So I thought an honest thief came by.

108
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,234
Gosh, check out his neat handwriting.
When did he leave a note?

109
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,861
Can I have this, May?

110
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,655
What about this is neat?

111
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,866
Then beg adorably.

112
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,288
May, please let Mi-joo have it.

113
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,672
It's like he's letting the world know
that we're dating.

114
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,466
-Are you okay with this?
-I'm not.

115
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,385
Not that stunt you pulled
but your relationship.

116
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,263
His father paid you off once.

117
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,934
He likes me, so who cares about his dad?

118
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,728
Because he's an assemblyman?
Well, I'm a voter.

119
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,189
It keeps bugging me though.

120
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,942
That and how his dad
pushed the additional payment.

121
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,946
I'm sure he's old enough
to separate work from his private life.

122
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,322
I doubt it.

123
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,451
Whatever. I chose to be positive
since he's Seon-gyeom's family.

124
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,080
Whatever. Anyway, how's he doing?

125
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,832
He's busy to the point
where it's difficult to get used to.

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,503
You will be just as busy now,
so get used to it.

127
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,879
But I don't want to.

128
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,799
I'll email the script to you,
Ms. Translator.

129
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,511
Gosh, look at you with that sharper gaze.

130
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,721
Okay, fine. I'll get going.

131
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,723
I'll get to work.

132
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,285
Keep the heel of the front foot
off the ground. Now hold.

133
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,661
Got it.

134
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,247
Only do so until
your back foot feels any pain.

135
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,416
Sure. Wait for me.

136
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,552
-Seon-gyeom, I--
-Don't stick your knees out.

137
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,805
-I thought we'd train after--
-Not so fast.

138
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,182
I get how you came up with--

139
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,102
I told you to slow down.
Your breathing is off.

140
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,437
But this much…

141
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,564
I can do it on my own.

142
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,400
This must be easy
for you to be so talkative.

143
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,571
Are you here to check
whether I'm doing a proper job?

144
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,076
That one needs to be cleaned again.

145
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
Give it a spray then.

146
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,084
Faster.

147
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,258
Be gentle with that.

148
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
Got it.

149
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,517
-Hold on to this.
-Yes.

150
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,114
I'm honored, you know.

151
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,369
-What do you mean?
-You pick me up at work

152
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,954
and take care of me after our session

153
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,915
when you should be doing greater things.

154
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,875
I'm doing my job, you know.

155
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,835
Who else will look after my athlete?

156
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,796
So focus on your work too.

157
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,342
What's your fastest record?

158
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,052
Me?

159
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,848
Well, during practice, I came in
at ten seconds with a standing start.

160
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,226
At an official event,
I came in at 10,31 seconds.

161
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:30,022
Yeong-il's best record
is at 10,08 seconds, right?

162
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,358
And his average time is 10,17 seconds.

163
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,986
Could Yeong-il be a cheetah in disguise?

164
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,947
No, he's human.

165
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,326
Anyway, your goal is to
improve your time by 0,20 seconds.

166
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,328
That's out of the blue.

167
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,622
I thought you were thinking long-term.

168
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,959
Have some confidence, will you?
You have the best muscle elasticity

169
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,585
and a strong start.

170
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,963
Next week, we'll score
your physical ability.

171
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,091
You talked about taking it slow.

172
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,510
I should take my time going home then.

173
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,761
That's hardly funny.

174
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
It wasn't a joke.

175
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,390
-How can I not laugh though?
-Then laugh.

176
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,016
But it's not funny.

177
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,601
It wasn't a joke.

178
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,978
How can I not laugh though?

179
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,407
Good night, then.

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,494
I gave you enough space and time to think.

181
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,787
Answer me already.

182
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,789
Being clingy is new territory for me.

183
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,168
You'll never get used to it.
I say that from experience.

184
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,961
That's why I said I was done.

185
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,006
I no longer wanted to be clingy.

186
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,217
So I focused on my paintings again.

187
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,720
And although I missed you,

188
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,765
I told myself to keep moving on.

189
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,476
So why are you doing this to me?

190
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,981
So what if I'm behind the painting?

191
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,942
What if I refuse to move on?

192
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,282
Call me when you find your answer.

193
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,367
I won't wait long though.

194
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,832
You know,

195
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,213
no matter what you do,
I can't help but like you.

196
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,426
And that's what I loathe.

197
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,885
I hate this too.

198
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,596
Being unable to reach a decision.

199
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,812
All I did was waste my time.

200
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,734
Ms. Seo?

201
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
Seon-gyeom?

202
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,865
What brings you here?

203
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,491
Beats me.

204
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,869
Are you perhaps sick?

205
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,456
I heard you moved out,
so why are you still in this neighborhood?

206
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,375
I already paid my rent

207
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,460
and Yeong-hwa likes my company.

208
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,170
How did you know that I moved out?

209
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,006
He likes you?

210
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,134
I wish you two a happy life then.

211
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,652
I should've gone to Mi-joo's.

212
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,530
She lives near Yeong-hwa's place.

213
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,622
Sis?

214
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,917
Spare me a minute.

215
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,004
Mr. Jeong must still prefer you over me.

216
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,632
-Why are you here?
-I heard Myeong-min took what's yours.

217
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,675
As if he's the only one.

218
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,220
He took more than one.
Which are you referring to?

219
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,472
The charity event.

220
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,017
So? Was it a success?

221
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,895
The gallery. Do you want it?

222
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,481
I heard Myeong-min
hung his painting there.

223
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,153
I did some thinking…

224
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,864
to see how I can lift your mood.

225
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,788
You know how to think?

226
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,500
I do. I just normally choose not to.

227
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,423
You'll give me what you have
to appease me?

228
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,217
With no strings attached?

229
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,970
-Is that a no?
-Would you take it back?

230
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,310
What can you give me
that will piss Myeong-min off the most?

231
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,232
Take my side when the time comes.

232
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,026
I'm always on your side.

233
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,156
The situation might call for you
to turn against me.

234
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,117
<i>You're my sister?</i>

235
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,541
I only heard you existed,
so it's my first time seeing you.

236
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,293
Are you really my sister?

237
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,631
And this is my younger brother?

238
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,263
Stop it. You're being creepy.

239
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,642
You called me your brother.

240
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,770
You came from Korea to see me?

241
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,397
That's not why I'm here.

242
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,818
I came to make Jeong Ji-hyun mine, but
paid a visit after hearing you were dying.

243
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,906
Jeong Ji-hyun, your private tutor.

244
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,827
Didn't you understand the Korean?
Your tutor.

245
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,706
I know, but who cares about the reason
when you're actually here?

246
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,921
One day, when I ask you,

247
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,758
be my brother.

248
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,678
Don't die on me until then.

249
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,602
If that can make you feel better,
that's what I'll do.

250
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,565
It's been way over a minute.

251
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,568
Just tell me to piss off and I will.

252
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,992
Maybe he's matured.

253
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,297
Can I get a club soda?

254
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,465
Sure.

255
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,262
I see you're old enough
to ask me out for a drink now.

256
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,390
Why come when you're
only going to order a club soda?

257
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,602
To drive you home, of course.

258
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,022
Do you like me that much?

259
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,150
Did you cry?

260
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,069
Are you nuts?

261
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,280
She already sees me as a nuisance.

262
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,116
Being a crybaby on top of that?

263
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,952
You surely have matured.

264
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,498
Back when you were young,
all you did was cry in front of her.

265
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,918
For some reason, her presence
doesn't evoke tears from me anymore.

266
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,254
I cry in front of my fans though.

267
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:54,091
I guess I have a weak spot
for people who like me.

268
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,345
Maybe it's because
I'm not immune to love yet.

269
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,685
Have you ever cried
in front of anyone before?

270
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,355
Well…

271
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,609
My cat fell sick recently,

272
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,321
so I shed tears in front of…

273
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,073
the vet.

274
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,160
The vet must've been terrified.

275
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,753
Is Dan-ah still seeing
that college student?

276
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,089
You should stop her.

277
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,466
I don't have the right to do that.

278
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
If you did, would you?

279
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,765
It's better not to have another weakness.

280
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,603
People already look down on her
because of her gender and illness.

281
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,981
-Seeing a student will only make it worse.
-You have a point.

282
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,694
The reason Dad wanted me to come to Korea
was so that I could be a replacement.

283
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,863
He wanted me to take over

284
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,449
and protect his wealth
if any of my siblings got ill.

285
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,411
But I'd probably be the one to die first.

286
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,623
I have to say, life can be really…

287
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,043
It can be really difficult.

288
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,714
I thought I'd get off work
once I drove Ms. Seo home.

289
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,592
Just quit your damn job.

290
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,927
Let's get wasted tonight.

291
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,059
That sounds nice.

292
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,560
One Godfather, please.

293
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,645
Sure.

294
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,525
IT'S TIME TO GO

295
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,163
Let's sleep.
I promised to sleep at 2:00 a.m.

296
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,960
Let's just do it until 3:00 a.m.

297
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,419
I swear.

298
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,664
No, no.

299
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,333
Well begun is half done.

300
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,627
I'm already up.

301
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,382
Is well begun really half done?

302
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,732
Gosh.

303
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,040
I'm running?

304
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,667
I can't believe I'm doing this.

305
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,216
TRAINING PROGRAMS

306
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,385
30 MINUTE RUN CHALLENGE

307
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,304
BEGIN WORKOUT

308
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,432
<i>Okay, now relax</i>
<i>and start running comfortably.</i>

309
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,225
Guide me well, sir.

310
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,740
Gosh, help.

311
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,910
<i>You can't get exhausted already.</i>

312
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,497
Why? Why not?

313
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,249
<i>Because the next course</i>
<i>will be even more exhausting.</i>

314
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,638
Are you okay?

315
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,847
Yes, I'm okay.

316
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,100
-Don't overdo it.
-Okay.

317
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,203
Does it hurt? Do you feel a sting?

318
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,039
Maybe you're not ready yet.

319
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,583
Just use one hand for today.

320
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,834
No.

321
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,670
I want to try.

322
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,924
Today's just the beginning,

323
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,509
so take it easy.

324
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,970
Okay.

325
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,473
Ready.

326
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,273
Yeong-il! My gosh.

327
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,069
Think of Yeong-il as the finish line.
Now get ready.

328
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,237
Got it.

329
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:50,906
Steady.

330
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,077
Go!

331
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,709
Stop. I said stop!

332
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,045
Gosh.

333
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,839
-I missed you, Yeong-il.
-Have you been well?

334
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,591
-How's your leg?
-It's fine.

335
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,261
Woo-sik, you need to straighten
your upper body to run faster.

336
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,763
What's your deal?

337
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,641
I guess it's hard to do that
because of your leg.

338
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,726
But you did great. You've improved a lot.

339
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,436
What the heck are you…

340
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,605
Are you his agent or something?

341
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,650
You can call me that if you want to.

342
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,945
If I can call you whatever I want,
can I cuss at you?

343
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,196
No.

344
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,198
-Come on. Just once.
-No.

345
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,408
What were you going to say?

346
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,623
Did I just hear an "F"? A what?

347
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,667
That's enough.

348
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,460
-What comes after "F"?
-Let's go.

349
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,128
-Okay.
-Move.

350
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,464
KI SEON-GYEOM

351
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,763
Do you have training today? Did you eat?

352
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,433
I woke up.

353
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,978
What are you talking about?
I'm a morning person.

354
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,107
You told me I should move to stay alive.

355
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,525
Well, help me stay alive.

356
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,535
I should look beautiful

357
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,496
to make him want to help me stay alive.

358
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,463
Seon-gyeom.

359
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,429
What was that?

360
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,436
Hey, you're here.

361
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,230
Did you just cringe at me?

362
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,942
-We haven't met in a while.
-I was just wondering if it was you.

363
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,694
I couldn't see properly.

364
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,530
Are you sure you didn't want to see me?

365
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,407
Don't make me upset when I'm hungry.

366
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,993
I think my eyesight is getting weak.

367
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,788
-I didn't notice when I was an athlete.
-You just left it like that?

368
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,625
Let's get your eyes examined after we eat.

369
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,126
Why are you so eager about it?

370
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,921
Because if you cringe at me again,
I'll get the wrong idea and get angry.

371
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,840
This is for both of us.

372
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,675
Let's go.

373
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,596
<i>Keep your chin fixed.</i>

374
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,222
Don't pull your chin in.

375
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,808
Just two more seconds.

376
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,105
There.

377
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,609
Can you see more properly?

378
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,486
-Are you not dizzy?
-No.

379
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,656
Does he have to wear glasses
just because of that?

380
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,075
What?

381
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,202
No, it's nothing.

382
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,581
My vision must be really bad.

383
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,999
It's bad, isn't it?

384
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,466
How about this one?

385
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,684
Then how about this?

386
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,560
I don't like it.

387
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,604
I see.

388
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,027
Yes. This one.

389
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,658
I mean, you look nice in glasses and all…

390
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:26,037
You didn't want me to cringe again.
That's why I'm getting glasses.

391
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,790
Did I do something wrong?

392
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,210
I don't want anything covering your face.

393
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,254
How about contact lenses?

394
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,381
We have disposables too.

395
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,843
I've never tried them before.

396
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,680
No one's born with contact lenses
in their eyes. Right, sir?

397
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,015
-Get contact lenses.
-That shouldn't happen.

398
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,476
Gosh, this is a great achievement.

399
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,145
I'm happy.

400
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
Is it difficult to wear these?

401
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,940
No, it's easy.

402
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,443
I should go to work now.

403
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,027
I need to go too.

404
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,279
I'm going this way.

405
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,072
I need to go that way.

406
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,282
-Go on.
-No, you go.

407
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,117
You go first. I'll leave once you go.

408
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,036
-No, it's okay. You go first.
-No, you go first.

409
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,622
Then why don't we walk just until there?

410
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,046
Your father will meet you
at the golf course.

411
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,133
He wants us to go first
so the others won't have to wait.

412
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,926
He made me finish my coffee.

413
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,513
He must be busy these days.

414
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,767
He is, with the establishment
of the local team and all.

415
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,478
I see. You make it sound like
I have nothing better to do.

416
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,689
He calls me when I'm already busy
with my training

417
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,857
and commercial shoots.

418
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,902
How many times more
do I have to entertain his friends?

419
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,863
What do you mean "entertain"?
That's not a nice way to put it.

420
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,239
You should be careful.

421
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,785
I'm not even allowed to be honest anymore?

422
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,915
My gosh, my life is already boring
as it is.

423
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,334
You're working too hard.
Don't overstrain yourself.

424
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,794
What about you?

425
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,880
What's your joy in life?

426
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,883
Tell me so I can be happy too.

427
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,344
Me? Playing golf.

428
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,347
My gosh.

429
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,933
Are you teasing me?

430
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,729
Oh, gosh.

431
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,482
Hello, Ms. Ki.

432
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,400
It's nice to finally meet you.

433
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,153
I'm so nervous.
I asked your father many times

434
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,197
to let me play golf with you.

435
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,157
I'm No Geun-seong.

436
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,493
Let's keep a distance.

437
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,329
I don't want to seem too close.

438
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,250
Isn't it better to seem close
than to seem suspicious?

439
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,919
I don't really like
talking to married men.

440
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,007
I'm a golf fanatic.

441
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,301
My daughter even receives
junior golf lessons.

442
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,555
What's taking my dad so long to get here?

443
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,102
I want her to become
a world-famous golf player just like you.

444
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,187
Does your daughter want that too?

445
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,690
She's too young to know what she wants.

446
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,443
Kids know what they want.

447
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,573
It won't be too late to encourage her
once she sets her mind to it.

448
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,534
You know Tae-oh,
the really stubborn male lead?

449
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,662
The way he speaks slowly changes
as things become

450
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,038
more emotional.

451
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,833
Yes. But if you look at how
he normally speaks,

452
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,461
he uses all sorts of fancy words
and talks like Shakespeare.

453
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,921
But in this scene,

454
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,174
it needs a liberal translation
to convey the religious references.

455
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,928
Tae-oh does quote a lot of Shakespeare.

456
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,432
Right. But these quotes
are already so famous,

457
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,310
and they're pretty much used as idioms.

458
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,478
So what if people hate
my liberal translation?

459
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,316
You can't always translate
everything as it is.

460
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,859
There's always a storyline,

461
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,779
and it's sometimes necessary
in order to deliver the context.

462
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,948
Nothing can be delivered perfectly.

463
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,784
That's why some people say
it's treason to translate.

464
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,245
I didn't know I was committing treason.

465
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,665
Be grateful you're not translating a movie
that gets millions of viewers.

466
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,711
You're right. Then I'd get criticized
from millions instead of a thousands.

467
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,422
I hope I never mistranslate anything.

468
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,299
I just want to make a decent living.

469
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,968
This is for you, Mi-joo.

470
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,012
Gosh, thank you.

471
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,974
Right. I heard Director Han's movie
received another award.

472
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,476
Congratulations.

473
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,313
Thank you. The reason that movie
keeps getting so many awards

474
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,856
is all thanks to the subtitles.

475
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,899
Right.

476
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,109
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

477
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,571
What if I get asked to translate
a blockbuster?

478
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,281
I'd love to do one of Ji-woo's movies.

479
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,784
You mean <i>Candy</i>?
I heard the movie came out great.

480
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,911
It was directed by Kim Sang-ho,
and stars Yook Ji-woo.

481
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,412
It will definitely make it big.

482
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,998
It'd be great if I did
the subtitles for it.

483
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,709
I once got a chance to translate
one of Ji-woo's movies.

484
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,128
There are tons of people like you.

485
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,464
You were just one of the wannabes.

486
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,342
I get how desperate you are,
but don't dramatize it.

487
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,886
We're all free to dream of
whatever we want.

488
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,513
Just let me have that freedom.

489
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,766
I'm allowed to dream.

490
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,232
-Ms. Oh.
-Ms. Ki.

491
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,192
Did you go somewhere?

492
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,195
Yes, I bought some ingredients
so I can cook <i>japchae</i>.

493
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,739
I see. You must be a good cook.

494
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,367
No, I've never tried it before.
It's just for practice.

495
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,494
-I see.
-But what brings you here?

496
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,788
I know, right?

497
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,374
I hate that I know this place.

498
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,961
I'm here because I saw something strange,

499
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,381
and I couldn't just ignore it.

500
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,635
By any chance, did you see me
and Seon-gyeom holding hands?

501
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,595
How would I be able to see that?

502
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,473
Oh, right. You have a point.

503
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,767
Then what is it about?

504
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,105
I contemplated a lot.

505
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,358
I figured it might be better
not to tell you anything.

506
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,777
But then again,
it might be better to know.

507
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,574
Ever since Seon-gyeom
went to the training center,

508
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,367
he started receiving updates on him

509
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,664
<i>so he could check</i>
<i>if he's training properly or not.</i>

510
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,376
<i>He thinks he'll come in first place</i>
<i>if he trains hard.</i>

511
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,765
<i>When things don't go well with his work</i>
<i>or he wants to take his anger out,</i>

512
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,559
<i>he randomly receives reports</i>
<i>on Seon-gyeom's daily routine.</i>

513
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,937
-Don't lie to me. I know it's spicy.
-You're bad with spicy food.

514
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,564
Seriously?

515
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,815
I'm kidding.

516
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,694
I'm worried someone might have been
caught in the crossfire.

517
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,010
PERSONAL INFORMATION
OH MI-JOO

518
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,930
I don't know what you guys are up to,
and I don't care.

519
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,475
But I think my dad knows
that you guys go around holding hands.

520
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,353
-Unbelievable.
-Exactly.

521
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,482
You don't think he'll come here
and throw water at me, right?

522
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,984
I mean, we're just dating.

523
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,653
I know, right?

524
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,739
But you should still be careful.

525
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,990
It's cold.

526
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,496
Yes, I'll catch a cold
if I get myself wet in this weather.

527
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,081
The sun is up.

528
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,337
I must've worked really hard…

529
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,592
My gosh. No. I'm not going to run.

530
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,094
I'm going to wash and sleep.

531
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,421
Yeong-hwa wants to know
when you're going to confirm his painting.

532
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,509
So this is how it's going to be?

533
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,054
Can you call…

534
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,680
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

535
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,560
Should I meet him outside?

536
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,896
Or should I meet him somewhere private?

537
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,274
It's best not to meet him at all.

538
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,069
How can I not meet him?
He's painting for me.

539
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,655
Because that's not why you're meeting him.

540
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,667
It's a hassle, isn't it?

541
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,086
I can't stand being hassled.

542
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,631
But I feel like
I'm willing to put up with it.

543
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,675
Ms. Seo.

544
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,177
You don't need to put up with it.

545
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,765
-Aren't you going to support me?
-No, I don't think I can.

546
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,310
Me neither.

547
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,105
I feel the same way.

548
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,901
I wish I could just maintain
this feeling that I have right now.

549
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,949
It's hard to have control
over how we feel.

550
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,076
Yes, it's hard.

551
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,495
But I can.

552
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,539
No.

553
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,833
I should be able to.

554
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,052
Who is this?

555
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,804
<i>"Who is this"?</i>

556
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,222
I asked you first.

557
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,392
<i>It wasn't a question.</i>
<i>Do you not know who I am?</i>

558
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,853
No, I don't have your number.

559
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,692
You nagged at me to tell you my number,
and you didn't save it?

560
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,111
Let me rephrase that. I deleted it.

561
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,030
Did you find the answer?

562
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,618
How about giving me some options
so I can pick one?

563
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,579
You told me you always get to decide.

564
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,289
So why can't you decide this time?

565
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,790
Damn it.

566
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,543
Let's meet first. Let's meet and talk.

567
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,795
I know that will give you
a bigger advantage.

568
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,422
Pick some other date.

569
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,508
I know you value time the most.
I'll tell you where we should meet

570
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
through this number. Bye.

571
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,639
That obnoxious bastard.

572
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,399
Thanks for the drink.

573
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,070
You looked miserable a while ago,
but now you're all smiles.

574
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,863
-Do you love coffee that much?
-Yes.

575
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,616
-Have you gone crazy?
-It's been a while now.

576
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,620
Hurry up and give that to me.
I want to drink it. Give it to me.

577
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,538
-Thank you.
-Now, get lost.

578
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,833
It's so warm.

579
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,002
First, it wasn't going well.

580
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,755
But then, there was an ace,
a king, and a heart.

581
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,716
-So I got confident and went all-in.
-Why are you so hyper? Go.

582
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,136
-And I got a heart and was elated.
-Look at him smiling.

583
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,179
Just leave.

584
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,598
-Seriously. Bye.
-I ought to…

585
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,605
He really is teaching me to be patient.
He sure does.

586
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,991
What's up with your eyes?

587
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,137
Hello.

588
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,764
You're my mom's boss.

589
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,725
Right, you were her son.

590
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,019
That came first.

591
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,731
Do you work here? Why haven't I seen you?

592
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,192
Yes, I'm a part-timer.

593
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,569
What would you like?

594
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,280
One Americano to-go, please.

595
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,157
Okay.

596
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,750
I should take a break.

597
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,824
-Are you busy?
<i>-Why do you ask?</i>

598
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,870
Let's go out and have dinner.
You wanted me to save you.

599
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,747
<i>Do you want to eat outside?</i>

600
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,462
I'm quite busy right now.

601
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,464
Let's meet next time.

602
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,967
Okay. Bye.

603
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:10,319
<i>I've been bribed and</i>
<i>I've been drenched in water,</i>

604
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:14,657
<i>so why would he send someone to spy on me?</i>
<i>Randomly at that.</i>

605
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,494
Gosh, what am I doing? I must be crazy.

606
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,205
I'VE BEEN BRIBED AND
I'VE BEEN DRENCHED IN WATER

607
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,002
<i>Ma'am, this is the final version.</i>

608
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,088
<i>Thank you for proofreading.</i>

609
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,015
I'm really terrible at lying.

610
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,984
-You must be busy these days.
-I am.

611
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,987
So busy that you skip your meals.

612
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,904
I…

613
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,365
No, I'll be eating on my way out.

614
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:00,327
I'm worried about you.
I haven't been able to see you often.

615
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,207
Who are you talking about?

616
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,587
-Do you know how to do this?
-Contact lenses?

617
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,382
I used to wear them before getting LASEK.

618
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,134
I managed to get this one in,

619
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,886
but this is just too difficult for me.

620
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,614
Don't you think it's strange?

621
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,200
-Is something wrong with it?
-No, not the lens.

622
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,453
This short distance between us.

623
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,873
-Blink your eyes.
-What is it?

624
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,670
I can feel the love

625
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,006
in your eyes.

626
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,467
-Oh, God. Don't feel it.
-Come closer.

627
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,762
-Do it from afar.
-No, I need to get close.

628
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,764
Come closer.

629
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,183
-Close your eyes.
-That's right.

630
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,453
What are you doing in front of my house?

631
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,124
I was just passing by.

632
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,169
Where is Seon-gyeom?

633
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,923
You should have come sooner.
He left ten minutes ago.

634
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,468
Have you seen anyone suspicious

635
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,138
around here or within
the one-kilometer radius?

636
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,520
Me?

637
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,730
I'm just worried. That's all.

638
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,442
Do you run every day as well?

639
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,027
You're dressed like one.

640
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,572
It's only temporary. I'm getting ready
for a marathon.

641
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,076
It's a charity event.
I'm a good person, you know?

642
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,371
I think Seon-gyeom told me about it.

643
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,832
I didn't know you're participating too.

644
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,710
He was worried about you skipping
your meals.

645
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,045
I don't know why he told me about it.

646
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,257
Does he eat on time?

647
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,092
All the time.

648
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,305
Can you keep it a secret about me running

649
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,849
and this encounter?

650
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,145
Care to join me for breakfast?

651
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,896
I can't believe you don't skip breakfast.

652
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,773
You're more diligent than I thought.

653
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,402
But why are you treating me?

654
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,155
Mi-joo.

655
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,949
Do you tutor?

656
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,369
I am tutoring someone every other week.

657
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,080
-Why?
-I'm good at everything

658
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,623
except for languages.

659
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,419
I'm afraid I'm too busy with my main job
to tutor another person.

660
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,130
-How bad are you?
-It's beyond belief.

661
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,758
Is that what this is about?

662
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:06,096
Then let me give you a simple test
in return for my sandwich.

663
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,056
Let's see how good you are.

664
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,434
Here. You have three minutes.

665
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,941
I'm done.

666
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,114
I'm good at listening,

667
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,741
but I'm bad at reading.

668
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,995
It's quite bad. How did you go to college?

669
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,457
I guess I was exceptionally brilliant
at drawing.

670
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,961
I excel in all the other subjects.

671
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,548
I'll text you some materials

672
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,468
that'll help you improve
in the areas you lack.

673
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,261
Your score will definitely improve.

674
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,931
It's not like you can go any lower.

675
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,646
It's obvious that you're cramming.
Am I right?

676
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,397
Is it for your graduation?

677
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,983
My school is sending some students abroad.

678
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,320
I also need to do some volunteer work.

679
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,534
Does that marathon accept
volunteers as well?

680
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,954
Probably. She likes to boss people around.

681
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,831
What?

682
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,542
Let me know If you see someone suspicious

683
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,212
while you're with Seon-gyeom.

684
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,506
Sure.

685
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,634
By the way,
is someone following him around?

686
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,761
Perhaps, a stalker?

687
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,597
That's terrifying. That's not why.

688
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,433
I'm just overly concerned.

689
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,227
Overly concerned?

690
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,242
Let me see your mock test result.

691
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,120
-You're not busy, are you?
-I am.

692
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,788
I swung by on my way to somewhere.

693
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,499
-Is that a pain-relief patch?
-What?

694
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,836
My shoulders are so sore from studying.

695
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,841
What's this bruise?

696
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:10,262
I slammed it on the desk while studying.

697
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,392
Don't tell me you're being bullied
and keeping it a secret.

698
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,228
-Come on, I have many friends.
-And you're not the bully?

699
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,563
What do you take me for--

700
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,440
You're not boxing again, are you?

701
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,818
I thought you were busy. Go on, then.

702
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:29,907
Director Dong.

703
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,869
Do you hate me being bullied?
Or do you hate me taking up boxing again?

704
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,246
-Boxing.
-Why?

705
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,166
Because that's something
you deliberately choose to do.

706
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,556
Should I look for another job?

707
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,517
Should I get bullied?

708
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,899
Don't let me hear you breathe.
I'm studying here.

709
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,612
Go study in your own room.
This is my room, and that's my desk.

710
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,615
I have no space to study on my desk.

711
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,784
Then clean up.

712
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,036
A high school senior has no time for that.

713
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,996
You only bring that up at times like this.

714
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,541
-Do you even feel bad?
-Shut up and help me with…

715
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,212
Forget it. What do you know?

716
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,215
It seems like Yeong-hwa likes someone.

717
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,342
I know.

718
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,344
I see.

719
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,064
How annoying.

720
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,067
Me?

721
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,361
I'm annoyed about making time
when I'm so busy

722
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,154
and being ten minutes late.

723
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,657
You can be late.

724
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,034
How could anyone be punctual all the time?

725
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,452
That's how I lived.

726
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,831
Look at me being all happy again
like an idiot.

727
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,671
It feels great to know
that you made time for me.

728
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,926
I shouldn't have come.

729
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,220
You were conceited, Dan-ah.

730
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,305
What?

731
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,182
I'm not fine.

732
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,561
I keep making time for you when I'm busy.

733
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,231
I don't know what you want exactly,

734
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,026
so I'm not sure what kind of answer
you're looking for.

735
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,572
But to me,

736
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,037
<i>you've been my comfort.</i>

737
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,542
And at times you've also been my despair.

738
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:48,962
Despair?

739
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,133
I used to be content with your painting.

740
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,553
But that made me miss you more.

741
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,432
I hated that

742
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,019
I was wasting my time
without you by my side.

743
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,649
Just let

744
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,069
that time go.

745
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,988
Don't try to grab onto something
you can't.

746
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,128
Instead, grab something that you can.
Like this.

747
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,174
How dare you try to teach me?

748
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,343
Don't even bother. You're still cute.

749
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,137
This is suffocating.

750
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,057
Wait. Hey, kid. How dare you call me cute?

751
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,810
How could you still call me a kid
in this situation?

752
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,772
Then what else am I
supposed to call you, kid?

753
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,441
I already answered that before. Let's see.

754
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,610
If I take time off school,
what will you call me?

755
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,613
-A kid who's taking a break?
-I'll drop out.

756
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,697
Then a college dropout.

757
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,575
-When will you stop calling me that?
-When you graduate.

758
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,952
Then I should graduate early.

759
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,122
I like that you're still a kid.

760
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,292
Don't tell me you like me this time
because I'm a kid.

761
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,755
I like you for who you are,
not your status.

762
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,176
Come on, don't make my heart flutter
like that.

763
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,887
-Do you not like it?
-Then will you stop?

764
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,848
No, you should put up with it.

765
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,351
Who do you belong to?

766
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,688
-Me.
-Then I'm yours too.

767
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:33,024
-No, you can be yours.
-Just put up with it.

768
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,783
Let me go. I need to go. Our time's up.

769
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,746
Me too. I have to go to class.

770
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,000
Good luck in class, kid.
Don't daydream about me.

771
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,251
Dream on.

772
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,597
I found an odd condition
in Eun-bi's advertisement agreement.

773
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,600
-And what's that?
-It's about her losing weight.

774
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,226
Maybe that's why she lost weight.

775
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,856
How speechless.

776
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,234
Her schedule for tomorrow
hasn't changed, right?

777
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,319
No.

778
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,866
It's me. Let's have a meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

779
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,326
<i>I have plans.</i>

780
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,038
You have a different schedule
than the one given by the agency?

781
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:28,955
Why?

782
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,499
<i>Do you think Seon-gyeom is</i>
<i>the only person I'm helping?</i>

783
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,500
Why?

784
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,086
<i>I have to play golf with my father</i>
<i>and his friends.</i>

785
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:36,838
Why?

786
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,592
<i>Because I joined your agency. Bye.</i>

787
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,304
-Why?
-That's enough.

788
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,598
Why?

789
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,061
Massage gun. Pain-relief patches.

790
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,157
-Hello, Ms. Seo.
<i>-Were you aware?</i>

791
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,244
Of what?

792
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,413
<i>Your sister seems to be wasting her time.</i>

793
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,623
What do you mean?

794
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,543
What?

795
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,215
-Nice birdie!
-Nice birdie!

796
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,385
That was incredible.

797
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,141
Smile, will you?

798
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,936
-Be grateful I'm not crying.
-Ms. Ki.

799
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,480
Could you coach me?
I keep raising my head.

800
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,651
Gosh, this is
a once-in-a-time opportunity.

801
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,444
Go on.

802
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,073
Thank you.

803
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,952
-Don't move your head.
-Okay.

804
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,954
Okay. Keep your eye on the putter.

805
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,166
-Okay.
-After that,

806
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,626
-hold it a bit lower.
-Okay.

807
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,546
-This is more stable.
-Let's go.

808
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,090
Hey, Seon-gyeom!

809
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,301
Let go of me! Why are you humiliating me?

810
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,760
What the hell are you doing?

811
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,263
Can't you see that my friends are here?

812
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,558
Is this how he's supposed to greet us?

813
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,520
Greet him. He's Chairman Seo Myeong-pil.

814
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,105
He's Ms. Seo's father.

815
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,025
Greet him? Does that matter right now?

816
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,527
The way you use your family
to your advantage

817
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,488
disgusts me.

818
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,453
My friends and I are just hanging out.

819
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,872
You better choose your words wisely.

820
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,875
Why would you need a pro-golfer
if you're just hanging out?

821
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:41,171
You know I'm doing this for a reason.

822
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,174
Stop involving us in your endeavors.

823
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,095
You should be ashamed of yourself.

824
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,725
What's gotten into you?

825
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,602
Let me go.

826
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,563
Seriously!

827
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:07,155
Hey. How did you know I was here?

828
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,865
Does that matter?

829
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,368
Did Ms. Seo tattle on me already?

830
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,329
"Tattle"? That must mean you know
that this is wrong.

831
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,501
-How will you take care of this?
-Then what did you expect me to do?

832
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:23,088
Isn't it obvious?
You should've done nothing.

833
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,965
Since when did he do this?

834
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,635
Actually, that doesn't matter.

835
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,389
Now that I've found out,
I won't allow him to use you like this.

836
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,642
Is this for me as well?

837
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,729
It isn't.

838
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,815
Why would you go this far?

839
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,735
Because I pity you
for being my older sister.

840
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,659
You saved me countless times.

841
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,745
I could do this over and over again.

842
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,041
You know how to save me now?

843
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,961
I'm proud of you.

844
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,509
-Where do you stay these days?
-At a hotel, of course.

845
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,886
I'll drop you off. Let's go.

846
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,222
Hurry up.

847
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,062
I'm not going to leave
until I see you sleeping.

848
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,565
-I hate you.
-I know.

849
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:29,362
It seems like you and your son
need to bond more.

850
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,162
I should get going as well. Goodbye.

851
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,973
Hey, miss.

852
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,684
Are you seeing my son?

853
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,770
You better answer wisely.

854
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,734
Must I answer that?

855
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,406
Then what will you do?

856
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,868
You're the one who ruined my son,
aren't you?

857
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,872
He used to be such a good boy,
but he won't listen to me anymore.

858
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,459
Thanks to what you've done to him,

859
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,337
he's now about to ruin
my daughter's reputation.

860
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,466
And thanks to you,
my reputation is at risk.

861
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,760
Will you still not answer?

862
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:42,477
Fine. The only thing you can refuse to do
is giving me an answer, so don't!

863
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,313
Where are the honorifics?

864
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,483
Hey.

865
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:52,487
Do you think I raised him so that
he could meet someone like you?

866
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,738
Sir.

867
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,783
Your son isn't an object.

868
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,577
Why do you talk as if he's yours?

869
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,789
You impudent girl!
How dare you talk back at me?

870
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,920
I have the right to own him.

871
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,132
Then you'd discard him
if there's a seizure warrant on him.

872
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,760
What did you say?

873
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,179
If you come back here again,
I will call the police.

874
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,682
Goodbye.

875
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,607
I wish I could give her a good beating.

876
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,148
Why are you here?

877
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,109
Are you afraid now that you've realized
what you've done?

878
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,028
Shouldn't you be the one who's afraid?

879
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:01,574
-What if Eun-bi turns her back on you too?
-She'd never do that.

880
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,576
Unlike you, she's a good daughter.

881
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,703
And yet, you made her do such a thing?

882
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,753
So you're not here to ask
for my forgiveness.

883
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,755
You're not repenting.

884
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,799
I wouldn't have done it
if I'd regret it.

885
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,678
Is that so?

886
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,767
Track and field, Kim Woo-sik,

887
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,228
and Oh Mi-joo.

888
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,774
Among your three weaknesses,

889
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,319
which do you think I'll be after?

890
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:46,661
I will never hurt my own son
because I love him.

891
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,956
However, if you keep acting out like this,

892
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,961
I have no choice
but to make her life a living hell!

893
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,632
You're wrong.

894
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:01,968
She is

895
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,846
my strength, not my weakness.

896
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,225
So, do whatever you want.

897
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,103
I'm your weakness.

898
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,566
As you know, I'm still not aware
of what I'm capable of.

899
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,904
Please stop making me want to hurt you.

900
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,094
Ms. Oh.

901
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:47,847
Ms. Oh.

902
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,517
Come out for a minute.

903
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,272
Ms. Oh, let's talk for a second.

904
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,703
<i>The number you have dialed--</i>

905
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,339
Ms. Oh.

906
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,383
Ms. Oh.

907
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,429
Let's talk for a bit.

908
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,518
Ms. Oh.

909
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,882
Why haven't you been picking up?

910
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,929
You should go. It's cold.
Don't wait for me.

911
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,767
Let's talk for a minute. It won't be long.

912
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,769
Please.

913
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,983
Did you cry?

914
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,824
I came to apologize.

915
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,203
I'm sorry.

916
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,163
For what?

917
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,915
I heard my father stopped by.

918
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,209
That's not all.

919
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,632
Let's talk next time.

920
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,552
If we talk right now,

921
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,347
-I think I might make a mistake.
-You can do that.

922
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,812
You should've told me right away.

923
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,483
I told you to call me
when you're in pain or struggling.

924
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,028
I told you to do that.

925
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,115
Then I would have come here right away
instead of wasting time.

926
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,284
It's even tougher

927
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,162
to see you right now.

928
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,793
If I had called you right away,

929
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,589
would it have made a difference?

930
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,221
Only I can make myself feel better
since they're my feelings.

931
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,645
How could I make you go through with that?

932
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,773
That's abuse.

933
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,903
All sorts of thoughts crossed my mind.

934
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:55,201
"Must I continue seeing him
at the expense of ruining myself?

935
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,081
I wanted to live like everyone else.

936
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,794
I wanted to do just as much as they did.

937
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,842
So why does it feel like
I'm forcing myself to be someone else?"

938
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,012
You can be disappointed in me.

939
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,848
Don't stop yourself.

940
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,694
I'm humiliated myself.

941
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,322
It's difficult to look you in the eye.

942
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,243
I don't want to do it.

943
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,748
Do what?

944
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,251
Being disappointed.

945
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,590
It's not your fault anyway.

946
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,638
I don't want to badmouth your family.

947
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:58,973
I just…

948
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,392
I just…

949
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,148
What's wrong with me?

950
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,445
I've lived well until now.

951
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,615
So what do I lack?

952
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,669
I value myself

953
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,214
more than anyone else.

954
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,305
So I want to give up.

955
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,686
You said I could

956
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,522
make a mistake.

957
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:33,776
Does she really want to break up?

958
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,862
Don't you think I'm way in over my head
that I want to be with Seon-gyeom?

959
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,988
Ms. Seo's birthday is soon.

960
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,533
-What are these balloons for?
-To throw Ms. Seo a party.

961
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,743
This is the first time
someone's asked me out.

962
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,453
Where are you going all dressed up?

963
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,080
I have to look reliable.
