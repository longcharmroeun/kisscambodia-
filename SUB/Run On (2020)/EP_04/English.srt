1
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,764
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,807
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,679
It turns out that the assault victim
lives with only his grandmother.

4
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,557
They must have thought
he was beneath them.

5
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,518
It's sick, if you ask me.

6
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,020
Ki Seon-gyeom sure is righteous.

7
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,438
He must pack a punch too.

8
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,985
Still, isn't it scary
that he used violence?

9
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,320
If his mother had taught him better,

10
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,030
he wouldn't have.

11
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,241
Don't you agree?

12
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,076
That mother would be me.

13
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,746
He's my son, you see.

14
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,252
I read the article, Mr. Ki.

15
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,087
-It must have been tough.
-Thank you.

16
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,508
You made a public apology
even though you knew the whole story.

17
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,178
-Your love for your son is commendable.
-We should be considerate of the public

18
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,097
since we get paid with their tax money.

19
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,434
My son using violence
to handle the situation

20
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,185
reflects on my role as a father.

21
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,146
I heard he was banned as a runner,

22
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,690
but that might change
thanks to the public sentiment.

23
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:15,278
This recent issue with my son
has been a teaching moment for me too.

24
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,531
Mr. Ki, isn't it about time
we went golfing?

25
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,617
Is Ms. Ki still in Korea?

26
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,163
Should I get Eun-bi to join us sometime?

27
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,497
It wouldn't be difficult.

28
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,041
You must love to golf.

29
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,250
Of course.

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,921
-<i>Seon-gyeom, an article is out.</i>
-Everything seems okay,

31
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,049
but your medical history shows
you may have arrhythmia…

32
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,345
-Ms. Seo?
-I'm listening.

33
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,597
As if my opinion matters to you.

34
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,892
I'm going to suggest
a Holter monitor test.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,355
NATIONAL TRACK AND FIELD TEAM

36
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,439
Coach.

37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,984
You should see this.

38
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,612
You're mentioned in the article too.

39
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,794
Hey, let's get out of here.

40
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,303
-I'll go first.
-Sure.

41
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,141
Damn it.

42
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,400
That bastard.

43
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,235
I hope he's all right.

44
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,587
<i>Have you seen the news? If not, don't.</i>

45
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,674
<i>Seon-gyeom, I know it came as a shocker,</i>

46
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,718
<i>but I couldn't tell you in person.</i>

47
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,761
<i>Honestly though, I'm fine.</i>

48
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,805
<i>I'll help out my grandma
for the time being.</i>

49
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,474
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

50
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,980
<i>Leave a dot if you got home safely
and tell me if you can't sleep.</i>

51
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,940
<i>I'll recommend a boring movie.</i>

52
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,850
We'll send Park Gyu-deok and
Kim Gi-beom off to the military.

53
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,811
And don't put them in the Athletic Corps.

54
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,815
All of this happened because
hierarchy is enforced around here.

55
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,193
It's because the organization
is male-dominated.

56
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,736
We need more women
in leadership positions.

57
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,614
That's not what matters at the moment.

58
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,241
Regarding Ki Seon-gyeom,
the disciplinary committee

59
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,035
already finalized a ruling.

60
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,953
So what about Kim Woo-sik?

61
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,790
As if there's anything more to consider.

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,459
He blew this wide open
and quit on his own accord.

63
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,171
I doubt he'll ever come back
as long as he's right in the mind.

64
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,811
The association has decided on

65
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,938
a six-month suspension for you.

66
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,233
Your hard work and achievements
were put into consideration,

67
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,110
so we'll see you then.

68
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,402
Any objections?

69
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,239
I'd like to know if this is a fair ruling.

70
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,533
Am I receiving special treatment?

71
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
Please do it by the book.

72
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,578
If so, you'll be banned from track.

73
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,122
-Is that what you want?
-Yes.

74
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,915
You're not a bad runner.

75
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,626
Why choose to end your career short?

76
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,295
You sure are determined, aren't you?

77
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,923
The one who had his career on the line
was Woo-sik.

78
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,551
This isn't the place
to mention a whistle-blower.

79
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,346
How is it whistle-blowing
when he was only speaking up?

80
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,100
Keep at it
and you won't ever be reinstated.

81
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,146
Seon-gyeom, you've been given a chance

82
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,731
to make up for this mess.

83
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,358
That isn't what I want.

84
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,080
Thank you for giving me
the chance to retire.

85
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,733
I really am unemployed now.

86
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,580
When will Ki Seon-gyeom be back?

87
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,290
That's not something we'd know.

88
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,334
Rumor has it that he lives here.

89
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,419
You're putting us in quite a spot.

90
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,797
-Just tell us a few things--
-I won't be staying here anymore.

91
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,383
I'm checking out as of today.

92
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,845
The last thing I want is to cause trouble
for anyone else here,

93
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,180
so please be aware of that.

94
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,067
I can't believe you finally answered

95
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,069
when you've been ghosting me.

96
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,196
I'm sorry, Seon-gyeom.

97
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,198
Everything's been set,

98
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,700
so stay at the hotel
with your grandmother.

99
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,370
I bet people have been pestering you.

100
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,289
Anyway, just know that it's an order.

101
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,501
Thank you and I'm sorry.

102
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,336
Just stick to one, okay?

103
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,338
<i>Could you give me some time?</i>

104
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,133
Truth is, I still don't have
the courage to face you.

105
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,177
<i>I know you're disappointed in me.</i>

106
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,638
Why would you need the courage to face me?

107
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,433
You're a master at messing with people,
you know that?

108
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,768
So much for being innocent.

109
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,020
<i>I apologize for that then.</i>

110
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,855
Forget it. It's too late anyway.

111
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,026
You've made your decision,

112
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,280
so what else can I do but respect it?

113
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,783
SEO DAN-AH

114
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,620
Woo-sik, I'll hang up then.

115
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,789
Take good care of yourself.

116
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,300
<i>I will if I need to. Good night.</i>

117
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,513
Right, a towel.

118
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,375
I WILL IF I NEED TO, GOOD NIGHT

119
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,303
I chose the perfect day.

120
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,055
I'm not in the mood to bicker.

121
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,849
I just wanted to ask you something.
Did you meet Seon-gyeom that day?

122
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,226
Well, let me go first then.

123
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,812
-Why did you say that to me?
-Say what?

124
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,856
That you were his last.

125
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,818
I didn't know you'd be this concerned
about your athlete.

126
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,530
I can't help it.
It's been ages since he liked someone.

127
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,866
And how do you know that?

128
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,785
I was the last person he liked.

129
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,748
You're still bothered by that?
It was ages ago.

130
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,084
You said it in a way that bothered me.

131
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,293
Why did you do that?

132
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,462
Well, to seem friendly, I guess.

133
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,966
That's your way of being friendly?
I thought we were in a love triangle.

134
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,803
A love triangle?
Should it be? It sounds like fun.

135
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,222
No, don't.
It's already boring if you ask me.

136
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,308
-Why be friendly toward me anyway?
-I want to be friends.

137
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,686
That just sent a chill down my spine.

138
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,064
You like having the last say
and always talk back.

139
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,567
On top of that, you accept bribes.

140
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,237
You should learn how to be friends first.

141
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,446
There you go again.

142
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,950
Hold on a second.
Did you mean it when you told me to kneel?

143
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,411
See? Again with that rebellious attitude.

144
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,498
She won't even answer me.
I'm busy, so leave and don't bother me.

145
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,041
You're ignoring me now?

146
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,336
That's a first for me.
It's very interesting.

147
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,548
I see I unknowingly
charmed someone's socks off again.

148
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,565
-How much is that painting?
-Pardon?

149
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,443
I'll pay for the one you gave me before
while I'm at it.

150
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,320
Oh, right. But you see,

151
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:23,701
he doesn't charge me for the paintings
I hang up around here.

152
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,328
It wouldn't be my place
to put a price on them.

153
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,123
Why don't you speak
to the painter himself?

154
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,749
The art student?

155
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,211
I'd rather not bother.

156
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,421
One Americano, please.

157
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,589
Sure.

158
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,050
-Here you go.
-I'll prepare your order.

159
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,214
What's this about?

160
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,473
This is Eun-bi's contract
that she signed personally.

161
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,558
Your father will throw a fit, won't he?

162
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,227
I heard she'd be renewing her contract.

163
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,979
But she signed with me,
opening up the gates of hell.

164
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,023
Aren't you curious as to what this is?

165
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,529
It's the cancellation of your contract.

166
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,407
You don't need me
now that Eun-bi signed with you.

167
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,867
That's one of the reasons.

168
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,662
Eun-bi signed with me
and I have no use for you,

169
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,456
so we'll go back
to a simpler relationship.

170
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,501
I heard you left the hotel.
Did your grandfather kick you out?

171
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,295
-He read the article?
-I left for multiple reasons.

172
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,341
-He kicked you out for multiple reasons?
-That's not what I meant.

173
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,928
-How did you know though?
-I know a lot of reporters.

174
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,932
Then you must know
that I retired as of today.

175
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:19,191
When the media
will be spinning you as a hero,

176
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,818
you retired?

177
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,613
You're not my agent anymore.

178
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,703
Where will you stay then?

179
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,414
I don't know,

180
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,042
but I'm sure there will be
a bed for me somewhere.

181
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,963
Really?

182
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,343
But it worries me.

183
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,970
There's no need for that.

184
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,099
Well, I'm worried that you might not
have anywhere to go.

185
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,269
Come on, now.
It's not like we're strangers.

186
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,396
-I didn't say anything.
-Move into my apartment.

187
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,565
I'll find a place on my own.

188
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,400
You've been there before, right?

189
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,278
I'll mostly be staying
with my family, but--

190
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,114
I can take care of it.
Jeez, you're strong.

191
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,032
What?

192
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,327
What are you looking at?

193
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,457
I'll stay with you if you ask me to.

194
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,208
Should I?

195
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,883
Ms. Oh?

196
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,384
How long have you been there?

197
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,221
I renovated the place with
natural marble floor tiles from Brazil.

198
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,849
Falling on them
will only crack your skull.

199
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,559
I also have an outdoor pool.

200
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,936
-It's private.
-Where I stay--

201
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,687
A pool? Who's going to clean it?

202
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,357
Why waste money on something
you barely use?

203
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
And the wide window

204
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,986
provides you with
a panorama view of Han River.

205
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,947
It only gets hot in the summer.

206
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,783
Oh, dear.
Your house must have nothing to offer.

207
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,618
Where I stay has three rooms

208
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,037
and wooden floors
that won't crack any skulls.

209
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,873
Also, it's a five-minute walk from here.

210
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,249
You have a car, so why walk?

211
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,336
And create more air pollution?
What about carbon emissions?

212
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,879
How uneducated of you.

213
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,548
So you're being eco-friendly?
That's a great idea.

214
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
How about you sell your car?

215
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,805
Don't I get a say in this?

216
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,016
Why are you deciding for me?

217
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,103
Ms. Oh, your actions are just as puzzling.

218
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,945
Wait!

219
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,030
Was that fun for you?

220
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,825
Is it that fun to toy with other people?

221
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,369
Do I look like I have nothing better to do
than toy with you?

222
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,872
Yes. If that wasn't the case,
you should explain yourself.

223
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,916
I see.

224
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,628
First, he seemed emotionally upset
and in need of company.

225
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,881
Second, he has no friends,
no girlfriend, no agent,

226
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,717
and his family is useless.

227
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,970
Third, I came to the decision that
the person best suited to care for him

228
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,971
is you.

229
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,227
There's no need to thank me.

230
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,741
She really is messing with me.
Damn it, she did it again.

231
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
Again?

232
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,996
-Did you two go out or something?
-No.

233
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,125
Is that it?

234
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,587
Yes, is there anything else
you'd like to hear?

235
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,259
Did you retire?

236
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,429
Yes. How did you know?

237
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,806
I overheard you.

238
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,020
Do you want a lift? Oh, wait.

239
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,689
It'll be fine
since you live five minutes away.

240
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,900
So think how fast it would be by car.

241
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,487
Thanks.

242
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,158
-Oh, hey.
-Ms. Oh.

243
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,618
What's all this?

244
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,871
Posters. I went on an urgent pick-up run,

245
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,915
but moving them has been hard work.

246
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,542
That's not necessary…

247
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,710
Where to?

248
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,922
The third floor of the coffee shop.

249
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,806
You can drop it off down the hallway.

250
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,272
-Watch your hands.
-Thanks.

251
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,403
First my house, and now my workplace?

252
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,489
You keep bringing him home.

253
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,658
I met him just outside, you see.

254
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,994
Anyway, he checked out of his hotel.
That's where he's been staying.

255
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,496
I never asked.

256
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,958
Someone wanted to take him home,
but she's a crazy person.

257
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,544
I couldn't let them be alone together,

258
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,712
so I said we had three rooms.

259
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,882
If you're going to talk to yourself,
do it somewhere else.

260
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,802
If I could, I'd let him
stay in our living room.

261
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,595
Don't you agree?

262
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
Why don't I move out instead?

263
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,642
If you do, I might do something I regret,
so don't you dare.

264
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,936
It's like he's already unpacking.

265
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,397
May, please. He retired as a runner

266
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,566
and isn't in the right state of mind.

267
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,568
What if he dies of starvation?

268
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,070
I thought you wanted to move on.

269
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,615
You told me to let my feelings
run its course.

270
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,121
-Here you go.
-I doubt he'll let himself starve.

271
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,207
People don't announce that they'll die
when the time comes.

272
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,043
Besides, I'd rather he die by my side
and not by Ms. Seo's.

273
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,464
He's bound to be the death of you.

274
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,800
Stay put. I'll make it
as natural as possible.

275
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,885
Got it.

276
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,848
-How are you?
-Not so good, I'm afraid.

277
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,519
You see, someone has been targeting women

278
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,898
in our neighborhood by
mugging and terrorizing them.

279
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,982
Really?

280
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,735
I've been worried sick

281
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:59,114
about being mugged or terrorized
on my way home,

282
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,909
but then I heard you had nowhere to stay.

283
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,910
I do.

284
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,039
How about you stay at our place
for a few days?

285
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,207
No, it's okay.

286
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,541
What a natural way to ask.

287
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,585
We have three rooms.

288
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,587
You'll get the biggest room.

289
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,381
That's enough.

290
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,971
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

291
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,810
Thank you for this.

292
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,812
I guess you really enjoyed wearing this.

293
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,023
I never wore it again after that day.

294
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,984
Oh, I see.
At least you didn't throw it away.

295
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,069
Go on inside.

296
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,154
Where are you going to go?

297
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,281
To a different hotel.

298
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,119
Goodbye then.

299
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,169
HOPE YOU GET BETTER SOON

300
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,338
WE WISH YOU A QUICK RECOVERY

301
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,476
No one's here.

302
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,813
<i>Back then, I didn't know</i>

303
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,901
<i>that my choices would end up
hurting me forever.</i>

304
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,406
<i>I've never really been
sick of living like this.</i>

305
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,744
<i>Because I wasn't interested</i>

306
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,455
<i>even though it was my life.</i>

307
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,069
<i>Of all the things I've loved,</i>

308
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,448
<i>why have I never loved myself?</i>

309
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,004
Eat up.

310
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,718
How did you get into my house?

311
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,847
Are you here to live with me?

312
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,809
What did you say?

313
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,395
You're going to leave
once you finish this?

314
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,023
Okay.

315
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,841
I'm sorry for calling you all of a sudden.

316
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,552
I didn't have anyone to discuss this with.

317
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,930
After the recent article,
the public sentiment has changed.

318
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,141
Could you come back to coach for our team?

319
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,228
I'm sure there's someone
who's more suited for the job.

320
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,526
I actually checked the resume
of a potential candidate,

321
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,528
but he has been involved in some scandals.

322
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,740
The higher-ups think it'll be best
to have a coach in the long run

323
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,951
and aren't entirely against hiring him.

324
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,996
But they'd be a lot more relieved
if you were to return.

325
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,749
They would most likely think
that I'm not qualified.

326
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,210
But I'll look around for you.

327
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,379
I actually have someone in mind.

328
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,050
Director Dong, I need help,
but I didn't know who to ask.

329
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,345
There's a track and field coach
named Ms. Bang Bae-jeong.

330
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,306
Can you help me find her?

331
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,641
<i>I heard she's living a very secluded life.</i>

332
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,435
-<i>I'll look into it.</i>
-Thank you.

333
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,271
<i>How are you? Are you doing okay?</i>

334
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,522
I'm trying my best.

335
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,911
He never messaged me once,
but I guess he's alive.

336
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,000
What brings you here?

337
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,588
Must I help you
come up with an excuse again?

338
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,048
Come up with it yourself.

339
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,091
Okay.

340
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,344
I came to patrol the place
in case that mugger shows up.

341
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,973
-But I haven't seen anyone suspicious yet.
-There's someone suspicious right here.

342
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,103
By the way, the movie you translated
isn't in the theaters anymore.

343
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,022
It was long enough
for an independent film.

344
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,817
But seriously, why are you here?

345
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,490
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

346
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,159
Why did you come back
looking like a fool again?

347
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,953
Who bothered you this time?

348
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,914
You're here because you want to
stay at my place, right?

349
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,125
See? You should've come
when I asked you to.

350
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,545
If you really meant it,

351
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,505
can I?

352
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,967
Can I stay there for just a few days?

353
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,264
Let's go to my place.

354
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,225
Come on.

355
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,312
It's actually a ten-minute walk.

356
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,522
-Is that okay with you?
-Yes.

357
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,489
That gun must be really precious to you.

358
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,160
You always have it with you.
I guess it's not just for safety.

359
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,496
It was actually used as a prop
in one of my favorite movies.

360
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,789
I bought it at an auction.

361
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,625
And I got the autograph
from the director herself.

362
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,877
Have a seat.

363
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,797
When I won the auction,

364
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,593
I couldn't believe
that this gun was going to be mine.

365
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,637
All the actors in the movie
had that gun at least once.

366
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,598
You also had it for a while yourself.

367
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,643
I took that gun with me everywhere.

368
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,605
And one day, I ran into Ms. Colangelo
at a film festival.

369
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,566
So this is what I said.
"Hi, Michelle. I'm a big fan.

370
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,777
This is that gun from your movie.

371
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,071
Can I please get an autograph?"

372
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,240
The street was pretty packed,
so it was easy to run into people.

373
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,325
Sit down.

374
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,827
Gosh, I'm sorry.

375
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,205
You must be fluent in English.

376
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,582
Yes.

377
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,502
So it turns out you didn't get that gun
for no reason.

378
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,631
The same goes for you.
You also didn't help me for no reason.

379
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,508
I kind of did.

380
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,135
People tend to say
they did things for no reason

381
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,596
to prevent anyone from feeling burdened.

382
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,476
Then I guess it wasn't just for no reason.

383
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,692
Where's my room?
I think I should unpack first.

384
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,695
Well, this is your room.

385
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,615
This is the living room.

386
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,410
That's May's room. That's my room.

387
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,036
And this is your room.

388
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,917
Like I said, we have three rooms
including the living room.

389
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,797
You can use this chance
to take your clothes back.

390
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,715
I'll find them for you.

391
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,009
Let's see. Where did I put them?

392
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,431
Tinker Bell is in our house.
No, wait. He's more like Peter Pan.

393
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,057
Where did it go?

394
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,264
<i>Seon-gyeom is asleep</i>

395
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,184
<i>behind that door.</i>

396
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,981
SEON-GEYOM IS ASLEEP BEHIND THAT DOOR

397
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,561
<i>A day like today calls for a drink. </i>

398
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,524
<i>How about we finish this bottle,
and have three more.</i>

399
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,026
<i>Drink 'til we can't feel anything,
right?</i>

400
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,029
<i>That's what i'm talking about, Linda.</i>

401
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,616
<i>Here's to looking at you, kid.</i>

402
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,879
Pick up your phone.

403
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,760
HOUSEMATE

404
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,099
-Hello?
-I'm working until late today.

405
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,600
-Don't wait up.
-<i>May.</i>

406
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,270
I brought that guy home.

407
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,814
-<i>So don't get shocked.</i>
-Right back at you.

408
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,986
Yes, she's right.
I'm the one who's still shocked.

409
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,838
-Didn't you sleep?
-You're up.

410
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,299
I just got off work.

411
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,218
-You stayed up all night?
-When I'm busy with work,

412
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,178
I sometimes sleep at this hour.

413
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,055
Didn't you get any sleep?

414
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,641
Thanks to you, I slept well.
I'm going for a run.

415
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,567
Gosh, I guess I was worried for nothing.
He's so strong-minded.

416
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,667
Hello.

417
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,384
What a nice way to start the day.

418
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,886
It's the best kind of welfare.

419
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,057
You're finally up.

420
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,060
Gosh, I can't believe you're still here.

421
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,938
You're still half-asleep.

422
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,068
The moon is out.

423
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,659
I used some stuff in the fridge.
I'll fill it back tomorrow.

424
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,743
Sure.

425
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,381
Is that…

426
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,549
It's my meal.

427
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,870
-You must really care about your health.
-It's to stay alive.

428
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,289
Wouldn't it be better to exercise?

429
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,332
I take everything that's good for my body.

430
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,253
Then will you die
without these supplements?

431
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,380
I even quit smoking to live.

432
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,257
No, you didn't.

433
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,426
I only touched it, okay?

434
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,180
You feel better
just by holding it between your fingers…

435
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,140
Did you wait to nag at me?

436
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,558
I'm not nagging. I'm worried.

437
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,771
It sounded like you were nagging.

438
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,194
I waited until you got up
to ask you a question.

439
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,487
What do you want to know?

440
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,993
Hello.

441
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,538
-Me?
-Yes.

442
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,916
How did you know
I get off work at this hour?

443
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,542
I asked Ms. Oh.

444
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,545
I forgot to ask you this morning.

445
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,798
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

446
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,218
Okay.

447
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,888
Is there anything you find uncomfortable
at our place?

448
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,182
I guess I just exist there.

449
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,434
Doesn't Mi-joo bother you?

450
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,604
We barely even see each other
because I sleep when she works.

451
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,273
So you don't get to see her that much?

452
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,442
What a relief.

453
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:15,655
I haven't noticed anyone suspicious
in your neighborhood yet.

454
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,989
The mugger?

455
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,075
Do you patrol the neighborhood?

456
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,618
Every now and then.

457
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,745
But just in case, would it be okay for me

458
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,164
to come and pick you up
whenever you get off work late?

459
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,460
-No wonder she can't get over you.
-Sorry?

460
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,755
You don't need to worry about
being in a love triangle.

461
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,382
I'm asexual.

462
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:36,926
Okay.

463
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,261
Okay.

464
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,526
Did you get rid of my painting?

465
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,736
You should greet us first.

466
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,739
I'm home, guys. Did you get rid of
the painting in the gallery?

467
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,491
What were you doing at the gallery?

468
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,785
You're always busy with your work.

469
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,872
You mean the painting
that Myeong-min hung up in the gallery?

470
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,040
It's by an artist that I've found.

471
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,626
It'll help him get paid better
at the art fair.

472
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,670
How was it? I should go see it too.

473
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,048
He hung it on the best spot
to show off that he discovered the artist.

474
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,466
But it was trash.

475
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,011
How did you even find that artist?
You know nothing about art.

476
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,679
I have a good eye.

477
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,514
Sure. You do have eyes.

478
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
Why are you being so cranky?

479
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,643
Then replace it with a new painting.

480
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,606
Dad, it's not easy
to discover a talented rookie artist.

481
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,359
If you did it, so can I.

482
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,869
But you're right. It's not easy.

483
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,996
Go ahead and bring whatever.

484
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,497
But mine will always be better.

485
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,500
Okay, I get it. Can we eat now?

486
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,545
Dan-ah, what are you going to do
about your blind date?

487
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,090
You came to the head office and just left.
I'm quite upset.

488
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,885
I'll fix a date to go see you again.

489
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,929
I have to talk to Myeong-min anyway.

490
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,640
-Say it now.
-It's more than just words.

491
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,937
ASSEMBLYMAN KI JEONG-DO

492
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,110
FATHERS,
DO NOT EXASPERATE YOUR CHILDREN

493
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:24,951
INSTEAD, BRING THEM UP IN THE TRAINING
AND INSTRUCTIONS OF THE LORD

494
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,746
Sir, I brought the…

495
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,331
Sir, please.

496
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,293
Discuss it with us before you post it.

497
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,545
The strategy team exists for a reason.

498
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,258
Let me breathe.
This is the only thing I find joy in.

499
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,678
You need to think about atheists
and people with other religions.

500
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:50,101
-So what is it?
-Eun-bi is now with Ms. Seo's agency.

501
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,477
They already signed a deal.

502
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,650
But she told me
she's going to renew her contract.

503
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,820
Bring her to me
so I can hear it from Eun-bi herself.

504
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,948
She was seen near Bulguksa Temple
according to an online post.

505
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,449
So we're checking.

506
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,120
And as for Seon-gyeom, they were
going to suspend him for six months,

507
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,914
but he decided to retire.

508
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,041
What?

509
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,419
That darn punk.

510
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,842
How dare he retire without my permission?

511
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,094
He can't quit just because he wants to.

512
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,596
That arrogant punk.

513
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,184
Gather everyone from the association.

514
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,198
Go ahead. Take it.

515
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,034
Okay, I will.

516
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,952
Hey.

517
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,080
Do you live in this neighborhood?

518
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,457
No, I live somewhere else.

519
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,626
I see. I live in this neighborhood.

520
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,711
Okay.

521
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,387
Do you know me?

522
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,848
Don't you remember me?

523
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,518
You threw my drawing tube like a pro.

524
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,312
Will it work?

525
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,402
-Yes.
-You are…

526
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,738
-Yes, that was me.
-Right. I see.

527
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,616
You didn't have it with you today,
so I didn't recognize you.

528
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,785
It's because I didn't have class today.

529
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,879
Why are you doing this?

530
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,255
I thought you wanted to communicate
like E.T.

531
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,799
What's that?

532
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,634
Expressing your feelings.

533
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,761
This is how you do it.

534
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,480
Sorry I didn't recognize you.

535
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,317
It was such an unforgettable situation
that I had forgotten what you looked like.

536
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,069
I tend to leave a nice impression.

537
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,531
But why are you shopping here
when you live somewhere else?

538
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,950
I heard there's a mugger
in this neighborhood.

539
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:11,992
Really?

540
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,994
You're not having soju with that, are you?

541
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,998
Right, milk. I forgot about that.

542
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,751
This is for your drawing tube.

543
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,962
Are you sparing me the hassle?

544
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,133
Put your items on the counter with mine

545
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,592
so I can pay for them, okay?

546
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,804
My brother!

547
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,515
Can I treat you like my brother?

548
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,643
Wait. What's your name?

549
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,312
My gosh.

550
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,190
Thank you for everything, Seon-gyeom.

551
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,775
Why are you addressing me so politely?

552
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,571
Because you have a credit card
and bought me groceries.

553
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,614
I have to go that way.

554
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,074
See you again next time.

555
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,844
-You're here.
-I just came.

556
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:14,972
What is that?

557
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,224
My meal.

558
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,643
Are you too lazy to chew?

559
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,188
It may not look like much,

560
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,815
but this a balanced meal
full of essential nutrients.

561
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,734
I have no time to set the table.

562
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,110
I have to go to work too.

563
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,079
Where are you?

564
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,123
<i>Ms. Oh, I'm here.</i>

565
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,625
Where?

566
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,335
<i>Ms. Oh, I'm here.</i>

567
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,714
-Where? Where are you?
<i>-Ms. Oh, I'm here.</i>

568
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,136
Come in.

569
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,391
-Looking for this?
-Gosh.

570
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,394
There you were.
I've been looking everywhere.

571
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,979
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

572
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,319
Do you want to take a look?

573
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,404
-Would that be okay?
-Of course.

574
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,572
Come on in.

575
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,330
-Excuse me.
-Don't worry about it.

576
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,916
Check it out.

577
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,379
This is a newly released Blu-ray movie.

578
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,506
The title is <i>The Strange Red Carpet</i>.

579
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,591
I bet you didn't watch it.

580
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,011
The original title is quite long.

581
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,763
The literal translation would be

582
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,683
<i>The Strange, Narrow Passageway</i>.

583
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,601
But it sounded too suffocating,

584
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,229
so I changed it to <i>The Strange Red Carpet</i>.

585
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,064
Isn't it cool?

586
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,733
It sounds like the red carpet is the lead.

587
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,699
Whenever the sun sets on the road
the main character always takes,

588
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,617
and the wasteland turns scarlet.

589
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,453
People say that it looks like
the red carpet

590
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,789
despite the lack of cheer and cameras.

591
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,003
Fascinating, right?
Not all translators do this.

592
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,170
I'm very anal,

593
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,008
so I make sure the subtitles appear
at the right time.

594
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,970
This is my work diary and my schedule.

595
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,473
This helps me identify
what my problems are.

596
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,267
Since I'm a freelancer,

597
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,477
I don't have a boss who oversees
what I do.

598
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,574
EAT

599
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,994
EAT

600
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,957
You wanted to identify your problems.

601
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,544
Not having meals regularly
and only drinking juice

602
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,255
is a problem.

603
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,676
You must be bored since you're unemployed.

604
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,597
I am jobless, but it's difficult
to adjust to this lifestyle.

605
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,224
There's nothing to adjust to.

606
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,352
And you're not even doing it right.

607
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,896
What kind of jobless person
goes jogging every morning?

608
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,649
How can you do it every day?
Is that your schtick?

609
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,693
-You've retired.
-How can you spend all day sitting down?

610
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,864
How did we meet during the day?

611
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
I didn't sleep.

612
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,535
You should leave now.

613
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,670
-You said you'd hang out if I was bored.
-What? What did you say?

614
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,924
You said you'd hang out if I was bored.

615
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,302
I said I'd hang out if I had time.

616
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,347
Don't do this to me when I'm working.

617
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,598
You're demotivating me.

618
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,902
I'm joining you today.

619
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,988
I want to know how fun it is
for you to do it every day.

620
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,869
I'm making time to hang out with you.

621
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,132
Seon-gyeom.

622
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,637
-I have something important to say.
-What is it?

623
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,015
Let me take a breather.

624
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,019
Wait. Hold on. Wait.

625
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,604
I mean…

626
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,025
Teach me how to run.
This is my first time.

627
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,819
You ran so well last time.

628
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,071
Was it because you were robbed?

629
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,156
Start with your arms.

630
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,701
Point it upwards when swinging up
and downwards when swinging down.

631
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,205
And make a fist
like you're holding an egg.

632
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,417
The grip is too strong. Lighter.
Imagine an egg.

633
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,212
Why is your grip so strong?
You'll get tired quickly.

634
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,256
-A light grip.
-Why do you think so?

635
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,469
Moving on. Your arms are
the most important when running.

636
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:07,139
Fling them backward
to get the momentum going.

637
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,599
That'll make it easier.

638
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,850
Give it a try.

639
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,439
It's somewhat similar,
but loosen your shoulders.

640
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,608
They are loose.

641
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,527
Hold on.

642
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,362
Keep going.

643
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,619
Relax.

644
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:33,916
That's much better.

645
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,169
Lastly, let me teach you how to breathe.

646
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,712
If you inhale with your mouth,

647
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:41,089
it'll dry out quickly
and you'll tire soon.

648
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,553
Breathe in a four-four time. It's easy.

649
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,431
Just…

650
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,559
Just breathe.

651
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,731
Can't you do it? Even little kids can.

652
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,691
I can't because I'm an adult.

653
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,153
Nothing's impossible. Keep trying.

654
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,031
-Keep trying.
-You must be excited to see me struggle.

655
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,410
I'm excited to be running with you.

656
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,628
Maintaining your pace
is very important when running.

657
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,339
You can slow down if you're struggling.

658
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,009
Just don't give up.
You can do that as an adult, right?

659
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,597
What if I lose sight of you?

660
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,643
Then I'll wait until you come around.

661
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,274
Shall we continue?

662
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,067
Okay.

663
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,130
-Do you need to rest?
-It's okay.

664
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,392
Here's your tuition fee

665
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,769
for teaching me how to run.

666
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,313
Thank you.

667
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,526
I actually returned the favor
since you've taught me a lot.

668
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,238
I did teach you many new terms
and abbreviations.

669
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,032
It's all thanks to my job.

670
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,370
How was your first run?

671
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,206
I loved it.

672
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,958
-Really?
-Yes.

673
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,129
I didn't have to focus on anything
except running.

674
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,508
I realized that this was
your way of communicating.

675
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,345
That was a beautiful explanation.

676
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,515
You're right. You're a true translator.

677
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,978
How does it feel now that you've quit?

678
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,022
It was your job.

679
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,816
How does it feel to run for a living?

680
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,113
You're just out of breath.

681
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,782
Do you feel less out of breath?

682
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,661
I should look back on my life from now on.

683
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,456
How? Are you going to write in a diary?

684
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,418
Should I? It's boring being unemployed.

685
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,671
You don't deserve
to call yourself that yet.

686
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,089
You're always going out.

687
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,052
I guess you'll be going to bed now.

688
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,929
Yes.

689
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,225
I should start sleeping at night.

690
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,061
Mornings are so wonderful.

691
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,192
DIARY

692
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,864
I'm sorry.

693
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,367
I was on the phone
about my daughter's university entrance.

694
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,286
I'm unemployed, so I have plenty of time.

695
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,789
-It's okay.
-I can't believe you're unemployed.

696
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,290
It's so absurd.

697
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,629
She was your first teacher, right?

698
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,425
Yes. I believe it's all thanks to her
that I became a national athlete.

699
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,678
She rejected everyone who visited her.

700
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,179
No wonder she's legendary.

701
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,640
She wouldn't reject
her former student, would she?

702
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,016
I'll have to try.

703
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:23,520
Ms. Seo seems to be out.

704
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,481
She went to the headquarters
to talk about her blind date list.

705
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,609
I heard that you were on the list too.

706
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,572
I never agreed to that.
Why would they put my name there?

707
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,700
She likes alcohol,
so make sure to buy some.

708
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,119
-Don't go empty-handed.
-Okay.

709
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,830
Thank you.

710
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,546
It was such an uncomfortable encounter.

711
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,256
You've done well.

712
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,356
Hey!

713
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,568
-Have you gone insane?
-I kicked lightly

714
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,361
so you won't be disabled.

715
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,238
You know I used to play soccer, right?

716
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,531
Had you not tattled on me,

717
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,992
I would be playing
for Tottenham right now.

718
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,871
Don't you know I made you quit soccer
by outing you?

719
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,956
Should I make it so that
you can't ever set foot in here again?

720
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,666
You messed with what was mine.

721
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,714
You…

722
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,842
You're being this way
because of Jeong Ji-hyun?

723
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,844
You? Right now?

724
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,180
-How dare you!
-Exactly.

725
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,643
You should hit someone
who's also on your level.

726
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,729
Also, let me tell you what "outing" means.

727
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,233
"Outing" is when you disclose
an individual's sexual orientation

728
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,153
or sexual identity without their approval.

729
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,822
You outed me regarding soccer?

730
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,200
If you want to continue
doing business globally, study.

731
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,576
Study about genders.

732
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,038
-I went to an Ivy League school.
-Enough!

733
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,375
Don't upset me anymore.

734
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,919
Unlike how I look, I'm not too kind.

735
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,466
Damn it.

736
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,429
If I wasn't born rich,
I could have been more rowdy.

737
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,932
-More than now?
-Don't you think so?

738
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,059
Nothing's impossible for me.

739
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,104
How did you know?

740
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,024
I told you to stop!

741
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,736
I feel so shitty!

742
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,367
I could hear it. It must've hurt.

743
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,202
What if the chairman finds out?

744
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,330
I avenged you.
Don't you feel relieved or thankful?

745
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,877
You did so because he harmed something
that was yours.

746
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,754
I don't think I should thank you for that.

747
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,218
Thanks to you, I could vent my rage.

748
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,097
You're what they call
a talented individual.

749
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,606
CHILAN MOUNTAIN BEEKEEPING

750
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:14,517
Come on, Mom.

751
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,228
I still have so much, but you sent more?

752
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:40,043
How can a bracelet cost 10 million won?

753
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,048
Why didn't she demand compensation?
Is it because she's rich?

754
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:53,181
Who is this?

755
00:53:54,057 --> 00:53:56,768
-You're here early.
-Mr. Jeong called.

756
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:58,811
-I heard you called--
-Let's talk upstairs.

757
00:54:05,985 --> 00:54:08,988
What? Is she really his sponsor?

758
00:54:10,156 --> 00:54:12,450
Tae-woong, we really need to go.

759
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,203
Fine. Let's go.

760
00:54:15,995 --> 00:54:18,373
Kang Baek…

761
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,877
Lee Yeong…

762
00:54:23,378 --> 00:54:25,838
LEE YEONG-HWA

763
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,639
LEE YEONG-HWA

764
00:54:36,724 --> 00:54:37,892
I got you.

765
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:40,478
FOLLOW

766
00:54:41,604 --> 00:54:42,855
What?

767
00:54:43,898 --> 00:54:46,150
There are no photos of you.
Are you not confident?

768
00:54:50,113 --> 00:54:51,114
Wait.

769
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:57,745
Please send it over by Friday.
I'll confirm it.

770
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:00,248
Goodbye.

771
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:19,308
KI SEON-GYEOM

772
00:55:19,392 --> 00:55:20,309
He's--

773
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,272
Sell me the new painting at the cafe.
The owner told me to discuss with you.

774
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:27,525
You can speak casually to me.

775
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:33,031
-Here you are.
-You refused to paint a new one,

776
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:34,532
so just sell that to me.

777
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:38,327
You like my painting that much?

778
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,417
What happened here?

779
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,170
I didn't know it was wet and touched it.

780
00:55:47,253 --> 00:55:49,922
Don't you know that drying is
the most important step in oil painting?

781
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:53,342
It was for school,
and I hung it right after.

782
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:55,803
Art students often don't have the time
to dry their paintings

783
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:57,847
as the assignments have a tight deadline.

784
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:01,225
Seeing how you took the painting anyway,
you must really like it.

785
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,729
I do. I see time in your paintings.

786
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,231
You see, I value time the most.

787
00:56:09,984 --> 00:56:12,528
If you're not going to sell it,

788
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:17,366
I'd like my ten million won in cash.

789
00:56:18,785 --> 00:56:21,370
Right. You could sell your painting
for just as much.

790
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:22,789
-That's good, right?
-Pardon?

791
00:56:23,915 --> 00:56:25,792
It's a bit much for my painting.

792
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,126
Then give me the change.

793
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,545
And buyers are the ones
who put the price on them.

794
00:56:29,629 --> 00:56:32,215
If I say it's worth ten million,
then that's that.

795
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:36,344
-Why me?
-What do you mean?

796
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,512
Why my painting?

797
00:56:38,096 --> 00:56:41,265
Someone like you could ask
Monet or Picasso for one.

798
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:42,517
They're dead.

799
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:47,271
I'm not selling it.

800
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:52,485
You don't want to paint or sell.
What is it? Are you rich?

801
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:54,362
Hear me out, will you?

802
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,906
I drew that for the cafe.

803
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:59,951
If it's displayed anywhere else,
it loses its meaning.

804
00:57:01,494 --> 00:57:04,247
What if it was placed
at Seomyung Art Museum?

805
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,373
I don't care…

806
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:09,919
What was that again? Seomyung Art Museum?

807
00:57:10,711 --> 00:57:12,588
I'm going there?

808
00:57:12,672 --> 00:57:13,714
Your painting, not you.

809
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:23,808
My goodness.

810
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:27,437
You should improve
your communication skills.

811
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:32,066
What I meant was that
I'd rather paint you a new one.

812
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,570
That was what I was about to say.

813
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:37,780
You rejected me before.
You must be quite materialistic.

814
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:38,906
I was playing hard to get.

815
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,826
If I said yes right away,
I would've looked desperate.

816
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:45,663
This is why I'm so disgusted by artists.

817
00:57:45,746 --> 00:57:48,332
Give me your number. I need to speak
with you to get the drawing you want.

818
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,709
You can call Mr. Jeong.

819
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:52,003
You spoke to him,
so you must have his number.

820
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:57,300
You should go.
Give me the rough sketch by this week.

821
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:02,889
Thanks for the robe.

822
00:58:04,765 --> 00:58:06,601
Hey, about the rough… Answer…

823
00:58:07,268 --> 00:58:08,561
Hey, kid.

824
00:58:29,165 --> 00:58:32,210
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WON

825
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,386
CHILAN MOUNTAIN BEEKEEPING

826
00:58:49,685 --> 00:58:52,063
<i>My parents are beekeepers
and sent me too many.</i>

827
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:53,022
<i>It's pure honey.</i>

828
00:58:53,105 --> 00:58:55,691
<i>I know the number on your card
is for business.</i>

829
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:57,318
<i>Reply with your private number.</i>

830
00:59:02,198 --> 00:59:05,076
Mr. Jeong, please check
the origin of this ingredient.

831
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:06,744
You know I'm careful about what I eat.

832
00:59:14,043 --> 00:59:15,253
What is that?

833
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:17,505
Is that how it's going to be?

834
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,131
You shouldn't do that
when you're unemployed.

835
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:22,009
I thought bringing these would help.

836
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:23,803
What do you mean? Bring them where?

837
00:59:25,137 --> 00:59:26,973
I need my teacher's help.

838
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:29,475
I'm going to meet with her
and ask for a favor.

839
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:32,353
I'm so lost right now.
Does she live far away?

840
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:33,646
Not really.

841
00:59:34,397 --> 00:59:36,399
When will you be done with your project?

842
00:59:37,483 --> 00:59:39,485
I'm trying to finish it by tonight.

843
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:41,362
That way, I can have fun in peace.

844
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,072
The weather's lovely these days.

845
00:59:43,155 --> 00:59:46,033
Do you want to come with me?
You can get some fresh air.

846
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:48,869
Am I allowed to go?

847
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:51,455
I don't feel too confident alone.

848
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:53,457
There's a lot that I don't know.

849
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:57,336
Eun-bi lent me her car

850
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,547
and told me to get some fresh air.

851
01:00:01,549 --> 01:00:03,926
How nice of you to try and clock me out.

852
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,346
Since I don't have a boss,
I clock out when I think I should.

853
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,599
But when I do, I feel bad.

854
01:00:11,142 --> 01:00:13,644
That schedule of yours
is quite problematic.

855
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:17,523
Write that you'll get off work
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

856
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:20,776
Yes. I'll make sure to get it done by then.

857
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:23,237
I'm excited to work now.

858
01:00:31,078 --> 01:00:32,622
<i>This is nice.</i>

859
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,931
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

860
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,267
-<i>Ending navigation.</i>
-Apparently, we're here.

861
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:55,102
I don't think this is correct.

862
01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:57,688
It's the right address.

863
01:00:58,522 --> 01:00:59,565
What should we do?

864
01:01:00,566 --> 01:01:01,692
One minute.

865
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:08,616
I should look around a bit more.

866
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,117
It's the correct address.

867
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:13,371
It's blazing hot.
Let's have some ice cream.

868
01:01:13,454 --> 01:01:14,747
There was a mart back there.

869
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,417
You can wait there while I look around.

870
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:19,502
Okay.

871
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,049
I bought some ice cream.

872
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:28,302
GAMA MART

873
01:01:29,261 --> 01:01:30,346
Sit down.

874
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,139
Good boy.

875
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:32,950
"One hundred seventy-two."

876
01:02:35,578 --> 01:02:36,620
Is anyone in?

877
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:39,081
Ms. Bang?

878
01:02:58,517 --> 01:02:59,560
Ms. Bang.

879
01:03:03,272 --> 01:03:04,440
Ms. Oh.

880
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,067
Why are you with her?

881
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,444
I picked her up on my way.

882
01:03:09,195 --> 01:03:10,488
It's been a long time.

883
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:13,324
I was worried I couldn't find you

884
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,367
since you lived in seclusion.

885
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:18,662
It's not that. It's just hard
to get a connection here.

886
01:03:19,288 --> 01:03:21,624
Have you eaten?

887
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,043
No.

888
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,391
I don't have much,
but this drink is expensive.

889
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:43,646
-Can you handle alcohol better now?
-A bit.

890
01:03:45,606 --> 01:03:48,234
Goodness, he's such a gentleman.

891
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:51,529
What kind of gentleman peels fruit?
They won't even go near the kitchen.

892
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:53,197
Can you drink?

893
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,907
He's boring
since he can't handle his drink.

894
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,159
I enjoy drinking.

895
01:03:57,243 --> 01:03:58,953
I'll be your drinking buddy.

896
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,207
This must be expensive.

897
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,502
It seems like yesterday when we first met.

898
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:09,880
I can't believe
you became a national athlete.

899
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:13,592
Ms. Bang, we met for the first time
during your farewell match.

900
01:04:13,676 --> 01:04:15,886
It was the National Sports Festival.

901
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,556
I was so shocked when I saw you.

902
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,308
I thought Jeong-do had adopted you.

903
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:25,354
You should seriously thank your mom.

904
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:32,486
Who knew he'd become a politician?

905
01:04:33,529 --> 01:04:36,574
Never mind. I did see it coming.

906
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:44,039
Drink up, will you?
Did you come here to peel fruit?

907
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:51,589
I still have some.

908
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:59,346
Ms. Bang, a track and field
coaching position is currently vacant.

909
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:03,142
I was wondering if you could
take that position.

910
01:05:03,225 --> 01:05:06,520
I've been doing charity for them
for the past five years.

911
01:05:06,604 --> 01:05:10,357
Some of them are worth being nurtured
for the national team.

912
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:13,360
Goodness, you did well. I'm proud of you.

913
01:05:14,403 --> 01:05:18,490
What a shame. I enjoy my current life.

914
01:05:18,574 --> 01:05:20,200
I don't want to get involved again.

915
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:23,037
Ms. Bang, there are many prospects
in that team.

916
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,330
There are many girls too,

917
01:05:24,413 --> 01:05:27,249
-so I think it's best--
-I don't want to hear it.

918
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,004
-Ms. Bang, I--
-Get out. Go.

919
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:34,006
Ma'am.

920
01:05:36,342 --> 01:05:38,260
This gentleman…

921
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:40,429
Wait, what was his name again?

922
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:42,640
-Seon-gyeom.
-"Seon-gyeom"?

923
01:05:42,723 --> 01:05:44,224
Did you know that he came in last?

924
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:48,020
Do you or do you not?

925
01:05:48,103 --> 01:05:51,482
Of course, I do.
His record improved thanks to me.

926
01:05:52,191 --> 01:05:54,777
No way. I didn't know that.

927
01:05:56,195 --> 01:05:57,905
You're completely wasted, aren't you?

928
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,283
You see…

929
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:07,831
Listening to you, I couldn't help
but be curious.

930
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:11,460
Since he didn't ask, I will.

931
01:06:13,128 --> 01:06:18,342
Why don't you want to get involved again?

932
01:06:18,968 --> 01:06:23,138
You made a boy who came last
into a national athlete.

933
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:25,224
That shows how good you are.

934
01:06:25,307 --> 01:06:27,726
So why are you refusing his offer?

935
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:30,938
Who gave you a tough time?

936
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:34,316
Who hurt you?

937
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,402
I'm going to kill them all.

938
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,530
Goodness.

939
01:06:44,827 --> 01:06:45,869
Ms. Oh.

940
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:49,581
-Take her with you!
-Yes, ma'am.

941
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:52,876
Get up.

942
01:06:53,544 --> 01:06:55,337
This way. Over here.

943
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:01,260
-Are you okay?
-Let me go.

944
01:07:01,343 --> 01:07:02,469
I didn't touch you.

945
01:07:05,723 --> 01:07:06,682
Ms. Oh.

946
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:10,185
It's a dead-end that way.
Where are you going?

947
01:07:10,853 --> 01:07:11,895
Ms. Oh.

948
01:07:29,747 --> 01:07:30,831
Ms. Oh?

949
01:07:31,749 --> 01:07:33,042
Wake up for a minute.

950
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:37,254
Have some water. Here.

951
01:07:37,337 --> 01:07:39,465
What? It's not cold.

952
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:43,135
You should've refused
if you couldn't take it.

953
01:07:43,218 --> 01:07:44,970
She can drink you under the table.

954
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:52,728
Let me look around
for a bed and breakfast.

955
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:55,397
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

956
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:01,612
Don't go.

957
01:08:11,914 --> 01:08:13,207
I don't know. I just…

958
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,293
I'm worried you'll disappear.

959
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:22,049
I won't.

960
01:08:22,883 --> 01:08:24,635
You drank so much for me.

961
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:36,688
To be honest, I wanted to help out.

962
01:08:37,272 --> 01:08:38,190
That's a lie.

963
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:42,111
I wanted to see more of you.

964
01:08:43,112 --> 01:08:48,075
If I get drunk and go to bed early,

965
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,910
then I'd wake up early as well.

966
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:55,541
By doing that, I'd get to see you more.

967
01:09:00,462 --> 01:09:01,839
Gosh, my head.

968
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,174
Do you want more water?

969
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:06,844
-Are you cold?
-No.

970
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:08,095
Is there anything you need?

971
01:09:08,929 --> 01:09:10,305
I'll do everything I can.

972
01:09:11,473 --> 01:09:13,392
-Really?
-I'll try to.

973
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:16,186
You're saying that again.

974
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:18,063
You're…

975
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,607
You're so hardworking.

976
01:09:22,693 --> 01:09:23,652
Then…

977
01:09:26,071 --> 01:09:27,239
can you…

978
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,201
What did you say?

979
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:34,121
Can you…

980
01:09:36,123 --> 01:09:37,374
like me?

981
01:09:45,924 --> 01:09:47,509
I already do.

982
01:10:40,562 --> 01:10:42,356
<i>You must live around here.</i>

983
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:44,233
-Let me walk you home.
-He's like a baby.

984
01:10:44,316 --> 01:10:47,319
What is it about him that makes you
so protective of him?

985
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:49,488
<i>-I never said I liked him.
-You don't remember.</i>

986
01:10:49,571 --> 01:10:50,572
How disappointing.

987
01:10:50,656 --> 01:10:53,492
<i>-She even invited us to the premier.</i>
-Go with him instead.

988
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:54,993
<i>Seo Tae-woong, Seo Dan-ah…</i>

989
01:10:55,077 --> 01:10:56,787
<i>He was looking at you funny.</i>

990
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,413
<i>Stop crossing the line.</i>

991
01:10:58,497 --> 01:11:00,374
<i>But you came to see me
because I crossed the line.</i>

992
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:02,251
<i>Seon-gyeom! Where are you going?</i>

993
01:11:02,334 --> 01:11:05,963
-To see Ms. Seo?
-I guess he wants us to become a thing.

994
01:11:06,046 --> 01:11:08,715
<i>-Why the hospitality?
-Maybe I want something from you.</i>

995
01:11:09,508 --> 01:11:11,093
-Did you fight?
-Stop following me.

996
01:11:11,176 --> 01:11:12,761
<i>I guess it was just me again.</i>

997
01:11:12,844 --> 01:11:15,222
<i>What's with you and Ms. Seo?</i>

998
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:17,182
I'm going to have Ms. Seo

999
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:18,684
<i>marry Seon-gyeom.</i>

1000
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,602
Stop using me as the means
to fulfil your dream.

1001
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:22,229
<i>Should I file a missing persons report?</i>

1002
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:25,232
Could he be crashing someplace else?
