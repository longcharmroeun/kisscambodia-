1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,722
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,016
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,693
Damn it.

4
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,646
I'm sorry, ma'am.

5
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,920
-Son, you're here.
-Hi.

6
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:52,213
EPISODE 1

7
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,962
Do the cameras make you nervous?

8
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,256
They're blinding, that's all.

9
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,884
How silly of you.

10
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,222
That's Yook Ji-woo's son.
He's on the national team.

11
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,973
Where is her assemblyman husband?

12
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,100
Isn't he more well-known?

13
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,353
Someone younger
always makes better company.

14
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,313
He's handsome too.

15
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,649
We love you!

16
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,653
Finally, it's over. Good job.

17
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,988
Ji-woo, you need to get going.

18
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,407
The visual radio show is next,
so keep that on.

19
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,243
A visual radio show?

20
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,328
Only for the best, Ji-woo.

21
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,664
By the way, these are from your fans.

22
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,002
Son, what do you have planned next?

23
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm meeting up with some colleagues
by the theater.

24
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,466
We'll head there together, then.
It's on the way.

25
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,887
What do you say about joining me
for the visual radio show?

26
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,846
No, thanks.

27
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,557
Joining us today in Annam

28
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,560
is Yook Ji-woo, the Queen of Cannes.
Hello.

29
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,645
Hi.

30
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,815
Will we be able to see you
promoting a new movie next year?

31
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,526
I'm not sure,
but I'd be grateful for the invite.

32
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,779
I'd appreciate the interest
of those in the film industry.

33
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,282
Now, who was the young man
you stepped on stage with?

34
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,992
The partner of your next film?

35
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,206
He's the man
I love the most in this world.

36
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,834
Maybe I do because he resembles me.

37
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,003
Could you tell us about your new project?

38
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,754
Many are looking forward to it.

39
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,134
We haven't begun filming,
so I can't mention anything in detail.

40
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,804
It's one of those ordinary love stories
where one can be…

41
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,974
a nutjob,

42
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,103
a loser,

43
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,693
a psychopath…

44
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,779
Wait. I know this voice.

45
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,574
She's Yook…

46
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,993
Yook…

47
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,873
…a piece of trash,

48
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,670
or someone's first love.

49
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,426
I really wanted to be there.

50
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,887
Please look forward to it.

51
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,641
-That was nicely put.
-Excuse me, but what's going on here?

52
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,185
It's an event held by the festival.

53
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,811
Actually, it's already my third time.

54
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,731
-The woman inside…
-It's Yook Ji-woo.

55
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,067
You're still one of Korea's finest

56
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,903
-female actors.
-No way!

57
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,071
What's your key to success?

58
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,615
-I have to thank my family and my husband…
-Ji-woo…

59
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,909
-…who have been my biggest supporters.
-Not now.

60
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,285
My husband…

61
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,538
-Hey, May.
-The movie will start soon.

62
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,290
When will you be here?
Are you even coming?

63
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,167
I won't make it.

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,210
Why not?

65
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,837
Did something happen?
Were you in an accident?

66
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,548
You can say that.
I made it to the theater,

67
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,092
but guess who I saw.

68
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,135
Yook Ji-woo is before my very eyes.

69
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,095
Can you believe it?

70
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,306
I wanted to catch the first run,
but I'll pass.

71
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,350
Luck won't ever find me like this again.

72
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,060
It sure is your lucky day.

73
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,188
I'll send you a photo
of the closing credits, then.

74
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,067
-Sure. I'll hang up, then.
-I'm always trying my best.

75
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,026
I see.

76
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,029
-What do you typically do…
-May I sit with you?

77
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,865
-…for a workout?
-My regular exercise routine?

78
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,994
I walk 10,000 steps in the morning.

79
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,748
-How you stay fit is admirable.
-Ji-woo!

80
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,668
Wait, what's that?

81
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,422
-"Ji-woo, your skin is as fair as milk."
-She saw my message!

82
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,048
"I'm talking about your skin."

83
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,301
-Yes, your skin.
-I'm flattered.

84
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,305
You, over there, with the fair skin.

85
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,641
I appreciate it.

86
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,726
-You're the best.
-Ji-woo!

87
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,523
How sweet!

88
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,692
Should we eat first
or watch the movie first?

89
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,818
Why don't we eat first?

90
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,236
-I'm starving.
-Sure.

91
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,031
Did you see Choi Tae-ri earlier?

92
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,825
How can one even look like that?

93
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,619
I know. She is drop-dead gorgeous.

94
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,664
If I had known this was held
near the training center,

95
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,374
-I would have come every year.
-Exactly.

96
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,251
Could I perhaps get a ticket?

97
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,087
There's a movie I want to see.

98
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,381
You always complain
about not having money.

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,841
You never even buy us drinks.

100
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,636
I'm sorry.
If I win the prize next time, I'll--

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,305
I'll get the ticket for you.

102
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,934
There you are. You come waltzing in
bragging about your money.

103
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,315
Seon-gyeom,
you looked great on stage earlier.

104
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,025
I nearly asked you out.

105
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,949
-I'll get my ticket, then.
-Mine too.

106
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,867
Sure.

107
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,118
Why yours too?

108
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,329
Because you're rich.

109
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,331
You and Yook Ji-woo…

110
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,584
The photo of you and your mom
was uploaded.

111
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,629
My mom wanted to take one with me.

112
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,381
Then go to a photo studio.

113
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,133
Why let it get plastered online?

114
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,718
What an AS.

115
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,553
-What?
-What?

116
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,015
-"An AS"?
-What about it?

117
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,187
What does it mean?

118
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,148
Look it up online.

119
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,025
Why be proud of being ignorant?

120
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,237
I almost let you know.

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,323
Can I get two tickets
for Gone is the Night?

122
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,075
-I mean, three.
-Just a second.

123
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:54,992
Sure.

124
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,419
Seung-woo's need for speed was
what pulled the trigger on Yoon-sun.

125
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,990
What did you think?

126
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,076
-It was good, right?
-Right.

127
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,914
Did you enjoy meeting Yook Ji-woo?

128
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,168
If this were a dream, I'd stay in it.

129
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,797
You did a good job on the translation
despite the lack of time for spotting.

130
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,924
Spotting for a film festival movie?

131
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,635
I could barely keep up with the deadline.

132
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,012
I worked my ass off
to have this shipped abroad,

133
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,264
so I'm the one to credit if that happens.

134
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,974
You're only good for Sundance though.

135
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,685
-Here.
-Is this it?

136
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,188
-Thank you.
-Could we get your autograph?

137
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,105
Sure.

138
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,858
You work hard. I give you that.

139
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,236
Translating film festival movies
every year from Korean to English?

140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,864
Well, the reward is more exhilarating.

141
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,866
I do it all for this single line.

142
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,579
Oh Mi-joo?

143
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,208
It really is you.

144
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,752
I didn't expect to run into you here.

145
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,129
-It's good to see you.
-Really?

146
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,299
I doubt it'd be good
considering how we broke up.

147
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,218
Exactly how did we break up?

148
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,804
Like a scene from a movie.

149
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,684
Long time no see, May.

150
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,020
-I heard you became a film distributor.
-Right. Hi, there.

151
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,940
You've come a long way
to be translating for my movie.

152
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,900
Congratulations.

153
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,903
I kept it as professional as possible.

154
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,823
For someone
who claims to be a professional,

155
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,492
you truncated the male
protagonist's monologue too much.

156
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,785
Did you even get it right?

157
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,164
I kept it short to not ruin the scene.
The meaning was well conveyed.

158
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,625
It's not always good
to have long subtitles.

159
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,960
They ruin the immersion.

160
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,503
-Director Han.
-Yes.

161
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,798
You did a good job.
We'll talk more at dinner.

162
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,258
May, I'll see you later too.

163
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,597
Lucky bastard. I'm so jealous.

164
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,515
Unfortunately,

165
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,518
I can't go with you because
I have to be at a different event.

166
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,769
I'll manage on my own.

167
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,147
You saying that is most terrifying.

168
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,695
-How about a few drinks?
-Is there a pub?

169
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,989
Soju, here we come.

170
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,158
-Sure.
-Let's go.

171
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,536
-Hi, guys.
-It's us.

172
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,997
I thought you guys went back
to the training center.

173
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,125
How can we miss dinner
when Seon-gyeom's buying?

174
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,043
This looks great.

175
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,255
Set the table properly.

176
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:39,967
Here.

178
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,844
Cheers!

179
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,805
Director Han, I enjoyed the movie.
It was great.

180
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,016
-Thanks for saying so.
-Congratulations.

181
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,644
I have a good feeling about this,
you know.

182
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,563
Off to Cannes with you.

183
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,981
Thanks again.

184
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,318
I knew Seok-won would make it.

185
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,653
No other young director
is as well-known as he is.

186
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,364
All tickets for his movie were sold out.

187
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,158
-I know!
-When will our food be out?

188
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,493
It's on its way.

189
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,496
Mi-joo, I heard you were translating
the guest interview too.

190
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,164
-Really?
-Well, yes.

191
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,458
I can easily go from
translator to interpreter.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,293
I guess I'm a genius.

193
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,628
-That's so cool.
-Awesome.

194
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,005
All I did was follow
your guidance, Professor.

195
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,423
Isn't he handsome?

196
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,510
He scolded me often,
and one time I ended up crying.

197
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,096
Professor Hwang
mentioned you a lot, Mi-joo.

198
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,641
Out of all his students,
you translate the best.

199
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,559
You guys must be close.

200
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,353
I guess we are.

201
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,982
We're so close that I did everything
that required translation for him.

202
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,152
We're so close that he hardly paid me.

203
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,196
Mi-joo, there you are.

204
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,490
You should get over here. Come on.

205
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,033
-What about us?
-All right.

206
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,743
Sure, you guys can join too.

207
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
I'll make room for you both.

208
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,248
-One more.
-Over here.

209
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,708
Mi-joo, it's been a while.

210
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,960
-Here.
-Right.

211
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,337
Thank you for giving me a shot with this.

212
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,631
The head programmer and I
graduated together.

213
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,383
It was him who recommended you.

214
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,302
Since we're alumni, it could
add weight to the university name.

215
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,179
Yes, I know him too.

216
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,223
I volunteered
at the festival for a few years.

217
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,184
I translated urgent projects for him,
so I guess he liked it.

218
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,353
Right. Well, I was against it.

219
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,689
I see. You were against it.

220
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,525
My glass is empty.

221
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,361
You'll get sick if you drink
on an empty stomach.

222
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,073
Are you looking after him
now that he's a successful director?

223
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,741
-Who, me?
-Aren't you?

224
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,703
Our university hasn't seen
a late bloomer in years.

225
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,456
-I'll make sure to write a rave review.
-Thank you, Professor.

226
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,959
Are your glasses full?

227
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,419
Let's drink.

228
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,129
Wait.

229
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,339
I see that your glass is empty.

230
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,760
All right, then. Cheers for Han Seok-won!

231
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,262
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

232
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,931
-Cheers!
-Nicely done.

233
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,516
Can I get another bottle of soju?

234
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,727
SEARCH: AS

235
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,854
ATTENTION-SEEKING

236
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,816
BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO BE AT THE CENTER OF ATTENTION

237
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,776
"Attention-seeking"?

238
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,697
"Attention-seeker."

239
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,119
What?

240
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,670
Eat.

241
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,799
My research paper…

242
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,472
should be read by all aspiring directors.

243
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,473
Of course.

244
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:37,436
Movies by Andrei Tarkovsky
such as The Sacrifice and Stalker

245
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,648
depict the beauty of long takes.

246
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,026
The long takes and the mise-en-scène…

247
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,736
Boy, do I want to go home.

248
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,239
What did you just say?

249
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,367
Professor, your glass is empty. Let me--

250
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,329
No. Mi-joo should be the one
to fill my glass.

251
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,792
Professor, we should call it a night.

252
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,043
You seem tired and--

253
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,420
You're the one who's tired
because you got older.

254
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,548
Let's order more or head to another bar.

255
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,845
-Professor, are you all right?
-You can barely stand.

256
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,558
What? I can barely get it up?

257
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,771
I was just worried because
you can barely keep yourself upright.

258
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,607
How dare you!

259
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,442
Professor, what's wrong?

260
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,737
-Mi-joo, are you okay?
-I can take care of myself.

261
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,783
Female translators need a reality check.

262
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,576
Just because you're pretty…

263
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,954
Pretty faces may be good to look at,

264
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,582
but it's not enough
to excuse that attitude of yours.

265
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,632
What the hell?

266
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,015
Apologize, Professor.

267
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,559
If you do, I'll let it slide.

268
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,186
You think you're something now,
don't you? An apology?

269
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,105
Doing well in your field

270
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,566
doesn't give you the right
to disrespect me!

271
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,986
Fine. Then let me ask you this instead.

272
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,322
What has my pretty face
got to do with my translations?

273
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,743
Do the movies you watch
show the face of the translator on screen?

274
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,203
-That's never been the case for me.
-What?

275
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,164
Pretty faces are good to look at?

276
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,374
Do you even know what you're saying?

277
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,418
A comment like that in this day and age?

278
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,004
You must be from
a different era, Professor.

279
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,548
Are you from the Joseon era?
Are you a time traveler?

280
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,050
Who is your current King, then?

281
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,509
King Sejong? King Cheoljong?

282
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,053
Why you…

283
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,264
Professor, please. Professor--

284
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,392
Just let him go. He wants you to let go.

285
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,518
You're abusing the elderly.

286
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,771
Mi-joo, that's enough!

287
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,147
Get off me.

288
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,567
I graduated and am no longer your student.

289
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,028
I'm now a member of society
who has civil rights.

290
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,905
Is being a woman

291
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,991
reason enough for you to insult me
with sexist comments?

292
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,162
You're the one who humiliated me first.

293
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,706
You said I couldn't get it up.

294
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,583
What do you mean

295
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,085
I can't get it up?

296
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,544
I can't get it up?

297
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,713
Is that what you thought I meant?

298
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:15,385
How can this happen to me?

299
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,642
Excuse me, Doctor

300
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,937
-She said I couldn't get it up
-What? Hey!

301
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,273
-She said I couldn't keep it up!
-What?

302
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,068
-What the…
-Let go of me.

303
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,986
Who do you think you're talking to?

304
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,822
A wig?

305
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,957
-You, Oh Mi-joo!
-Professor.

306
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,959
-You asked for it!
-She didn't mean it.

307
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,377
-Professor.
-Likewise.

308
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,339
-What?
-You'll regret what you said to me today.

309
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,467
What the…

310
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,928
You, Oh Mi-joo, get back here!

311
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,764
-Professor, please calm down.
-Get off me!

312
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,267
Let me apologize instead.

313
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,686
-Please.
-Oh Mi-joo!

314
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,119
I shouldn't throw away garbage
on the street.

315
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,290
Hold on for a while.

316
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,958
About a year ago--

317
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,627
Ouch.

318
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,130
Sorry.

319
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,931
Thank you.

321
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,979
-That's a lighter.
-I didn't ask.

322
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,772
You're right.

323
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,108
Just forget you saw this.

324
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
Mi-joo!

325
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,946
Oh Mi-joo!

326
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,534
Gosh. Just a second.

327
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,329
Sorry. Just spare me three minutes.

328
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,753
-Let's go.
-No, I don't want to go.

329
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,131
Mi-joo, come on. Let's go already.

330
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,759
-No, I don't want to go.
-Just this once.

331
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,053
-Come on.
-No, I'm not going.

332
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,639
-What's with you?
-Are you really going to make me do this?

333
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,682
He was drunk. He just said whatever.

334
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,684
So what? I'm not going. Let me go.

335
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,437
-Come on.
-Gosh, you're hurting me!

336
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,441
My goodness.

337
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,696
Is this real?

338
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
Does this shoot real bullets?

339
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,366
What if it does?

340
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,370
I thought maybe I could make him
let go of your hand.

341
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,789
Do you know him?

342
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,959
I don't quite get it.
Are you helping me right now?

343
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,919
You fell because of me.

344
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,838
That's why he was able to catch you.

345
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,215
And three minutes isn't over yet.

346
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,176
I get that you're trying to help,
but why the gun?

347
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,761
Is it real?

348
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,138
I thought he'd at least
let go of your hand

349
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,848
or put his hands up in the air.

350
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,476
I guess I was wrong.

351
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,521
That only happens in movies.

352
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,982
-You look a little crazy.
-Exactly.

353
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,984
Who is this crazy man?

354
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,404
Or he might just leave thinking I'm crazy.

355
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,781
What?

356
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,731
Oh, my gosh!

357
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,276
Gosh, that totally startled me.

358
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,075
My goodness.

359
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,749
Get up.

360
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,298
-You should go.
-Okay.

361
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,885
My gosh, where did she go?

362
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,638
MAY 5, 2019
COLANGELO

363
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,947
Get ready.

364
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,004
-Thanks.
-I'll see you.

365
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,216
Is the sports news shoot this week?

366
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,094
Didn't they ask you for an interview?

367
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,683
Seon-gyeom,
are you doing an interview or not?

368
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,853
I already declined.

369
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,064
Why did you decline? Even I'm doing it.

370
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,483
You have the best record in Korea.

371
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,318
But I'm nothing. That's why.

372
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,196
If you call yourself that,
what does that make the others?

373
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,948
Are you trying to be humble or what?

374
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,741
Is that a compliment?

375
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,994
You have a weird way
of complimenting people.

376
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,829
Why would I compliment you?

377
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,372
Are you on drugs? Are you nuts?

378
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,460
Yeong-il, you really know
how to speak your mind.

379
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,423
The reporters will love
that attitude of yours.

380
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,716
Keep it up.

381
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,594
Good luck with the interview.

382
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,346
Gosh, that annoying punk.

383
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,849
He always thinks he's different and smart.

384
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,478
Seon-gyeom is always annoying.

385
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,646
Exactly. It's nothing new.

386
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,441
Hey, Gyu-deok.

387
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,821
-Yes?
-Seon-gyeom is my friend, not yours.

388
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,285
-Respect your seniors.
-Yes, sir.

389
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,622
See you guys.

390
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,500
-Bye.
-Bye.

391
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,523
I guess the guys
talked behind my back again.

392
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,817
Well, the thing is…

393
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:34,449
Yeong-il seems to keep you in check
even though he's the best athlete.

394
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,203
I mean, you're a really nice guy.

395
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,247
That's why he's always number one.

396
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:44,167
Then why do all the other guys
hate you so much?

397
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,380
You're tearing me down
with a smile on your face.

398
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,381
Me?

399
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,262
I think my personality
is changing a little.

400
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,723
Maybe it's because
I'm always thinking about

401
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,600
reducing my record time.

402
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,645
It's also difficult
how everyone's so strict.

403
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,939
Maybe I'm not used to the place yet.

404
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,525
Don't blame yourself.

405
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,860
Blame the ones
who made you become like that.

406
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,280
Does that include you?

407
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,406
Of course.

408
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,492
I'm sure I also played a part.

409
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,621
Seon-gyeom.

410
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,502
I got this for you.

411
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,046
You bought the movie tickets.

412
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,965
-Did you like it?
-No, not really.

413
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,176
I understand.

414
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,190
-You're so handsome.
-Gosh, thank you.

415
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,109
-I enjoyed your movie.
-Thank you.

416
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,152
Thank you so much.

417
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,949
Did you get home safely that night?

418
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,410
It was the worst day ever.

419
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,746
I ran into my ex-boyfriend
and lost my gun.

420
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,708
You're talking like a total stranger.
That's making my heart flutter.

421
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,960
Are you kidding me?

422
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,795
Can I punch you real hard?

423
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,133
-I thought you went back to Seoul.
-Why would I?

424
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,719
I have to provide the interpretation
for your interview.

425
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,347
-Don't ruin my excitement.
-You don't need to be excited.

426
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,432
Professor Hwang will be taking your place.

427
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,142
What?

428
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,525
Professor Hwang, I noticed you forgot
to take your wig.

429
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,487
I took it home
and washed it nice and clean.

430
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,203
My dear Professor Hwang.

431
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,829
Are you there?

432
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,834
Professor Hwang?

433
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,512
I really wanted to be an interpreter
for that movie.

434
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,265
Keep this up and I'll kill you.

435
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,642
Get the facts straight.

436
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,519
You're the one who took my wig.

437
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,230
-My goodness, hello.
-Wait inside, honey.

438
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,440
Hello, ma'am.

439
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,120
I heard you decided to interpret
Director Han's interview yourself.

440
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,373
Yes, he's doing well.
They call him the next Bong Joon-ho.

441
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,626
Did you watch Gone is the Night?

442
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,796
It was released yesterday.
Yes, I watched it.

443
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,464
You only saw it once?

444
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,134
It's a nonlinear movie,

445
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,302
and it's complicated
with a lot of metaphors.

446
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,722
And Director Han goes back and forth
when he speaks,

447
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,641
so it'll take some effort
to interpret what he says.

448
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,273
I understand you took the job from me
out of spite,

449
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,443
but think of the foreign audiences.
This is all on me.

450
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,529
Once I finish interpreting the interview,
I'll apologize to you--

451
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,157
I'll let you do it if you turn back time.

452
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,659
-What?
-You asked me if I'm a time traveler.

453
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,746
Why don't you go ahead
and turn back time yourself?

454
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,874
If you can, do it here and now.
Turn this back.

455
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,375
Back to when you used to have hair?

456
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,711
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

457
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,214
No, wait.
Professor Hwang, that's not what I meant.

458
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,884
These days,
people shave their heads for fashion.

459
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,594
So just be proud of yourself.

460
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,972
-This is my honest opinion.
-That's the problem!

461
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,599
Why are you angry at my sincerity?

462
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,100
Go! Get lost, you psychopath!

463
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,102
I will never forgive you!

464
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,062
My goodness.

465
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,788
I hung it on the doorknob, sir.

466
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,707
My gosh.

467
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,678
Did you go there to apologize
or to get on his nerves?

468
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,307
Don't ask. He got angry about
his bald head and told me to get lost.

469
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,977
-He even called me a psychopath.
-With his wig back on?

470
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,688
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

471
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,151
It's only getting colder,
and wigs keep getting more expensive.

472
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,822
Did you know? Wearing a hat
increases your body temperature by 1°C.

473
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,908
Just worry about
our heating bills for this winter.

474
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,785
Aren't you worried about polar bears?

475
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,203
I just don't get it.

476
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,081
I'm not the reason he went bald.

477
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,334
If you think of his wig as his hair,
you did make him go bald.

478
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,044
May.

479
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,672
Life is so hard.

480
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,715
-All of a sudden?
-Yes, it comes suddenly.

481
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,720
Just forget about it.
Let's go watch a movie.

482
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,347
We already booked a hotel.

483
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,892
I must have been
out of my mind that night.

484
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,019
And how am I going to find my gun?

485
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,356
Yes, that gun. Didn't you get it
autographed at a film festival?

486
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,943
Who was it again? Col…

487
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,738
-Cola.
-My gosh, May.

488
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,908
I told you so many times.
It's Michelle Colangelo.

489
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,245
Do you think I should have bought him
some red ginseng?

490
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,163
You went there empty-handed?

491
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,165
Get lost, you fool.

492
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,327
Seon-gyeom,
it took you exactly ten seconds.

493
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,953
It's your best time. Good job.

494
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,498
That was close. You could have
reduced it to nine seconds.

495
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,167
It took a while to get this far.

496
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,628
Keep it up until the competition.
Great job.

497
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,716
Why are your records getting worse?

498
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,886
Do you do martial arts?
Are you a bodybuilder?

499
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,722
You guys are bulking up
front, back, and sideways.

500
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,099
How will you run with that body?
You guys are huge.

501
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,269
Do a proper job, okay?
Stop slacking off and run!

502
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,104
Watch Seon-gyeom and learn.

503
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,522
-Yes, sir.
-Got it, sir.

504
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,640
Okay, go. Keep it up there. Good.

505
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,475
Woo-sik.

506
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,894
What's that on your face?

507
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,148
I fell while taking a shower.

508
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,110
I figured it might hurt if I sweat.

509
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,030
This is your first year.
You need to be on your toes.

510
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,324
I'm sorry, sir. I'll be more careful.

511
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,994
Watch out, okay? Now go ahead.

512
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,161
Okay.

513
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,456
That's right. One more time.
Keep it up there. Just one more.

514
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,001
Okay, good job.

515
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,309
Woo-sik.

516
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,650
I thought about something.

517
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,527
Would you like to hear me out?

518
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,323
Our coach is extra careful
with all the athletes.

519
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,161
Yeong-il only cares about himself.

520
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,331
And you're a complete stranger
to athletes who play other sports.

521
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,461
And you don't seem like the type
who enjoys hurting yourself.

522
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,885
You went to high school with
Park Gyu-deok and Kim Gi-beom,

523
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,346
and I think they've been doing this
since then.

524
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,557
-What do you think?
-It's nothing like that.

525
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,100
What is it, then?

526
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,148
I mean, at least lie about it.

527
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,567
I…

528
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,029
I lacked discipline.
That's why they did this to me.

529
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,572
You're actually going to lie?

530
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,700
It's not a lie. I'm really okay.

531
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,244
-Really?
-Yes.

532
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,955
You're okay with getting beaten up
for no reason?

533
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,918
And even if you did do something wrong,

534
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,337
are you really okay with
getting beaten up?

535
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,341
Can't you just ignore what you saw?

536
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,262
I don't want to cause a fuss
over nothing. I'll do better.

537
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,641
Let me tell you what it is
that you need to do.

538
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,521
Get a doctor's certificate.

539
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,606
This…

540
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,319
Take photos of this.
Take photos of all those bruises.

541
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,030
You never know what might happen.

542
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,199
Make sure you take photos, okay?

543
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,036
Even your back.

544
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,108
Hello, ma'am. I'm Oh Mi-joo,
Professor Hwang's pupil.

545
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,901
Is Professor Hwang inside?

546
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,320
Just a second.

547
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,283
What if he refuses to meet us?

548
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,038
If you feel uneasy about meeting him,
I could go in by myself.

549
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,543
You could've said that earlier.

550
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,256
Are you still there?
He asked me to say he's not here.

551
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,926
-Seriously?
-What's with this lady?

552
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,431
Ma'am, we bought some red ginseng for him.

553
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,224
Could you at least take this for him?

554
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,561
He says he can. Just a second.

555
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,815
That scrooge.
He must want the red ginseng.

556
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,995
May, long time no see.

557
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,623
So you quit translating
and became a film distributor?

558
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,833
I heard you're doing great.

559
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,586
-It's all thanks to me.
-You're still arrogant.

560
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,215
That's why I started my own business
instead of working for someone else.

561
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,175
It's because you lack social skills.

562
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,302
I'm about ten years your senior.

563
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,346
If you started a new career,

564
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,890
you should have reached out to me
with some job offers.

565
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,727
Gosh, you really have no respect at all.

566
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,189
When you make bone broth,
you need to have bones.

567
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,982
It takes an effort.

568
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,193
Why would I respect you
and reach out to you

569
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,319
when you taught me nothing?

570
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,528
Then why are you here?

571
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,198
You should've come to my funeral instead.

572
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,328
Sir!

573
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,955
You startled me.

574
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,499
A funeral? You should live a long life.

575
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,334
Don't even say that.

576
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,256
I was out of my mind that day.

577
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,882
The same goes for the day after.

578
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,136
Will you please let me interpret
for the remaining interview?

579
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,555
It's really important for my career.

580
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,646
-You want to be an interpreter that badly?
-Yes.

581
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,773
I promise I'll do my best.

582
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,859
Professor Hwang.

583
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,281
How long will it take to find me
an interpreter who can work for a week?

584
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,991
Sir.

585
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,795
I asked for someone who could follow
my son during his training

586
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,131
and help him speak
with the foreign reporters.

587
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,341
Did I ask for too much?

588
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,886
I had been looking around for the best
since he's a national athlete.

589
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,974
In that case,
I'd prefer someone who's poor.

590
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,936
They won't cause a mess later on
since they need the money.

591
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,689
I've found someone
who fits that condition.

592
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,774
Okay. Goodbye, Assemblyman Ki.

593
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,362
"Part-time interpreter," my ass.

594
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,074
Does he think you're still his student?

595
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,493
And what? You'll do it pro bono?

596
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,289
He's going to take
your pay and your commission for himself.

597
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,915
I'm really fine.

598
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,001
It's much easier than turning back time.

599
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,587
When will I ever get to interpret
for a national athlete?

600
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,423
This will be a stepping stone
for my career.

601
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,508
That cheap bastard.

602
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,386
He's so pathetic.

603
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,057
-Let's not age like him.
-Of course not.

604
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,519
Why hasn't the Grim Reaper taken him yet?

605
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,563
He must be busy.

606
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,024
May, go home first.

607
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,318
I need to practice my shooting.

608
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,579
Damn it.

609
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,510
Furry, I thought
you went to a film festival?

610
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,515
I'm there now.

611
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,683
But you're at a net cafe.

612
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,812
I couldn't sleep.

613
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,897
I lost my gun IRL.

614
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,776
No way. Did you find it?

615
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,196
No, I think someone just like me
farmed it.

616
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,492
I have a limited edition Ruger.
Care to buy it?

617
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,369
I'll sell it for cheap.

618
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,705
No way. Seriously?

619
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,167
Can we meet in Seoul?

620
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,511
FURRY KIM: OKAY!

621
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,772
It's so difficult

622
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,526
to live humanely.

623
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,285

YOOK JI-WOO'S MANAGER

626
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,231
MY PRETTY SISTER

627
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,816
What is this?

628
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,654
You changed your name on my phone?

629
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,531
Did you finally notice?

630
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,825
I changed it a while ago.
I guess it was futile.

631
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,368
What do you want?

632
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,912
What if I just called?

633
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,748
Apparently, siblings don't call each other
for no reason.

634
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,668
Did you make friends?
Where did you hear that?

635
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,213
Are you coming to the family gathering
next week?

636
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,715
There will be reporters there.
You better come.

637
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,925
Of course.

638
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,844
They even sent me clothes
in case I was going to go naked.

639
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,639
They're from Mom's manager.

640
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,357
-In case I threw it away last time?
-Did you?

641
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,859
-Not yet.
-Then take this instead.

642
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,903
I've changed the design.

643
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:13,989
Isn't it pretty?

644
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,658
This way.

645
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,871
I'll go with her.

646
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,382
What is all this?

647
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,011
Camping equipment. I go camping
with my kids on the weekends.

648
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,222
What a nice mom.

649
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,349
That's my hobby.

650
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,682
How was Palm Springs?

651
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,768
Dan-ah put in so much effort
to find the best hotel.

652
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,188
Thanks to her, it was nice,
but I felt burdened.

653
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,818
She probably spent a few hundred
million won on me in the past year.

654
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,863
Can she do that
when I belong to another agency?

655
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,575
Everyone knows that you became an FA
at the beginning of this year.

656
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,786
I'll be renewing my contract
since my father's close with them.

657
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,121
To them, an agency

658
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,498
is just a way to show off
without spending a lot of money.

659
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,002
The wealthy create golf clubs,
give sponsorships,

660
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,462
and create agencies as well.

661
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,921
And is yours any different?

662
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,799
Pretending to be so
helps us to be competitive.

663
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,262
You know you will be doing a photo shoot
with your brother, right?

664
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,183
Dan-ah prepared a lot for it so that
you could wear her company's clothes.

665
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,935
I'm escorting you today
so that you'll agree to do it.

666
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,564
I'm not a part of your agency,
so focus on Seon-gyeom instead.

667
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,868
Hi, I'm done swimming.

668
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,622
Could you give me a cup of hot coffee?

669
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,501
I knew it.

670
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,546
Eun-bi loves her brother so much.

671
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,884
Should I drop you off at home?

672
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,887
I'm not sure.

673
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,932
Do Seon-gyeom and I even have a home?

674
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,350
Of course you do.

675
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,728
Don't you live in Cheongun-dong?

676
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,231
It's not a home if it's vacant.

677
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,900
Seon-gyeom lived there alone
when he was little.

678
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,944
It's empty now that he's gone.

679
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,364
Please take me to a hotel.

680
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,831
No one's here.

681
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,259
My god, he looks so suspicious.

682
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,055
You're Angelic Smile, right?

683
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,557
I'm Furry Kim.

684
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,600
You're a woman?

685
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,979
Is that why you were never on voice chat?

686
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,523
It's all because of people like you.

687
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,858
May I see the goods?

688
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,151
Pay me first.

689
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,987
-I should see it first.
-Gosh, this is annoying.

690
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:41,989
Just pay me first.

691
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,991
You're so weird.

692
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,879
Let's do it simultaneously to be fair.

693
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,796
Gosh.

694
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,883
Do you think I brought a brick
or something?

695
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,220
This is awesome.

696
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,183
-Let me show you.
-No, I know.

697
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,603
Let me see it.
The reloading is a bit different.

698
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:17,816
Damn it.

699
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,656
-Hey!
-Move.

700
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,408
You asshole!

701
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,411
-Gosh. She's almost caught up.
-I'll kill you.

702
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,999
Hey! Stop right there!

703
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:34,917
Damn it.

704
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,044
Hey!

705
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,046
You bastard!

706
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,091
I'm going to kill him. Stop right there!

707
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,093
-Come here!
-Damn it.

708
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,347
You're dead.

709
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,766
I'm on my way, ma'am.

710
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,518
I'm almost there.

711
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,063
Apparently, today was my first leave
this year.

712
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,190
I didn't know.

713
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,483
I was going to rest,

714
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,528
but today was the only day
you were available.

715
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,656
I'm the one dying to see you,
but could you hurry?

716
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,741
Okay, I'll be there soon.

717
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,785
Sadly, I have nothing to throw at you.

718
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,078
Thief!

719
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,663
Is something going on?

720
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,332
Move aside!

721
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,810
Damn it!

722
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,229
-I'm hanging up.
-Come on!

723
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,816
What? Did he hang up on me?

724
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,153
Can I borrow that?

725
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,282
Will it work?

726
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,533
I'll have to try.

727
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,928
-The number you have dialed cannot be…
-What?

728
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,138
Did he reject my call?

729
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,440
-The number you have dialed cannot be…
-Is he playing hard to get?

730
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,694
Gosh.

731
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,822
I was so worried this would break.
You asshole.

732
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,204
Hello, sir. I caught a thief red-handed.

733
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:40,751
I'm in the middle of Jinguk Park.

734
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,336
-What's going on?
-Please hurry.

735
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,341
I'm going to kill this bastard.

736
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,097
How dare you scam a fellow gun nut?

737
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,643
I ought to teach you a lesson.
I will shoot you. Okay?

738
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,228
I will. I'm going to become
a killer today.

739
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,439
You son of a bitch, wake up!

740
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,443
Did you throw that?

741
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:07,945
No, of course not.

742
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,615
Well, it's mine, but…

743
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,494
He's the one who threw it.

744
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,918
Thank you for helping me.

745
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,129
Can you pretend it didn't happen?

746
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,424
I could get myself in a pickle
depending on

747
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,551
whether I was involved
directly or indirectly.

748
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,597
It's true that I didn't see you
throw that.

749
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,015
That's a relief.

750
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,768
Is that okay?

751
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,478
It's fine if it didn't break.

752
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,272
It's honey water.

753
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,025
I'm glad.

754
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,988
Then I don't need to compensate
for any damages, right?

755
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,239
I should get going, then.

756
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,411
We received a report.

757
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,872
Don't move.

758
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,792
Put the gun down!

759
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,585
This is fake.

760
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,295
It's fake.

761
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,881
I already knew that.

762
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,758
It's not real.

763
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,097
Help me.

764
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,610
Gosh, this really is intricate.

765
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,113
-It looks so real.
-Right?

766
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,240
There aren't many with such high quality.

767
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,200
I finally managed to get that,

768
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,078
but while I was looking at it,
he snatched it away and ran.

769
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,872
My heart broke.

770
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,125
I understand how you feel
and what went down at that park.

771
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,252
Please fill in this report.

772
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,254
Both of you.

773
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,642
That was a good throw.

774
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,603
I thought you didn't see me throwing.

775
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,771
STATEMENT
KI SEON-GYEOM

776
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,940
Right. I bet you threw well.

777
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,901
Thanks to you, I got my gun back.

778
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,904
-Are you sure it's fake?
-Of course.

779
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,614
Guns are illegal in Korea.

780
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,825
There are many perverts
who like to go against the law.

781
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,953
I'm not a pervert.

782
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,039
I didn't say you were.

783
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,879
Does that mean you sprinted
that distance for a fake gun?

784
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,382
Are you interrogating me?

785
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,550
Are you a cop?

786
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,097
Is that why you looked calm
when you first saw my gun?

787
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,015
I'm rarely startled.

788
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,392
And it obviously looked fake.

789
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,104
It was expensive
because it looked so real.

790
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,648
Are you a firearms expert or something?

791
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,903
I've come across many of them
due to my job.

792
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,697
Well, what's your job?
Are you John Wick or something?

793
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,118
-Who is that?
-Do you not know him?

794
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,077
No.

795
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,788
I see.

796
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,791
But why a pervert?

797
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,502
-Me?
-No.

798
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,254
Me.

799
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,090
Are you a pervert?

800
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,051
No. What I mean is…

801
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,012
When we were talking about guns
being illegal.

802
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,349
Forget it.

803
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,327
He must think I'm a joke.

804
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,830
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

805
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,915
He's still not picking up, is he?

806
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,628
Sir, buy me an ashtray.

807
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,797
Get me one of those thick, glass ones.

808
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,051
-Ma'am, before that--
-Why isn't Seon-gyeom picking up?

809
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,512
-The meeting will begin soon.
-He probably can't

810
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,849
since he's in police custody.

811
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,476
I see. He's in police custody.

812
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,273
Wait, where is he? How do you know this?

813
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,151
I witnessed it by coincidence. And--

814
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,195
Dan-ah!

815
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,905
Why is he here?

816
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,073
Your brother's here.

817
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,701
I told you to lock the door.

818
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,329
Did you swim again? I love this robe.

819
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,749
Wasn't he supposed to fly in tomorrow?

820
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,418
If I had stayed in Osaka until tomorrow,
you'd be working.

821
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,502
What's wrong with working?

822
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,547
Check if any of his fans
followed him here.

823
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,217
If there are any,
be kind and send them away.

824
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,134
Yes, ma'am.

825
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,385
Why do your fans like you?

826
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,637
To each to their own, right?

827
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,138
You should respect them.

828
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,559
-Then why do you like me?
-Because you're my sister, my family.

829
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,144
Then why do you dislike me?

830
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,605
-It's the same reason as yours.
-What?

831
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,650
Because you're my brother, my family.

832
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,198
Stop liking me. You're only bothering me.

833
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,909
Also, stop coming here.

834
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,788
Can I still come if I stop bothering you?

835
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,082
Why are you begging me?

836
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,668
Your fans just see you breathing,
and they go berserk.

837
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,962
Do you have that much free time?

838
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,798
Don't beg me for affection.

839
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,049
Didn't you--

840
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,769
Didn't you become an idol
to stop doing that?

841
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,899
I'm so upset.

842
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,485
Dan-ah, you're so annoying.

843
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,698
I rushed over here so you could eat this
while it was still fresh.

844
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,574
Have it if you want. See if I care!

845
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,420
Should I clean that up?

846
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,051
I just don't get why he's so dramatic

847
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,970
when we're only half-related.

848
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,723
Is he just good-natured
or downright crazy?

849
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,559
Does he even know
how precious time is for me?

850
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,272
We should reschedule Seon-gyeom's meeting.

851
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,065
Do you know why he's at the station?

852
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,151
It was related to some civilians.

853
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,114
I guess he didn't know
that athletes shouldn't get involved.

854
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,657
I should have told him.

855
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,159
I'll take care of it.

856
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,287
I trust the assemblyman. Right.

857
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,164
Did you look into it?

858
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,834
About the interpreter Assemblyman Ki
hired instead of me?

859
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,508
Goodness, it's already nighttime.

860
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,927
What will you do about the meeting?

861
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,804
I'm not sure.

862
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,682
Today may be the last time
you get to see me.

863
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,018
The president wasted her leave
because of me.

864
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,895
You must be famished.

865
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,481
I'm so grateful and sorry.
Maybe I could treat you--

866
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,316
I'm not hungry.

867
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,276
Then when do you think you will be?

868
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,612
You can give me your number
or your business card…

869
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,867
I'm not making a move on you.

870
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,286
You can say no if you want.

871
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,167
It's not because
I'm kind of unemployed and bored.

872
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,711
It's just because I feel bad
for what happened.

873
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,842
Since you're just staring at me,

874
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,886
I can't help but keep spewing nonsense.

875
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,598
This was how you stared at me
back at the park.

876
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,975
We're outside a police station
thanks to that,

877
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,395
and the president is going to kill me.

878
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,691
You were the only familiar face
in the crowd.

879
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,236
Is there a way I could save you?

880
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,949
Give me your number.

881
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,913
-Should I call you when I'm hungry?
-Sure.

882
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,209
Are you unemployed?

883
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,255
Not entirely. It's just temporary.

884
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,300
You're unemployed
if you're not working at the moment.

885
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,386
Here you go.

886
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,014
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

887
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:16,891
"Bang"?

888
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,518
"Bang!"

889
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,438
Just give me a call and I'll be there
like a bullet so we can eat.

890
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,859
So about that gun…

891
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,736
Is it even worth owning when it's fake?

892
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,324
It doesn't have to be real
to be worth something.

893
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,328
So what if it's fake?
I got it because I wanted one.

894
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,208
Why did you help me? Twice at that.

895
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,712
Well, I just did.

896
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,881
You must have a reason for helping me.

897
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,550
I don't.

898
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,179
You also got that fake gun for no reason.

899
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,055
I guess we're the same, then.

900
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,745
What's John Wick's profession?

901
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,163
John Wick.

902
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,665
What is his profession?

903
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,002
A killer?

904
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,424
Going on a business trip again?

905
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,134
Yes, for a film market.

906
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,095
Do you want anything from duty-free?

907
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,680
Ammunition.

908
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,308
Will that be tax-free?

909
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,102
Did you take care of everything?

910
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,064
May, do you believe in fate?

911
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,985
I do, only if he's handsome.

912
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,820
Forget it, then.

913
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,531
Sure.

914
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,159
I don't know this number.

915
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,495
Could it be…

916
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,414
Hello?

917
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,751
Sorry? Who is this?

918
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,010
What? No way.

919
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,973
He's a model?

920
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,812
I guess he's not available.

921
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,155
Ever since they got a new chef,
they don't taste as good.

922
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,365
You're right.

923
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,451
I hate it when I get full
after a horrible meal.

924
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,120
This is what I get for hard work?

925
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,042
Excuse me.

926
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,128
How may I help you?

927
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,464
I was told to come here
to interpret for the off-season training.

928
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:59,178
Are you Ms. Oh Mi-ja,
the assemblyman's special interpreter?

929
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,806
It's Oh Mi-joo.

930
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,393
I don't know about special,
but I came because my professor's wig--

931
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,062
I mean, my professor introduced me.

932
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,071
Are you rich?

933
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,991
Not that I know of.

934
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,786
I thought maybe you bought your way in.

935
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,289
I know that Professor Hwang Guk-geon,

936
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,875
who recommended you,
is the assemblyman's gofer

937
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,793
and crazy about money.

938
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,380
Does that make you a gofer's gofer?

939
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,885
Was this week-long interpretation job
worth soliciting for?

940
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,137
It definitely wasn't a job
that you could beg for and get

941
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,722
without executive consent.

942
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,931
I didn't beg for anything.

943
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,059
-You must be an executive, then.
-I am.

944
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,894
As you can see,

945
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,064
I own the athlete
you may be interpreting for.

946
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,735
Shall we grab a coffee nearby?
I haven't had one after my meal.

947
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,613
-You can work.
-Yes, ma'am.

948
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,132
I thought you had called me over to say hi

949
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,218
since we'd be
temporarily working together.

950
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,845
But it seems like you just want
to vent on me.

951
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:27,392
I'm upset because some politician
hired you behind my back.

952
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,937
I wanted to check if you were like him,
but I don't think you are for now.

953
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,398
I don't feel that great either,

954
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,401
because I'm starting to think
I really am the gofer's gofer.

955
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,904
If you're upset with some politician
and not me,

956
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,948
I'd appreciate it
if you could vent on him instead.

957
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,244
You're right. I'll do that.

958
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,248
Are we done, then?

959
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,542
Don't burden yourself with this job.

960
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,129
Our agency also has interpreters.
They're very competent.

961
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:01,217
You're going to fire me? Again? Why?

962
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,969
I'm not sure about "again."

963
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,304
But it's because we don't need you.

964
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,932
No, if I get fired,

965
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:11,394
I'd have to force myself to apologize
and suck up to him.

966
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:15,356
I'd rather die than do that.

967
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,360
Why would I care?

968
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,282
I have to do this job no matter what.

969
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,535
I can assure you that
I'll be the best temporary interpreter.

970
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,956
You've become
a completely different person.

971
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,459
Don't tell me you're going to
start begging on your knees.

972
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,922
What? Aren't you going to kneel?

973
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,215
Sorry?

974
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,473
Is it because it's grass?

975
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,022
Fine, you can do it.

976
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,065
If you want to, you should.

977
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,318
What a crazy--

978
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,235
Crazy?

979
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,114
I'm crazily thankful.

980
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,282
I see.

981
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,076
Yes?

982
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,317
So the athlete I'll be working with is…

983
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,486
Yes, that one.

984
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,572
I guess it's fate.

985
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,621
-Who is she?
-That's what I want to ask.

986
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,789
Who are you?

987
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,709
Most people know his face
even if they don't know his name.

988
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,295
He's Ki Seon-gyeom,
a national track and field athlete.

989
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,047
You can introduce yourself.

990
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,550
Is this our third time?

991
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,926
It's the fourth.

992
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,886
"I'm talking about your skin."

993
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:14,392
-I'm flattered.
-You, over there, with the fair skin.

994
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:16,936
Thank you.

995
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,606
Her shoelaces are untied.

996
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,360
-She's going to trip and fall.
-How sweet!

997
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,987
I love you.

998
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,156
Today, your shoes
don't have any shoelaces.

999
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,870
Yes. What?

1000
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,874
Why are you here today?
Is this another deal you're making?

1001
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,002
No. What do you take me for?

1002
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,545
You're the Deal Killer.

1003
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,845
I'm Oh Mi-joo, and I'll be your gofer.

1004
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,430
I'll also be your interpreter.

1005
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,058
Shall we shake hands
to formally introduce ourselves?

1006
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,154
Bang!

1007
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,993
I have your lighter.

1008
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,164
Are you really insane?

1009
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,541
I'm not insane.

1010
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,710
I'm Ki Seon-gyeom.

1011
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,287
Have you become more motivated
now that you'll retire soon?

1012
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,247
I assaulted someone, Coach.

1013
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,917
-What?
-Did you say you assaulted them?

1014
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,920
-What's wrong with your face?
-That drawing tube…

1015
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,506
-We've met before, right?
-I'm Lee Yeong-hwa.

1016
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,675
He drew all the paintings here.

1017
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:11,884
Sell this to me.

1018
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,803
-"Choi Tae-ri"?
-A love scandal?

1019
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,596
I'm so proud of you.

1020
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,141
Can you not tell anyone that you went
to the station because of me?

1021
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,102
Ms. Gofer. I mean, Ms. Oh.

1022
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,269
Ms. Oh, are you sleeping?

1023
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,939
-Then would you like to watch my movie?
-Just the two of us?

1024
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,273
Do you drink?

1025
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,068
You're wasted. You're an LW, aren't you?

1026
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,778
A lousy woman?

1027
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,155
Are you flirting with me?

1028
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,367
Keep this up, and I might end up
making a mistake.

1029
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,958
