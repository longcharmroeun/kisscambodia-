ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:16,787
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:22,654
Seon-gyeom.

00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:23,571
EPISODE 5

6
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:25,740
-Are you here to work out?
-I'm here to park.

7
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:27,450
I'll work out since I'm here.

8
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:31,079
I got you a membership so you'd work out,
but I guess you use it for parking.

9
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:33,164
But still,
it's nice that I got to run into you.

10
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:35,500
I know you got me the membership
for that reason.

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,960
So we'd run into each other.

12
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:38,712
You caught me.

13
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:43,508
-What are you here for?
-For the spa. Would you like to join?

14
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:46,511
I saw the news photo,
and your skin looked rough.

15
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:47,595
No thanks.

16
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,932
Is everything else okay?

17
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,059
Obviously not.

18
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:55,645
Your dad suggested
that we should go and repent.

19
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,356
Why would you repent
when I'm the one who caused trouble?

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,567
Because it's obvious that you won't.

21
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:03,445
I'll be off now.

22
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:04,738
-Bye.
-Bye.

23
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,948
Please wait in the car.
I need to talk to him.

24
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:07,991
Okay.

25
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:14,205
We're trying to stop the articles
from spreading.

26
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,333
But we have no control over social media.

27
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,669
Be careful not to do anything
to get your photo taken.

28
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:22,756
-Don't even throw garbage on the street.
-Got it.

29
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,008
Sir.

30
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,552
Can you update me first

31
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:30,221
on everything regarding my interpreter?

32
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:32,432
Why do you still care about her?

33
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:36,519
I owe her a lot.
It's only right that I care.

34
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:37,812
I don't understand

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,859
why you're always the only one
who has good manners.

36
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:47,530
That interpreter must've acted innocent
when she was with you.

37
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,366
But don't get fooled.

38
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,327
You talk as if she's a bad person.

39
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:57,332
Your dad asked her to keep an eye on you
and paid her in return.

40
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,834
And she took every single penny.

41
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:03,046
Does she seem like a bad person now?

42
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:04,839
He paid her?

43
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:14,599
It seems like you're the bad person.

44
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,234
Did my father pay you?

45
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:33,535
Remember what I said?

46
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,162
That I might make a mistake?

47
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,336
So this is what you call a mistake.

48
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,423
You have such a noble character.

49
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,384
I thought you meant something else.

50
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:53,304
It's true.

51
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:56,015
He paid me, and I took it.

52
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:00,395
You can be disappointed in me.

53
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,689
Don't stop yourself.

54
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,532
Now you know.

55
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,912
I've always been embarrassed of my dad
for being like that.

56
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:26,254
Why did you

57
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:28,882
take the money?

58
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:30,425
It could've gotten in your way.

59
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:33,136
I already have enough in my way.

60
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:36,431
People who give me money
already know about my weakness.

61
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:41,728
You might not know since you're rich,
but I've had this happen to me often.

62
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:52,697
OH MI-JOO

63
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,213
People who give me money think

64
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:11,216
they've reached a compromise
only if I take their money.

65
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:14,260
If I don't,
it means I'm going to ignore them.

66
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,727
How do you feel
now that you know I got paid?

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,187
You hate that kind of stuff.

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,355
I do.

69
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,193
Then you can hate me, be disappointed,
and just forget about me.

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,320
Yes.

71
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:35,698
And tell myself
that everything you did for me was fake.

72
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:41,454
But I don't want to.

73
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,668
Even if your words and consolations
were all fake,

74
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,629
they were still meaningful.

75
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,509
Why are you being so kind?

76
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:55,802
Because I want to.

77
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,639
-Why?
-I just do.

78
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,766
Seon-gyeom.

79
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:04,185
Don't be like that.

80
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,232
You may be embarrassed,
but I feel like a wreck, so just stop it.

81
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,696
I normally don't mind
taking that kind of money.

82
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,991
That's not even me at my lowest.
It's just who I am.

83
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:20,910
But this time,

84
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:24,080
I kept feeling uneasy about it
because of you.

85
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:29,627
You make me feel like I'm worthless.

86
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,715
You make me feel like a good person,

87
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,843
but then you make me feel
worthless at times.

88
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:39,804
But you see,

89
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,099
I really hate feeling that way.

90
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,566
Give me my gun.

91
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,883
Let's forget that there was anything
between us two.

92
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,180
I'll give it back if you say you won't.

93
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:24,766
-Are you kidding?
-No, I'm not.

94
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:29,520
Okay, fine. Whatever.

95
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:32,190
I'm too tired to even talk back.

96
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,151
Give me that.

97
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:05,098
Why is there no soju at home?

98
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:06,516
Who drank it all?

99
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,560
Right. I did.

100
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,230
I didn't buy any on my way home.

101
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,780
If I drink in this kind of mood,
that would be an illness.

102
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:25,243
Where are the sleeping pills?

103
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,829
I need to go to sleep. Where are you?

104
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:29,664
Here it is.

105
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:01,339
KI

106
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,594
Did you seriously just call me?

107
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,640
Must I start the day hearing your voice?

108
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:14,727
Are you bored?
You must be really bored without me.

109
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,105
<i>Are you getting anxious
because you're not training?</i>

110
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,607
I drank alcohol yesterday.

111
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,443
<i>Who is this? This can't be Seon-gyeom.</i>

112
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:25,154
Last time I drank, it felt pretty nice.

113
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:29,283
I heard people drink
to relieve their stress.

114
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:34,997
So I was going to drink a ton, sleep in,

115
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,750
and spend all day in bed.

116
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:40,169
But I found myself running again.

117
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:43,422
Is that why you called me?
Did you feel lost?

118
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,717
I have no one to talk to
because I don't have any friends.

119
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,429
What are you talking about?
Who do you think I am? Your girlfriend?

120
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,184
Hang up. I need to train.

121
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,148
What an annoying punk.

122
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:08,030
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

123
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,156
-You look great.
-Yes.

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,366
Hello, ma'am.

125
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,201
-Hello.
-Hello.

126
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,537
-Assemblyman Ki.
-Deacon.

127
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,122
I hear your son got into college.

128
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:18,207
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

129
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,750
-Thank you.
-Hello.

130
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,627
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

131
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,341
Hello.

132
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:31,220
Let's go.

133
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:38,853
WONIL CHURCH

134
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,658
Sir. Ma'am. Hello.

135
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,286
I heard the news.

136
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:56,662
You must be very upset.

137
00:10:56,746 --> 00:11:00,082
Yes. But it's all because
I wasn't a better father.

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,835
You must pray at times like this.

139
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,296
-Let us pray together.
-Okay.

140
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:11,969
Lord, kindly show us mercy
and forgive us the sins

141
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:15,306
we’ve committed this past week
with your gracious love.

142
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,267
Lord, your faithful believers,

143
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:23,272
Assemblyman Ki and his wife
are currently being tested.

144
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:25,441
-Amen.
-However, we trust

145
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:28,152
that this test is a blessing in disguise

146
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:31,822
to help them to do more good deeds
and achieve greater things.

147
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:33,074
Amen.

148
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,076
Their path is of full thorns
and hardships.

149
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,455
Lord! Please guide their children
toward the righteous path

150
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:42,375
so they can find their way
back to the church.

151
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,961
Dear Lord! Please bless this family

152
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:50,675
-with your everlasting love and peace.
-Amen.

153
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:52,468
I pray in the name

154
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:56,389
of our living Savior, Jesus Christ.

155
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:58,265
Amen.

156
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:02,937
-What's the matter with you?
-I want that!

157
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,897
-Buy me chocolate!
-What?

158
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,440
There's still some left at home.

159
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,025
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,037
Can I give it to her?

161
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,331
I bought more than enough.

162
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,874
Gosh, you don't need to.

163
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,460
Go ahead and say "Thank you."

164
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:28,379
Thank you.

165
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:00,202
I forgot I still had this.

166
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,371
Should I throw it away?

167
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,002
Gosh, it's really expensive.

168
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,087
Should I sell it online?

169
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,923
Why are you here today?
Is this another deal you're making?

170
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,300
You're the Deal Killer.

171
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:17,178
Of all the things he could've said…

172
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:27,271
You're a better actor than I am.

173
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,522
Watch what you say.

174
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm always sincere before the Lord.

175
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,819
I would be even more disgusted
if that was the case.

176
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,654
Assemblyman Ki.

177
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:38,240
My goodness, it's so nice to see you here.

178
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:39,992
It's been so long.

179
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,119
Things must be hard because of your son.

180
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:45,664
Well, yes. But I believe
it's all part of the Lord's plan.

181
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:48,042
Honey, say hello.
He's Assemblyman No Geun-seong.

182
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,877
He's a young politician on the rise.

183
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:53,672
Hello, I'm Yook Ji-woo. I'm his wife.

184
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,217
Gosh, you don't need
to introduce yourself.

185
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,970
I heard your daughter came back to Korea.
It must be nice to see her again.

186
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:02,598
Yes. Thank you for showing interest.

187
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:05,017
It's hard not to know about your family.

188
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:09,772
My dream is to play a round of golf
with your daughter.

189
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,859
We haven't met in a while,
so let's eat together.

190
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,611
-Sure.
-Let's go.

191
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:22,868
I bet you did great though.

192
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:25,496
It wasn't that great.

193
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,292
-My goodness, Ye-chan.
-Hello.

194
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:32,378
You're a senior,
but you haven't gained any weight.

195
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:35,673
You're getting prettier every day
just like your mother.

196
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:36,674
Thank you.

197
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:39,135
Your mom prays a lot
for your college entrance.

198
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:41,303
You should go to a nice college
like your brother.

199
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,346
Yes.

200
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:44,473
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

201
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,311
So prayers get me into a nice school?

202
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:51,605
Don't be sarcastic. She meant well.

203
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:56,152
-Ms. Dong.
-I haven't seen you here lately.

204
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,320
I come quite diligently for an atheist.

205
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:00,906
Aren't you going to eat? The assemblymen--

206
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,909
I'm on a diet.
I'm getting ready for a movie.

207
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:06,078
I see. Ye-chan, say hello.

208
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:08,122
She's Ms. Yook. She's my daughter.

209
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,373
Hello, Ms. Yook.

210
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:12,960
I really like the look in your eyes.
Do you exercise?

211
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,254
No. Not at all.

212
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:19,175
She used to box when she was little
to learn self-defense.

213
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:21,051
-But not anymore, right?
-Right.

214
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,678
She's fit for liberal arts.

215
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,930
Oh, I see. Then just forget what I said.

216
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:27,349
-Ms. Dong.
-Yes?

217
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,518
-Can we talk for a moment?
-Sure.

218
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:30,936
Goodbye then.

219
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:35,983
-I really like her.
-Why?

220
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:38,694
-Because she doesn't judge.
-She doesn't what?

221
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:41,780
She didn't judge how I looked.
She didn't compare me to you.

222
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,616
Is Korean hard for you?

223
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,410
You make it hard for me to understand.
Eat up.

224
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,747
-Hello.
-Hello.

225
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,665
Oh, hello.

226
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,085
What time is the table read?

227
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:57,713
<i>It's at 3:00 p.m.
Should I go pick you up, Ji-woo?</i>

228
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:00,633
Why did he have to bring me here today?

229
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:02,092
Aren't you sick of this?

230
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:03,928
I'm sick of living like this.

231
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:05,846
<i>But you still always go.</i>

232
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,890
-<i>Should I buy you coffee?</i>
-Yes.

233
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,185
Add three more shots
so I can drink it and die.

234
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,981
The agency must be in a mess.
What did the advertiser say?

235
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:17,858
They don't want a model
who beats people up, right?

236
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:21,237
We're dealing with it.
You know we're good at doing our jobs.

237
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,198
Seon-gyeom seemed to be doing okay.

238
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,575
-Did you meet him?
-I ran into him.

239
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,329
Please look into him every now and then.

240
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,206
You're closer to him than I am.

241
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,375
You can slowly get closer to him too.

242
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,210
You're right.

243
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,631
I wonder why I feel so embarrassed about

244
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,383
being close and friendly with my kids.

245
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,218
But you act for a living.

246
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,221
That's easier than being a mom.

247
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,932
I envy you. I need to do both.

248
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:54,144
Being a working mother in Korea
really sucks, doesn't it?

249
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,939
It'd be nice if Assemblyman Ki
could change things.

250
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:59,733
Gosh, that's probably
the last thing on his mind.

251
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,420
-Hey!
-My gosh, look.

252
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,339
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

253
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,300
This is 250mm.

254
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,719
Gosh, you get bigger every time I see you.

255
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:27,928
Thank you.

256
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:31,515
You guys exercise even during break time?
I'm impressed.

257
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,808
Your posture got better.

258
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:35,185
-Really?
-Straighten your back a little.

259
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:36,854
-Okay.
-Pull your chin down a bit.

260
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:38,314
-Okay.
-Perfect.

261
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,861
By the way, Mr. Ki,
did you really hit someone?

262
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,614
-Yes.
-You're lying.

263
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:49,950
-I don't lie.
-Don't lie.

264
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:52,202
Why did you hit them?

265
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:56,790
You shouldn't be asking me why.

266
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,501
Just think of me as a bad person.

267
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:02,171
Now that I'm here,
I'll help you fix your postures.

268
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,881
Let's see you guys move your arms.

269
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:06,967
You can't be a bad person.
You promised to be our coach.

270
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,011
-Move your arms.
-Were they seriously hurt?

271
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,138
Wouldn't they forgive you
if you apologized?

272
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,306
Move your arms.

273
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,892
She's right. You can start over.

274
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:17,519
"Start over"?

275
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:21,523
"Start over"? I don't know.

276
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,279
I don't know if I'm standing in front of
the starting line or the finish line.

277
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:31,492
I don't know if this is the beginning,
nearly over,

278
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:33,202
or the end.

279
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:35,204
What do you mean?

280
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:36,914
-I'm not sure.
-Give it.

281
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,957
-Give it. It's mine.
-Wear something else.

282
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,460
-There are so many.
-I grabbed it first.

283
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:43,420
-Shouldn't you stop them?
-That's mine.

284
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:45,089
You're the adult here.

285
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:47,716
Not on my own though.
Could you lend me a hand?

286
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,884
Sure.

287
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,844
-Hey, what's going on?
-Stop arguing!

288
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:52,429
-Guys.
-Come on!

289
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:21,750
<i>I'm embarrassed to tell you this,</i>

290
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:24,253
but it's because of the articles.

291
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:27,965
Since this is an educational facility,

292
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:32,886
the management have been
showing their disapproval.

293
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,723
Even the parents complained about you
mentoring the track and field athletes,

294
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:41,562
and we've been receiving calls
about how you're a bad influence.

295
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:43,689
I understand.

296
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:50,696
The teachers have known you for years now,

297
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,698
and we know this isn't who you are.

298
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:55,242
But you can never really tell
what someone is like.

299
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,706
I'd like to keep sponsoring the athletes,

300
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,251
so would it be okay
if I did it under a different name?

301
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:09,423
Thank you. We wouldn't mind.

302
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:10,924
Neither would I.

303
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,904
Only 500m to go!

304
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,197
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

305
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,285
I'll take on that musical film.
The next <i>La La Land</i> as you call it.

306
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,455
I already handed it over
to another translator.

307
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,332
I have to be busy. I need to be.

308
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:44,500
You're being weird.

309
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,753
Someone gave me money recently
out of pity.

310
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,755
Lucky you.

311
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:53,675
It's not easy receiving free money
at this age.

312
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:56,803
-I gave it back.
-That's a shocker.

313
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:58,222
For Ki Seon-gyeom's sake.

314
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:04,061
Is it him that you've been pitying?

315
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:07,272
Being pitied is the worst, you know.

316
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:10,108
Can being pitied be bought too?

317
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,527
Lucky rich bastards.

318
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:13,904
What about you then?

319
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,740
When did you buy the right
to pity Ki Seon-gyeom?

320
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,661
That's totally different.

321
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:26,250
And how am I supposed to know that?

322
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,044
It was Ki Seon-gyeom's father who paid me

323
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,046
and Ki Seon-gyeom found out.

324
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,965
How's that for context?

325
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:34,967
That prick of an old man.

326
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,511
How dare he treat you like some bum?

327
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,014
What's funny though

328
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:45,394
is that I'm worried he might've
told his son about my adversities.

329
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:49,773
I'm scared that he might have found out
that I've been putting up an act

330
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,900
when I have nothing to offer.

331
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:55,195
What has he to find out
when you never hid it?

332
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,032
I guess I'm just embarrassed of myself.

333
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,578
He's so annoying.
He makes me feel like a loser.

334
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:04,663
That hurts.

335
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,166
So are you just going to end it?

336
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:12,713
It's the end of the road
once you start pitying someone.

337
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:16,383
-Last rep!
-Let's do this!

338
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:21,013
Why bother training
when it won't lead to a gold medal?

339
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:27,936
Ashamed, my ass.

340
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:30,272
You're bolder than ever.

341
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:44,745
PRESIDENT SEO DAN AH

342
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,339
Here's the list for this quarter.

343
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,308
Each one is crappier than the next.

344
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:07,976
A pure list of trash.

345
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:11,104
The second son
of Dongjeong Pharmaceuticals is a divorcé.

346
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:14,149
-And he has a son?
-He got divorced twice.

347
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:18,904
Am I only allowed to marry
someone with flaws?

348
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:22,032
I guess my father thinks I'm flawed
since I came out of the closet.

349
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,034
Or maybe he's punishing me for lying.

350
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:28,413
KI SEON-GYEOM

351
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:30,123
Is this his father's doing?

352
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:33,043
Look at him
quickly selling off his damaged son.

353
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,507
He's the youngest here though
and isn't bad to look at.

354
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,967
It's his way of telling you
to come by the company.

355
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,260
When I'm this busy?

356
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,221
What do you think though?

357
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:48,683
Choosing the pretty Ki Seon-gyeom to marry
will solve my marital issue.

358
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:52,687
Why aren't you answering?

359
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:54,648
Because he'll probably decline.

360
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:00,028
You're right.
Put down a day to visit my father.

361
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:01,196
Sure thing.

362
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,248
While Greece has its mythology,

363
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:13,458
Korea has the myth of Dangun.

364
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:17,921
I'm sure that explains
why we should study Greek gardens.

365
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:21,591
In that sense,
we'll move on to the Garden of Adonis.

366
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:24,052
I'm sure Adonis
is a familiar name to all of you.

367
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,596
He was the lover
of the beautiful Aphrodite.

368
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,849
It's said that he loved to hunt.

369
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:32,227
However, while out hunting,
he was bitten by a wild boar and died.

370
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,646
Imagine how heartbroken
Aphrodite must have been.

371
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,024
She poured nectar, the drink of the gods,
over his blood

372
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,652
which created the flower known as anemone.

373
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:46,032
Why should we learn about Greek gardens
when we're Korean?

374
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:47,951
I should've dropped this class.

375
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:49,828
Did you find your card case?

376
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,706
I probably dropped it somewhere.
I canceled my cards for now.

377
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:55,167
You need your student ID
to work late on campus.

378
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,543
I did in freshman year,

379
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:59,212
but now the security guards know my face.

380
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:03,258
You've gone onto bewitching
the security guards of all people?

381
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,469
Why are people laughing at me?

382
00:25:05,552 --> 00:25:07,304
Do I look funny?

383
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:16,354
So I'm a cat today.

384
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,732
What's with that boring response?

385
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:21,276
It's nothing new. So what's for lunch?

386
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:22,736
Grilled fish.

387
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,156
Grilled fish?

388
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:29,201
Grilled fish, meow?

389
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:30,911
-What the hell?
-Meow.

390
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:34,623
After eating grilled fish,
I'll head to the studio.

391
00:25:34,706 --> 00:25:35,916
-Meow!
-You're crazy.

392
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,083
-Meow!
-Damn it.

393
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,418
Lighten up, will you?

394
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,128
Yeong-hwa!

395
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:44,382
Are you done with classes today, meow?

396
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:47,844
We were wondering
if you could help us, meow.

397
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:50,055
Some boards have to be carried
to the studio,

398
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:52,474
but we're lacking the manpower, meow.

399
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:55,936
I'll be there after lunch, meow!

400
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,354
-Got it, meow.
-Got it, meow.

401
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:58,396
Meow!

402
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:08,532
I thought you were
the prince of the art department,

403
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:09,574
but you're the slave.

404
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:14,120
However, this slave is more into
someone cool than cute.

405
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:15,747
Someone cool? A fellow student?

406
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,459
No, someone who lives
at a place so high up

407
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:22,003
that I can barely see her.

408
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:23,964
A modern-day Rapunzel?

409
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:27,884
Rapunzel?

410
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,222
I do wish to drag her down.

411
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,477
-I want to color this.
-Teacher!

412
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,271
-Do you need help?
-Here.

413
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:41,106
Maybe a little later.

414
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,233
I'm all done. Whatever.

415
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:44,693
Look at this.

416
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:47,070
-I want…
-Want me to draw something?

417
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,488
-What should I draw?
-Yes?

418
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,240
-Here.
-Let me see.

419
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,117
-That's pretty.
-Is it a watermelon?

420
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,702
What will you draw?

421
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:56,454
-Hold on.
-It's a rabbit.

422
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,623
-Here.
-Should I draw you one too?

423
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:00,792
-Also, a cat.
-A cat as well?

424
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,210
That's what you'll draw?

425
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:05,130
Okay. In a moment's time though.

426
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:08,174
-What will you draw?
-Over here!

427
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:10,051
-Right.
-A giraffe, too.

428
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:12,679
-Do you want to draw a giraffe?
-What should I draw?

429
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,328
Your order will be ready soon.

430
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:37,746
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

431
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:40,457
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

432
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,668
<i>Gone is the Night</i>
won awards in India and Bergen.

433
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,837
It's all thanks to you.

434
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,214
Director Han must be thrilled,

435
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,508
but it's you who did
most of the heavy lifting.

436
00:27:50,592 --> 00:27:53,803
It's thanks to you that
I made it to the festival in one piece.

437
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,307
-Did you watch <i>The Strange Red Carpet</i>?
-Yes.

438
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,975
Will you revise the subtitles?

439
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,436
I'd jump at the chance to revise my work.

440
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,188
I get to perfect it.

441
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:07,025
I'm just sorry
that we won't be able to pay you.

442
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:10,612
Don't be silly.
I'm only doing it because I want to.

443
00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:13,531
You seem to be sporting a tan.
Were you off on vacation?

444
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:17,035
-Please enjoy.
-It was for a shoot, not vacation.

445
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:19,496
The sun was blazing in Chungyang.

446
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:20,538
Is that so?

447
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:24,209
You went over this script last year.

448
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,170
-Do you remember it?
-The American indie film?

449
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:30,423
It's filming in Korea too, right?
I see filming has already begun.

450
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:33,969
How can you ask someone to join the movie
two months before filming?

451
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:35,220
This is killing me.

452
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:38,515
It must be hard to interpret
the words exchanged on set.

453
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:40,100
You have to translate both ways.

454
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:42,477
-Tell me about it.
-Goodness.

455
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,605
You were in a movie club
in college, weren't you?

456
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:49,651
Yes, those were some fun days.

457
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:53,571
I don't remember
ever mentioning that though.

458
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:57,075
Oh, that. Well, you see,

459
00:28:57,158 --> 00:29:00,870
Director Han said that's where he met you.

460
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:03,623
Right. Director Han and I

461
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:06,751
-go way back.
-Yes, you two dated.

462
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:09,462
I mean, you broke up.

463
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:12,507
I should've become a widow instead.

464
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,217
Is it too late for that?

465
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,721
No, you know how they say
it's never too late.

466
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,597
-It's not late at all.
-Damn him.

467
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:28,481
Good, you're here.

468
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:31,276
You sound like you're dying.

469
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:35,113
Gosh. I ran upstairs from the first floor.

470
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:37,323
So much for going on a walk.

471
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,909
-Did you have a meeting?
-Yes, with Hui-jin.

472
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,747
There's a rumor going around

473
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,583
that I only got the job
because I dated Han Seok-won.

474
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:50,503
Apparently, everyone on set gossiped about
how we used to date.

475
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:52,630
Even his girlfriend was there.

476
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,966
-I see.
-What?

477
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:59,512
Why does it sound like you already knew?

478
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,431
How can I not know what Hui-jin knows

479
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,641
when I work in this industry too?

480
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,435
Don't ask why I didn't tell you.

481
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:09,397
You haven't been yourself lately
and I didn't want to add onto that.

482
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:19,908
LONG TIME NO SEE, FRIENDS
I'M GETTING MARRIED

483
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:23,119
SEOUL HOTEL, HILL LOUNGE, 2 P.M.

484
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:26,956
No way. Yoon Gong-ju's getting married.
She's giving out wedding invitations.

485
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,918
Yoon Gong-ju?
The one you went to Florida with?

486
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,003
With? She practically dragged me there.

487
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:33,588
The princess needed a maid

488
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:34,964
and I needed the funding.

489
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:37,926
Why here of all places?

490
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,178
This is where Seon-gyeom stays.

491
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,387
I'm not going.

492
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:43,681
Yes you are.

493
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:48,853
You can't tell your heart to stop feeling.

494
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:52,315
It's never too late to do so
when it sends you a signal.

495
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,027
Just be grateful that
you have an excuse to run into him.

496
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:57,153
An excuse?

497
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,906
As if I'd really go.

498
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:01,449
There's no way I'm going.

499
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,867
No way.

500
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:08,164
May, can I borrow your purse?
I can't look shabby!

501
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,793
Kim Woo-sik…

502
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:16,798
Why hasn't his article been published?
Are the reporters sleeping on this?

503
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:30,186
Merciless, aren't they?

504
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,196
Ta-da, here's today's main dish.

505
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:42,907
-Here.
-The wedding invite.

506
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:43,992
Let's take a look.

507
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,035
My gosh, how pretty.

508
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,496
Is this where your wedding is at?

509
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,664
I'm jealous!

510
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:53,376
My darling went through hoops
booking the venue.

511
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:54,586
Lucky you.

512
00:31:55,336 --> 00:31:56,254
Mi-joo,

513
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:58,089
why aren't you getting married?

514
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:01,134
-Why are you?
-Why am I getting married?

515
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:02,635
Yes.

516
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:05,722
My parents have been insisting and…

517
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:11,519
-Why must I explain this?
-You realize that after you're confronted?

518
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,314
I only asked because I care about you.

519
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,817
It's more weird staying single
than getting married.

520
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:21,654
You can't afford to be this naive anymore.

521
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:24,908
-I thought that made me charming.
-It did when you were 20.

522
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,454
You upset me a lot back in the day,

523
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:31,331
but I never said anything, you know.

524
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:32,874
She'd never hang out with me

525
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:35,293
because she was too busy
working part-time jobs.

526
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:38,630
Money for tuition and meals
doesn't just fall from the sky.

527
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:40,548
Why not ask your parents for the money?

528
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:42,133
Hey…

529
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:49,682
Sorry. I forgot about
your parents being gone.

530
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:55,980
Hey, Woo-sik.

531
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:59,192
<i>I heard you left the training camp.</i>

532
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:01,444
<i>You moved out completely.</i>

533
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:02,654
The public is enraged,

534
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,740
so staying would only bring trouble
to others and you.

535
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:07,867
Of course, I should leave.

536
00:33:11,162 --> 00:33:12,205
Right.

537
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:14,582
I guess you're right.

538
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,668
Call me whenever you're in Seoul.
We should eat.

539
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,671
-How about this week?
-<i>This week?</i>

540
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:22,090
I want to treat you to a nice meal.

541
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:24,509
It slipped my mind

542
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:27,762
that you were in that foster--

543
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:30,014
-Foster care?
-Yes.

544
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:33,142
It's just that you always seem
bright and happy--

545
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:37,021
Should I seem glum all the time
so that you never forget?

546
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:40,483
Must you put it that way?

547
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:42,193
No wonder you're still single.

548
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:44,821
Stop it, you both.

549
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:46,823
Must you argue on a day like this?

550
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,366
I'm sorry, guys.

551
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:50,368
I'll make it up to you some other time.

552
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:51,619
I'll get going then.

553
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,584
Must you be like that
when you know her situation?

554
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,795
She's all haughty
despite being beneath me.

555
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:02,755
She's only nice to you guys.

556
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,174
That's because we're nice to her too.

557
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:06,718
Whatever.

558
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:10,346
Excuse me, can we get some more wine?

559
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:19,355
Seriously, May?
What's with the cigarettes?

560
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,946
No way.
Not after what it took for me to quit.

561
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,993
Okay, I'll smoke just one.

562
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,545
Damn it, May.
Isn't there a lighter in here?

563
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:43,921
I'm sorry,

564
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:46,924
you can't smoke
on the premises of the hotel.

565
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:49,677
Not having a lighter is shitty enough,

566
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,929
but now I'm being told
I can't freely smoke.

567
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,431
-Unbelievable.
-I'm sorry, but--

568
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:56,684
Could I perhaps borrow a lighter?

569
00:34:56,768 --> 00:35:00,355
I don't carry one
being a non-smoker and all.

570
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:01,939
I see.

571
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:04,817
What should I do then?

572
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:09,238
Beats me. Maybe--

573
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:10,907
-Let me help.
-Hello.

574
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:15,078
She's with me. I'll take it from here.

575
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:21,000
And this… Follow me.

576
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,794
Were you perhaps just at the lounge?

577
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:24,587
Yes.

578
00:35:40,144 --> 00:35:41,229
Did you hear everything?

579
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:43,773
-Hear what?
-Anything.

580
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,361
I did. Music, to be exact.

581
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:54,492
When did you spot me?

582
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,161
When you took this out.

583
00:35:57,245 --> 00:35:59,038
You could've looked the other way.

584
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:01,624
I was waiting to say something to you.

585
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:04,502
That's out of the blue.
Why didn't you call or text?

586
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,921
Woo-sik wants to treat us to a meal.

587
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,172
He just told me, you see.

588
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:10,550
I see.

589
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,760
He doesn't know your number,

590
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:14,720
so he asked me to invite you instead.

591
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:19,350
"Us" as in you and me?

592
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:26,357
If that's the case,
please tell him the gesture is enough.

593
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,277
I won't be there
if it makes you uncomfortable,

594
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,820
so please accept his offer.

595
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:36,701
Then please text me his phone number.

596
00:36:36,784 --> 00:36:38,119
I'll take it from there.

597
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:45,209
That movie was still showing.

598
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:47,545
-Which one?
-The one we saw together.

599
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:50,047
The one you had to watch
since you didn't know

600
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:51,382
when it'd be taken down.

601
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:55,803
Did you really believe me?

602
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:57,805
Was it a lie?

603
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:01,184
I wouldn't call it a lie,
but I had to say it.

604
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,313
It was an excuse to make you stay.

605
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:07,815
Same here.

606
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:10,818
Mentioning Woo-sik and the movie
was an excuse

607
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:12,278
to keep you from going.

608
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,995
Anyway, just in case,

609
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,708
please know that I didn't come here

610
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,544
so that I'd have a reason to run into you.

611
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:32,423
I was here to meet some friends,
and I already had my meal and coffee.

612
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:35,343
I hate working out
and home is where I sleep.

613
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,845
Why did you ask me to follow you earlier?

614
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:41,307
To escort you to a smoking area.

615
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:43,434
Unbelievable.

616
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,272
It's times like these
that make me fond of your personality.

617
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:50,233
I thought you hated it.

618
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:53,778
The cigarette…

619
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:57,073
I'll figure it out myself.

620
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,116
I feel a lot better now, you see.

621
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:02,954
Thank you

622
00:38:03,955 --> 00:38:05,998
for not asking what's wrong.

623
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,209
I mean it.

624
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,555
CROWN PUB

625
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:22,056
-It's ours.
-Enjoy.

626
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,432
Thank you.

627
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,017
Finally, a hangover meal.

628
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:29,814
It's good.

629
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:31,148
-Is it?
-Yes.

630
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,029
How many chickens can you buy
with two million won?

631
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:38,447
A hundred.

632
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:39,532
A hundred?

633
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,786
That means she gave me a robe
worth a hundred chickens.

634
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:45,830
Have you met anyone like that?

635
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,084
My mom's CEO carries a bag
that's worth ten million won.

636
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,002
Ten million won?

637
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:55,381
-How many chickens can you buy with that?
-Five hundred.

638
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:57,883
Did you get swindled out of money?

639
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:02,555
Forget it. She's actually the one
who was swindled.

640
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,228
Hey, didn't you say your mom works
for an agency?

641
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,605
What was it called again?

642
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:11,897
DANN.

643
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:14,025
It's DANN, isn't it?

644
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:15,484
Yes.

645
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,695
Do you want an internship?

646
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,577
Yes.

647
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,787
I'm eating with Yeong-hwa.

648
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,290
Okay.

649
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,585
-Was that your mom?
-Yes.

650
00:39:33,502 --> 00:39:35,254
She wants me to bring something over.

651
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,589
She left something.

652
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:39,759
Hey, I brought my bicycle.
I'll give you a ride.

653
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,302
Let's stop by the bank on the way.

654
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:43,763
-Did you get your tutoring fee?
-Yes.

655
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:44,680
I see.

656
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:47,600
Pay for the chicken.
My mom's the one paying you.

657
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:49,644
I need to spend that money elsewhere.

658
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:52,146
I may be having cereal
for the entire month.

659
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:02,114
Could you please check?

660
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,200
How many I help you?

661
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:07,411
I'm here to see Director Dong Kyung.
She told me to bring this.

662
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:09,330
Yes, I heard.

663
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:12,166
The meeting will be over soon.
Come upstairs with me.

664
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:19,077
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

665
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:25,709
She's the one who carries 500 chickens.

666
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:32,800
It really is her.

667
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:34,176
You came together.

668
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:38,680
Hey. This is my son, Goh Ye-jun,
and his friend, Yeong-hwa.

669
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,641
This is President Seo Dan-ah, our boss.

670
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:42,392
Hello.

671
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,563
How old is your son again?

672
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:47,981
How old are you?

673
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:50,067
-I'm 23.
-He's 23 years old.

674
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,569
He went to school early,
so he's younger than his friends.

675
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:55,072
I see. It's nice to meet you all.

676
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,493
Ye-jun, my hands are full,
so please follow me.

677
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:00,744
Yes, ma'am.

678
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,746
Let's go.

679
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:32,109
Have you been painting?

680
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:35,195
Yes, at school for an assignment.

681
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:37,447
How did you know?

682
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:40,659
How could I not?
You're reeking of varnish.

683
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:44,496
So you can see me.

684
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,040
Why did you ignore me just now?

685
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,879
Because I didn't see the need to.

686
00:41:51,962 --> 00:41:53,505
I didn't think we'd meet again.

687
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:56,550
So you only say hi when you need someone.

688
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:06,435
I don't know what that is,
but I don't think I need it.

689
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:07,936
-It's money.
-It is?

690
00:42:09,354 --> 00:42:10,439
What's this for?

691
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:13,275
It's 500,000 won for the bracelet.
I said I'd pay you back.

692
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:15,152
Oh, that?

693
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:17,779
You could've left it at the lobby.

694
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:19,823
But it's such a hefty sum of money.

695
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:22,159
A hefty sum?

696
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:28,540
Did you hear that?

697
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:35,714
What's so funny?

698
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:39,760
Why do I feel offended?

699
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:47,684
I still haven't received the email
that I need to confirm.

700
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:49,394
Yes. I'll check up on it.

701
00:42:59,154 --> 00:43:00,072
Ms. Seo.

702
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:03,283
Aren't you going to greet me?

703
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:09,915
You're required to come here
from time to time

704
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:13,210
and forced to look through
some prospective partners.

705
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:15,629
It's such a pain in the ass.

706
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:16,922
You're so noisy.

707
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:20,842
The smallest mutts bark the loudest.

708
00:43:20,926 --> 00:43:22,094
They're such cowards.

709
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:26,098
If you want to help your family out,
just get married.

710
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:28,934
Fulfill your duties as a daughter.

711
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:34,022
I know it was a lie
when you came out of the closet.

712
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:40,237
Are you talking about me being a lesbian?

713
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,573
Yes, that.

714
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:46,743
How could you do that
just to get out of getting married?

715
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:49,955
-You should be ashamed.
-Are you outing me right now?

716
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:51,748
In front of a third party?

717
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,250
Hey, Seo Myeong-min.

718
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,252
"Hey, Seo Myeong-min"?

719
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,337
-Are you crazy?
-My courtesy must have made

720
00:43:57,421 --> 00:43:59,923
you think you're better than me
when I'm actually older.

721
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:02,926
You call Tae-woong a bastard,
but you're also one yourself

722
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,303
and talk down on the legitimate heir.

723
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:08,181
Society has come a long way, hasn't it?

724
00:44:11,226 --> 00:44:13,228
No matter how much progress we've seen,

725
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:15,772
you'll never become a CEO

726
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:18,900
because I'm the rightful heir, you wench.

727
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:25,407
You're right.

728
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,493
You fit its definition perfectly.

729
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:31,663
"A daughter born
of the mainline of descent

730
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:34,458
may not take over
the responsibilities of her family shrine.

731
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:38,712
But a son from a lowly mother
may take over the responsibilities."

732
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:41,548
Lowly mother?
Did you just badmouth my mom?

733
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:44,843
Both you and I like women
and want to become the CEO.

734
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:47,179
But it's abnormal for me
and normal for you.

735
00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:50,432
The only difference we have is our gender.

736
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:58,190
Should I expose the fact
that you're an illegitimate child?

737
00:44:58,273 --> 00:44:59,483
What will happen then?

738
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:05,363
How dare you threaten me?

739
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,950
Look at you. I only stated the facts,

740
00:45:09,034 --> 00:45:11,244
but you got scared and took this
as a threat.

741
00:45:12,704 --> 00:45:16,625
Mr. Jeong, I'm in a terrible mood.
I don't think I can see the chairman.

742
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:21,797
I ought to…

743
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:23,840
Had we met outside…

744
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,092
Stop glaring at me.

745
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:30,722
This is why I dislike you.

746
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,809
You obey me right away,
so I feel more offended.

747
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:35,685
I'm sorry.

748
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:39,773
If you are,

749
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:43,235
know where your loyalty lies, Ji-hyun.
Got that?

750
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:47,989
Don't be a fool who listens to a woman.

751
00:45:49,282 --> 00:45:51,493
Are you two dating or something?

752
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:57,082
I told you to stop glaring.

753
00:45:57,707 --> 00:45:59,334
I told you to stop!

754
00:46:01,294 --> 00:46:03,296
I feel so shitty!

755
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:06,508
Damn it.

756
00:46:49,384 --> 00:46:51,094
Here's your coffee.

757
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:30,318
What are you doing?
You should come inside.

758
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:32,779
It's nothing.

759
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:34,531
What about you?

760
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:37,158
I'm filling in for the owner.
She has to leave early.

761
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:39,119
-Come. I'll give you coffee.
-It's okay.

762
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:43,081
I'll come next time when you're working.
I don't think I should say hi.

763
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:45,709
What are you talking about?

764
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:48,461
I need to make more canvases.

765
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:51,464
Bye. Work hard.

766
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,010
You can fix this, right?

767
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,308
We can't fix this here.

768
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:45,310
-Go to the store.
-Where is it?

769
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:47,812
Probably at a department store
or Cheongdam-dong.

770
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:51,649
Goodness, what happened?
This is worth ten million won.

771
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:54,861
What? How much?

772
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,238
Ten million won?

773
00:50:14,714 --> 00:50:17,425
She was wearing 500 chickens.

774
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:19,552
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

775
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:24,015
RESERVED

776
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:26,768
Ma'am, one small duck soup
and soju, please.

777
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:28,561
Okay.

778
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:35,819
Ms. Oh.

779
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,070
What?

780
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:38,822
What are you doing here?

781
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:41,032
And you? What are you doing here?

782
00:50:41,116 --> 00:50:43,284
Woo-sik is buying me dinner.

783
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:45,620
I'm also here
because he said he'd buy me food.

784
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:49,624
It's you, right?
You're the only young customers.

785
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:51,668
It is you two.

786
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:53,253
A-ryeon asked for a reservation.

787
00:50:54,212 --> 00:50:55,630
Don't you know who that is?

788
00:50:57,298 --> 00:50:58,550
May we get some water?

789
00:50:58,633 --> 00:50:59,926
Coming.

790
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:03,221
Hurry up and sit down.
Move. Don't stand in my way.

791
00:51:05,014 --> 00:51:06,474
Then…

792
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:09,936
I'll eat over there. You two can eat here.

793
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:15,483
You need to order at least two servings
per table. Can you eat that much?

794
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:17,527
Just sit with us.

795
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,071
I already said I won't be joining you.

796
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:25,285
I thought you meant
you won't be eating with us.

797
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:31,374
Woo-sik can't make it.

798
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,626
What?

799
00:51:34,169 --> 00:51:36,629
He wants us to reconcile.

800
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:39,924
-What?
-I think this was intentional.

801
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:42,468
<i>My grandma's friend is the owner.
Their food is tasty.</i>

802
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:44,387
<i>You two fought in Jeju, right?</i>

803
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,015
<i>I hope you make up over some good food.</i>

804
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:48,016
<i>I'll sit out.</i>

805
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:50,602
Gosh, you're still avoiding each other.

806
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:53,271
We don't have many seats.
Just sit together already.

807
00:51:54,522 --> 00:51:56,858
And drinks? Do you want some soju?

808
00:51:56,941 --> 00:51:58,067
Yes, please.

809
00:51:58,735 --> 00:51:59,736
Look at you.

810
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:18,421
How is Woo-sik doing
physically and emotionally?

811
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:21,758
He sounded okay, but who knows?

812
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:23,968
And you?

813
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:27,430
I'm…

814
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:28,931
I should've asked sooner.

815
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,558
Right.

816
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:35,188
I'm putting up with people calling me
a violent athlete.

817
00:52:35,813 --> 00:52:36,647
Thanks.

818
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:39,025
And you?

819
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:42,487
I'm working on a Blu-ray…

820
00:52:43,404 --> 00:52:46,908
Right. How do I explain?

821
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,035
I'm just working on a good project.

822
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:54,665
I was disqualified.

823
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,211
Have you been dropped?
I didn't read anything about that.

824
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:00,713
Those articles will come out soon.

825
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:03,299
But this is about
the track and field coaching position.

826
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:05,760
You mean those young kids?

827
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:23,653
Did you know that fast athletes
are born that way?

828
00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:28,825
Some people are born
with fast twitch fibers.

829
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:31,244
You can improve your technique
through practice,

830
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:34,330
but there's a limit to how fast
you can run.

831
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:40,294
That's why aspiring athletes
should be nurtured at a young age.

832
00:53:40,378 --> 00:53:43,965
Or it would be our nation's loss,
wouldn't it?

833
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:45,675
Did you ever think

834
00:53:46,342 --> 00:53:49,720
that it's the athlete's fault
that we can't win a gold medal?

835
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:52,306
I'm not too sure.

836
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,475
We lack a systematic environment

837
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,061
where we can recognize and nurture
these young athletes.

838
00:53:57,979 --> 00:53:59,564
That's why

839
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:03,359
I wanted to offer an environment
where they could solely focus on sports.

840
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:05,486
You've been doing that.

841
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,363
You've been sponsoring them.

842
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:10,825
Take Woo-sik's case for example.
You helped and protected him.

843
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:13,619
You did what Jerry Maguire did.

844
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:16,664
What was that called again?

845
00:54:16,747 --> 00:54:19,125
-An agent?
-Yes, that's what you were.

846
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,918
That wasn't what I did.

847
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:26,424
In our country, an agent usually aids you
in legal matters.

848
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:28,676
Like an attorney?

849
00:54:29,927 --> 00:54:32,305
I think it's more like a representative.

850
00:54:32,388 --> 00:54:34,265
Then do you have an agent as well?

851
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:36,893
Track and field athletes
don't usually have agents.

852
00:54:36,976 --> 00:54:39,687
I guess Ms. Seo is one.

853
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:42,690
She scouted me.

854
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:45,693
She manages my look and my scandals.

855
00:54:45,776 --> 00:54:49,363
When I cause trouble like now,
she's the one who steps up.

856
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:53,034
She's like a human shield.

857
00:54:53,117 --> 00:54:56,162
You just described yourself.
Especially the human shield part.

858
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:00,583
But I failed.

859
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,377
I couldn't do anything.

860
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:07,381
Why not include your failures
as a part of the process?

861
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,138
It's also a part
of your journey to success.

862
00:55:14,722 --> 00:55:17,850
Jerry Maguire also hit rock bottom
before succeeding.

863
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:19,936
Who is he exactly?

864
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:21,437
Do you not know that movie?

865
00:55:21,938 --> 00:55:24,941
Don't you know that movie
starring Tom Cruise?

866
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:27,193
What about this scene?

867
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:32,448
"Show me the money." Don't you know this?

868
00:55:33,115 --> 00:55:34,242
What's the title?

869
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:35,409
I'll watch it later.

870
00:55:35,493 --> 00:55:36,369
<i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

871
00:55:36,452 --> 00:55:38,246
The title is a person's name?

872
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:39,455
Yes.

873
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:44,210
I think asking questions like that
is a good habit.

874
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:47,463
Most people don't ask at all or only ask
about things that are too personal.

875
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,799
You would've been a good student.

876
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:54,136
Should I pick up studying again
since I'm jobless?

877
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,346
Study what?

878
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,181
English.

879
00:55:57,723 --> 00:55:58,933
By yourself?

880
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:02,019
Do you tutor as well?

881
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:04,480
Up until two years ago,
I did tutor on the side.

882
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:06,899
But I'm too busy with my main job
to do it now.

883
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:10,152
-We should've met then.
-What? What is this?

884
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:13,990
Seeing how you're spewing nonsense,
you must be a bit tipsy.

885
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,494
I'm okay.

886
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,252
Being unemployed will be boring.

887
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:27,920
Let me know if you get bored.

888
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:30,798
If I do? Will you hang out with me?

889
00:56:32,425 --> 00:56:34,468
Sure, if I'm not busy.

890
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:36,846
Sure.

891
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:41,559
Was that a scene

892
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:44,937
from that movie? Is it?

893
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,066
What's wrong with you?

894
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,277
-You said so yourself.
-You're kidding, right?

895
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,112
I'm just curious. I want to watch it.

896
00:56:58,701 --> 00:56:59,994
Thank you for the food.

897
00:57:00,077 --> 00:57:01,078
Don't mention it.

898
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:10,880
She's…

899
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:15,009
CONGRATULATIONS
TO SHIN A-RYEON'S GRANDSON, KIM WOO-SIK

900
00:57:15,092 --> 00:57:16,510
FOR BECOMING A NATIONAL ATHLETE

901
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:17,887
Thank you…

902
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:20,973
for helping for Woo-sik.

903
00:57:21,557 --> 00:57:23,059
I should've thanked you sooner.

904
00:57:25,144 --> 00:57:27,730
I found out that he was 20 years old.

905
00:57:27,813 --> 00:57:32,109
I met May when I was his age,
and my life became a bit better.

906
00:57:32,902 --> 00:57:35,029
Before that, my life was pretty gloomy.

907
00:57:36,405 --> 00:57:39,116
Woo-sik must think of you the same way.

908
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:43,579
In the long run, don't you think
it's a good thing for him

909
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:47,416
to have someone like you?

910
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,751
It is.

911
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:50,503
Even in the short run.

912
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:34,190
IS IT TRUE THAT THE ATHLETE
KI SEON-GYEOM ASSAULTED YOU

913
00:59:41,489 --> 00:59:43,866
<i>The first time they assaulted me</i>

914
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,826
<i>was in high school</i>

915
00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:49,830
<i>when I first joined the track team.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, but I don't quite remember.</i>

922
01:00:16,023 --> 01:00:19,360
<i>To tell you the truth,
I never thought it was weird</i>

923
01:00:20,402 --> 01:00:22,738
<i>because it's common
for athletes to get beaten up.</i>

924
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:25,116
<i>Seon-gyeom was the only person</i>

925
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:27,827
<i>who told me that it was wrong
no matter what</i>

926
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,161
-What?
<i>-the reason was.</i>

927
01:00:29,245 --> 01:00:30,996
-Check this out.
-What?

928
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,456
-Look at this.
-What is that?

929
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,126
Isn't this about those athletes
who assaulted each other?

930
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:37,837
-That lunatic who confessed about it?
-Yes.

931
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,713
-I said help me out!
-Look.

932
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:41,757
It wasn't Choi Tae-ri's ex after all.

933
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:43,134
Who was it then?

934
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:45,219
Park Gyu-deok and Kim Gi-beom?
I'm shocked.

935
01:00:45,302 --> 01:00:49,265
I can't believe this. It disgusts me.

936
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:52,476
<i>Did you read the post
about Choi Tae-ri's boyfriend?</i>

937
01:00:53,477 --> 01:00:54,812
<i>Is it true?</i>

938
01:00:55,855 --> 01:00:59,191
<i>Yes. I wrote it.
Please share it with everyone.</i>

939
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,610
<i>Okay. I've shared it already.</i>

940
01:01:01,694 --> 01:01:03,863
<i>You got it. We're loyal friends.</i>

941
01:01:03,946 --> 01:01:06,407
<i>The reasons for the assaults were simple.</i>

942
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,700
<i>It was because I won a medal.</i>

943
01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:10,286
<i>Because I didn't buy them cigarettes.
Because it rained.</i>

944
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:13,497
<i>Because being poor was acceptable,
but being an orphan wasn't.</i>

945
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:16,375
The Daily Sports New York <i>published
an article about a Korean athlete.</i>

946
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:18,961
<i>The Korean translation
has gone viral already.</i>

947
01:01:19,587 --> 01:01:21,797
<i>It's already causing a stir
on social media.</i>

948
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:23,716
<i>Should we write an article on it?</i>

949
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:26,927
<i>Yes, do that immediately.
And upload it as our headline.</i>

950
01:01:27,011 --> 01:01:29,972
<i>I know some people may ask
why I've been silent about it.</i>

951
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:32,600
<i>They may think I'm dense.</i>

952
01:01:32,683 --> 01:01:35,102
<i>Being assaulted was frightening.</i>

953
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:38,439
<i>But not being able to run
was even more terrifying.</i>

954
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:41,483
<i>I didn't want to worry
my grandmother either.</i>

955
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,903
<i>I believed everything would be fine

957
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:48,741
<i>it was bearable.</i>

958
01:02:12,181 --> 01:02:14,683
<i>All the articles claiming
that Ki Seon-gyeom</i>

<i>was the assailant aren't true.</i>

962
01:02:52,054 --> 01:02:54,515
Did Woo-sik come by today?

963
01:02:54,598 --> 01:02:56,183
No, he didn't.

964
01:03:02,564 --> 01:03:05,609
<i>I was inspired by Ki Seon-gyeom to run,</i>

965
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:09,196
<i>and I always strived to be like him.</i>

966
01:03:26,964 --> 01:03:32,136
<i>I need to be in rehab for months
because of the recent assault.</i>

967
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,013
<i>"Will I be able</i>

968
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:38,267
<i>to make the same records
after getting rehab?</i>

969
01:03:41,729 --> 01:03:43,689
Will I even be able to come back?"

970
01:03:46,608 --> 01:03:48,193
I thought for a long time

971
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:52,197
and have decided not to come back.

972
01:03:54,283 --> 01:03:55,909
I'm going to quit sports.

973
01:03:57,036 --> 01:04:00,914
I came here prepared to say this.

974
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:25,898
Did you already know

975
01:04:26,982 --> 01:04:28,567
that Woo-sik was quitting?

976
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:33,322
Yes. I interpreted for him.

977
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:36,116
Why didn't you tell me?

978
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:39,328
Because you'd be like this.

979
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:46,668
You did what you did,
hoping he'd continue.

980
01:04:48,003 --> 01:04:50,964
So I thought it'd break your heart to know
that he was quitting.

981
01:04:55,219 --> 01:04:57,304
Why did you have to let me
find out like this?

982
01:04:58,847 --> 01:05:00,015
Both of you.

983
01:05:04,436 --> 01:05:06,188
You have so much to learn.

984
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:10,442
You're considerate to everyone around you.

985
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:13,404
Did you not think that kind boy
would feel the same way?

986
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:19,743
No one is born

987
01:05:20,244 --> 01:05:22,913
being able to endure pain from the start.

988
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:25,165
So…

989
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:30,295
don't try to seem okay
if that's what you're doing.

990
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:39,471
Come inside for now.

991
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,977
Come on.

992
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:19,094
Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm doing.

993
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:23,140
I know.

994
01:06:25,476 --> 01:06:26,518
You're comforting me.

995
01:06:29,646 --> 01:06:30,647
Correct.

Ms. Oh.

I'll stay with you if you ask me to.

Write that you'll get off work

Yes.
