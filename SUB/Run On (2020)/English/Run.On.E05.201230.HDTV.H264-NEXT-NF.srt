DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA

00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,439

EPISODE 5

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,525
-Are you here to work out?
-I'm here to park.

6
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,235
I'll work out since I'm here.

7
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,864
I got you a membership so you'd work out,
but I guess you use it for parking.

8
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,949
But still,
it's nice that I got to run into you.

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,285
I know you got me the membership
for that reason.

10
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,745
So we'd run into each other.

11
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,497
You caught me.

12
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,293
-What are you here for?
-For the spa. Would you like to join?

13
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,296
I saw the news photo,
and your skin looked rough.

14
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,380
No thanks.

15
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,717
Is everything else okay?

16
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,844
Obviously not.

17
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,430
Your dad suggested
that we should go and repent.

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,141
Why would you repent
when I'm the one who caused trouble?

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,352
Because it's obvious that you won't.

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,230
I'll be off now.

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,523
-Bye.
-Bye.

22
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,733
Please wait in the car.
I need to talk to him.

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,776
Okay.

24
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,990
We're trying to stop the articles
from spreading.

25
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,118
But we have no control over social media.

26
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,454
Be careful not to do anything
to get your photo taken.

27
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,541
-Don't even throw garbage on the street.
-Got it.

28
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,793
Sir.

29
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,337
Can you update me first

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,006
on everything regarding my interpreter?

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,217
Why do you still care about her?

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,304
I owe her a lot.
It's only right that I care.

33
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,597
I don't understand

34
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,644
why you're always the only one
who has good manners.

35
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,315
That interpreter must've acted innocent
when she was with you.

36
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,151
But don't get fooled.

37
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,112
You talk as if she's a bad person.

38
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,117
Your dad asked her to keep an eye on you
and paid her in return.

39
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,619
And she took every single penny.

40
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,831
Does she seem like a bad person now?

41
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,624
He paid her?

42
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,384
It seems like you're the bad person.

43
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,019
Did my father pay you?

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,320
Remember what I said?

45
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,947
That I might make a mistake?

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,121
So this is what you call a mistake.

47
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,208
You have such a noble character.

48
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,169
I thought you meant something else.

49
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,089
It's true.

50
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,800
He paid me, and I took it.

51
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,180
You can be disappointed in me.

52
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,474
Don't stop yourself.

53
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,317
Now you know.

54
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,697
I've always been embarrassed of my dad
for being like that.

55
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,039
Why did you

56
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,667
take the money?

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,210
It could've gotten in your way.

58
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,921
I already have enough in my way.

59
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,216
People who give me money
already know about my weakness.

60
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,513
You might not know since you're rich,
but I've had this happen to me often.

61
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,482
OH MI-JOO

62
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,998
People who give me money think

63
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,001
they've reached a compromise
only if I take their money.

64
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,045
If I don't,
it means I'm going to ignore them.

65
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,512
How do you feel
now that you know I got paid?

66
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,972
You hate that kind of stuff.

67
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,140
I do.

68
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,978
Then you can hate me, be disappointed,
and just forget about me.

69
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,105
Yes.

70
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,483
And tell myself
that everything you did for me was fake.

71
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,239
But I don't want to.

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,453
Even if your words and consolations
were all fake,

73
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,414
they were still meaningful.

74
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,294
Why are you being so kind?

75
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,587
Because I want to.

76
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,424
-Why?
-I just do.

77
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,551
Seon-gyeom.

78
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,970
Don't be like that.

79
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,017
You may be embarrassed,
but I feel like a wreck, so just stop it.

80
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,481
I normally don't mind
taking that kind of money.

81
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,776
That's not even me at my lowest.
It's just who I am.

82
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,695
But this time,

83
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,865
I kept feeling uneasy about it
because of you.

84
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,412
You make me feel like I'm worthless.

85
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,500
You make me feel like a good person,

86
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,628
but then you make me feel
worthless at times.

87
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,589
But you see,

88
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,884
I really hate feeling that way.

89
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,351
Give me my gun.

90
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,668
Let's forget that there was anything
between us two.

91
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,965
I'll give it back if you say you won't.

92
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
-Are you kidding?
-No, I'm not.

93
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,305
Okay, fine. Whatever.

94
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,975
I'm too tired to even talk back.

95
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,936
Give me that.

96
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,883
Why is there no soju at home?

97
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,301
Who drank it all?

98
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,345
Right. I did.

99
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,015
I didn't buy any on my way home.

100
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,565
If I drink in this kind of mood,
that would be an illness.

101
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,028
Where are the sleeping pills?

102
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,614
I need to go to sleep. Where are you?

103
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,449
Here it is.

104
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,124
KI

105
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,379
Did you seriously just call me?

106
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,425
Must I start the day hearing your voice?

107
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,512
Are you bored?
You must be really bored without me.

108
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,890
<i>Are you getting anxious
because you're not training?</i>

109
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,392
I drank alcohol yesterday.

110
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,228
<i>Who is this? This can't be Seon-gyeom.</i>

111
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,939
Last time I drank, it felt pretty nice.

112
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,068
I heard people drink
to relieve their stress.

113
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,782
So I was going to drink a ton, sleep in,

114
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,535
and spend all day in bed.

115
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,954
But I found myself running again.

116
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,207
Is that why you called me?
Did you feel lost?

117
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,502
I have no one to talk to
because I don't have any friends.

118
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,214
What are you talking about?
Who do you think I am? Your girlfriend?

119
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,969
Hang up. I need to train.

120
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,933
What an annoying punk.

121
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

122
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,941
-You look great.
-Yes.

123
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,151
Hello, ma'am.

124
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,986
-Hello.
-Hello.

125
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,322
-Assemblyman Ki.
-Deacon.

126
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,907
I hear your son got into college.

127
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,992
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

128
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,535
-Thank you.
-Hello.

129
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,412
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

130
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,126
Hello.

131
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,005
Let's go.

132
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:20,638
WONIL CHURCH

133
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,443
Sir. Ma'am. Hello.

134
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,071
I heard the news.

135
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,447
You must be very upset.

136
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,867
Yes. But it's all because
I wasn't a better father.

137
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,620
You must pray at times like this.

138
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,081
-Let us pray together.
-Okay.

139
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,754
Lord, kindly show us mercy
and forgive us the sins

140
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,091
we’ve committed this past week
with your gracious love.

141
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,052
Lord, your faithful believers,

142
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:05,057
Assemblyman Ki and his wife
are currently being tested.

143
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,226
-Amen.
-However, we trust

144
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,937
that this test is a blessing in disguise

145
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,607
to help them to do more good deeds
and achieve greater things.

146
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Amen.

147
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,861
Their path is of full thorns
and hardships.

148
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,240
Lord! Please guide their children
toward the righteous path

149
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,160
so they can find their way
back to the church.

150
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,746
Dear Lord! Please bless this family

151
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,460
-with your everlasting love and peace.
-Amen.

152
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,253
I pray in the name

153
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:38,174
of our living Savior, Jesus Christ.

154
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,050
Amen.

155
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,722
-What's the matter with you?
-I want that!

156
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,682
-Buy me chocolate!
-What?

157
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,225
There's still some left at home.

158
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,810
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,822
Can I give it to her?

160
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,116
I bought more than enough.

161
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,659
Gosh, you don't need to.

162
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,245
Go ahead and say "Thank you."

163
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,164
Thank you.

164
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,987
I forgot I still had this.

165
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,156
Should I throw it away?

166
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,787
Gosh, it's really expensive.

167
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,872
Should I sell it online?

168
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,708
Why are you here today?
Is this another deal you're making?

169
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,085
You're the Deal Killer.

170
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,963
Of all the things he could've said…

171
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,056
You're a better actor than I am.

172
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,307
Watch what you say.

173
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,185
I'm always sincere before the Lord.

174
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,604
I would be even more disgusted
if that was the case.

175
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,439
Assemblyman Ki.

176
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,025
My goodness, it's so nice to see you here.

177
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,777
It's been so long.

178
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,904
Things must be hard because of your son.

179
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,449
Well, yes. But I believe
it's all part of the Lord's plan.

180
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,827
Honey, say hello.
He's Assemblyman No Geun-seong.

181
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,662
He's a young politician on the rise.

182
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,457
Hello, I'm Yook Ji-woo. I'm his wife.

183
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,002
Gosh, you don't need
to introduce yourself.

184
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,755
I heard your daughter came back to Korea.
It must be nice to see her again.

185
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,383
Yes. Thank you for showing interest.

186
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,802
It's hard not to know about your family.

187
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,557
My dream is to play a round of golf
with your daughter.

188
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,644
We haven't met in a while,
so let's eat together.

189
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,396
-Sure.
-Let's go.

190
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,653
I bet you did great though.

191
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,281
It wasn't that great.

192
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,077
-My goodness, Ye-chan.
-Hello.

193
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,163
You're a senior,
but you haven't gained any weight.

194
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,458
You're getting prettier every day
just like your mother.

195
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,459
Thank you.

196
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,920
Your mom prays a lot
for your college entrance.

197
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,088
You should go to a nice college
like your brother.

198
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,131
Yes.

199
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,258
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

200
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,096
So prayers get me into a nice school?

201
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,390
Don't be sarcastic. She meant well.

202
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,937
-Ms. Dong.
-I haven't seen you here lately.

203
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,105
I come quite diligently for an atheist.

204
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,691
Aren't you going to eat? The assemblymen--

205
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,694
I'm on a diet.
I'm getting ready for a movie.

206
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,863
I see. Ye-chan, say hello.

207
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,907
She's Ms. Yook. She's my daughter.

208
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,158
Hello, Ms. Yook.

209
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,745
I really like the look in your eyes.
Do you exercise?

210
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,039
No. Not at all.

211
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,960
She used to box when she was little
to learn self-defense.

212
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,836
-But not anymore, right?
-Right.

213
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,463
She's fit for liberal arts.

214
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,715
Oh, I see. Then just forget what I said.

215
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,134
-Ms. Dong.
-Yes?

216
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,303
-Can we talk for a moment?
-Sure.

217
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,721
Goodbye then.

218
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,768
-I really like her.
-Why?

219
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,479
-Because she doesn't judge.
-She doesn't what?

220
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,565
She didn't judge how I looked.
She didn't compare me to you.

221
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,401
Is Korean hard for you?

222
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,195
You make it hard for me to understand.
Eat up.

223
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,532
-Hello.
-Hello.

224
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,450
Oh, hello.

225
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,870
What time is the table read?

226
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,498
<i>It's at 3:00 p.m.
Should I go pick you up, Ji-woo?</i>

227
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,418
Why did he have to bring me here today?

228
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,877
Aren't you sick of this?

229
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,713
I'm sick of living like this.

230
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,631
<i>But you still always go.</i>

231
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,675
-<i>Should I buy you coffee?</i>
-Yes.

232
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,970
Add three more shots
so I can drink it and die.

233
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,766
The agency must be in a mess.
What did the advertiser say?

234
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,643
They don't want a model
who beats people up, right?

235
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,022
We're dealing with it.
You know we're good at doing our jobs.

236
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,983
Seon-gyeom seemed to be doing okay.

237
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,360
-Did you meet him?
-I ran into him.

238
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,114
Please look into him every now and then.

239
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,991
You're closer to him than I am.

240
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,160
You can slowly get closer to him too.

241
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:17,995
You're right.

242
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,416
I wonder why I feel so embarrassed about

243
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,168
being close and friendly with my kids.

244
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,003
But you act for a living.

245
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,006
That's easier than being a mom.

246
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,717
I envy you. I need to do both.

247
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,929
Being a working mother in Korea
really sucks, doesn't it?

248
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,724
It'd be nice if Assemblyman Ki
could change things.

249
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,518
Gosh, that's probably
the last thing on his mind.

250
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,205
-Hey!
-My gosh, look.

251
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,124
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

252
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,085
This is 250mm.

253
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,504
Gosh, you get bigger every time I see you.

254
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,713
Thank you.

255
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,300
You guys exercise even during break time?
I'm impressed.

256
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,593
Your posture got better.

257
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,970
-Really?
-Straighten your back a little.

258
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,639
-Okay.
-Pull your chin down a bit.

259
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,099
-Okay.
-Perfect.

260
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
By the way, Mr. Ki,
did you really hit someone?

261
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,399
-Yes.
-You're lying.

262
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,735
-I don't lie.
-Don't lie.

263
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,987
Why did you hit them?

264
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,575
You shouldn't be asking me why.

265
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,286
Just think of me as a bad person.

266
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,956
Now that I'm here,
I'll help you fix your postures.

267
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,666
Let's see you guys move your arms.

268
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,752
You can't be a bad person.
You promised to be our coach.

269
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,796
-Move your arms.
-Were they seriously hurt?

270
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,923
Wouldn't they forgive you
if you apologized?

271
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,091
Move your arms.

272
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,677
She's right. You can start over.

273
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,304
"Start over"?

274
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,308
"Start over"? I don't know.

275
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,064
I don't know if I'm standing in front of
the starting line or the finish line.

276
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,277
I don't know if this is the beginning,
nearly over,

277
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,987
or the end.

278
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,989
What do you mean?

279
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,699
-I'm not sure.
-Give it.

280
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,742
-Give it. It's mine.
-Wear something else.

281
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,245
-There are so many.
-I grabbed it first.

282
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,205
-Shouldn't you stop them?
-That's mine.

283
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,874
You're the adult here.

284
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,501
Not on my own though.
Could you lend me a hand?

285
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,669
Sure.

286
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,629
-Hey, what's going on?
-Stop arguing!

287
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,214
-Guys.
-Come on!

288
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,535
<i>I'm embarrassed to tell you this,</i>

289
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,038
but it's because of the articles.

290
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,750
Since this is an educational facility,

291
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,671
the management have been
showing their disapproval.

292
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,508
Even the parents complained about you
mentoring the track and field athletes,

293
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,347
and we've been receiving calls
about how you're a bad influence.

294
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,474
I understand.

295
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,481
The teachers have known you for years now,

296
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,483
and we know this isn't who you are.

297
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,027
But you can never really tell
what someone is like.

298
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,491
I'd like to keep sponsoring the athletes,

299
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,036
so would it be okay
if I did it under a different name?

300
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,208
Thank you. We wouldn't mind.

301
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,709
Neither would I.

302
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,689
Only 500m to go!

303
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,982
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

304
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,070
I'll take on that musical film.
The next <i>La La Land</i> as you call it.

305
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,240
I already handed it over
to another translator.

306
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,117
I have to be busy. I need to be.

307
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,285
You're being weird.

308
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,538
Someone gave me money recently
out of pity.

309
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,540
Lucky you.

310
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,460
It's not easy receiving free money
at this age.

311
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,588
-I gave it back.
-That's a shocker.

312
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
For Ki Seon-gyeom's sake.

313
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,846
Is it him that you've been pitying?

314
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,057
Being pitied is the worst, you know.

315
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,893
Can being pitied be bought too?

316
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,312
Lucky rich bastards.

317
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,689
What about you then?

318
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,525
When did you buy the right
to pity Ki Seon-gyeom?

319
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,446
That's totally different.

320
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,035
And how am I supposed to know that?

321
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,829
It was Ki Seon-gyeom's father who paid me

322
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,831
and Ki Seon-gyeom found out.

323
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,750
How's that for context?

324
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,752
That prick of an old man.

325
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,296
How dare he treat you like some bum?

326
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,799
What's funny though

327
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,179
is that I'm worried he might've
told his son about my adversities.

328
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,558
I'm scared that he might have found out
that I've been putting up an act

329
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,685
when I have nothing to offer.

330
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,980
What has he to find out
when you never hid it?

331
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,817
I guess I'm just embarrassed of myself.

332
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,363
He's so annoying.
He makes me feel like a loser.

333
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,448
That hurts.

334
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,951
So are you just going to end it?

335
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,498
It's the end of the road
once you start pitying someone.

336
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,168
-Last rep!
-Let's do this!

337
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,798
Why bother training
when it won't lead to a gold medal?

338
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,721
Ashamed, my ass.

339
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,057
You're bolder than ever.

340
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,530
PRESIDENT SEO DAN AH

341
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,124
Here's the list for this quarter.

342
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,093
Each one is crappier than the next.

343
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,761
A pure list of trash.

344
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,889
The second son
of Dongjeong Pharmaceuticals is a divorcé.

345
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,934
-And he has a son?
-He got divorced twice.

346
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,689
Am I only allowed to marry
someone with flaws?

347
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,817
I guess my father thinks I'm flawed
since I came out of the closet.

348
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,819
Or maybe he's punishing me for lying.

349
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,198
KI SEON-GYEOM

350
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,908
Is this his father's doing?

351
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,828
Look at him
quickly selling off his damaged son.

352
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,292
He's the youngest here though
and isn't bad to look at.

353
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,752
It's his way of telling you
to come by the company.

354
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,045
When I'm this busy?

355
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,006
What do you think though?

356
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,468
Choosing the pretty Ki Seon-gyeom to marry
will solve my marital issue.

357
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,472
Why aren't you answering?

358
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,433
Because he'll probably decline.

359
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,813
You're right.
Put down a day to visit my father.

360
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,981
Sure thing.

361
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,033
While Greece has its mythology,

362
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,243
Korea has the myth of Dangun.

363
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,706
I'm sure that explains
why we should study Greek gardens.

364
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,376
In that sense,
we'll move on to the Garden of Adonis.

365
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,837
I'm sure Adonis
is a familiar name to all of you.

366
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,381
He was the lover
of the beautiful Aphrodite.

367
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,634
It's said that he loved to hunt.

368
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,012
However, while out hunting,
he was bitten by a wild boar and died.

369
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,431
Imagine how heartbroken
Aphrodite must have been.

370
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,809
She poured nectar, the drink of the gods,
over his blood

371
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,437
which created the flower known as anemone.

372
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,817
Why should we learn about Greek gardens
when we're Korean?

373
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,736
I should've dropped this class.

374
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,613
Did you find your card case?

375
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,491
I probably dropped it somewhere.
I canceled my cards for now.

376
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,952
You need your student ID
to work late on campus.

377
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,328
I did in freshman year,

378
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,997
but now the security guards know my face.

379
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:45,043
You've gone onto bewitching
the security guards of all people?

380
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,254
Why are people laughing at me?

381
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,089
Do I look funny?

382
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,139
So I'm a cat today.

383
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,517
What's with that boring response?

384
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,061
It's nothing new. So what's for lunch?

385
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,521
Grilled fish.

386
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,941
Grilled fish?

387
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,986
Grilled fish, meow?

388
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,696
-What the hell?
-Meow.

389
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,408
After eating grilled fish,
I'll head to the studio.

390
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,701
-Meow!
-You're crazy.

391
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,868
-Meow!
-Damn it.

392
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,203
Lighten up, will you?

393
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,913
Yeong-hwa!

394
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,167
Are you done with classes today, meow?

395
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,629
We were wondering
if you could help us, meow.

396
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,840
Some boards have to be carried
to the studio,

397
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,259
but we're lacking the manpower, meow.

398
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,721
I'll be there after lunch, meow!

399
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,139
-Got it, meow.
-Got it, meow.

400
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,181
Meow!

401
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,317
I thought you were
the prince of the art department,

402
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,359
but you're the slave.

403
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,905
However, this slave is more into
someone cool than cute.

404
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,532
Someone cool? A fellow student?

405
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:01,244
No, someone who lives
at a place so high up

406
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,788
that I can barely see her.

407
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,749
A modern-day Rapunzel?

408
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,669
Rapunzel?

409
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,007
I do wish to drag her down.

410
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,262
-I want to color this.
-Teacher!

411
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,056
-Do you need help?
-Here.

412
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,891
Maybe a little later.

413
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,018
I'm all done. Whatever.

414
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,478
Look at this.

415
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,855
-I want…
-Want me to draw something?

416
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,273
-What should I draw?
-Yes?

417
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,025
-Here.
-Let me see.

418
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,902
-That's pretty.
-Is it a watermelon?

419
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,487
What will you draw?

420
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,239
-Hold on.
-It's a rabbit.

421
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,408
-Here.
-Should I draw you one too?

422
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,577
-Also, a cat.
-A cat as well?

423
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,995
That's what you'll draw?

424
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,915
Okay. In a moment's time though.

425
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,959
-What will you draw?
-Over here!

426
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,836
-Right.
-A giraffe, too.

427
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,464
-Do you want to draw a giraffe?
-What should I draw?

428
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,113
Your order will be ready soon.

429
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,531
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

430
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,242
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

431
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,453
<i>Gone is the Night</i>
won awards in India and Bergen.

432
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,622
It's all thanks to you.

433
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,999
Director Han must be thrilled,

434
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,293
but it's you who did
most of the heavy lifting.

435
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,588
It's thanks to you that
I made it to the festival in one piece.

436
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,092
-Did you watch <i>The Strange Red Carpet</i>?
-Yes.

437
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,760
Will you revise the subtitles?

438
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,221
I'd jump at the chance to revise my work.

439
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,973
I get to perfect it.

440
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,810
I'm just sorry
that we won't be able to pay you.

441
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,397
Don't be silly.
I'm only doing it because I want to.

442
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,316
You seem to be sporting a tan.
Were you off on vacation?

443
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,820
-Please enjoy.
-It was for a shoot, not vacation.

444
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,281
The sun was blazing in Chungyang.

445
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,323
Is that so?

446
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,994
You went over this script last year.

447
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,955
-Do you remember it?
-The American indie film?

448
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,208
It's filming in Korea too, right?
I see filming has already begun.

449
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,754
How can you ask someone to join the movie
two months before filming?

450
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,005
This is killing me.

451
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,300
It must be hard to interpret
the words exchanged on set.

452
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,885
You have to translate both ways.

453
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,262
-Tell me about it.
-Goodness.

454
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,390
You were in a movie club
in college, weren't you?

455
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,436
Yes, those were some fun days.

456
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,356
I don't remember
ever mentioning that though.

457
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,860
Oh, that. Well, you see,

458
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,655
Director Han said that's where he met you.

459
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,408
Right. Director Han and I

460
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,536
-go way back.
-Yes, you two dated.

461
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
I mean, you broke up.

462
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,292
I should've become a widow instead.

463
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,002
Is it too late for that?

464
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,506
No, you know how they say
it's never too late.

465
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,382
-It's not late at all.
-Damn him.

466
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,266
Good, you're here.

467
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,061
You sound like you're dying.

468
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,898
Gosh. I ran upstairs from the first floor.

469
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,108
So much for going on a walk.

470
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,694
-Did you have a meeting?
-Yes, with Hui-jin.

471
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,532
There's a rumor going around

472
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,368
that I only got the job
because I dated Han Seok-won.

473
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,288
Apparently, everyone on set gossiped about
how we used to date.

474
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,415
Even his girlfriend was there.

475
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,751
-I see.
-What?

476
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,297
Why does it sound like you already knew?

477
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,216
How can I not know what Hui-jin knows

478
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,426
when I work in this industry too?

479
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,220
Don't ask why I didn't tell you.

480
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:51,182
You haven't been yourself lately
and I didn't want to add onto that.

481
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,693
LONG TIME NO SEE, FRIENDS
I'M GETTING MARRIED

482
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,904
SEOUL HOTEL, HILL LOUNGE, 2 P.M.

483
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,741
No way. Yoon Gong-ju's getting married.
She's giving out wedding invitations.

484
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,703
Yoon Gong-ju?
The one you went to Florida with?

485
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,788
With? She practically dragged me there.

486
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,373
The princess needed a maid

487
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,749
and I needed the funding.

488
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,711
Why here of all places?

489
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,963
This is where Seon-gyeom stays.

490
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,172
I'm not going.

491
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,466
Yes you are.

492
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,638
You can't tell your heart to stop feeling.

493
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,100
It's never too late to do so
when it sends you a signal.

494
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,812
Just be grateful that
you have an excuse to run into him.

495
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,938
An excuse?

496
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,691
As if I'd really go.

497
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,234
There's no way I'm going.

498
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,652
No way.

499
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,949
May, can I borrow your purse?
I can't look shabby!

500
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,578
Kim Woo-sik…

501
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,583
Why hasn't his article been published?
Are the reporters sleeping on this?

502
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,971
Merciless, aren't they?

503
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,981
Ta-da, here's today's main dish.

504
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,692
-Here.
-The wedding invite.

505
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,777
Let's take a look.

506
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,820
My gosh, how pretty.

507
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,281
Is this where your wedding is at?

508
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,449
I'm jealous!

509
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:35,161
My darling went through hoops
booking the venue.

510
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,371
Lucky you.

511
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,039
Mi-joo,

512
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,874
why aren't you getting married?

513
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,919
-Why are you?
-Why am I getting married?

514
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,420
Yes.

515
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,507
My parents have been insisting and…

516
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,304
-Why must I explain this?
-You realize that after you're confronted?

517
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,099
I only asked because I care about you.

518
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,602
It's more weird staying single
than getting married.

519
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,439
You can't afford to be this naive anymore.

520
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,693
-I thought that made me charming.
-It did when you were 20.

521
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,239
You upset me a lot back in the day,

522
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,116
but I never said anything, you know.

523
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,659
She'd never hang out with me

524
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,078
because she was too busy
working part-time jobs.

525
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,415
Money for tuition and meals
doesn't just fall from the sky.

526
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,333
Why not ask your parents for the money?

527
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,918
Hey…

528
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,467
Sorry. I forgot about
your parents being gone.

529
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,765
Hey, Woo-sik.

530
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,977
<i>I heard you left the training camp.</i>

531
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,229
<i>You moved out completely.</i>

532
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,439
The public is enraged,

533
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,525
so staying would only bring trouble
to others and you.

534
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,652
Of course, I should leave.

535
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,990
Right.

536
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,367
I guess you're right.

537
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,453
Call me whenever you're in Seoul.
We should eat.

538
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,456
-How about this week?
-<i>This week?</i>

539
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,875
I want to treat you to a nice meal.

540
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,294
It slipped my mind

541
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,547
that you were in that foster--

542
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,799
-Foster care?
-Yes.

543
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,927
It's just that you always seem
bright and happy--

544
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,806
Should I seem glum all the time
so that you never forget?

545
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,268
Must you put it that way?

546
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,978
No wonder you're still single.

547
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,606
Stop it, you both.

548
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,608
Must you argue on a day like this?

549
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,151
I'm sorry, guys.

550
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,153
I'll make it up to you some other time.

551
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,404
I'll get going then.

552
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,369
Must you be like that
when you know her situation?

553
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,580
She's all haughty
despite being beneath me.

554
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,540
She's only nice to you guys.

555
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,959
That's because we're nice to her too.

556
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,503
Whatever.

557
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,131
Excuse me, can we get some more wine?

558
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,140
Seriously, May?
What's with the cigarettes?

559
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,731
No way.
Not after what it took for me to quit.

560
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,778
Okay, I'll smoke just one.

561
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,330
Damn it, May.
Isn't there a lighter in here?

562
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,706
I'm sorry,

563
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,709
you can't smoke
on the premises of the hotel.

564
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,462
Not having a lighter is shitty enough,

565
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,714
but now I'm being told
I can't freely smoke.

566
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,216
-Unbelievable.
-I'm sorry, but--

567
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,469
Could I perhaps borrow a lighter?

568
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,140
I don't carry one
being a non-smoker and all.

569
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,724
I see.

570
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,602
What should I do then?

571
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,023
Beats me. Maybe--

572
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,692
-Let me help.
-Hello.

573
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,863
She's with me. I'll take it from here.

574
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,785
And this… Follow me.

575
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,579
Were you perhaps just at the lounge?

576
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,372
Yes.

577
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,014
Did you hear everything?

578
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,558
-Hear what?
-Anything.

579
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,146
I did. Music, to be exact.

580
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,277
When did you spot me?

581
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,946
When you took this out.

582
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,823
You could've looked the other way.

583
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,409
I was waiting to say something to you.

584
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,287
That's out of the blue.
Why didn't you call or text?

585
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,706
Woo-sik wants to treat us to a meal.

586
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,957
He just told me, you see.

587
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,335
I see.

588
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,545
He doesn't know your number,

589
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,505
so he asked me to invite you instead.

590
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,135
"Us" as in you and me?

591
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,142
If that's the case,
please tell him the gesture is enough.

592
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,062
I won't be there
if it makes you uncomfortable,

593
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,605
so please accept his offer.

594
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:18,486
Then please text me his phone number.

595
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,904
I'll take it from there.

596
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,994
That movie was still showing.

597
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,330
-Which one?
-The one we saw together.

598
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,832
The one you had to watch
since you didn't know

599
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,167
when it'd be taken down.

600
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,588
Did you really believe me?

601
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,590
Was it a lie?

602
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,969
I wouldn't call it a lie,
but I had to say it.

603
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,098
It was an excuse to make you stay.

604
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
Same here.

605
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,603
Mentioning Woo-sik and the movie
was an excuse

606
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,063
to keep you from going.

607
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,780
Anyway, just in case,

608
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,493
please know that I didn't come here

609
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,329
so that I'd have a reason to run into you.

610
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,208
I was here to meet some friends,
and I already had my meal and coffee.

611
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,128
I hate working out
and home is where I sleep.

612
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,630
Why did you ask me to follow you earlier?

613
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,092
To escort you to a smoking area.

614
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,219
Unbelievable.

615
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:30,057
It's times like these
that make me fond of your personality.

616
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,018
I thought you hated it.

617
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,563
The cigarette…

618
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,858
I'll figure it out myself.

619
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,901
I feel a lot better now, you see.

620
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,739
Thank you

621
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,783
for not asking what's wrong.

622
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,994
I mean it.

623
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,340
CROWN PUB

624
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,841
-It's ours.
-Enjoy.

625
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,217
Thank you.

626
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,802
Finally, a hangover meal.

627
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,599
It's good.

628
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,933
-Is it?
-Yes.

629
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,814
How many chickens can you buy
with two million won?

630
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,232
A hundred.

631
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,317
A hundred?

632
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,571
That means she gave me a robe
worth a hundred chickens.

633
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,615
Have you met anyone like that?

634
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,869
My mom's CEO carries a bag
that's worth ten million won.

635
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,787
Ten million won?

636
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,166
-How many chickens can you buy with that?
-Five hundred.

637
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,668
Did you get swindled out of money?

638
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,340
Forget it. She's actually the one
who was swindled.

639
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,013
Hey, didn't you say your mom works
for an agency?

640
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,390
What was it called again?

641
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,682
DANN.

642
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,810
It's DANN, isn't it?

643
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,269
Yes.

644
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,480
Do you want an internship?

645
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,362
Yes.

646
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,572
I'm eating with Yeong-hwa.

647
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,075
Okay.

648
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,370
-Was that your mom?
-Yes.

649
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,039
She wants me to bring something over.

650
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,374
She left something.

651
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,544
Hey, I brought my bicycle.
I'll give you a ride.

652
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,087
Let's stop by the bank on the way.

653
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,548
-Did you get your tutoring fee?
-Yes.

654
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,465
I see.

655
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,385
Pay for the chicken.
My mom's the one paying you.

656
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,429
I need to spend that money elsewhere.

657
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,931
I may be having cereal
for the entire month.

658
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,899
Could you please check?

659
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,985
How many I help you?

660
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,196
I'm here to see Director Dong Kyung.
She told me to bring this.

661
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,115
Yes, I heard.

662
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,951
The meeting will be over soon.
Come upstairs with me.

663
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,749
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

664
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,381
She's the one who carries 500 chickens.

665
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,472
It really is her.

666
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,848
You came together.

667
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,352
Hey. This is my son, Goh Ye-jun,
and his friend, Yeong-hwa.

668
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,313
This is President Seo Dan-ah, our boss.

669
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,064
Hello.

670
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,235
How old is your son again?

671
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,653
How old are you?

672
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,739
-I'm 23.
-He's 23 years old.

673
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,241
He went to school early,
so he's younger than his friends.

674
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,744
I see. It's nice to meet you all.

675
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,165
Ye-jun, my hands are full,
so please follow me.

676
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,416
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,418
Let's go.

678
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,781
Have you been painting?

679
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,867
Yes, at school for an assignment.

680
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,119
How did you know?

681
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,331
How could I not?
You're reeking of varnish.

682
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,168
So you can see me.

683
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,712
Why did you ignore me just now?

684
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,551
Because I didn't see the need to.

685
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,177
I didn't think we'd meet again.

686
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,222
So you only say hi when you need someone.

687
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,107
I don't know what that is,
but I don't think I need it.

688
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,608
-It's money.
-It is?

689
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,111
What's this for?

690
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,947
It's 500,000 won for the bracelet.
I said I'd pay you back.

691
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,824
Oh, that?

692
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,451
You could've left it at the lobby.

693
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,495
But it's such a hefty sum of money.

694
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,831
A hefty sum?

695
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,212
Did you hear that?

696
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,386
What's so funny?

697
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,432
Why do I feel offended?

698
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,356
I still haven't received the email
that I need to confirm.

699
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,066
Yes. I'll check up on it.

700
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,744
Ms. Seo.

701
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,955
Aren't you going to greet me?

702
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,587
You're required to come here
from time to time

703
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,882
and forced to look through
some prospective partners.

704
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,301
It's such a pain in the ass.

705
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,594
You're so noisy.

706
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,514
The smallest mutts bark the loudest.

707
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,766
They're such cowards.

708
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,770
If you want to help your family out,
just get married.

709
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,606
Fulfill your duties as a daughter.

710
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,694
I know it was a lie
when you came out of the closet.

711
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,909
Are you talking about me being a lesbian?

712
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,245
Yes, that.

713
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,415
How could you do that
just to get out of getting married?

714
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,627
-You should be ashamed.
-Are you outing me right now?

715
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,420
In front of a third party?

716
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,922
Hey, Seo Myeong-min.

717
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,924
"Hey, Seo Myeong-min"?

718
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,009
-Are you crazy?
-My courtesy must have made

719
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,595
you think you're better than me
when I'm actually older.

720
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,598
You call Tae-woong a bastard,
but you're also one yourself

721
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,975
and talk down on the legitimate heir.

722
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,853
Society has come a long way, hasn't it?

723
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,900
No matter how much progress we've seen,

724
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,444
you'll never become a CEO

725
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,572
because I'm the rightful heir, you wench.

726
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,079
You're right.

727
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,165
You fit its definition perfectly.

728
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,335
"A daughter born
of the mainline of descent

729
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,130
may not take over
the responsibilities of her family shrine.

730
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,384
But a son from a lowly mother
may take over the responsibilities."

731
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,220
Lowly mother?
Did you just badmouth my mom?

732
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,515
Both you and I like women
and want to become the CEO.

733
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,851
But it's abnormal for me
and normal for you.

734
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:32,104
The only difference we have is our gender.

735
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,862
Should I expose the fact
that you're an illegitimate child?

736
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,155
What will happen then?

737
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,035
How dare you threaten me?

738
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,622
Look at you. I only stated the facts,

739
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,916
but you got scared and took this
as a threat.

740
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,297
Mr. Jeong, I'm in a terrible mood.
I don't think I can see the chairman.

741
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,469
I ought to…

742
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,512
Had we met outside…

743
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,764
Stop glaring at me.

744
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,394
This is why I dislike you.

745
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,481
You obey me right away,
so I feel more offended.

746
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,357
I'm sorry.

747
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,445
If you are,

748
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,907
know where your loyalty lies, Ji-hyun.
Got that?

749
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,661
Don't be a fool who listens to a woman.

750
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,165
Are you two dating or something?

751
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,754
I told you to stop glaring.

752
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,006
I told you to stop!

753
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,968
I feel so shitty!

754
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,180
Damn it.

755
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,766
Here's your coffee.

756
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,990
What are you doing?
You should come inside.

757
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,451
It's nothing.

758
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,203
What about you?

759
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,830
I'm filling in for the owner.
She has to leave early.

760
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,791
-Come. I'll give you coffee.
-It's okay.

761
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,753
I'll come next time when you're working.
I don't think I should say hi.

762
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,381
What are you talking about?

763
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,133
I need to make more canvases.

764
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,136
Bye. Work hard.

765
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,682
You can fix this, right?

766
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,980
We can't fix this here.

767
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,982
-Go to the store.
-Where is it?

768
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,484
Probably at a department store
or Cheongdam-dong.

769
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,321
Goodness, what happened?
This is worth ten million won.

770
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,533
What? How much?

771
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,910
Ten million won?

772
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,097
She was wearing 500 chickens.

773
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,224
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

774
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,687
RESERVED

775
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,440
Ma'am, one small duck soup
and soju, please.

776
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,233
Okay.

777
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,491
Ms. Oh.

778
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,742
What?

779
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,494
What are you doing here?

780
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,704
And you? What are you doing here?

781
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,956
Woo-sik is buying me dinner.

782
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,292
I'm also here
because he said he'd buy me food.

783
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:31,296
It's you, right?
You're the only young customers.

784
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,340
It is you two.

785
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,925
A-ryeon asked for a reservation.

786
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,302
Don't you know who that is?

787
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,222
May we get some water?

788
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,598
Coming.

789
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,893
Hurry up and sit down.
Move. Don't stand in my way.

790
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,146
Then…

791
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,608
I'll eat over there. You two can eat here.

792
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:57,155
You need to order at least two servings
per table. Can you eat that much?

793
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,199
Just sit with us.

794
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,743
I already said I won't be joining you.

795
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,957
I thought you meant
you won't be eating with us.

796
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,046
Woo-sik can't make it.

797
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,298
What?

798
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,301
He wants us to reconcile.

799
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,596
-What?
-I think this was intentional.

800
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,140
<i>My grandma's friend is the owner.
Their food is tasty.</i>

801
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,059
<i>You two fought in Jeju, right?</i>

802
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,687
<i>I hope you make up over some good food.</i>

803
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,688
<i>I'll sit out.</i>

804
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,274
Gosh, you're still avoiding each other.

805
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,943
We don't have many seats.
Just sit together already.

806
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,530
And drinks? Do you want some soju?

807
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,739
Yes, please.

808
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,408
Look at you.

809
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,968
How is Woo-sik doing
physically and emotionally?

810
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,305
He sounded okay, but who knows?

811
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,515
And you?

812
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,977
I'm…

813
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,478
I should've asked sooner.

814
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,105
Right.

815
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:16,735
I'm putting up with people calling me
a violent athlete.

816
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,194
Thanks.

817
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,572
And you?

818
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,034
I'm working on a Blu-ray…

819
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,455
Right. How do I explain?

820
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,582
I'm just working on a good project.

821
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,212
I was disqualified.

822
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,758
Have you been dropped?
I didn't read anything about that.

823
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,260
Those articles will come out soon.

824
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,846
But this is about
the track and field coaching position.

825
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,307
You mean those young kids?

826
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,200
Did you know that fast athletes
are born that way?

827
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,372
Some people are born
with fast twitch fibers.

828
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,791
You can improve your technique
through practice,

829
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,877
but there's a limit to how fast
you can run.

830
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,841
That's why aspiring athletes
should be nurtured at a young age.

831
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,512
Or it would be our nation's loss,
wouldn't it?

832
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,222
Did you ever think

833
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,267
that it's the athlete's fault
that we can't win a gold medal?

834
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,853
I'm not too sure.

835
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,022
We lack a systematic environment

836
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,608
where we can recognize and nurture
these young athletes.

837
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,111
That's why

838
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,906
I wanted to offer an environment
where they could solely focus on sports.

839
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,033
You've been doing that.

840
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,910
You've been sponsoring them.

841
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,372
Take Woo-sik's case for example.
You helped and protected him.

842
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,166
You did what Jerry Maguire did.

843
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,211
What was that called again?

844
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,672
-An agent?
-Yes, that's what you were.

845
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,465
That wasn't what I did.

846
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:07,971
In our country, an agent usually aids you
in legal matters.

847
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,223
Like an attorney?

848
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,852
I think it's more like a representative.

849
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,812
Then do you have an agent as well?

850
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,440
Track and field athletes
don't usually have agents.

851
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,234
I guess Ms. Seo is one.

852
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,237
She scouted me.

853
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,240
She manages my look and my scandals.

854
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:30,910
When I cause trouble like now,
she's the one who steps up.

855
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,581
She's like a human shield.

856
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,709
You just described yourself.
Especially the human shield part.

857
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,130
But I failed.

858
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,924
I couldn't do anything.

859
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,928
Why not include your failures
as a part of the process?

860
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:55,685
It's also a part
of your journey to success.

861
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,397
Jerry Maguire also hit rock bottom
before succeeding.

862
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,483
Who is he exactly?

863
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,984
Do you not know that movie?

864
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,488
Don't you know that movie
starring Tom Cruise?

865
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,740
What about this scene?

866
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,995
"Show me the money." Don't you know this?

867
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,789
What's the title?

868
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,956
I'll watch it later.

869
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,916
<i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

870
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,793
The title is a person's name?

871
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,002
Yes.

872
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:25,757
I think asking questions like that
is a good habit.

873
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,010
Most people don't ask at all or only ask
about things that are too personal.

874
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,346
You would've been a good student.

875
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,683
Should I pick up studying again
since I'm jobless?

876
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,893
Study what?

877
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,728
English.

878
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,480
By yourself?

879
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,566
Do you tutor as well?

880
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,027
Up until two years ago,
I did tutor on the side.

881
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,446
But I'm too busy with my main job
to do it now.

882
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,699
-We should've met then.
-What? What is this?

883
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,537
Seeing how you're spewing nonsense,
you must be a bit tipsy.

884
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,041
I'm okay.

885
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,799
Being unemployed will be boring.

886
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,467
Let me know if you get bored.

887
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,345
If I do? Will you hang out with me?

888
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,015
Sure, if I'm not busy.

889
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,393
Sure.

890
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,106
Was that a scene

891
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,484
from that movie? Is it?

892
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,613
What's wrong with you?

893
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,824
-You said so yourself.
-You're kidding, right?

894
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,659
I'm just curious. I want to watch it.

895
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,541
Thank you for the food.

896
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,625
Don't mention it.

897
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,427
She's…

898
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,556
CONGRATULATIONS
TO SHIN A-RYEON'S GRANDSON, KIM WOO-SIK

899
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,057
FOR BECOMING A NATIONAL ATHLETE

900
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,434
Thank you…

901
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,520
for helping for Woo-sik.

902
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,606
I should've thanked you sooner.

903
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,277
I found out that he was 20 years old.

904
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,656
I met May when I was his age,
and my life became a bit better.

905
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,576
Before that, my life was pretty gloomy.

906
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,663
Woo-sik must think of you the same way.

907
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:25,126
In the long run, don't you think
it's a good thing for him

908
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,963
to have someone like you?

909
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,298
It is.

910
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,050
Even in the short run.

911
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,737
IS IT TRUE THAT THE ATHLETE
KI SEON-GYEOM ASSAULTED YOU

912
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,413
<i>The first time they assaulted me</i>

913
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,373
<i>was in high school</i>

914
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,377
<i>when I first joined the track team.</i>

921
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,907
<i>To tell you the truth,
I never thought it was weird</i>

922
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,285
<i>because it's common
for athletes to get beaten up.</i>

923
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,663
<i>Seon-gyeom was the only person</i>

924
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,374
<i>who told me that it was wrong
no matter what</i>

925
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,708
-What?
<i>-the reason was.</i>

926
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,543
-Check this out.
-What?

927
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,003
-Look at this.
-What is that?

928
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,673
Isn't this about those athletes
who assaulted each other?

929
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,384
-That lunatic who confessed about it?
-Yes.

930
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,260
-I said help me out!
-Look.

931
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,304
It wasn't Choi Tae-ri's ex after all.

932
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,681
Who was it then?

933
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,766
Park Gyu-deok and Kim Gi-beom?
I'm shocked.

934
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,812
I can't believe this. It disgusts me.

935
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:34,023
<i>Did you read the post
about Choi Tae-ri's boyfriend?</i>

936
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,359
<i>Is it true?</i>

937
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,738
<i>Yes. I wrote it.
Please share it with everyone.</i>

938
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,157
<i>Okay. I've shared it already.</i>

939
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,410
<i>You got it. We're loyal friends.</i>

940
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,954
<i>The reasons for the assaults were simple.</i>

941
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,247
<i>It was because I won a medal.</i>

942
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,833
<i>Because I didn't buy them cigarettes.
Because it rained.</i>

943
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,044
<i>Because being poor was acceptable,
but being an orphan wasn't.</i>

944
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,922
The Daily Sports New York <i>published
an article about a Korean athlete.</i>

945
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,508
<i>The Korean translation
has gone viral already.</i>

946
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,344
<i>It's already causing a stir
on social media.</i>

947
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,263
<i>Should we write an article on it?</i>

948
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,474
<i>Yes, do that immediately.
And upload it as our headline.</i>

949
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,519
<i>I know some people may ask
why I've been silent about it.</i>

950
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,147
<i>They may think I'm dense.</i>

951
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,649
<i>Being assaulted was frightening.</i>

952
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,986
<i>But not being able to run
was even more terrifying.</i>

953
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,030
<i>I didn't want to worry
my grandmother either.</i>

954
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,450
<i>I believed everything would be fine
if I endured it.</i>

955
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,910
<i>After some time,</i>

01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,288
<i>it was bearable.</i>

957
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,230
<i>All the articles claiming
that Ki Seon-gyeom</i>

958
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,774
<i>was the assailant aren't true.</i>

959
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:03,029
<i>He's the only person who was on my side.</i>

960
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,465
REHABILITATION CENTER

961
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,062
Did Woo-sik come by today?

962
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,730
No, he didn't.

963
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:47,156
<i>I was inspired by Ki Seon-gyeom to run,</i>

964
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,743
<i>and I always strived to be like him.</i>

965
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:13,683
<i>I need to be in rehab for months
because of the recent assault.</i>

966
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,560
<i>"Will I be able</i>

967
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,814
<i>to make the same records
after getting rehab?</i>

968
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,236
Will I even be able to come back?"

969
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,740
I thought for a long time

970
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,744
and have decided not to come back.

971
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,456
I'm going to quit sports.

972
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,461
I came here prepared to say this.

973
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,445
Did you already know

974
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,114
that Woo-sik was quitting?

975
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,869
Yes. I interpreted for him.

976
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,663
Why didn't you tell me?

977
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,875
Because you'd be like this.

978
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,215
You did what you did,
hoping he'd continue.

979
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,511
So I thought it'd break your heart to know
that he was quitting.

980
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,851
Why did you have to let me
find out like this?

981
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,562
Both of you.

982
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,735
You have so much to learn.

983
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,989
You're considerate to everyone around you.

984
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,951
Did you not think that kind boy
would feel the same way?

985
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,290
No one is born

986
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,460
being able to endure pain from the start.

987
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,712
So…

988
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,842
don't try to seem okay
if that's what you're doing.

989
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,018
Come inside for now.

990
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,524
Come on.

991
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,641
Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm doing.

992
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,687
I know.

993
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,065
You're comforting me.

994
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,194
Correct.

995
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,463
<i>Of all the things I've loved,
why have I never loved myself?</i>

996
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,340
Thank you for giving me
the chance to retire.

997
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,676
<i>-I really am unemployed now.
-I heard you left the hotel.</i>

998
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,761
Move into my apartment.

999
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:22,139
If I wasn't born rich,
I could have been more rowdy.

1000
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,516
<i>How can a bracelet cost 10 million won?</i>

1001
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,810
<i>-Sell me the new painting at the cafe.</i>
-I'm not selling it.

1002
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,479
Is that how you're going to be?

1003
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,064
Ms. Oh.

1004
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,441
I'll stay with you if you ask me to.

1005
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,692
-<i>Did you two go out or something?</i>
-No.

1006
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,486
<i>I thought we were in a love triangle.</i>

1007
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,445
<i>Damn it, she did it again.</i>

1008
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,239
Write that you'll get off work
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1009
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,448
Yes.

1010
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,744
<i>Seon-gyeom is asleep behind that door.</i>

1011
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,665
<i>You must be excited to see me struggle.</i>

1012
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,416
I'm excited to be running with you.

1013
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,293
You're here because you want to
stay at my place, right?

1014
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,587
-Can I?
-Let's go to my place.
