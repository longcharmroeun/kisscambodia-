1
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,014
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,932
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,742
She's my girlfriend.

4
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,787
Have you lost your mind?

5
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,039
I'm serious.

6
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,708
Are you insane? Seriously?

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
Seriously.

8
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,513
Oh, my gosh. My goodness.

9
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,390
Hello.
Did you call for a chauffeur service?

10
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,312
-Which one of you called?
-That guy.

11
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,898
-Over here.
-Okay.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,025
Are you okay?

13
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,656
Did you take the photos?

14
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,699
She isn't a celebrity,

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,993
so stay quiet
if you don't want to get sued.

16
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,954
And I don't care about Ki Seon-gyeom.

17
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,497
He's not even my boyfriend.

18
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,082
Bye, guys.

19
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,662
You're up.

20
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,623
We live together.
We're not dating, we're friends.

21
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,041
So don't get the wrong idea.

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,461
My gosh. You were kind enough
to let me live with you.

23
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,801
Hello, I'm Ki Seon-gyeom.

24
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,596
I'm sorry this is how we had to meet,

25
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,307
but since I'm already here,
may I use your bathroom?

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,725
You must be pretty clean.

27
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,811
-Yes, kind of.
-What are you going to wash?

28
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,897
Your face? Hair? Body?

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,526
-Is there a limit?
-Make yourself at home

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,737
I'll give you a toothbrush. Wait a second.

31
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,951
Here. Eat this first.

32
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,288
-What is it?
-It's for your hangover.

33
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,916
Haven't you seen it before?
You should take it often.

34
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,918
You're too much of a lightweight.

35
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,545
Here. Take it.

36
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,741
I put new clothes there.
Feel free to wear them.

37
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,369
-Is this it?
-Yes.

38
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,163
You didn't have to do this. Thank you.

39
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,721
Your clothes are in the wash.

40
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,515
That's for men.

41
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,018
We purposely hang it out on the balcony
to keep us safe.

42
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,603
But no one's ever worn it though.

43
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,730
What's wrong? Is it too flashy?

44
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,110
I wasn't able to think that far.

45
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,487
I'm just surprised
people actually do that.

46
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,907
Thanks for letting me wear this.

47
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,034
Borrow it if you want.
Just make sure you return it.

48
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,995
No, I'm good. I'll return it right away.

49
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,454
Okay.

50
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,249
I'm sorry to interrupt,

51
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,960
but your shoes were a mess too.

52
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,963
We also have a pair of men's shoes,
so you can wear them home.

53
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,801
-I'm not sure if they'll fit.
-My goodness, it's like he's Cinderella.

54
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,219
You know Cinderella, right?

55
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,346
Do you know the story or not?

56
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,182
Cinderella was bullied
By her sisters and stepmother

57
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,560
So you do know.
We won't bully you, so sit down.

58
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,354
There we go.

59
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,607
Isn't it "Stepmother and sisters"?
I think he's still drunk.

60
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,568
This is it.

61
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,821
This is the meal I owe you. Dig in.

62
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,241
I'll do the dishes.

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,744
-Okay.
-Thank you for the meal.

64
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,704
My mom makes really good short rib soup.

65
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,081
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

66
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,880
By the way,

67
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,340
how did I end up coming here?

68
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,928
I don't see a home address
on his navigation history.

69
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,639
There's the training center, the agency…

70
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,851
-There's Seoul Hotel.
-A hotel?

71
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,063
Should I drive to Seoul Hotel?

72
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,481
My goodness.

73
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,358
The hotel sounds like the best option.

74
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,779
Just take us
to Hannam five-way intersection.

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,905
-Hannam five-way intersection?
-Yes.

76
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,864
Okay, you got it.

77
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,575
I'd punch him if I could.

78
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,330
Beginning navigation.

79
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,293
How do you feel? Do you feel better now?

80
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,431
Gosh, darn it.

81
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,143
That hurts.

82
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,437
My gosh. Wait.

83
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,232
Wait.

84
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,741
Oh, my goodness!

85
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,495
What's going on?

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,832
-Hey, May.
-What's that on your back?

87
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,334
You're unbelievable.

88
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,254
I found him on my way home.
Isn't he pretty?

89
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,423
Gosh, I'm cold.

90
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,883
I wanted to leave you behind,

91
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,344
but if you died,
I'd be summoned by the police.

92
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,471
So I carried you here on my back.

93
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,974
You didn't exactly carry him on your back.

94
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,810
To be more exact,
she dragged you here on her back.

95
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,645
Yes, it's always best to be exact.

96
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,316
So tell me.
When exactly did you black out?

97
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:30,408
I just remember paying.
I don't remember anything

98
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,244
after that.

99
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,622
That's where you blacked out?

100
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,833
You deserve a beating.
You promised yesterday.

101
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,837
Did I promise that yesterday?

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,006
So it wasn't a dream?

103
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,593
I guess not.

104
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,931
Hit me. You should've hit me
right after I kissed you.

105
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,852
We didn't kiss.
It was just a peck on the lips.

106
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,815
What's your lip balm?
It was delicious and moist.

107
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
-You talk like a guy.
-I need to check.

108
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,988
I just use whatever.

109
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,783
Birds of a feather flock together.

110
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,121
So it wasn't a dream.

111
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,143
I'll go on my own from here.

112
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,478
I'll be off now.

113
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,106
You look good in that outfit.

114
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,234
Thanks for the compliment.

115
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,612
I always wanted to buy a car
after I got myself a house.

116
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,323
But unfortunately,
I haven't bought a house yet.

117
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,493
I saw on the news
that a car driving 200km per hour

118
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,411
crashed into this car,

119
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,206
but the guy who drove this car
only ended up with bruises.

120
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,417
I also saw that news. It wasn't this car.

121
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,297
This obviously has a V8 engine.
I bet it drives really fast.

122
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,801
It's always been my dream
to drive a car like this.

123
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,512
And it just happens to be
right in front of me.

124
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,138
It has a V6 engine, not a V8.

125
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,394
I'm just asking for a ride.
Can't you do that for me?

126
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,939
Other couples share their cars
all the time.

127
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,316
You said so yourself that we're dating.

128
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,821
Then that would make me insane.

129
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,541
I need to go meet Ms. Seo.
Is that okay with you?

130
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,170
Yes, I'm fine. I'll just stay in the car.

131
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,464
-Is it a meeting?
-No, I need to apologize.

132
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,759
-"Apologize"?
-I got angry at her yesterday.

133
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,511
But it's not good
to get your emotions involved.

134
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,639
Do you normally get emotional with her?

135
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,558
No, not normally. But yesterday, I did.

136
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,144
Get in. Let's go for a ride.

137
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,906
Mr. Ki, what brings you here?

138
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,825
Is Ms. Seo inside?

139
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,287
She just went to the head office.
Should I leave her a memo?

140
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,539
I'll talk to her myself.

141
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,833
Mr. Ki.

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,087
Ms. Seo cares a lot about you.

143
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,631
I hope you know that.

144
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,507
I do.

145
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,355
Get in.

146
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,339
Did you meet Ms. Seo?

147
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,508
No, she seems busy.

148
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,677
Where to this time?

149
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,389
-The hospital.
-Why?

150
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,474
-Someone's hospitalized.
-I see.

151
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,187
I should get a stuffed doll
on my way there.

152
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,980
I know a great place for that.

153
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,066
-I'll take you there.
-Okay. Thanks.

154
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,031
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

155
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
How long have you been driving?

156
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,368
You didn't know?

157
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,455
Is it your plan to steal my car?

158
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,083
You think my plan is merely
to steal your car?

159
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,839
Gosh, what's wrong with that jerk?
What's his problem?

160
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,716
You're at fault, you know.

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,677
-No, I'm not.
-My gosh.

162
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,596
You can't just deny it.

163
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,849
You have a driver's license, right?

164
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,152
Perfect.

165
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,830
Excellent.

166
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,249
Heads up.

167
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,711
The person at the hospital must be young.

168
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,838
Yes, I guess.

169
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,299
Don't people normally get patients
fruits or drinks?

170
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,593
I want to give him a friend.

171
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,720
It gets boring when you're alone.

172
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,055
If you talk to stuffed dolls,
they'll get possessed.

173
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,309
But why couldn't we just buy one instead?

174
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,686
Because it's more fun to win it.

175
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,646
Just a second.

176
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,986
I sent you the interview questions
for Mr. Ki's photoshoot.

177
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,154
Please look over them.

178
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,406
Mr. Jeong just gave me work.
I should go now.

179
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,618
Thanks for the stuffed doll
and for driving me.

180
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,995
But don't buy a car.

181
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,039
You're a terrible driver.

182
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,127
Does this mean
we're not going to talk about

183
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,213
what happened yesterday?

184
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,257
I got you that doll and drove you here
hoping we'd talk about it.

185
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Why don't you hit me now?

186
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,802
I'll apologize if that's what you want.

187
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,846
You don't need to accept my apology
if you don't want to.

188
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,141
You can sue me too. I'll make sure
Ms. Seo doesn't call her lawyers.

189
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,019
If you want, you can do all of the above.

190
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,897
You left out the most important part.

191
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,899
I want to know why.

192
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,318
Why did you do that to me?

193
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,573
I wanted to avoid the situation.

194
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,451
-And you just happened to be there.
-What?

195
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,204
You talk as if you would have
done that to anyone.

196
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,831
I was too drunk yesterday.

197
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,125
I would have kissed whoever I was with.

198
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,752
If it really didn't matter to you,

199
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,046
why didn't you kiss Tae-ri's dad?

200
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,507
What?

201
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,678
Why did you kiss me if it didn't matter?
Is it because you're straight?

202
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,054
Don't get me wrong--

203
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,265
Hitting you sounds most appealing.

204
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,474
But I'll save it.

205
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,018
It's too crowded here,
and I'm a woman of culture.

206
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,187
Have fun visiting your friend.

207
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,277
Impressive. You pack a mean punch.

208
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,787
Hello.

209
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,540
Are you Woo-sik's friend?

210
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,208
Woo-sik and I train together.

211
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,626
My name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

212
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,170
You look so pretty.

213
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,423
I almost thought you were a woman.

214
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,633
-I'm a man.
-Go on inside.

215
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,803
I need to go to work now.

216
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,513
-You work?
-Yes.

217
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,517
It's nothing grand, but I clean buildings.

218
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,603
By the way,

219
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,940
did Woo-sik get hurt while training?

220
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,735
I keep asking him, but he won't tell me.

221
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,487
I'm asking because I'm worried.

222
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,781
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,909
Why are you sorry?

224
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,163
I'm just grateful
that you came to visit him.

225
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,664
Thank you.

226
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,508
Seon-gyeom.

227
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,428
Are you that happy
that you don't have to train?

228
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,596
You're smiling ear to ear.

229
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,974
What are you wearing?

230
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,602
-And what's with that doll?
-It's yours.

231
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,773
Did you get this for me?

232
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,608
Let it keep you company.

233
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,985
-Your legs must hurt. Sit down.
-Okay.

234
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,197
I didn't know your grandmother
would be here.

235
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,823
I just met her out front.

236
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,370
-You didn't tell her anything, right?
-No.

237
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,166
How do you feel?
I'm sure you're still not okay.

238
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,670
It'll take a while to start running again
because of rehabilitation.

239
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,923
I guess you won't get to come
to the off-season training in Jeju.

240
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,300
That's the least of my worries right now.

241
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,302
What's going to happen to you?

242
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,389
They can go ahead and discipline me

243
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,349
or suspend me.

244
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,728
But it happened because of me,
so just tell them that--

245
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,896
Seriously.

246
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,816
If I do that,
people will think we're dating.

247
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,319
-It's not funny.
-I'm not trying to be funny.

248
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,904
I'm seriously worried.

249
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,864
Did you want to be a hero?

250
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,284
You talk as if I saved my country
or something

251
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,245
when I couldn't even save you.

252
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,455
You knew that already.

253
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,501
-Why did you even bother?
-Because you would have put up with it.

254
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,422
You finally became a national athlete,

255
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,799
so you wouldn't have wanted
to raise an issue.

256
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,636
You would have also been worried
about the repercussions.

257
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,097
On the other hand, I'll be retiring soon.

258
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,641
I don't mind getting kicked out.

259
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,561
I have a lot of money too.

260
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,938
You're annoying.

261
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,775
-Yes, joke around like that.
-I meant it.

262
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,403
I'll see you then.

263
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,364
Seon-gyeom.

264
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,410
I wasn't able to thank you properly
because things were so hectic.

265
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,537
But thank you so much.

266
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,626
Does this really look bad?

267
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,756
Your outfit doesn't matter.
I really am grateful.

268
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,638
Rest up. You're still injured,
so get some rest.

269
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,130
FAMILY GATHERING
TOMORROW 3 P.M.

270
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,727
Are they kidding me?

271
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,481
This is pretty much
an exclusive interview.

272
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,822
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

273
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,743
There's a small problem with
the interview questions you sent me.

274
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,995
Is it about the translation?

275
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,665
You just need to focus on
Mr. Ki's questions.

276
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,253
He's like a third wheel in this interview.
There's not much about him.

277
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,712
Yes.

278
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,841
Okay, I'll summarize the issues
and email them to you.

279
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,177
Okay. Bye.

280
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,099
I'm working so hard
for that annoying punk.

281
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,108
He wanted to come himself,

282
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,902
but his meeting hadn't ended
so I had to come instead.

283
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,114
He'll probably have a good excuse
even when he dies.

284
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,783
You'll be riding the same car
once his meeting ends.

285
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,329
Yes, I know.
We need to get out of the same car.

286
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,001
Drop me off at a beauty parlor.

287
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,880
I should make sure I look nice
for the photos.

288
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,596
It's the athlete who committed assault.
Do you stay here too?

289
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,056
-I live here.
-Still?

290
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,683
Then let me go with you.

291
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,685
I don't want to take the car
that Dad sent.

292
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,979
Who told you about me?

293
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,856
I know everything.

294
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,820
Are you really dating Choi Tae-ri?

295
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,906
Why didn't you invite me to meet her?

296
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,867
We're not dating.
I'm getting sick of this.

297
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,578
I'm sick of it too, you know.

298
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,914
Everyone I meet asks me about it.

299
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,124
But I thought you knew everything?

300
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,292
You're right.

301
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,086
How long are you staying this time?

302
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,256
Until I wrap up ad campaigns,
attend the events I'm invited to,

303
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,301
and catch that son of a bitch.

304
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,304
That son of a bitch?
Ryan? He ran off again?

305
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,390
Ran off? Again?
One might get the wrong idea.

306
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,017
Are you even together?

307
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,686
We are if I say we are.

308
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,064
Ranking first in the world
gives me the authority.

309
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,528
A CLEAN ADMINISTRATION WITH KI JEONG-DO

310
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,614
I'm sick and tired of election periods.

311
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,951
He puts us on display
like animals at the zoo.

312
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,704
Can't he stop using us for his campaign?
Has he no shame?

313
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,665
There's no reason for him to stop

314
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,501
since it's the only reason we exist.

315
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,349
It's good to see you.

316
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,185
Dad!

317
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,147
-How is it that you always look good?
-You only see me when I'm dolled up.

318
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,234
I sent it home not knowing where you'd be.

319
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,944
I'm glad you found it.

320
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,114
My manager made the delivery,
but it was me who picked it out.

321
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,783
I know. It has you written all over it.

322
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,547
Hello.

323
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,716
Seon-gyeom, my goodness!

324
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,512
You've lost so much weight
since I last saw you.

325
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,265
I haven't lost any, actually.

326
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,433
That can't be true.

327
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,521
I can smell japchae.

328
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,816
Well, I heard you'd be here.

329
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,027
I know how much you like it.

330
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
Do you want to try it?

331
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,957
The punishment for
bringing home a guest unannounced

332
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,375
is to read a transcript?

333
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,461
It's more of an honor than a penalty.

334
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,254
This will be as big as La La Land.

335
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,341
But I hate musicals!

336
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,968
No one has hired you yet.

337
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm just asking you to take a look.

338
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,432
You're not allowed to go home
until you do.

339
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,316
La La Land's box office score…

340
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,694
La La Land.

341
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,156
LA LA LAND

NETIZENS THRILLED
BY THE AFFECTIONATE COUPLE

345
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,256
I'm used to this, so I'm fine.

346
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,592
If he's fine because he's used to it…

347
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,054
it must mean he wasn't at first.

348
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,063
Mr. Ki, are you sure
you're okay with this?

349
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,655
Why do you look like that in the photos?
I'd like you to answer.

350
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,703
How is this even flirting?

351
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,667
You weren't shy of smiling
when you were drunk.

352
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,468
Thank you, Lord,

353
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,847
for blessing us with today's meal.

354
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,184
Our whole family hasn't
gathered to eat in a while,

355
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,104
so let us enjoy this feast
and return safely home.

356
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,233
In the name of Jesus we pray,

357
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,026
amen.

358
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,534
You. What's with that
actress you're dating?

359
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,120
- We're not dating.
- How can you be silly enough

360
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,915
to let reporters catch you
with that tacky clown of an actress?

361
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,294
This tacky clown of an actress
is thrilled by the name-calling.

362
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,089
Why were you at the police station?

363
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,051
It's one of the last places
you should ever be spotted at.

364
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,138
Assemblyman Ki,
do you still keep tabs on Seon-gyeom?

365
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,182
People might think you actually love him.

366
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,435
Of course, I love him.
I'm his father, aren't I?

367
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,691
Why can't you be
even a fraction like your sister?

368
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,651
She's been a golfer her whole life

369
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,528
and always managed to win first place.

370
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,113
What about you though?

371
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,491
The best you can do is second place
and now you get in fights like a kid?

372
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,911
Be ashamed of yourself.

373
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,996
Dad, that's a weird way to put it.

374
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,789
Can he fight if he was a kid?

375
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,666
Did you come out on top?

376
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,461
Of course, he should have.
He's my son, isn't he?

377
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,588
Anyway,

378
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,383
what a proud moment
for a national athlete.

379
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,718
I see you've been patient.

380
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,679
You normally would have
given me an earful for every incident.

381
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,390
I was busy campaigning.

382
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,516
I'm a very busy man.

383
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,518
You sure do know a lot for a busy man.

384
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,981
I'll take care
of the disciplinary committee,

385
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,359
-so stay put.
-Are you going to pay them?

386
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,986
Why did you have to assault them?

387
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,863
I never asked for much.

388
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,490
You have everything.

389
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,326
All I wanted was for you
to stay on the national team.

390
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,453
Is that seriously so hard to do?

391
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,497
And why choose to be a runner?

392
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,250
I should have had you play soccer instead.

393
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,461
What's the use of a man with no ambition?

394
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:50,340
Isn't it better to not have any rather
than grinding yourself to have some?

395
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,344
Are you mocking me right now?

396
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,265
About the disciplinary committee…

397
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,310
Don't stop the disciplinary committee.
Let me get punished.

398
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,062
You darn punk!

399
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,698
You being disciplined
will put a dent in my political career!

400
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,616
Why must you be disciplined?

401
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,244
It's not like you used drugs for
leisure or performance-enhancement.

402
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,037
You only roughed up some kids!

403
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,833
Shall we go with the latter then?
It sounds more like a juicy story.

404
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,006
I'll go before I ruin lunch even more.

405
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,013
Happy anniversary.

406
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,478
What's his problem?

407
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,939
Couldn't you…

408
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,109
have done a better job raising him?

409
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,948
If that were my priority,
I would have become Mother of the Year,

410
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,450
not the Queen of Cannes.

411
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,873
A damn mess like always.

412
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,251
Seon-gyeom!

413
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,463
Hey, Seon-gyeom!

414
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,177
I was told to give this to you.
It's japchae.

415
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,763
-Eun-bi.
-Aren't you going to take it?

416
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,273
For not introducing me to your girlfriend?

418
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,111
I will next time.

419
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,989
Head back inside.

420
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,091
Park May, darn you.

421
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,344
You sure know how to pick a good movie.

422
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,391
What a way to end the movie.

423
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,028
Damn it. Damn this musical!

424
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:12,667
HAPPY PHARMACY

425
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,056
What's he eating?

426
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,478
Is he actually eating something?

427
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,028
What were you eating?

428
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,489
Japchae.

429
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,992
Why were you eating that out here
for everyone to see?

430
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,119
I was hungry. Were you out today?

431
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,163
I was at my roommate's office.

432
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,040
Did you come here to see me?

433
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,250
-Yes.
-For what reason?

434
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,961
I wasn't able to come up with one.

435
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,340
How about this?
You're here to return the clothes.

436
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,217
-That's right.
-As if.

437
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,135
I didn't hand them over in a lunchbox.

438
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,185
You should have called.

439
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,438
Maybe I should have.

440
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,110
But my phone's turned off.

441
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,323
Seriously.
Why have you turned ditzy overnight?

442
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,992
And what's with the wound on your face?

443
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,459
Hold on. I happen to have
an ointment with me.

444
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,175
Here.

445
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,845
Thanks.

446
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,641
I also have a plaster.

447
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,853
Not there. Here.

448
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,906
-Why are you always hurt?
-Beats me. Maybe I do seek attention.

449
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,368
I saw your photo.
It was taken at your house.

450
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,538
-I thought you didn't have one.
-I only do…

451
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,874
on days like this.

452
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,126
A home is where you come back to…

453
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,841
just like you did now.

454
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,139
-Did you just touch me?
-I didn't want to waste it.

455
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,142
-Why squeeze out so much?
-That usually happens with a new one.

456
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,855
It's my fault for having a cut too, right?
I bet it is.

457
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,491
About your home…

458
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,247
If you don't have one, why not
get yourself something similar instead?

459
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,712
It's what I did.

460
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,506
A place I can come back to.

461
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,324
When X is one, this will be A.
Then what do you need to solve this?

462
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,369
-Factorization and reduction of fractions.
-Right, then we get two.

463
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,663
Since the two equations must be equal,

464
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,207
So A is two, and number three
is the correct answer.

465
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,792
Got it? That's how you solve it.

466
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,294
An art student who's good at math?

467
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,295
You shouldn't exist.

468
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,548
A sports major who hasn't given up
on math. You shouldn't exist either.

469
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,426
Actually, no. I'm not giving up
so that I can fool Mom.

470
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,845
What's with that tone?

471
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,431
I can't tell if you're
being negative or not.

472
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,059
-Kids these days--
-Whatever.

473
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,021
Your mom doesn't know
you want to be an athlete, right?

474
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,064
I'd be dead if she did.

475
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,150
If it's her you want to fool,
you should study at home

476
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,277
and not at a coffee shop like this.

477
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,197
Mom's never home. Only her son is.

478
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,949
Why do you hate Ye-jun so much?

479
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,284
An only child wouldn't know.
Why must there be a reason?

480
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,955
I just don't get
why your smart brother can't tutor you.

481
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,334
Because he doesn't understand
why I can't solve this equation.

482
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,962
He doesn't get why my grades suck.

483
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,588
I mean…

484
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,259
Ye-jun, how can I solve this?

485
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,970
"The two real roots are alpha and beta…"

486
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,097
Minus five and minus three respectively.

487
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,391
Put that in the equation
to get the answer.

488
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,186
I want you to tell me
how to draw that conclusion.

489
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,899
This is the same as the earth being round.

490
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:55,450
Goh Ye-chan, get over her. It's urgent!
I'm not kidding.

491
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,576
Goh Ye-chan!

492
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,411
What?

493
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,329
-I have a question to ask.
-What is it?

494
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,416
How is it that you're so dumb?
Honestly, I'm curious.

495
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,085
-What the…
-Damn it.

496
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,963
Ye-chan, it's for real this time.

497
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,299
What now?

498
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,634
Turn off the light on your way out.

499
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,511
You!

500
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,853
So Ye-jun's to blame.

501
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,566
Anyway, let's get back to studying.

502
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,612
Are you seeing someone?

503
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,156
Why not ask about my first love too?

504
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,700
Yes, tell me.
Who, what, when, where, why, and how.

505
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,286
I know you're only trying
to get out of studying.

506
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,370
It worked until now.

507
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,208
Next question.

508
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,543
When was your first love?

509
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,005
It's never happened for me yet.

510
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,300
-Why not?
-Because it hasn't!

511
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,843
Anyway, next question. Please.

512
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,428
-Please.
-Please!

513
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,930
-Next question.
-Please tell me!

514
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,264
I don't have one!

515
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,368
It's the lookbook for the photo shoot
from the States.

516
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,787
You'll be in clothes by Seomyung Fashion.

517
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,374
The concept will be
the mix-and-match of high-end clothing…

518
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,753
Why are you glaring like that?

519
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,757
I see you're desperately trying
to win the chairman's favor.

520
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,969
I was just admiring your tenacity.

521
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,431
I'm desperately trying to get you
to wear our clothes.

522
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,641
Why can't you see that?

523
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,185
I don't like you.

524
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,606
I wonder if you're aware
of how cute you are when you're this way.

525
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,401
I'm telling you to stop using my brother.

526
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,029
How can I
when it leads to conversations with you

527
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,614
and ad campaigns?

528
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,491
It's like you're holding him hostage.

529
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,536
Then let's sign the contract.

530
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,997
That came out of the blue.

531
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,750
You're the one putting ideas in my head.

532
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,627
As if.

533
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,756
What will you do about
Seon-gyeom's assault?

534
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,426
He seems to have done it
knowing he'd be disciplined.

535
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,428
Oh, that.

536
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,933
Have you ever argued with your brother?

537
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,519
We've never spent enough time together
to do so.

538
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,023
-Did you two get into a fight?
-I'm not sure

539
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,358
if he got angry with me or I provoked him.

540
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,652
Seon-gyeom rarely gets angry.

541
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,237
If he did though,

542
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,615
then that'd be on you.

543
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,074
But I never do anything wrong.

544
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,368
I'd only do so
if I was treated the wrong way.

545
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,081
While we discuss who's at fault,

546
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,125
your father will have the issue dismissed.

547
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,587
I know this isn't right,

548
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,882
but I get why Dad would do that.

549
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,091
Seon-gyeom's my brother.

550
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,470
An assault on fellow athletes?

551
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,347
That could end his career.

552
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,310
Being in the States must have drained
all the Korean blood out of you.

553
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,480
An assault charge
isn't the end of the world,

554
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,856
especially in this country.

555
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,276
No one was injured severely
and it was over nothing anyway.

556
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,321
We were slacking off,

557
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,281
so Seon-gyeom only taught us a lesson.

558
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,991
By the sound of it,

559
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,328
it seems like a simple scuffle
between the athletes.

560
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,082
It wasn't even a scuffle.
Seon-gyeom was only setting us straight.

561
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,084
Calling this an assault

562
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,670
is embarrassing on our part.

563
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,755
We were out of line.

564
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,508
-I'm sorry, Seon-gyeom.
-I'm sorry.

565
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,928
Why make a big fuss over
what is only a simple argument?

566
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,806
It was an assault,
and I'll be punished for it.

567
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,890
Punished for what?

568
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,558
There's no victim here.

569
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,727
They're not saying
that you assaulted them,

570
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,354
so why call it one yourself?

571
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,315
Seon-gyeom, isn't it odd for this case

572
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,943
to only have an offender and no victim?

573
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,778
Just be careful from now on.

574
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,615
I'm sure Seon-gyeom
is sorry for his actions,

575
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,701
so let's not make a big deal out of this.

576
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,620
Make good when you can, then.
We should end the session.

577
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,456
-Sure thing.
-This concludes the hearing.

578
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,293
Is this all that we're discussing?

579
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,420
Must there be more?

580
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,671
We should wrap this up.

581
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,717
Has this been the story
for all disciplinary hearings?

582
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,885
Full of happy endings
with no offenders or victims?

583
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,137
Watch your mouth.

584
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,598
Can't you see that you're
muddying up clear water?

585
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,059
There has rarely been
a hearing for track athletes!

586
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,811
Talking of rare sights,

587
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,564
will you call it an assault
if I beat them right now?

588
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,982
What?

589
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,279
I doubt it, right?

590
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,868
There's no way.

591
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,354
-I bet you're exhausted.
-Right.

592
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,230
I made reservations at a restaurant.
Go and eat.

593
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,273
Coach.

594
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,444
What did you do with
what Woo-sik gave you?

595
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,196
Didn't you hand it in?

596
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,824
Seon-gyeom, coach will come by soon.

597
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,953
I'll hand him
all the evidence of the assault.

598
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,166
It'll help you get a lesser punishment.

599
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,501
Don't worry about me.

600
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,128
Are you sure about this?

601
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,340
You know, it's been great
to be hospitalized.

602
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,967
I don't get beat up in here.

603
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,972
I would like to think

604
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,393
that I could change something

605
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,981
with my courage. That's all.

606
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,569
It was nothing.

607
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,655
There was no use submitting it.

608
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,323
Who are you to decide that?

609
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,118
Did you also tell them to say the things
back there?

610
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,370
Hey, it's all over.
Don't cause another issue.

611
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,122
-Sir--
-This wouldn't have happened

612
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,459
if you had talked it out
from the very beginning.

613
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,798
Are you saying it was wrong of me
to speak up from the get-go?

614
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,300
Because you've brought them here?

615
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,928
How dare you talk like that to me?

616
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,013
Are you just going to feign ignorance?

617
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,640
-Aren't you embarrassed?
-You punk!

618
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,267
Sir, we're at the association building.

619
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,894
-Please don't.
-Let me go, you bastard!

620
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,901
You must think you're entitled
because of your dad.

621
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,654
I wouldn't have been able to do this
if that was the case.

622
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,114
Seon-gyeom, that's enough!

623
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,575
You're going to pay for this.

624
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,869
Sir, you should go. Please.

625
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,461
Discipline him properly.

626
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,883
Go on your way. Look natural.

627
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,885
Sir!

628
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,181
Hey, let's go.

629
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,309
You're sorry for being rash?

630
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,648
You can say the same thing
to Woo-sik too, right?

631
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,112
Oddly, I don't feel bad for him.

632
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,531
Did he ever do you wrong?

633
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,202
If that concerns you so much,
I'll give it a thought.

634
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,661
So quit being hypocritical.

635
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,207
Thanks to your dad,
you can get away with anything.

636
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,334
-Let's just go.
-Let go, damn it.

637
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,421
Am I wrong? Why do you act so noble?

638
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,757
What's so different about us?

639
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,759
You're right.

640
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,720
No, I'm worse.

641
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,389
Because I gave him hope.

642
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,491
Where did you get this?

643
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,535
He's my buddy now.

644
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,495
Why does he look this way, though?

645
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,369
Are you Ms. Oh Mi-joo?

646
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,454
-Yes.
-You can wait with me.

647
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,540
-He'll be out soon.
-Okay.

648
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,422
It's an honor to meet you.

649
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,008
Why did you want to see me?

650
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,385
I just wanted to say hi

651
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,596
since you're looking after my son.

652
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,098
He's lucky to have you as his father.

653
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,101
This is only a week-long job,
yet you're taking an interest.

654
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,105
And yet, I feel sad
since he doesn't appreciate me.

655
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,357
Am I just a foolish dad?

656
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:35,529
To tell you the truth,
Seon-gyeom got himself in a pickle.

657
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,157
Just like his dad,
he could be difficult to deal with.

658
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,659
He can be unpredictable when he's upset.

659
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,454
I'd like you to keep him under control.

660
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:49,084
As an interpreter, I'm sure you know
how to sugarcoat everything.

661
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,586
Pardon?

662
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,216
I'd like you to report
on everything that he does.

663
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,053
You'll be following him around
as his interpreter.

664
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,348
I trust that you won't have
other intentions

665
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,891
such as chatting him up.

666
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,442
Here. Take it.

667
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,534
I've seen this situation before.

668
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,829
-What is this?
-How should I put it?

669
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,956
For your expenses?

670
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,045
Are you paying me
with the citizens' hard-earned money?

671
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,673
Wouldn't they think this is a moral deed

672
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,842
if I were to give alms with their money?

673
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,303
Professor Hwang told me

674
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,765
that you grew up well
despite your adverse upbringing.

675
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,936
If you're uncomfortable with this,
let's just say

676
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,605
that I'm giving you some allowance
in your parents' stead.

677
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,946
Why would you replace my parents?

678
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,281
It's not your fault that they passed away.

679
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,745
Then we can just say
that it's condolence money.

680
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,790
Sir, the intermission is almost over.

681
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,291
The mayor is already seated.

682
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,501
Okay.

683
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,962
I'll see you on Jeju Island,

684
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,132
Ms. Interpreter.
I trust that you'll do well.

685
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,620
I should still be sleeping at this hour.

686
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,914
I really don't want to go.

687
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,614
-Ms. Oh!
-Yes?

688
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:07,991
Hello, Ms. Ki Eun-bi.

689
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,661
Get in. We're going the same way.

690
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,955
Right. How did you know me?

691
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,290
Of course, I didn't.

692
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,000
He recognized you.

693
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,727
Ms. Seo will arrive tomorrow.

694
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,897
We don't need to wear her clothes today.

695
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,567
Let me make a call.

696
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,865
What's going on?

697
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,743
With your interpreter.

698
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,911
She interprets for me.

699
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:10,387
Being the best in something
is actually quite boring.

700
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,599
At times, people need
something to look up to.

701
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,350
I have to look into the mirror.

702
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,521
Can we skip this one? It's boring.

703
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,869
Because I'm Korean.

704
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,537
Yes, I'm fluent in English.

705
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,539
But many athletes are more fluent
than I am.

706
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,083
I'm still the best golfer out there.

707
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,753
Why use English

708
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,963
when the number-one golfer is Korean?

709
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,341
It's a chance to let everyone hear Korean.

710
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,511
That's commendable reasoning.

711
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,642
I'm sorry, but please excuse me
for a minute.

712
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,826
She's so cool.

713
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,664
Do you even understand her?

714
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,293
You should treat her well.
She's looking out for you.

715
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,845
-I'll leave.
-Okay.

716
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,685
Mr. Ki, I'm Reporter Yoo A-in
from Sports Tomorrow.

717
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,437
I came here today
since you'd be busy training tomorrow.

718
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,439
-Do you have some time?
-I'm sorry.

719
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,525
I'm a big fan.

720
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,777
Did you read the article
about the scandal?

721
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,195
I wrote that.

722
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,407
Is it true that you assaulted
a fellow athlete?

723
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,742
Everyone's sweeping it under the rug.

724
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,537
But you see, I have great interest in you.

725
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,122
I just want to check the facts.

726
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,791
-Can you make some time?
-I'm sorry.

727
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,210
Gosh.

728
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,962
Damn it.

729
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,756
I love him so much.

730
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,883
What's so great about him?

731
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,511
Make sure you take
good photos of him tomorrow.

732
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,055
That way,
our article will get many clicks.

733
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,348
Got it.

734
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,744
I can't blame Seon-gyeom
for his father's rude behavior.

735
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,747
I feel so uncomfortable around him.

736
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,465
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where Assemblyman Ki Jeong-do's room is?

737
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,301
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we can't.

738
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,220
You see, he had hired me
as an interpreter.

739
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,389
I have something to give back to him.

740
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,474
Is it not possible?

741
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,225
I'm sorry.

742
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,020
No, I understand. I'm sorry.

743
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,441
He's not here yet. He'll arrive tomorrow.

744
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,776
Ms. Ki.

745
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,361
I didn't know that.

746
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,239
By the way, why do you have his belonging?

747
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,533
Well…

748
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,789
Oh, that was an invasion of privacy.
I'm sorry.

749
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,291
I just saw you and wanted to say hi.

750
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,418
Seon-gyeom found himself
a good interpreter.

751
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,631
No, I'm not a good interpreter.

752
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,801
I should get going then. Goodbye.

753
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,632
Ms. Oh--

754
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,885
Who are you?

755
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,263
Ms. Oh.

756
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,854
What was that?

757
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,733
Are you crying?

758
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,528
You startled me.

759
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,618
Well,

760
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,580
I'm truly sorry about this.

761
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,960
I thought you were just
out for a jog like me. Anyway…

762
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,795
I think I know

763
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:58,258
what went through your mind,

764
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,260
so I'm really sorry about that.

765
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,263
Why would you run late at night
like some lunatic?

766
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,806
You're right.

767
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,685
I must be insane. I had trouble digesting.

768
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,854
Why? That was some good food.

769
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,983
I had a lot on my mind.

770
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,485
I couldn't do anything.

771
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,280
So if I were to go by the book,

772
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,157
I shouldn't have been here.

773
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,701
But you have a tight schedule.

774
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,495
A photo shoot, an interview,
and the training.

775
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,665
I need to run a bit more.

776
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,500
Could you wait for me?

777
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,130
Try to calm down in the meantime.

778
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,117
How are you feeling?

779
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,994
Have you calmed down a bit?

780
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,247
Let's stay here a bit more.

781
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,543
Sure. Let's do that.

782
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,093
Had I had a gun,
I would have shot you in the head.

783
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,886
I'm sorry again.

784
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,017
Does that mean that lighter
was for self-defense?

785
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,685
Something like that.

786
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,395
Did you bring it with you?

787
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,772
It's at the training center.

788
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,483
-What?
-But I can't go there.

789
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,484
Why not?

790
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,529
Because I assaulted my juniors.

791
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,160
We should walk now, right?

792
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:32,954
Let's go.

793
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,382
The association rewards its athletes

794
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,967
whenever they set a new record.

795
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:51,973
But let's be honest.
That doesn't happen very often.

796
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,641
However,

797
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,730
there are countless athletes
who strive for that reward.

798
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,483
Woo-sik is one of them.

799
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,905
One day, he asked me a question.

800
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,240
"Why do you run?"

801
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,913
To him, I was an inspiration.
But I couldn't give him an answer.

802
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,543
"Could there be a reason?
I'm just running."

803
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,922
It could be because it's your job.
You need to make a living.

804
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,009
I've never worried about making money,
so I don't think that's it.

805
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,680
So this is how they felt.
You do sound quite obnoxious.

806
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,310
I couldn't answer that question,

807
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,189
but I think I wanted to tell him this.

808
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,399
"I was punished,

809
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,402
so those who assaulted you
will get punished as well."

810
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,988
You know, that's a given.

811
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,827
But I couldn't do it.

812
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,790
Gosh.

813
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,377
The race only lasts ten seconds.

814
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:08,216
I wonder if striving that hard
for those ten seconds is worthwhile.

815
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,260
You see,

816
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,388
I'd run like nothing happened

817
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,724
even if I had a rough day.

818
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,061
I just forget about the past

819
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,064
and start the day afresh.

820
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,024
That was how I lived my entire life.

821
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,445
But this time around,

822
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,490
I don't think I should do that.
I don't want to.

823
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,409
Don't do it if you don't want to.

824
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:41,499
You don't always have
to overcome everything.

825
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,251
You can rest on the weekends.

826
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,713
So if you don't want to do something,
just don't.

827
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,299
I mean it.

828
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,639
But then again, I can't speak for myself

829
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,850
since I came here
even though I didn't want to.

830
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,019
I'm actually a loser.

831
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,604
You didn't want to do this.

832
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,897
Not because of you.

833
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,317
I was happy to see you.

834
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,527
I still am.

835
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,331
This is for tomorrow.

836
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,336
We're finally shaking hands.

837
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,795
You're right.

838
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,884
I hope we get along.

839
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,136
Likewise.

840
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,735
You didn't get a convertible?
It's Jeju Island.

841
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,570
It's quite windy here.

842
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,822
Were you worried that I'd get hurt?

843
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,907
Yes.

844
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,827
Those sunglasses really make you look

845
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,080
like a gangster.

846
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,366
Why are you here?

847
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,076
I thought you were rehabilitating.

848
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,537
I just came to watch.

849
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,789
The coach was considerate.

850
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,041
He invited me for some fresh air.

851
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,711
Considerate?

852
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,882
He brought me along with him
when I couldn't even run.

853
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,759
I'm grateful for that.

854
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,179
By the way,

855
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,473
about the disciplinary committee…

856
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,978
Seeing how everyone's here,

857
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,689
no one was punished, were they?

858
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,696
I'm still happy.

859
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:21,034
Right. I am sad that I can't run with you,

860
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,494
but when will we ever visit
Jeju Island again?

861
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,913
I'm relieved that you're okay.

862
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,586
I don't regret anything.

863
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,880
I don't resent anyone either.

864
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,094
Those two didn't get punished.

865
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,681
That means
they didn't do anything wrong officially.

866
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,101
Then

867
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,355
I should forgive them…

868
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,025
since they're innocent.

869
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,946
Can you forgive them?

870
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,575
No?

871
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,288
Then don't.

872
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,666
You have the right to do that.

873
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,644
Thank you. Look at the cameras.

874
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,104
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

875
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,069
Executive Director Seo,
thank you for all your hard work.

876
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,572
It's all because Director Seo
didn't do his job. Thanks.

877
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,282
Did you have to put it that way?

878
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,034
You know how to make me feel shitty.

879
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,706
Since you're all here,
shall we get some fresh air?

880
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,459
The national track and field will begin
their off-season training today.

881
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:57,255
Wouldn't it be a beautiful sight
if we cheered for them?

882
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,471
You're the only one who makes me wait.

883
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,306
Is that a hobby of yours?

884
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,148
Is that not funny? It is for me.

885
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,280
Eun-bi's solo shoot will begin soon.

886
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,907
Join her after your training.

887
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,785
The foreign press will be there,
so make sure you smile.

888
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,204
Since when were they so interested in us?

889
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,707
Don't you know? It's because of you.

890
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,294
You did well in Doha,
and you're the face of track and field.

891
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,254
-You're handsome--
-Most importantly,

892
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,589
you want to dress me up.

893
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,799
That's only because of your fame.

894
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,676
It pays off well.

895
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,513
I heard you stopped by. What for?

896
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,807
I felt bad about getting upset with you.

897
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,896
Was that junior you mentioned Kim Woo-sik?

898
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,398
His leg looked badly injured.

899
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,861
Are you still angry?

900
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,072
I'm no longer upset with you. No, wait.

901
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,950
I was never upset with you.

902
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,787
Should I be happy to hear that?

903
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,122
But I'm still going to be upset with them.

904
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,708
I'm going to stay upset.

905
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,919
And I'll continue being mad.

906
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,434
Gosh, it's been ages.

907
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,021
I'll take a photo now.

908
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,235
Go!

909
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,612
Good work.

910
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,201
Sir, here.

911
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,122
I thought
there would just be more reporters.

912
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,295
Are we some monkeys in a zoo or what?

913
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,346
-He broke his previous record.
-Really? What's your record?

914
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,932
Right now, it's about 10.25 seconds.

915
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,393
-That's nice.
-He used to be faster, though.

916
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,854
All right, then. Goodbye.

917
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:19,856
No, right?

918
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,902
-What do you mean?
-Did you bribe them?

919
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,071
Tell me you didn't.

920
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,575
Don't act so naive.

921
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,451
It was nothing.

922
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,497
Don't cause a mess.

923
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,086
There are many people watching today.

924
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,507
-Answer me.
-That's why

925
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,635
you shouldn't have allowed me
to come here.

926
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,263
I gave you a chance.

927
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,338
What's on his mind?

928
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,882
Yesterday

929
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,592
and today.

930
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,912
He seems to be all alone on the tracks.

931
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,831
But then, he seems to have it all.

932
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,419
Even when he's not running, he seems
to be doing so with all his might.

933
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,474
All right, get in position.

934
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:20,411
In track and field, one must begin.

935
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,954
Get ready.

936
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,751
At the start line…

937
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,127
Set!

938
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,505
an athlete can make a decision

939
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,050
whether to run until the finish line

940
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,469
or not run at all.

941
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:17,802
I chose…

942
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,349
not to run.

943
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:38,447
However, I still couldn't answer
why I ran in the first place.

944
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,591
Mr. Ki, are you feeling unwell?

945
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,718
Is this about the scandal?

946
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,514
Is the rumor true?

947
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,391
Why didn't you run?

948
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,434
Because I couldn't.

949
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,234
I assaulted

950
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,154
my juniors.

951
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,714
You seem too fine,
and it's starting to scare me.

952
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:22,051
I'm scared you might jump in,
so please take a few steps back.

953
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,844
I know this place.
It's the road to the afterlife.

954
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,554
-Hey.
-Miss!

955
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,224
Do you really think I hired you
just as an interpreter?

956
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,226
I heard you received money
from Assemblyman Ki.

957
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,436
You really are the gofer's gofer.

958
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,480
Was it Ki Seon-gyeom who assaulted you?

959
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,315
You seem to want to know a lot about me.

960
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,275
As if.

961
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,361
Paint me a picture.

962
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,821
What if I refuse?

963
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,865
-Ms. Oh.
-Are you giving me orders

964
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,951
to make things up as I go?

965
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,495
I never said to take
your interpreter with you.

966
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,121
-You don't need to say anything about me.
-What do you mean?

967
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,040
Your story is what matters the most to me.

968
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:56,210
Everything you've said so far
seems to be hinting at that.

969
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,212
I like you.

970
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:05,844
