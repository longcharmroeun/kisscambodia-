DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,897
I'm not insane. I'm Ki Seon-gyeom.

4
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,904
I don't care who you are,
but I'm glad you still have it with you.

5
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,781
I'm glad you're glad.

6
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,824
Are you guys smoking buddies?

7
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,909
Are you smoking now?

8
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,661
-Would you be mad?
-No. Just avoid the newspaper.

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,705
For example, the police station.

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,373
How did that end?

11
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,379
I guess you could say
that justice was served.

12
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,802
Are you going to stand there
while we talk about such heinous topics?

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,763
No, I'll disappear now. You two can talk.

14
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,014
I had a fun time.

15
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,934
You call yourself a gofer,
which means you know your place.

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,312
Mr. Jeong will email Seon-gyeom's
schedule and information to you.

17
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,022
Okay.

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,916
Gosh, she's a psychopath.
She's not normal.

19
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,421

CHOI TAE-RI AND KI SEON-GYEOM DATING

21
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,849
What's your deal with that gofer?

22
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,392
You guys seemed to have a story.

23
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,061
Don't hold your breath.
I'm just asking as an agent.

24
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,691
In that case, I'll have to say
that this is private.

25
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,989
And if I'm asking as the woman
you once liked?

26
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,703
Why would you ask me this now?
You should have asked back then.

27
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,790
Is that so? Then I should
ask about this now, right?

CHOI TAE-RI AND KI SEON-GYEOM DATING

29
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,174
Front page? A love scandal?

30
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm so proud of you.

31
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,304
I bought a newspaper for the first time.

32
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,014
-Who is this?
-It's you.

33
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,433
-They say it's lovey-dovey.
-Not me.

34
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,393
"Choi Tae-ri"?

35
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,193
She's the famous actress
with whom you did a photo shoot.

36
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,029
Why can't you recognize her?

37
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,822
She's even met your mom.

38
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,410
I heard she debuted in a movie
that starred your mom.

39
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,079
She was her future mother-in-law.
It was fate.

40
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,165
You even walked down
the red carpet together.

41
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,959
Everyone's having a field day with it.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,628
People are so sharp-eyed.

43
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,130
How did they recognize us?

44
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,133
Thanks to them,
guess what the most-searched phrase was.

45
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,719
"Choi Tae-ri's boyfriend".
Share your thoughts on that.

46
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,347
What's there to share?

47
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,682
I didn't win a medal.

48
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,518
You should be sad that they didn't get
a better photo.

49
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,189
Let me make this clear.
We're not lovey-dovey.

50
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,446
Aren't you Ki Seon-gyeom?

51
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,823
-Do you work out here?
-Who are you?

52
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,454
Are you asking me who I am?

53
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,373
Yes.

54
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,002
We met a few days ago. Don't you remember?

55
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,589
Is it because I changed my makeup style?

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,301
I'm sorry, but I don't remember you.

57
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,639
But then again, I had full makeup on
during that photo shoot.

58
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,850
But still, you're so mean.

59
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,189
It's anything but lovey-dovey.

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,024
In fact, she gave me a bruise.

61
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,361
Please give an official announcement

62
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,655
that we're not dating.

63
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,907
We can do that after launching
our photo shoot.

64
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,285
I invested a lot of money
into this photo shoot.

65
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,413
It'll attract more reporters,
and you'll be publicized. Awesome.

66
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,832
This is the official announcement.
Let me see.

67
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,378
Your skin is looking nice.
You don't need anything.

68
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,880
Just get a massage before the photo shoot.

69
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,592
If you're done checking my face,
I should get going.

70
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,885
I have training to do.

71
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,602
It's adorable how aloof he is.

72
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,316
Wait.

73
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,360
When was the fourth time?

74
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,903
I don't recall.

75
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,031
You won't remember even if I tell you.

76
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,533
Whatever. Give me my lighter.

77
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,160
It's precious to me.

78
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,662
So did you go?

79
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,706
-Go where?
-That night.

80
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,333
No, I don't want to go.

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,918
No, I'm not going to go. What's with you?

82
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,131
It didn't seem like dating violence,
so I was relieved.

83
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,925
-What?
-The lighter is at the training center.

84
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,762
It's a two-hour drive from here.

85
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,306
We're speaking the same language,
so why am I lost?

86
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,350
-Did you live abroad or something?
-No.

87
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,353
If it takes that long,

88
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,773
you can return it
when we meet again for work.

89
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,652
You said you were unemployed,
but you're an interpreter.

90
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,321
That's not my main job, though.

91
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,699
I'm not even getting paid for this gig.
It's like charity.

92
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,744
You must enjoy interpreting
if you're doing it for charity.

93
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,246
You do charity to own up to something.

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,419
I didn't want you to feel embarrassed.

95
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,963
I see.

96
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,549
What was that?

97
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,387
-That's me.
-Have you not seen that before?

98
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,099
No. I don't monitor myself.

99
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,193
Actually, I wanted to treat you
to an overdue meal

100
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,153
and ask you for a favor.

101
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,364
What is it?

102
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,784
Can you not tell anyone that you went

103
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,161
to the station because of me?

104
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,621
If that crazy bitch…

105
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,791
If your president finds out,
I might have to kneel.

106
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,335
She probably doesn't care about that
right now

107
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,795
because of the love scandal.

108
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,507
Also, you were the victim in the incident,

109
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,217
so you shouldn't have to kneel.

110
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,470
About that scandal…

111
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,139
I'm not dating that actress.

112
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,141
Are you getting to know each other?

113
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,768
Am I that charming?

114
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,603
Why would she want to get to know me
when we only met once.

115
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,815
I looked into it,
and Tae-ri vehemently denied it.

116
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,609
I could see how enraged she was
just by reading it.

117
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,778
So many articles were mocking you.

118
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531
They call you Tae-ri's boyfriend
forgetting that you're a national athlete.

119
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,824
I just don't get it.

120
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,789
-What's wrong?
-Are you trying to get on my good side?

121
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,293
Yes. Will you keep it a secret?

122
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,839
Did I offend you?

123
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,759
It feels strange that you're defending me.

124
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,554
I'm used to this, so I'm fine.

125
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,559
I'm used to being linked
with other people's names.

126
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,062
To Tae-ri, I'm his boyfriend.
To you, I'm a lunatic.

127
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,357
I should get going.

128
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,195
I'll keep it a secret.

129
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,115
I'm not hungry right now,
and I should go before the rush hour.

130
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,619
Why are you in a hurry?
Can't you just stay for a meal?

131
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,705
It seems like you want to get rid of me
after the meal.

132
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,376
Then text me a few dates
when you're available.

133
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,128
I'll take a look and reply back.

134
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,631
-You're asking for my number?
-Yes.

135
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,966
Okay. I'll text you.

136
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,723
Okay.

137
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,768
What was that?

138
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,483
BACK SURGERY
20,000,000 WON!

139
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,784
YOU'RE REALLY NOT

140
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,455
YOU'RE REALLY STUBBORN

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,425
YOU REALLY ARE STUBBORN

142
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,344
You're really not going to give up,
are you?

143
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,396
This is Jeong Ji-hyun.

144
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,481
Here's Ki Seon-gyeom's schedule.

145
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,359
He's going to Jeju Island.

146
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,528
Jeju Island is nice.

147
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,698
I should finish this up.

148
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,875
Focus on work. You should finish it.

149
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,808
Why is he wearing earphones?

150
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,021
He doesn't want to talk, does he?

151
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,107
It's not like him to be on his phone.

152
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,569
He's bragging about dating, isn't he?

153
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,948
Choi Tae-ri denied it already.

154
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,200
That's what celebrities say all the time.

155
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,121
Ask him if they're really dating.

156
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,457
-I don't want to speak with him.
-Okay.

157
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,794
Gosh, Choi Tae-ri.

158
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,467
ON THE 11TH, ITAEWON STATION AT 1 P.M.

159
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,012
Su-gyeong, hi.

160
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,097
-Did she stay up?
-She had a meeting.

161
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,599
Gosh, good luck.

162
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,525
Hey.

163
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,321
What is this?

164
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,200
I saw you finished the Romanian movie.

165
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,286
It was uploaded.
I said you could take it slow.

166
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,163
The interpretation schedule came out.

167
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,999
I had to finish the movie
before preparing for it.

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,751
This is my first time doing sports.

169
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,879
-What's this? What are you looking at?
-The goods from the film market.

170
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,676
I found a pretty nice musical film.

171
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,594
They're going to suffer big time.

172
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,308
Don't you think you should give it a try
since you've already suffered once?

173
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,603
You've done a musical before.
Care to read the transcript?

174
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,106
You'll be crying a river.

175
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,151
Isn't this the client who wanted us
to sync the subs with the lip movements?

176
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,404
"Are these lyrics or sentences?

177
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,781
Am I translating or writing a poem?

178
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,617
Is it day or night?"
I was crying a river too.

179
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,994
-I'll pay you handsomely.
-Ten million?

180
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,621
Get lost.

181
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,999
Hold on.

182
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,919
Who is this?

183
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,883
On the 11th, Itaewon Station at 1 p.m.

184
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,136
On the 13th, City Hall Station at 1 p.m.

185
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,596
On the 19th, Gwanghwamun Station at 1 p.m.

186
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,890
If these don't work, I'll text you again.

187
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,767
This is so detailed.

188
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,604
What is it? Is something going on
between you and your handsome fate?

189
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,648
We're too different
for something to go on.

190
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,985
-As long as you're not pregnant.
-That should never happen.

191
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,487
We may never meet again after this gig.

192
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,574
I choose the second option.
Let's make it 4 p.m.

193
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,409
Let's rehearse as well.

194
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,705
Seon-gyeom.

195
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,748
The training will begin.

196
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,670
-What are you doing?
-Texting.

197
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,299
Are you really dating…

198
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,635
What?

199
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,512
It's nothing.

200
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,852
Okay.

201
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,648
You're going to pay for dating men
based on their looks.

202
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,944
-Didn't Seok-won teach you a lesson?
-Why would you bring him up?

203
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,489
-It wasn't because of his looks.
-What's worse

204
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,866
is that he received
the best picture award.

205
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,242
What?

206
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,996
What? It can't be.

207
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,125
BEST PICTURE AWARD
HAN SEOK-WON

208
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,212
He actually got it.
It has finally happened.

209
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,339
This world has gone insane.

210
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,258
He'll be invited
to an international film festival.

211
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,676
It suits the Cannes, right?

212
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,262
The projects I translated were nominated

213
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,889
but never awarded.

214
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,641
Could this be…

215
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,228
He better not accept it.
Does he think he's a big shot?

216
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,396
Is he Bong Joon-ho? My ass.

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,191
Who are you talking to?
I'm terrified right now.

218
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,321
Ki Seon-gyeom?
Why is he in a photo with Yook Ji-woo?

219
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,116
Do you know him?
The national track and field athlete?

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,868
Be more specific.

221
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,328
The scandal with Choi Tae-ri--

222
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,038
Right, her boyfriend.

223
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,666
-That's his name?
-Yes.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,086
-What about him?
-Is he very famous?

225
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,339
He sure is.
His entire family is well known.

226
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,716
How could you not know this
as Yook Ji-woo's fan?

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,593
He's Yook Ji-woo and Ki Jeong-do's son,

228
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,136
and Ki Eun-bi's younger brother.

229
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,638
-Go!
-We only remember athletes

230
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,847
who come in first.

231
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,974
-That's it!
-But he's famous

232
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,183
despite being second place.

233
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,520
Go!

234
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,273
That's it!

235
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,236
Hey. Get ready.

236
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,905
-Get up, Gyu-deok. Get up.
-I'm dying.

237
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,950
Hurry up and move. Get in position.

238
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,835
That's good!

239
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,260
Seon-gyeom, you're doing well these days.
I love your vigor.

240
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,974
I wonder why.

241
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,976
Is this the power of love?

242
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,607
I want to beat you at least once
before I retire.

243
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,528
You want to beat me? You?

244
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,447
Every time.

245
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,990
Are you dying or what?

246
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,785
Have you become more motivated
now that you'll retire soon?

247
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,079
I've always been motivated.

248
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,915
You didn't look all that motivated.

249
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,835
I thought you've been a runner-up
because you wanted to.

250
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
I want to come in first place too.

251
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,759
I just don't say it out loud.

252
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,767
Why didn't I know?

253
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,436
You? Because you only watched her movies.

254
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,063
You're right.

255
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,815
I'm used to this, so I'm fine.

256
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm used to being linked

257
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,445
with other people's names.

258
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,157
I didn't know he had such a story.

259
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,661
I feel even more distant,
not that we were ever close.

260
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,663
-What do you mean?
-I mean…

261
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,833
I've barely managed to become a translator

262
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,045
by building a career
through my work and studies.

263
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,755
Since I represent myself,

264
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,299
I'm striving to support just me.

265
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,093
But then, he has his own struggles too.

266
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,096
So? Are you jealous?

267
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,181
That he has a family?

268
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,648
His life is filled with everyone
around him but himself.

269
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,151
Whereas, I only have me.

270
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,160
NAME

271
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,749
KI SEON-GYEOM

272
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,770
Yes, Coach.

273
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,691
Right now?

274
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,902
Okay.

275
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,455
Drop this, and I'll kill you.

276
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,963
I told you to buy me cigarettes.

277
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,509
The convenience store nearby
didn't have your brand.

278
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,181
Then you should've gone
to another convenience store.

279
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,602
I couldn't smoke thanks to you,
you bastard.

280
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,065
Also, Seon-gyeom beat me during training.

281
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,317
Am I a joke to you?

282
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,486
Damn it.

283
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,115
Hey, are you okay?

284
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,243
-You son of a bitch.
-I'm sorry.

285
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,497
How dare you touch me?

286
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,707
Do you want to end up behind bars?

287
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,960
Do you have money? Connections?

288
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,296
Or parents like everyone else?

289
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,091
All you have are these two legs.
What an impudent asshole.

290
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,177
Do you think Seon-gyeom has your back?

291
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,471
Do you think you're like him
since you're close?

292
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,851
I thought I was him all this time.

293
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,275
What the hell are you saying?
Have you gone insane?

294
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,778
-Hey, that's enough.
-Let go of me.

295
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,909
-Hey, explain it to me.
-You beat me for no reason back in school.

296
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,120
But now you beat me
whenever he breaks his record,

297
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,705
looks down on you,
or takes care of his juniors.

298
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,917
That's why

299
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,045
I thought I was a stand-in
for Ki Seon-gyeom.

300
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,467
Since I can't touch him, I instead…

301
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,846
Is that it?

302
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,723
Why would I be scared of him?

303
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,977
But you are

304
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,272
since he has everything.

305
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,526
Hey, you better shut up.

306
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,822
You're going to die tonight.

307
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,912
Damn it.

308
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,999
Run your mouth off again.

309
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,500
You bastard.

310
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,901
Woo-sik.

311
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,281
Woo-sik, open your eyes.

312
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,158
Let me see you. Are you okay?

313
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,660
-Are you?
-Seon-gyeom.

314
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,578
Yes?

315
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,455
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,961
Hey. Get up.

317
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,990
You shouldn't move.
The doctor said you should stay still.

318
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,034
Are you okay?

319
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,623
Why am I here?

320
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,751
-I should tell the Coach--
-I'll tell him myself.

321
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,170
I'll do it.

322
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,050
-I'll tell him everything later.
-When?

323
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,761
When your tendons have ruptured?

324
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,597
You need to receive surgery
for your thigh.

325
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,599
-A surgery?
-Woo-sik.

326
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,227
Let me ask you one more time.

327
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,896
Are you really okay?

328
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,310
Don't worry about the bills.

329
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,104
Get all the treatment you need.
You need to recover first.

330
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,275
Ask them to do everything they can.

331
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,986
Bye.

332
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,407
Don't do it.

333
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,286
-Don't do it, Seon-gyeom.
-Don't do what?

334
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't know. I'm just…

335
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,006
-I'm just scared.
-Of what?

336
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,217
I hit Gyu-deok.

337
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,554
It was an accident.

338
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,765
He may kill me.

339
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,975
Then

340
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,978
let's tell them I hit him.

341
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,731
What do you mean?

342
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,775
You're a rising star.

343
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
You should win the prize money
and the medal.

344
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,323
Don't worry about anything.
He should be the one who's worried.

345
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,534
Bye.

346
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,875
That useless bastard…

347
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,377
Can you be more gentle?

348
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,297
Are you okay?

349
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,051
Damn it.

350
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,517
-Have you gone insane?
-That hurts!

351
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,687
-What's this about?
-Woo-sik.

352
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,690
You're here pretending to be
national athletes

353
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,443
when you should be in prison.

354
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,862
Do you want to go to prison?

355
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,532
Damn it.

356
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,703
Watch what you say.
I'm having a shitty day as is.

357
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,789
From the look of things,
he was beaten more than once.

358
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,957
He deserved it.

359
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,501
Ever since we were students,
he never knew his place.

360
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,670
I was just disciplining him.

361
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,297
Can't you see what he's done to me?

362
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,758
You're not showing any remorse.

363
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,264
He also got beaten up because of you.

364
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,392
You took part in it.

365
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,565
Are you sure that I took part in it?

366
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,944
I'm asking you. Are you sure?

367
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,698
You spoiled him
by embracing every mistake he's made.

368
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,450
Get lost while I'm being nice.

369
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,412
Quit playing nice
and telling me to apologize.

370
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,542
Apologize?

371
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,551
I'm not here…

372
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,680
to play nice.

373
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,891
Damn it.

374
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,811
You bastard, are you crazy? Are you?

375
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,945
Come here.

376
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,407
-What's going on?
-What is it?

377
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,992
Hey, open the door!

378
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,952
-What is this?
-What's going on?

379
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,370
Who the hell is fighting?

380
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,788
They're not our team, right?

381
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,249
Could they be sprinters?
I saw Seon-gyeom entering.

382
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,417
-Ki Seon-gyeom?
-Yes.

383
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,919
-Darn it.
-Is he hurt?

384
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,670
-Hey.
-Open the door!

385
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,963
Hey!

386
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,514
How are you still bad at making coffee?

387
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,642
-Is it not tasty?
-It's terrible.

388
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,269
Well, that took a long time…

389
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,980
-What's with your face?
-I assaulted someone, Coach.

390
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,316
You assaulted someone? Where? Outside?

391
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,651
When? Who? A civilian?

392
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,570
I assaulted the national athletes
Gyu-deok and Gi-beom just now.

393
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,863
-What?
-Who?

394
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,532
Word will spread quickly
as many people were watching.

395
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,909
Let's be clear here.

396
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,535
Did you say you assaulted them,
not disciplined them?

397
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,455
I don't think it's discipline
if I hit them

398
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,374
because I wasn't happy with them.

399
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,502
So you assaulted them.

400
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,254
Why are you telling me right away?

401
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,964
There's something else.

402
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,091
Will you fix the problem if I tell you?

403
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,930
Don't make a big deal out of this, okay?

404
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,224
-It happens all the time.
-Were you aware of it?

405
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,560
Then we'll summon
the disciplinary committee.

406
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,646
The disciplinary committee?

407
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,441
Why would a smart kid like you
do such a dumb thing?

408
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,153
Don't you know that he brought
those kids here himself?

409
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,280
So what?

410
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,367
I'm sure you had your reasons
for disciplining them.

411
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,244
-I wasn't disciplining them.
-I know.

412
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,996
So you guys fought.

413
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,247
It was an assault.

414
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,957
It was a power trip on both ends.

415
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,250
Hey.

416
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,086
Choose your words carefully.

417
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,963
People will get the wrong idea.

418
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,464
I wouldn't want them to.

419
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,467
Aren't you going to become a coach
once you retire?

420
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,844
Aren't you?

421
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,388
This will forever remain on your record!

422
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,348
The international contest is next year.

423
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,935
What kind of bastard destroys
his own future with such a trivial issue?

424
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,562
This isn't trivial.

425
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,149
Hey, go back to Seoul
until we decide what to do with you.

426
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,735
Get lost. I don't want to see your face.

427
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
Seon-gyeom.

428
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,740
Apologize to him. Will you end your… Hey!

429
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,576
If this is the flexibility
you expect from my future,

430
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,412
I don't think I have a future
to begin with.

431
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,832
I wanted to be a leader with principles.

432
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,828
Why do you run?

433
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,039
How can you ask me that
with a straight face?

434
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,709
Are you not going to answer?

435
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,586
Then what about you?

436
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,090
Well… It's because of my grandmother.

437
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,926
But you were the reason I started running.

438
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,096
Now, it's your turn.

439
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,600
Why do you run?

440
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,359
You know your house is right there, right?

441
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,489
I'd be a terrible son
for coming home drunk at this hour.

442
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,866
Who did you drink with?

443
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,784
You wouldn't know.

444
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,787
Why did you skip church?
Your mom was worried.

445
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,706
I've quit being Christian
for three years now.

446
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,249
Quit? It's not like smoking.

447
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,876
-Are you going to sleep?
-Yes.

448
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,632
-I smell oil.
-I use cheap paint.

449
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,427
It's going to get worse.
Plug up your nose.

450
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,927
I'm off to deliver my work.
Have some honey water when you wake up.

451
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,984
DON'T TOUCH, JUST LOOK

452
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,872
Shouldn't you be at work at this hour?

453
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,833
-Bosses shouldn't slack off.
-Can't we hang up?

454
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,044
Is this plant on display for me?
You should clean it up.

455
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,046
You should clean yourself up as well.

456
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,173
Why not sleep or do something else?

457
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,926
Can you just not exist?

458
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,512
Take out the trash while you're there.

459
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,973
Hello? Dan-ah?

460
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,349
Hello?

461
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,269
Damn, she hung up on me.

462
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,857
Why should I clean this up?

463
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,536
Damn, that stings.

464
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,085
Thinking like a true elite.

465
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,090
So when does the resort open?
I'd like to be present.

466
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,346
To do what?

467
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,556
It's not like that.

468
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,141
I just want to be there.

469
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,560
Ki Seon-gyeom will be too.

470
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,814
He'll only be there for the photo shoot
and his off-season training.

471
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,026
The dates just happened to overlap.

472
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,947
On the exact day of
Seomyung Resort's opening ceremony?

473
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,698
That's why I'm not wanted.

474
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,700
The chairman and
the director will be there,

475
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,993
so it'd be uncomfortable.

476
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,037
Director Seo does hate me, right?

477
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,247
Well, President Seo hates you too.

478
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,833
Do you hate me as well?

479
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,257
Forget it. There's no need to answer that.

480
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,635
I'm sure there's a reason

481
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,679
why only my brother and sister are going.

482
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,931
Being born a bastard sucks.

483
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,481
You weren't invited because
you have nothing to do with the event.

484
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,691
Here.

485
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,402
Since it's been sterilized,

486
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,781
-I'll put this on.
-How considerate of you.

487
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,742
It's quite odd considering how you look.

488
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,332
A gangster.

489
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,044
You can keep that.

490
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,296
It completes your look.

491
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,340
Get me some hallabong, okay?

492
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,521
-Hi.
-Welcome.

493
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,232
-One Americano to go, please.
-Sure.

494
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,318
Here.

495
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,918
Ms. Gofer. I mean, Ms. Oh.

496
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,888
Ms. Oh, are you sleeping?

497
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,856
My gosh. Goodness, hello.

498
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,650
When did I fall asleep?

499
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,071
Do you live around here?
Your clothes say that you do.

500
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,280
Right.

501
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,699
Judging by your clothes,
you must live elsewhere.

502
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,619
I don't. Neither does Seon-gyeom.

503
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,332
Which has me wondering.
How did you get to know him?

504
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,918
Goodness. Doesn't everyone know who he is?

505
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,045
You didn't know his name or occupation.

506
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,636
Did you meet him at the police station?

507
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,725
Miss, your coffee is ready.

508
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,227
Your coffee is ready.

509
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,437
I'll be heading to the restroom.

510
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,733
I'll see you in Jeju then.

511
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,193
Make sure you're prepared.

512
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,991
Here you go.

513
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,326
Please enjoy.

514
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,676
This painting…

515
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,472
It's ridiculously crude.

516
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,730
The angle…

517
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,775
doesn't do the painting justice.

518
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,759
Miss, are you okay?

519
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,803
My goodness!

520
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,514
The painting must've still been wet.
Oh, dear.

521
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,310
I'm fine, but the painting isn't.
It seems like a collectible.

522
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,520
Please don't worry about it.

523
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,106
I got it cheap
from a friend who paints for fun.

524
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,359
Meanwhile, your jacket seems expensive.
Oh, dear.

525
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,819
How about this?

526
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,822
Sell this to me
for double the original price.

527
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,283
What?

528
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,561
BASTARD 2

529
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,817
I cut my finger
cleaning after a broken flowerpot.

530
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,695
Can my fans wish me a full recovery?

531
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,406
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

532
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,495
See? My fans are saying I'm kind.

533
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,330
They want to be my flowerpot.

534
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,050
-Ms. Noh, it's me.
-Hey.

535
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,134
Hi.

536
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,888
Let me see.

537
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,980
Ms. Noh, did you take down my painting?

538
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,858
-You must not have liked it.
-Oh, you see…

539
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,069
I gave it to someone else.

540
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,822
A customer of mine took a liking to it.

541
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,532
Really? Who?

542
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,036
Really? Who is it exactly?

543
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,332
I'm sorry, but your painting--

544
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,460
That drawing tube…

545
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,713
We've met before, right?

546
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,506
Did you throw that?

547
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,425
No, of course not.

548
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,426
It's mine, but…

549
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,179
You're the one with the gun, right?

550
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,973
-That's right.
-I see.

551
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,268
I guess you must have settled
seeing how you're here.

552
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,270
It feels like I've made it out of prison.

553
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,147
Yes, it's all been settled.

554
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,607
I see you're acquainted.

555
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,527
He drew all the paintings here.

556
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,654
Really? Are you a painter?

557
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,281
Actually, no. I'm still a student.

558
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,284
Whether I'll become one
is still uncertain.

559
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,452
I'm Lee Yeong-hwa.

560
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,496
These are the kinds of paintings I draw.

561
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,750
Good morning.

562
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,377
It's good to see you, Ms. Seo. Inside--

563
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,462
Mr. Jeong.

564
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,841
Why do you keep letting my brother in?
What's wrong with you?

565
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,928
You see, Ms. Seo,

566
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,182
I don't have the authority
to keep the chairman's son out.

567
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,475
I work for Seomyung Group.

568
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,811
How are you their employee
when I haven't taken over yet?

569
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,979
You work for me.

570
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,858
Even if I do take over the group,
you'll still work for me.

571
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,944
Get your priorities straight, Mr. Jeong.

572
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,121
Is it a plant this time?
He just lets anything in.

573
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,377
What's wrong with your face?

574
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,090
I hit someone yesterday.

575
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,592
You had that in you?

576
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,096
As per protocol, I'll be disciplined.
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,105
You're not the type
to act without a reason,

578
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,606
so I guess he had it coming.

579
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,234
You can't justify violence.

580
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,277
And yet you still struck him.

581
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,323
Tell me who, how and why.

582
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,909
-They were my junior athletes.
-Right.

583
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,202
And I did it to get revenge.

584
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,872
Revenge?

585
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,422
I thought revenge
only motivated characters in soap operas.

586
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,506
How corny.

587
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,300
Don't tell me you think this is funny.

588
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,011
Wait. Can't I find it funny?

589
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,263
Of course not.

590
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,350
This is about athletes using
violence to discipline their juniors.

591
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,228
The young athlete they went after

592
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,606
beat his senior athletes and won
first place in his tournament debut.

593
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,983
They beat him to the point

594
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,571
where he almost needed a tendon implant,
and you find that funny?

595
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,123
So you could have told them off,
but you hit them instead.

596
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,584
I figured I'd feel a lot better

597
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,837
to give them a taste of their own medicine
and be punished for it.

598
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,132
Incidents like this

599
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,177
make me wonder if you're my brother
instead of Tae-woong.

600
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,888
I, for one, agree with your methods.

601
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,348
Being reprimanded

602
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,101
will have companies
drop all their campaigns and sponsorships.

603
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,646
No company wants to be seen
as an advocate for violence.

604
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,565
I'll make sure
this doesn't hurt your business.

605
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,360
You'll be reimbursed
for any cancellation fees regarding

606
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,071
the campaign deals and sponsorships.

607
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,574
We can sue the association
if they reprimand you.

608
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,409
Seomyung will provide legal aid.

609
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,911
Why are you bringing up a lawsuit?

610
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,371
On what grounds?

611
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,208
That the reprimand is unfair and cruel.

612
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,419
We'll get people to pity you,
despite having committed an assault.

613
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,754
But I don't find it unfair.

614
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,632
Yes, you do. Wasn't it out of justice?

615
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,926
We can turn this around
and make you a hero.

616
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,055
-Are you serious?
-Would I be joking?

617
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,681
Yes, you should be.

618
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,018
How can I be a hero
for assaulting someone?

619
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,235
You said you wouldn't
let this hurt my business.

620
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,118
Mr. Jeong, Seon-gyeom injured his face.
Book a dermatologist.

621
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,163
The photo shoot will happen as planned.

622
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,667
I'm only a package deal
that comes with Eun-bi.

623
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,002
Just find someone better you can manage.

624
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,421
Look at the package deal talk.

625
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,091
Eun-bi won't wear my clothes
if it wasn't for you.

626
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,594
If I only needed someone to run,
I would've signed Kwon Yeong-il.

627
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:41,183
I almost forgot that this company
was founded for you to play dress-up.

628
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,227
And to expand your fashion business.

629
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,896
To put it correctly,
it's to have my athlete of choice

630
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,190
wear the sportswear I designed.

631
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,734
I couldn't care less about
what happens to you.

632
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,029
-I'm only here for my agent.
-I wasn't finished.

633
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,698
But I was.

634
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,635
Goodness.

635
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,013
Look who it is.

636
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,350
Waiting actually paid off.

637
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:24,852
Right?

638
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,701
I can't introduce myself

639
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,537
unless you ask me who I am.
Don't just stand there and blink.

640
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,166
-I'm not interested.
-I'm not selling anything!

641
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,794
That I didn't mean.

642
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,213
Anyway, let me introduce myself.

643
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,384
I'm Yoo Jae-gyu,
the head of Choi Tae-ri's agency.

644
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,428
Why can't I get in touch with your agent?

645
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,598
Seo Dan-ah, that woman,
has been leaving me hanging.

646
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:06,477
She's not "that woman."
She's President Seo Dan-ah.

647
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,356
I don't care if she's a rich girl
running an agency for fun.

648
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,066
When there's a mess--

649
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,110
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
who is as passionate as Ms. Seo

650
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,820
when it comes to work.

651
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,908
Let's stay on topic here--

652
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,451
But there was no topic.

653
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,911
Milk has been spilled,

654
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,498
and you're just here to vent on someone.

655
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,999
So you know.

656
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,919
And I thought all athletes were dumb.

657
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,463
Dumb people are biased like that.

658
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,716
Hey! You little…

659
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,512
I know that you're trying
to use Tae-ri as a stepping stone.

660
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,347
Dreaming big, are we?

661
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,391
We only met once.

662
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,103
I am not dating Ms. Choi.

663
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,981
Who are you to conclude
that there is no relationship?

664
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,650
You're a nobody!

665
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,611
Look here.

666
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,030
You may not know this industry,

667
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,658
but there's evidence
to prove you're in a relationship

668
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,868
while there's none to prove you're not.

669
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,246
So find a new gym
while I'm asking you nicely.

670
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,249
Tae-ri must work out there
to keep up appearances.

671
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,167
As if that would solve anything.

672
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,211
It would only trigger more rumors.

673
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,379
Besides…

674
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,933
What? What is it?

675
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,398
Isn't that your car?

676
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,482
My car?

677
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,195
Hey, hold on. You can't do that!

678
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,156
When it comes to rumors,

679
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,451
I don't believe a word you say.
I'll keep an eye on you!

680
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,162
You little… Hey, wait!

681
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,497
Take photos of me and not my car.

682
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,708
Which district office are you from?

683
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,299
I reported the illegal parking.

684
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,554
Serves him right for parking his car
outside my building.

685
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,764
I wasn't in a forgiving mood today.

686
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,227
-And Seon-gyeom?
-He probably went to train.

687
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,064
He doesn't know how to unwind,
but he stresses himself to help others.

688
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,984
He wouldn't have cared
if he was the one beaten up.

689
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,486
He should learn to take care of himself.

690
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,575
-Mr. Jeong.
-Yes?

691
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,038
I feel like I offered
the perfect solution to our problem,

692
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,416
but Seon-gyeom seemed upset.

693
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,085
What did I do wrong?
I honestly don't get it.

694
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,047
Well…

695
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,636
Maybe you're just different
in the way you act and think.

696
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,680
No two people are the same anyway.

697
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,147
It'd be much easier
if we were all the same.

698
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,983
What a nuisance.

699
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,427
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

700
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,805
I've arrived,
but there's no need to hurry.

701
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,933
Where on earth are you?

702
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,186
Knock, knock, Mr. Ki.
Why aren't you answering?

703
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,981
Are you sick?

704
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,733
Were you in an accident or something?

705
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,736
This is bad.

706
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,368
Is this how you blow me off?

707
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,414
This isn't the way to treat someone
you'll be working with.

708
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,958
Being a national athlete
doesn't make you a king.

709
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,840
I should forgive him since I'm pretty
and kindhearted.

710
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,258
What else can I do?

711
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,024
What the hell?

712
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,485
He sure is fast.

713
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:08,880
Where are you?

714
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,716
You just ran past me.

715
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,217
Head back this way and--

716
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,637
Hello?

717
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,973
Damn him.

718
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,438
What the hell?

719
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,369
-You ran a little slower than earlier.
-What?

720
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,038
Is it because you knew I'd still be here?

721
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,166
If I ran too fast,
I figured I might run past you again.

722
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,003
I texted you the wrong date.

723
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,088
I meant the 18th, not the 13th.

724
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,258
I sensed something was off.

725
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,053
It's okay.
What matters is that you're here.

726
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,765
Are you sure you're okay?

727
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,517
Thanks to you, I was entertained.

728
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,727
You ran so fast
that I couldn't even stop you.

729
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,064
First, let's rehearse.

730
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,983
I won't miss a lot of things
if we rehearse beforehand.

731
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,861
Can we do something else?

732
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,655
Is it because you don't want to work?

733
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,201
Yes. Instead, I'll make up for being late.

734
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,120
You're awfully confident.

735
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,415
Then should we go eat something first?

736
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,959
-Are you hungry?
-No.

737
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,210
Me neither.

738
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,506
Then do you like movies?

739
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,800
-No.
-You don't like movies?

740
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,346
How could you hate movies?

741
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,557
I never said I hate them.

742
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,935
Then would you like to watch my movie?

743
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,436
-Your movie?
-Yes.

744
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,689
Well, sure.

745
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,733
-Just the two of us?
-Yes.

746
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,946
It premiers today, but today might be
my only chance to watch it.

747
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,990
I mean, in theaters.

748
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,700
It's an independent film.

749
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,202
Let's go.

750
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,560
Here are the emergency exits

751
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,271
and safety regulations
in case of an emergency.

752
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,522
For your safety…

753
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,649
Don't you feel safe

754
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,735
when you're sitting in a dark theater?

755
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,320
That's why I like theaters.

756
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,155
It seems more dangerous.

757
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,782
It's dark and scary.

758
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,577
It could be if you were alone.

759
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,955
But don't worry. From this moment on,
we'll all be in the dark.

760
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,599
TRANSLATION: OH MI-JOO

761
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,562
TRANSLATION: OH MI-JOO

762
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,903
How was the movie?

763
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,321
It was boring.

764
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,240
I see.

765
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,117
You weren't even in the movie.

766
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,245
My name came out at the very end.
It said "Translated by Oh Mi-joo."

767
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,330
I see.

768
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,999
Not many people notice though.

769
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,418
No one waits until the end of the credits.

770
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,087
So in order to see you,
people have to wait until the end.

771
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,548
You're right.

772
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,302
I didn't mean
your translations were boring.

773
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,139
I never really enjoyed watching movies.

774
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,017
As you've noticed,
the movie is really difficult.

775
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,728
So I had a hard time translating it.

776
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,605
You need to understand it well
to translate it properly.

777
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:21,317
I know I'm exaggerating,
but I probably watched it about 100 times.

778
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,194
Depending on the emotions

779
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,905
and relations of the characters,
the translation changes.

780
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,240
Isn't that interesting?

781
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,285
Do you drink?

782
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,455
-What if I do?
-Would you like to go for one?

783
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,168
Do you know
what people call this kind of stuff?

784
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,421
-A date.
-No.

785
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,797
A business dinner.

786
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,215
Let's go.

787
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,644
I worked on my first foreign movie
and saw my name on the screen,

788
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:02,025
but because of the font,
it looked like it said Oh Ma-joo.

789
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,527
It was as if my name was "Homage."

790
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,280
But you said not a lot of people wait
until the end anyway.

791
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,116
You make it sound like
I'm an attention-seeker.

792
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,868
An "AS."

793
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,120
For some reason, I'm offended.

794
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,872
I guess you know what that means.

795
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,709
A fellow athlete called me an AS

796
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,378
for taking a photo with my mom
on the red carpet.

797
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,299
Right. Your mother is Yook Ji-woo,
isn't she?

798
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,553
I almost translated the movie
she once starred in.

799
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,598
I don't watch my mom's movies.

800
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,684
And when I was young,
I couldn't because it was R-rated.

801
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,269
I think I know which one it is.

802
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,815
One of her films is R-rated
because it's too gory.

803
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,941
How gory is it?

804
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:46,402
Ji-woo plays a very cold-hearted killer.

805
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,656
She catches the bad guys
and tortures them in all kinds of ways.

806
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,158
Later on, she plucks out their eyeballs,

807
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,619
stabs them, and skins them.

808
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,624
It was the first Korean movie
to skin humans like that.

809
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,793
Why would you watch that?

810
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,087
I just like movies.

811
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,506
Is that why you became a translator?

812
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,551
Well…

813
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,396
The first time I watched a movie
in a movie theater, there was this line

814
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,690
that consoled me a lot.

815
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:28,111
But if there were no subtitles,
I never would've known what that meant.

816
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,532
"I wonder who it is that lays a bridge
between the two different languages.

817
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,910
I'd also love to do that for a living."

818
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,579
That's what came to my mind.

819
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,750
So I just did my best
to become a translator,

820
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,086
and here I am.

821
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,685
It makes me feel really rich.

822
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,939
I have to understand a movie
from start to finish

823
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,025
to share it with the world.

824
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,488
And it makes me feel like
I'm holding on to something bountiful.

825
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,493
It makes me feel like I have a lot

826
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,078
and it makes me feel rich.

827
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,460
Here. I hope you become rich too. Cheers.

828
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,633
Here's your rolled omelet.

829
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,843
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

830
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,261
Enjoy.

831
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,849
That day,

832
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,644
you threw that drawing tube very nicely.

833
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,354
Do you throw things a lot?

834
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,856
Do you have trouble
controlling your anger?

835
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,484
Before I became a sprinter,

836
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,111
I was a javelin thrower.

837
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:56,324
And I rarely end up in a situation
where I have to control my anger.

838
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,785
Well, you got hurt.

839
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,454
I can easily tell it was a fist-fight.

840
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,542
I'm sorry. I just told you

841
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,503
I rarely end up in a situation
where I have to control my anger,

842
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,548
but let's say I don't control my anger.

843
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,344
Seon-gyeom.

844
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,515
-Do people tell you you're weird?
-They tell me I'm annoying.

845
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,685
Why are you laughing?

846
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,438
It's just that
people tend to be intimidated

847
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,483
when someone like you are around.

848
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,196
What kind of person am I?

849
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:37,949
Well…

850
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,993
You're mentally strong.

851
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,079
But not with alcohol.

852
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,164
You haven't been drinking that much.

853
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,251
Why did you want to drink
when you're a lightweight?

854
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,338
The guy in the movie seemed happy
after drinking alcohol.

855
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:56,843
So I figured maybe I might feel the same.

856
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,389
I'm not a big drinker,
but I still wanted to drink.

857
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,975
You're not a big drinker,
but you still wanted to drink?

858
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,395
I don't know how that feels
because I can hold my liquor.

859
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,901
But why did you choose to sprint?
Because you run fast?

860
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,653
I came in last in my first race.

861
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:19,782
All they ever do is run,
so I'm sure it wasn't easy to beat them.

862
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,034
You must have felt down.

863
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,036
My first goal

864
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,080
was to run faster
than the guy right in front of me.

865
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:30,877
I tried my best and finally managed
to come in faster than him.

866
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,796
Then my next goal was to beat
the next guy in front of me.

867
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,842
I kept doing that one by one,
and after a while,

868
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,970
no one was in front of me.

869
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,515
That's how I graduated high school
with the fastest record.

870
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,683
I see.

871
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,020
How does it feel to run for a living?

872
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,193
You're just out of breath.

873
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:01,616
When you run,
you don't think about what's behind you.

874
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,411
The only thing that matters is
what's right in front of you.

875
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,122
Normally, it's the finish line.

876
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,416
But today, it was you.

877
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,712
If I timed myself today,

878
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,465
it might have been
a little over nine seconds.

879
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,634
Nine seconds? Is that good?

880
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,553
Gosh, of course. Totally.

881
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,701
What's wrong with you? My goodness.

882
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,955
-I'm okay.
-You're wasted.

883
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,373
You're an LW, aren't you?

884
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,542
An LW? What's that?

885
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,585
A lousy woman?

886
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,379
It means you're a lightweight.

887
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,964
My gosh.

888
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,383
Where are you going?

889
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,970
Where should I go?

890
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,682
Home, of course.
And tell me you know where you live.

891
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,559
Try to sober up a little.

892
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,686
I don't have a home.

893
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,731
Why are you flirting with me?

894
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,734
How is this even flirting?

895
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,279
I don't see how it isn't.
You keep smiling when you rarely smile.

896
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,618
You have a place to sleep, right?

897
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,288
I'll leave you to go on your own.
I'll do the same.

898
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,876
Keep this up and I might end up
making a mistake.

899
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,086
A mistake?

900
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,680
Something like this.

901
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,074
But…

902
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:16,417
I'm going to control myself
since we'll be meeting again.

903
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,256
I'll be off now.

904
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,095
Excuse me.

905
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,098
What are you doing here?

906
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,308
Oh, I'm sorry.

907
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,478
Gosh, you seem really drunk. Are you okay?

908
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,230
Yes, I'm okay.

909
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,816
He doesn't look okay.

910
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,025
Let's just go.

911
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,672
Why are you back?

912
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,842
Why are you smiling at me like that?

913
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,469
It makes me feel like I abandoned you.

914
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,015
Is that why you came back?

915
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,766
Let's say I felt a bit guilty.

916
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,186
How do you plan to go home?

917
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,231
My car is parked nearby.

918
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,649
I'll take my car.

919
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,112
It's late, so let me give you a ride.

920
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,781
No, it's okay.
Let me walk you to your car.

921
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,242
I don't want to go
to the police station again.

922
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,787
Come on.

923
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,590
About that line from the movie…

924
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,970
What was it?

925
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,223
"Why do we fall?

926
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,644
So we can learn to pick ourselves up."

927
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,821
You should also learn to pick yourself up.
Come on.

928
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,786
There we go.

929
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,045
Look. She's here.

930
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,925
They're still there?

931
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,802
Is she looking at us?

932
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,388
If Seon-gyeom is in his right mind,
he wouldn't be here.

933
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,890
Gosh, I'm so tired.

934
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:18,975
Nice.

935
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,476
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

936
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,602
My goodness.

937
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,276
What? What are you doing here?

938
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,322
Have you lost your mind?

939
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,951
I see.

940
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,662
You're not in your right mind.

941
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:43,124
It's an honor to see a famous movie star
like you here, Ms. Choi.

942
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:50,756
Thank you for the compliment,
but we shouldn't be meeting again.

943
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,927
-Especially not in front of my car.
-I see.

944
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,890
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

945
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,189
Gosh, this is awkward.

946
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,900
I get that you want attention
because of the love scandal.

947
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,944
But I really don't find this amusing.

948
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,364
I'm already dating someone else,
so please don't do this again.

949
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,365
Tae-ri!

950
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,118
What do you think you're doing?

951
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,204
Are you going to say
it was a coincidence again?

952
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,708
-You said it's not true!
-I swear it was a coincidence.

953
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,084
We're not dating.

954
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,129
You always say that.
But this already proves you're lying.

955
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,673
Avoiding him will make it look
even more suspicious.

956
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,759
There you go again.
You already lied to me once!

957
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,719
-Who did I lie about?
-That guy!

958
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,554
What's his name? Lee Jae-hun!

959
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,473
-Gosh, they're so loud.
-Let's hear you explain.

960
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,143
I can't believe you said his name.
I'm not renewing our contract.

961
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,563
What does that have to do with this?
That's totally irrelevant.

962
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,733
Hey, you! I said I'd keep my eyes on you.

963
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,151
How dare you lie to me?

964
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,444
We're not dating.

965
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,946
As if! You're together right now!

966
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,156
Seon-gyeom.

967
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,825
What's going on?

968
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,205
Hey, you're Choi Tae-ri.

969
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,998
-Hello.
-Hello.

970
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,794
Gosh, you little jerk.
Are you cheating on her?

971
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,296
How dare you cheat on Tae-ri?

972
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,340
What's wrong with you?
Just stay out of it.

973
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,925
Are you my dad or what?

974
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,552
-Do you have no pride?
-We're not dating!

975
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,096
What's wrong with those people?

976
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,181
-What's going on?
-Let me talk. Hey.

977
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,141
Who are you? Are you a rookie actress?

978
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,268
What is he saying? They're so weird.

979
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,145
A rookie shouldn't be dating already!

980
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,231
Will you please believe me?

981
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,108
He's cheating on you with her!

982
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,275
About that mistake…

983
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,402
There are reporters over there!

984
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,862
Can I do it instead?

985
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,072
-I'm serious!
-What?

986
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,740
-Where are they?
-Over there!

987
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:40,783
You always lie!

988
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,192
She's my girlfriend.

989
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,864
Have you lost your mind?

990
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:22,616
I'm serious.

991
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,538
Are you insane? Seriously?

992
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,959
Seriously.

993
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,169
What's your lip balm?

994
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,503
It was delicious and moist.

995
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:21,967
-You said so yourself that we're dating.
-Then that would make me insane.

996
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:28,349
How can you let me look for you?
I bought that painting ages ago.

997
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:31,268
Don't stop the disciplinary committee.
Let me get punished.

998
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,394
You darn punk!

999
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,774
You're touching me.

1000
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,609
Can you forgive them?

1001
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,778
Are you just going to feign ignorance?

1002
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,404
-You should be embarrassed.
-You punk!

1003
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,073
Ms. Oh!

1004
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,075
Are you still angry?

1005
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,743
Don't do it if you don't want to.

1006
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:51,121
You don't always have to
overcome everything.

1007
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,456
That was so cool.

1008
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,209
You should treat her well.
She's looking out for you.

1009
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,294
Do you like me?

1010
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:05,511
