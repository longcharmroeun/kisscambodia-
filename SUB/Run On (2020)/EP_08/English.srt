1
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:10,463
RUN ON

2
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,493
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:16,787
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:20,649
Aren't you coming?

5
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:26,571
I'm really good at finding my place.

6
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,615
Especially since I've been here
countless times.

7
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:35,455
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

8
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:56,059
Did they just ignore what I said?

9
00:00:56,768 --> 00:01:00,063
Calm down, Mr. Assemblyman.
There are many people here.

10
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:03,275
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

11
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,571
What made you give money
to that interpreter?

12
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:10,782
It looks like you've been shooting
a soap opera behind my back.

13
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,826
I should look into a few things

14
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,495
before things really turn
into a daytime soap.

15
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,080
Look into what?

16
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,832
Like how to splash her with water?

17
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:22,419
Let's go.

18
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:31,178
He's your father,
and it's regarding your family,

19
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:34,139
so I don't want to say
anything unnecessary.

20
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:36,975
But why do I always
have to see you like this?

21
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,978
I don't really know the right way
to pity someone.

22
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:43,940
But you should care for yourself
before you care for others.

23
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:49,154
And what was that earlier?
A natural encounter with Ms. Seo?

24
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:52,199
I thought you came here to watch a movie
and drink with me.

25
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:54,743
If I came here to meet Dan-ah,

26
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:56,953
I wouldn't have kept talking to you.

27
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,247
You and your excuses.

28
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,793
I doubt you even know
what natural encounter means.

29
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:08,590
Things just got worse.

30
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,887
EPISODE 8

31
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,350
My goodness.

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,735
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:14,030
Where's Ms. Seo?

34
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:15,532
She's probably at home.

35
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:19,077
That seat is taken.

36
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,787
He gave me his ticket.

37
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:22,122
Why is Ms. Seo at home?

38
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,875
Because she gave me her ticket.

39
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:31,548
I can't believe this.
I worked so hard to look nice today.

40
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,219
Do you want some?

41
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,554
No, thank you.

42
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:42,184
But why won't you give me
Ms. Seo's number?

43
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,602
She said it's okay.

44
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,729
Because I feel a bit uneasy.

45
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:47,939
What makes you feel uneasy? Me?

46
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,692
Me?

47
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,985
Can't we just…

48
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:54,946
The movie is starting.

49
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:15,258
I think I kind of understand why
you think movie theaters feel safe.

50
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,053
Will you be quiet? The movie just started.

51
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:20,931
Sorry.

52
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,103
Your voice was kind of loud.

53
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,244
Seon-gyeom!

54
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:29,040
Hey, Mi-joo. Just a second.

55
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:36,006
Are you kidding me?
You said it's right next to her.

56
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,050
But why did Mr. Jeong show up instead?

57
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,386
I guess she didn't come.

58
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,180
Is that why you cried?

59
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,932
No, the movie was touching.

60
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,393
I cry easily. I'm an emotional guy.

61
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:52,981
You know each other?
When did you become so close?

62
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:55,984
I guess you two are also acquainted.

63
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,529
Did you get home safely?
I woke up, and you weren't there.

64
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,364
I guess you did, seeing you're here.

65
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:05,160
Does that mean you spent the night at…

66
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,580
Why didn't you tell me?

67
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:12,000
It's been a while, so I thought
you would have forgotten about him.

68
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,461
That's not for you to decide.

69
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:15,879
Gosh, I had no idea.

70
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:17,589
I let my imagination run wild.

71
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:23,928
I guess I'll get going then.

72
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:26,097
-It's not like we're going to drink.
-Bye then.

73
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,183
It's sad not to drink
after watching a movie.

74
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:31,353
Let's go drink. I told you
I wanted to drink after the movie.

75
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,149
Right? It'd be a pity to just go home.
Why don't we all go for a drink?

76
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,233
The three of us?

77
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,986
But weren't you two on a date?

78
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,447
Just leave if you know.

79
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,532
Did something urgent come up?
You should go then.

80
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,784
You leave.

81
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,370
I can't leave.

82
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:51,373
-Then should I leave?
-No. You can't leave either.

83
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:55,043
Okay, that's enough.
Let's all go for some drinks.

84
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:57,462
Okay.

85
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:06,096
Rather than focusing on the main lead,

86
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:10,266
I focused more on the customer in that bar

87
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,894
who was searching for happiness
in chance and a glass of alcohol.

88
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:14,813
"How is he feeling?

89
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,606
What is he drinking?

90
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,734
Why is he sitting in that corner
looking all sad and gloomy?"

91
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,194
That was my approach.

92
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:25,573
Remember when Choi Tae-ri blows a whistle
when the camera zooms in on the male lead?

93
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:27,867
I couldn't stop myself from crying.

94
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,994
I think I might cry again.

95
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,956
They showed the ending first
and saved the climax for later.

96
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,207
I see.

97
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,085
But that scene…
The sound of that whistle was so sad.

98
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,713
I totally agree. It was so sad.

99
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:42,048
Do you think we felt that way

100
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:44,926
because we're conditioned to think it is?

101
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,928
Or because it just is?

102
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:53,309
It's interesting how whistles set
a different mood depending on the context.

103
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:56,146
It changes depending on
the kind of situation you're in.

104
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,982
When I paint,
I put on movies I've already watched.

105
00:07:59,065 --> 00:07:59,983
Mostly black-and-white.

106
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,484
You must like classic movies.

107
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,863
They are simple,
so they don't distract you that much.

108
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:08,616
Do you do that
so you don't lose focus when working?

109
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,453
And you can also notice things
that you've missed before.

110
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,788
Like how it feels different
when you watch movies from your childhood?

111
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,123
-Yes, exactly.
-Exactly.

112
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,666
-Right?
-You're the best.

113
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,002
You seem to know very well.

114
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:22,630
By the way, I've seen this film.

115
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,800
We did too.

116
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:30,180
No, I mean, I watched it a long time ago.
I watched it two times.

117
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,224
I also watched it several times already.

118
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,268
Oh, I see.

119
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:37,979
-My gosh.
-Here you go again.

120
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,689
Where did you watch it?

121
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,191
At the film festival.

122
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:42,734
What? You were there?

123
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,152
Yes.

124
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:45,820
-I'll take a bottle of soju.
-Sure.

125
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:46,905
Just a second.

126
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:51,868
-What are you doing?
-Don't you know what this is?

127
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,036
-What?
-Hey.

128
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,414
-It's that thing.
-What?

129
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:57,791
It's that thing, right?

130
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:58,792
No, it's not.

131
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:04,422
Mi-joo, I recently attended a film class
called "Three Acts and Five Seconds,"

132
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:07,217
and the movie was quite different
from what I learned in class.

133
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:10,136
That class sounds so familiar.

134
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,930
Do you go to Myeongin University?

135
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,515
Was it taught by Professor Hwang?

136
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:16,059
Yes, he came to our school
to teach that class.

137
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:17,560
I don't go to Myeongin University.

138
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:21,940
He still teaches that class?
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of it.

139
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,237
By the way,

140
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,033
why would I have a natural encounter
with Dan-ah?

141
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:34,118
A natural encounter with Ms. Seo? Why?

142
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:35,787
Why are you so upset?

143
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,167
I would love to be in a natural encounter
with Ms. Seo.

144
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:44,796
Seon-gyeom, you know her number, right?

145
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,422
Yes.

146
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,132
Tell me.

147
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:51,177
He can't tell you her number
without her permission.

148
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:53,012
I got her permission.

149
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,600
If you don't believe me, call her and ask.

150
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,436
Why would he call her and ask?

151
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,521
Then what should I do?

152
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:02,689
Why are you asking me?

153
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:03,773
My gosh.

154
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,902
Wait. I can actually prove it.

155
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:10,238
Where should we go?

156
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:15,034
-"Where"?
-Didn't you bring a car to go for a drive?

157
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:17,203
With a kid like you? In your dreams.

158
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:20,248
Why would you say that?
That kind of hurts.

159
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,168
-What?
-Can you drop me off on your way?

160
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,962
-Where do you think I'm going?
-Where are you going?

161
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,213
Definitely not where you're going.

162
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,007
-Where do you think that is?
-I don't care.

163
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,218
Mr. Jeong won't give me your number.

164
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:33,428
What if he never does?

165
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,599
Do everything you can.

166
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:38,808
Did you just tell me

167
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:42,020
to do everything I can?

168
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,400
Here. I've done it.

169
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:48,610
RECORDING

170
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:56,534
<i>I told him he could have my number.
Are you happy now?</i>

171
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:58,077
Did you hear that?

172
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:59,454
You heard her voice, right?

173
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:02,915
You're being creepy.
Why don't you ask her yourself?

174
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:03,958
She'll never tell me.

175
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,293
She hasn't memorized it.

176
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:08,171
She's never memorized her number before.

177
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:09,422
What a strange woman.

178
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,800
Can I also have your numbers too?

179
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,844
We're neighbors. Maybe not you.

180
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:19,015
That's more of a reason to tell me.
We won't be able to run into each other.

181
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:20,767
We can text each other and meet up.

182
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,477
-You know I love you, right?
-No.

183
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:27,357
Come on. Hurry.
You guys need to save my number too.

184
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,067
I'll send you guys my number.

185
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,320
Here.

186
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:36,824
RAPUNZEL

187
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:42,455
What? Why is there no profile photo?

188
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:43,915
How can I tell it's her?

189
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,375
It's her number.

190
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,003
Why would I lie to you about her number?

191
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,130
What an interesting person.

192
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:52,965
What? You don't have one either?

193
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,592
Neither do you, Mi-joo.

194
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,428
Is this a trend?

195
00:11:57,512 --> 00:12:00,056
I don't know if it's a trend.

196
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,141
I never had one from the start.

197
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:03,643
You too?

198
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,145
I don't want to be considered
the same type.

199
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,189
It hasn't been that long
since I deleted it.

200
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,984
This is for self PR.
Why would you leave it empty?

201
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:15,238
On purpose.
It used to be a vacation photo.

202
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,406
But people kept nitpicking.

203
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,659
Some people didn't seem to like
that I travel abroad.

204
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:22,620
And I hate how I get weird texts
after someone sees my face.

205
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,580
What's your profile picture?

206
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,082
Mine? Just a second.

207
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,961
This. It's what I'm working on.

208
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,172
What are you painting?

209
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,632
I'll know when I'm done.

210
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,467
I need to finish it first.

211
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:42,598
A CLOUDY SKY TURNS CLEAR
AFTER A RAINFALL

212
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,707
I wanted to read it once more
to understand it properly.

213
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,791
Who is this?

214
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,044
"Lee Yeong-hwa"?

215
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:15,339
<i>This is my number.
You can ghost me, but at least save it.</i>

216
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:18,009
<i>You should save it
to know who you're ghosting.</i>

217
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:21,012
He sounds familiarly arrogant.
I think I know him.

218
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:24,223
LEE YEONG-HWA

219
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,979
Oh, that kid?

220
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:36,277
Do people really think a couple of photos
can grab people's attention?

221
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:41,616
You're giving him attention
by asking me that right now.

222
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:46,037
Do you sign artists at your agency now?

223
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,830
He's still in college.

224
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:51,834
Is he trying to show off
how talented he is or what?

225
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:54,796
That kind of profile picture
is pretty average.

226
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,255
He's a college student.

227
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,674
No one around me does this kind of stuff.

228
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,304
-Should I keep it for you?
-Yes.

229
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:06,099
If they're going to exploit
people's anxieties for money,

230
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,433
couldn't they make it fun?

231
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,769
How can it be

232
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:11,687
when it's targeting your anxiety?

233
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,525
Don't rich people have their own studies?

234
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,195
It's embarrassing to keep it in my study.

235
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,572
I don't want people to know
that I get anxious.

236
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,326
See you.

237
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:34,544
<i>YOU'VE DONE WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH</i>

238
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,425
How do you feel?

239
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:44,846
What a straightforward question.

240
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,098
I'm not sure.

241
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:50,643
I hope you feel better soon.

242
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:54,313
How will you be getting to the film site?

243
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:55,565
By train.

244
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,567
What are you taking to the train station?

245
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,901
A cab.

246
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,112
My car is all fixed.

247
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:02,905
Congratulations.

248
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:19,172
-Did you cure your hangover?
-No, I still have it.

249
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:21,841
Are you working?

250
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:23,718
Yes, I couldn't focus at home.

251
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,596
It's all in English.
Are you good at English?

252
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,055
Of course. It's my major.

253
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,057
That doesn't always mean
you're good at it.

254
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,351
I wouldn't know. I was always good.

255
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:33,769
The same goes for me.

256
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:36,564
If anyone overhears us,
they'd think we're annoying.

257
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,150
Did you skip class
because of your hangover?

258
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:42,737
I thought about doing that,
but I just went since I paid tuition.

259
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,988
I'm free for three hours.

260
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:45,823
What a messed up schedule.

261
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,951
I'm not a freshman,
but I still get nervous

262
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,287
when it's time to apply for classes.
It's like a battlefield.

263
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,248
Graduating didn't make things any better.
I'm still in debt.

264
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:55,666
-Your school loans?
-Yes.

265
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,169
Would I have paid it off
once I reach your age?

266
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:00,880
I'm still in debt.

267
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,048
If I cut back on work,

268
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:04,425
my bank account goes empty
once I pay my mortgage,

269
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:07,261
and that's when I find work
to make more money.

270
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,639
Gosh, that sounds so miserable.

271
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,515
ARE YOU A CELEBRITY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW TAE-WOONG?

272
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:16,395
-My gosh. Mi-joo, can I ask you something?
-Yes.

273
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,981
I'm good at everything else but English.

274
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,733
Look. If you look here…

275
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:25,780
I think she's threatening to kill me.
What does it exactly mean?

276
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:29,992
"You are killing me. Who are you?
Tell the truth. It's killing us."

277
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:33,496
She's asking how you know Tae-woong.
She's so curious that it's killing her.

278
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:36,415
Why won't he unfollow me?
Is he doing this on purpose?

279
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:38,000
The only Tae-woong I know
is Seo Tae-woong.

280
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:40,211
Are you also an Alphabet?

281
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,505
What? I'm talking about <i>Slam Dunk</i>.

282
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:45,841
Gosh, this reminds me of the old days.
I used to love Jeong Dae-man.

283
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:49,011
-What about you?
-Me? I liked Kang Baek-ho.

284
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,098
I don't want my hair like that.

285
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,058
Make mine look natural.

286
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,852
And how do you think that makes me feel?

287
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:00,106
I know you have a schedule,
but what about you Tae-woong?

288
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,484
Do you have a date
with the person you're following?

289
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,779
People think you have a secret girlfriend.

290
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,198
Respect my privacy.

291
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,742
Tae-woong, you have a girlfriend?

292
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,079
I have tons of girlfriends.

293
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,331
My fans are my girlfriends.

294
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:18,833
Another selfie?

295
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,793
You're pretty much addicted.

296
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,962
How can I not get addicted?

297
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:24,380
Every time I upload a photo,

298
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,800
tens of thousands of people like it.

299
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:31,387
How are the preparations
for Eun-bi's tournament coming along?

300
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,932
We sent her the outfit and portfolio,
and she's still checking.

301
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,642
We'll receive a feedback soon.

302
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:38,728
Director Dong.

303
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:42,356
Eun-bi is finally going to play golf
wearing our outfit

304
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,275
in front of the entire world.

305
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,235
Gosh, I'm so excited.

306
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:51,115
Did you have to cancel the deal
with Seon-gyeom?

307
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,702
Was it your plan to discard him
once Eun-bi joined the agency?

308
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,537
I know you're fond of him.

309
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,581
The contract was nearing termination

310
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:01,459
and I figured he won't renew it.
That's why I did it first.

311
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,085
I'm not joking around.

312
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,011
I don't want an athlete
who committed assault.

313
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,849
It's true that I'm fond of him,

314
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:20,144
but that never trumps what's important.

315
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:21,937
My agency matters more to me.

316
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,943
What's so great about an agency
who discards their athletes?

317
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:32,073
You just let go of him
so you could provide more for Eun-bi.

318
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:36,077
Wouldn't it be better for our image
to help him get back on his feet?

319
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,079
I think Seon-gyeom will do great.

320
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,581
-You have a point.
-Then why don't you--

321
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:42,792
I don't want a former athlete
to be an agent.

322
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,794
He'll care for them better than anyone.

323
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:45,753
That's exactly why.

324
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:51,217
I feel like he'll only focus
on the athletes and nothing else.

325
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,888
You know
I'm in charge of personnel, right?

326
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,724
We're two years in
and should have a manager for athletes.

327
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:02,144
But I like working with those
who put my priorities above all else.

328
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,106
What would you have done
if you were in his shoes?

329
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:08,651
What if Mr. Jeong were assaulting me
behind your back?

330
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:14,657
I doubt he's the one
who'd be doing the hitting.

331
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:18,744
Is that a compliment or what?

332
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:34,802
I'm home. I'll go get changed.
I was at the gym.

333
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,680
Dan-ah, I heard you hit Myeong-min

334
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:40,516
in front of the employees.

335
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,184
You tattled again?

336
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,394
Dumb and childish.

337
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:46,063
I didn't say anything.
It wasn't just us there.

338
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:48,357
Others have eyes and ears too, you know.

339
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:50,317
Couldn't you have done it discreetly?

340
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,153
-You hurt his pride.
-Father!

341
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:54,405
Can I kill him if done discreetly?

342
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:55,531
Hey!

343
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:59,201
-Of course not.
-He damaged what's mine first.

344
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,704
-Treat me as your older brother.
-I do in public.

345
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:05,708
Is that brain of yours broken?

346
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,586
Have you forgotten
I was born ten months prior?

347
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:12,006
It still sickens me to know
that he forged your birth certificate--

348
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,674
-That's enough.
-Be grateful

349
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:16,969
that I go along with the lie
when we're in public.

350
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,013
Being dumb is no excuse to be an ingrate.

351
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:23,309
If only you each shared
your good qualities.

352
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,563
We might have if we had the same mother.

353
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:29,231
Unlike me, they're all bastards.

354
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,525
You might not agree,

355
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,736
but you're all equally precious to me.

356
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:36,906
If you mean that,
prove it with your actions.

357
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:38,407
I'd love to see that it's true.

358
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,045
Is your second wife setting the table
for your first wife's memorial service?

359
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:53,047
This is making me sick.

360
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:56,383
Who are you to shit over
my mom's generosity?

361
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,843
I'm not the one doing the shitting.

362
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,261
Dan-ah,

363
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,680
it's time you let go
of your hatred against her.

364
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:10,773
Why would I hate her?

365
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:13,067
I'm not interested enough
to have such feelings.

366
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,694
Seo Dan-ah,
don't talk like that to the chairman--

367
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,112
Seo Myeong-min!

368
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,074
Do you know why I haven't exposed you?

369
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,536
It's for the good of the company
and the CEO.

370
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:26,288
You two couldn't care less
about the company image.

371
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,916
Only I've been working my ass off
to keep it clean.

372
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,251
It's all my fault, I guess.

373
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:31,794
I should just die.

374
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:33,420
Please don't say things like that.

375
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,256
Stop playing the victim here.

376
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,968
And be done with trying
to set me up with a suitor.

377
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:42,137
These days, being gay isn't a big deal.

378
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:44,848
Marriage will set you straight.

379
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:54,984
I won't bother responding to that
since I don't even know where to begin.

380
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,903
I guess it all comes with
being an educated woman.

381
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,072
I'll find an adequate suitor,

382
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,908
so clear your schedule for the wedding.

383
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:04,201
I'll keep it short.

384
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,663
You'll be in breathtaking outfits
and vow your endless love.

385
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:11,500
Could it be any more romantic?

386
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,211
I said I didn't want to waste my time
on marriage yet.

387
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,172
Isn't it enough
that you married three times

388
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:18,966
and had your son married?

389
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,426
You see…

390
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:26,015
I learned something
on Myeong-min's wedding day.

391
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,978
"I'm glad to have a daughter."

392
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:34,565
Being able to walk one down the aisle
is crucial to a father.

393
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,571
So escorting you down the aisle
with your hand in mine…

394
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:42,573
is all I need.

395
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,371
I can't stay here anymore.

396
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,085
Dan-ah, where are you going?

397
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:56,378
Dan-ah!

398
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,838
My youngest is here.

399
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,426
How much of it did you hear?

400
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:05,471
Myeong-min,
are you seriously talking to me?

401
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:08,265
What have I said about
speaking casually to me?

402
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:09,683
-You.
-Yes?

403
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,185
You're in Korea now.

404
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:13,354
Where are your manners?

405
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,024
I will. I will, but…

406
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:20,944
Just a second though.
Father, let me be excused.

407
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:30,996
Dan-ah. Where are you off to?

408
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:33,207
Dan-ah!

409
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:35,793
Dan-ah.

410
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,962
Your mother's memorial service is today,

411
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:41,048
so I bought some rice cakes.

412
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,802
That must be how it's done in America.
Why not just crawl back there?

413
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,430
I will if that's what you want.

414
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:52,267
What about your agency and fans then?
Stop being such an idiot.

415
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:58,649
Why do you do this when I
make it clear that I don't like you?

416
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:03,070
Because you at least hate me.

417
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:07,741
It's better than being treated
as if I'm invisible.

418
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:10,160
It also takes effort

419
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,663
to hate someone.

420
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,210
You've got to be kidding me.

421
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,589
What did I ever do that was so wrong?

422
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:24,967
That we have the same dad?

423
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,803
That we don't have the same mom?

424
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,515
Or is it because I'm just me?

425
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:33,892
Why ask when you clearly know the answer?

426
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:35,894
It's not like

427
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:40,274
I can choose my parents.

428
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:42,401
Exactly.

429
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,864
Why did you have to be born
into this family?

430
00:24:55,164 --> 00:24:56,165
Dan-ah.

431
00:24:58,292 --> 00:24:59,293
Dan-ah!

432
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:08,135
I LOVE YOU TAE-WOONG

433
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:12,431
What's the point of living?

434
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,567
Damn it.

435
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:58,018
Your painting shines even in the darkness.

436
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:13,951
Make yourself at home

437
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:17,246
and feel free
to use anything in the house.

438
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:20,666
Take this with you.
I made enough for you both.

439
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,836
Please don't skip breakfast.

440
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:28,507
Wow. Prepped meals?
This will last us two days.

441
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,093
I made sure they'd be easy to eat
even in the car.

442
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,013
We'll get going then.

443
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:36,139
Come on, we'll be late.

444
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:45,023
Is she still pretending to be pissed off?

445
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:48,026
I'd be glad if she was only pretending.

446
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,031
We'll enjoy this. Thank you.

447
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,285
Enjoy it together.

448
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:57,327
Sure.

449
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:10,757
Sorry about that.
Eun-bi's meeting was delayed…

450
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:16,513
You don't have to stop on my accord.

451
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:17,931
Regarding what?

452
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:19,641
My sister.

453
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,436
You can talk about her in front of me.

454
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:27,232
Also, my fingerprint
doesn't seem to be registered

455
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:29,234
for the front gate.

456
00:27:29,318 --> 00:27:31,528
It wasn't me. Dan-ah delisted you.

457
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:39,661
Don't tell me that's why you're here.

458
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:40,954
Of course not.

459
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:43,248
Here you go.

460
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:48,795
I wanted to thank you
for giving me Coach Bang's number.

461
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,464
I was able to meet her.

462
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:54,426
From what I hear,
she's been spotted with a certain team.

463
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,427
Was that your doing?

464
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,139
She never said anything to me,
but I guess that's what she's up to.

465
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:02,184
And you made her get back out there.

466
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,982
It wasn't my doing.

467
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,109
This was her choice.

468
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:14,404
-What a waste.
-Sorry?

469
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:18,784
There's a natural gift you have,
but I bet you don't know what it is.

470
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:21,912
You motivate people.

471
00:28:23,372 --> 00:28:24,539
I honestly don't.

472
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:27,042
It's never your intention, but it works.

473
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,835
That's why it's a natural gift.

474
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,882
Director Dong, the report you handed in…

475
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,844
Seon-gyeom. Fate must have
brought us together.

476
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:39,429
Will you marry me?

477
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:40,722
I know you're my boss--

478
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,266
I'm sick and tired of these blind dates.

479
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,851
You liked me once, right?

480
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:46,603
Let's get married. I'll be good.

481
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:50,357
I've never liked you,
so why do you keep saying that?

482
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,109
-Didn't you like me?
-No.

483
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:55,237
Why haven't you told me earlier?

484
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,031
You mislead me,
so make up for it with marriage.

485
00:28:58,532 --> 00:28:59,574
How's that logical?

486
00:28:59,658 --> 00:29:01,576
I'm dead serious, so think about it.

487
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:06,873
Here. How about we reduce the front
and elongate the back?

488
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:11,211
Sometimes, I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

489
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:13,171
Think of how I must feel.

490
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:15,799
I said it's not a joke.

491
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:28,020
-The smell of the sea.
-Gosh.

492
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,440
How peaceful and calm.

493
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:33,734
What?

494
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:40,157
It's Hui-jin.

495
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:41,783
Hey.

496
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:43,785
Camera rolling.

497
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:45,704
Action!

498
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,293
All right. Cut!

499
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,170
-All right. Cut!
-Fantastic. Great, that was perfect.

500
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:55,714
All right. Scene 42, take three.

501
00:29:57,382 --> 00:29:59,760
Let me tell you who's who.

502
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:02,220
That's James, the leading actor.

503
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:04,264
I hear he's part Korean.

504
00:30:04,347 --> 00:30:06,308
Next to him is
the director of photography.

505
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:08,852
He seems somewhat racist,

506
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:10,687
but he's still a gentleman.

507
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:12,397
Weird.

508
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,941
Up there is the movie director.

509
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:16,318
He's a Korean-American.

510
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:18,862
He speaks Korean a little,
so it'll make your job easier.

511
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:22,032
And the lady with red lipstick
sipping her coffee

512
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:24,493
is the Korean producer Yeom Gang-sun.

513
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:25,786
She hates her Korean name,

514
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:28,371
so make sure you call her Julie.

515
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:31,750
-She still comes to movie sets?
-Do you know her?

516
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,835
She's infamous for being a know-it-all.

517
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,422
She butts in all the time
while people translate

518
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:38,924
even though she's not that fluent.

519
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:42,928
I see. Doesn't she have
her own translator?

520
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:44,596
Of course. Look right next to her.

521
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,098
She slacks off though.

522
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:49,684
A translator should correct people
when there's any miscommunication,

523
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:51,019
but not her.

524
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:54,648
We wasted a lot of our time because
Ms. Yeom didn't have the facts right.

525
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:55,899
Oh, dear.

526
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:58,401
We'll move after this scene,

527
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:00,612
so you can say hello then and get working.

528
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,193
We'll be filming in five.
Please get ready.

529
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:42,654
-Five minutes to shoot. Be ready, please.
-All right.

530
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:44,239
Five minutes.

531
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,796
What do track and field athletes do
after they retire?

532
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:02,132
After retirement,

533
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:04,259
here I am doing laundry.

534
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,554
Is there anything you want to do?

535
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,818
Ms. Oh, can you get the light?

536
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:23,361
Sure thing.

537
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,181
What the hell?

538
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:53,099
The door won't budge.

539
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:58,188
Come in.

540
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:11,326
I've slept in all kinds of places,
but this is on a whole new level.

541
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:14,454
It's very humbling.

542
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:17,123
I saw a supermarket on my way here.

543
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,125
Should I buy us new covers?

544
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,669
I'm sure it's closed by now.

545
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:24,464
Anyway, I brought a blanket from home,
so let's sleep under that.

546
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:28,134
Also, we'll sleep on these towels.

547
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,761
They should be clean at least.

548
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:32,555
Shouldn't we leave a few
to shower tomorrow?

549
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,308
I brought two from home,
so we'll use those.

550
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:40,230
We were given the corner suite though.
It's tiny but there's even a window.

551
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:42,190
It has all the essentials.

552
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:50,907
No wonder Hui-jin's
been constipated for three weeks.

553
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:53,994
Why does the toilet look so noir-esque?

554
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:11,761
I wonder if he's doing all right.

555
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:14,806
OCTOBER 17, SATURDAY

556
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,158
What the…

557
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:37,704
-Unbelievable.
-What is it?

558
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:39,122
It's nothing. Go to sleep.

559
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:05,648
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

560
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:11,613
<i>Could you recommend a movie
that'll put me…</i>

561
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:37,180
MYEONGBINJANG INN

562
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:28,356
<i>May!
Why are you sleeping with your eyes open?</i>

563
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,595
-Hello?
-Hi, son. Where are you?

564
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:00,889
-On the road.
-<i>You must be driving.</i>

565
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:03,558
What do you say to some coffee?
Your sister's buying.

566
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:06,102
Where should I meet you?

567
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:09,341
IT'S KI EUN-BI'S TREAT!

568
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,885
YOOK JI-WOO IS SO LUCKY
TO HAVE KI EUN-BI AS A DAUGHTER

569
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:19,810
Yook Ji-woo is lucky to also have
a son who comes when she asks!

570
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:22,646
Sorry about that.

571
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:27,693
I heard you were the first Korean actress
to skin someone.

572
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:30,613
Right, it was about 30 years ago.

573
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,656
I was young and fresh at the time.

574
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,076
-Is that also the case today?
-No, I sliced up a person instead.

575
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,455
It required some elbow grease
because I had to be slicing constantly.

576
00:37:39,538 --> 00:37:42,958
-Are you playing another killer?
-No, a vegan murderer.

577
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,794
Can I have two coffees,
one with an extra shot?

578
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:47,963
-Sure thing.
-Ms. Yook. Who is this?

579
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:50,716
He's my son. Isn't he pretty?

580
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,510
You could be an actor too.
How about a cameo appearance?

581
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:54,845
Why not?

582
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:57,306
What do you say? We can slice together.

583
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,766
No.

584
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:07,066
Your sister was generous enough
to send a coffee truck to the set.

585
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:09,068
Shouldn't you be just as generous?

586
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:11,904
Are you broke now that you're unemployed?

587
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:13,447
Should I give you some money?

588
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:17,910
Don't most mothers scold their children
for being unemployed?

589
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,246
Do you miss my nagging
now that you're older?

590
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:25,417
You never criticized my life,

591
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,212
so how could I criticize or meddle
in yours?

592
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:34,259
I told you to be a good boy

593
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,720
<i>while I was gone for work.</i>

594
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:43,060
<i>I told you not to bother Eun-bi
since she was busy for a tournament.</i>

595
00:38:46,438 --> 00:38:48,649
<i>I told you to win a medal</i>

596
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:51,944
<i>to help your dad get elected.</i>

597
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:56,865
You did everything we asked you to
without complaining.

598
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,368
It was all for your family.

599
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:03,163
You may be mild-tempered,

600
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,125
but I know you made an effort too.

601
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:14,258
I thought it was easy to raise kids.

602
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:20,431
I thought they matured with time.

603
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:27,020
But it turns out, you raised yourself.

604
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:34,153
Then you took initiative and told us
you wanted to do something.

605
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:37,239
I was exhilarated.

606
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:44,163
Every time you want to do something,
I should just support you.

607
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,749
That's all I can do.

608
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:51,336
Because every time I asked you
to do something,

609
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:56,008
you did just that.

610
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:02,806
I know I look a bit gruesome
to be saying this.

611
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:05,309
You're still just as beautiful.

612
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:08,353
I've always been beautiful.

613
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:13,776
Next time, I'll bring a gift.

614
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:17,446
-With my fan?
-Your fan?

615
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:20,365
Oh, her?

616
00:40:21,158 --> 00:40:23,327
Treat her well. After all, she's my fan.

617
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,037
I don't know how you two met,

618
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,457
but if she's close enough
to hold your hand, you treat her well.

619
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,127
Why…

620
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,882
did you marry Father?

621
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:41,220
Because I loved him.

622
00:40:43,555 --> 00:40:45,599
Are you two still on good terms?

623
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:50,103
No.

624
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:53,357
That's because

625
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:55,859
we still love each other.

626
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:00,155
Are you sure you don't want a part?

627
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:04,117
Who do you take after to be so stubborn?

628
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:07,037
In that case, I understand.

629
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:09,915
Yes, I do.

630
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:45,158
<i>My mom told me to treat her fan well.</i>

631
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:46,159
Gosh.

632
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:48,620
What a cutie.

633
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,583
Thank you, Ji-woo.

634
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:55,168
<i>Treat me well, then.</i>

635
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:09,224
-Dinner time, everyone.
-James. Do you like <i>bibimbap</i> or…

636
00:42:09,308 --> 00:42:10,642
Do you know <i>mulhoe</i>?

637
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:14,396
Mul… I don't but all the food
has been delicious.

638
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:20,110
Oh, I know. We should try it.

639
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:22,738
-I want to get some hamburgers, man.
-Yes, I want…

640
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:43,258
I've always wondered what people did
in the countryside after sundown.

641
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:44,801
They drink.

642
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,263
Why did you skip your meal
and keep an eye on that?

643
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:49,765
Because no one else did.

644
00:42:49,848 --> 00:42:52,100
Keep that up,
and they'll put you in charge.

645
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:55,354
Someone was bound to do it anyway.

646
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:57,522
How's budgeting going?

647
00:42:58,148 --> 00:43:00,025
We just keep talking about it.

648
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:01,568
How's the interpretation going?

649
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:03,779
I agreed to do it,
but they're not letting me.

650
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:05,614
They won't give me any time to translate.

651
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:08,825
That's why our youngest staff
couldn't take it anymore and left.

652
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:13,038
I see. And you hid that fact from me.

653
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:15,499
I can totally relate to them right now.

654
00:43:15,582 --> 00:43:17,125
I love you. Cheers.

655
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:18,919
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

656
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:23,715
At first, I had no time
to even think about this.

657
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:27,177
But now, I sometimes wonder
what I'm doing here.

658
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:29,513
They talk so much.

659
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:33,016
I'm on edge because I'd be wasting
their time if I made a mistake.

660
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,978
Since time and budget are linked,
I get nervous.

661
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,147
I feel like I need to work at all times.

662
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:44,945
But for now, it's still fun.
It's manageable.

663
00:43:46,196 --> 00:43:47,614
It was worse back then.

664
00:43:47,698 --> 00:43:50,909
Back then, I didn't get paid
for working overtime.

665
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,246
I thought that was normal.

666
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:57,708
It's been six or seven years already.
I was ignorant.

667
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:00,460
They were the ignorant ones.

668
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:02,379
-Screw working for free.
-That's right.

669
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,965
You're drinking here again.

670
00:44:05,048 --> 00:44:07,300
We're closing, so get going.

671
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:08,802
I want to go to bed.

672
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:11,263
This is our first time here, sir.

673
00:44:11,346 --> 00:44:13,390
I know you're saying that to me, sir.

674
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:16,435
This is a 24-hour convenience store, sir.

675
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:19,229
Hold on. Where did I keep the salt?

676
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:24,735
-What? Salt?
-You must have come here every day.

677
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:52,387
Have you eaten yet?

678
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:57,601
Yes, I'm eating right now.

679
00:44:57,684 --> 00:44:58,894
<i>I ate too.</i>

680
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:02,272
<i>They served </i>doenjang<i> soup
with spinach and bulgogi. It was tasty.</i>

681
00:45:02,355 --> 00:45:03,356
<i>You?</i>

682
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:07,611
I'm having something tasty too.

683
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:10,781
By the way, why have you called?

684
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:12,783
<i>You make it feel so awkward.</i>

685
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:15,619
I know it's awkward for you,
but it's worse for me.

686
00:45:17,078 --> 00:45:18,413
I feel the most awkward.

687
00:45:18,497 --> 00:45:20,957
Two people I'm used to seeing daily
are no longer here.

688
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,211
Have you met Seon-gyeom again?

689
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:25,962
No, not yet.

690
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:29,549
<i>I'm not quite ready yet.</i>

691
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:31,927
Worry about that once you come back here.

692
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,181
He'll just keep waiting
unless you ask to see him first.

693
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:38,350
He'll always be so dense.

694
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:43,980
Just do it.

695
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:46,817
You're much younger.

696
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:50,237
Being reckless is a privilege at your age.

697
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:53,824
<i>-It's okay to do that.</i>
-Okay, I will.

698
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:56,576
Thank you for your concern.

699
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:58,912
Okay. Bye.

700
00:45:59,746 --> 00:46:02,999
-Mr. Kim Woo-sik?
-Coming.

701
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:08,588
Terrific. Now, after you flow him down,

702
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:10,382
you're going to move to your left,
and sees an enemy on the right.

703
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:13,718
Yes, make him fall down.
Grab a hammer, and pound it.

704
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:16,680
Okay, this is the end of first sequence.
What do you think?

705
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:19,766
I mean, I think that's great but you got to
remember for the angle of the camera,

706
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,518
We need to show the hammer
against the wall.

707
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,729
But in this case, that means
I need to have some staff hiding somewhere

708
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:26,022
that are going to throw some blood
onto the wall.

709
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:29,526
Okay, sounds good. We'll do that.
All right, moving on. Second sequence.

710
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:31,194
James returns with the hammer,

711
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:33,780
sees three enemies, throws it,
hits the enemy in the middle.

712
00:46:33,864 --> 00:46:35,991
He's going to run. Run to your right,

713
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:37,158
and jump off the wall.

714
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:40,412
Garrison, I really feel
this should be a long take

715
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:42,622
-Can you make that work?
-Yeah, I mean the only problem is

716
00:46:42,706 --> 00:46:45,166
that I going to have a B camera
on the other side of the wall

717
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,126
when he jumps over.

718
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:48,336
And you got to remember,
there's still two other attackers

719
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,921
that are going to come over
to attack him.

720
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:53,008
So, I just think it's impossible
we can do this in a single take.

721
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:54,384
All right, sounds good.
You know what,

722
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:55,760
we're actually going to do
a separate take on that. Okay?

723
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:57,012
-All right.
-All right, moving on. Let's go.

724
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:58,013
That'll be great.

725
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:00,265
Scene 35 will be a long take.

726
00:47:00,348 --> 00:47:02,309
James will make a stuntman trip,

727
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:04,769
grab the hammer, and attack him.

728
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:07,564
That's when the staff
can squirt the blood.

729
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:10,901
Then he'll grab the hammer
and go around the house,

730
00:47:10,984 --> 00:47:12,569
and three enemies will be waiting.

731
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:15,280
He'll then throw the hammer,
hit the enemy in the center,

732
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:18,033
run to his right, and climb over the wall.

733
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:20,785
Okay, wait a minute. Why is the blood
on the floor and not on the wall?

734
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:22,621
That's exactly
what I was talking about with

735
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:25,206
the angle of the camera.
that we needed on the wall as well.

736
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,000
-What's going on?
-Mi-joo!

737
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:34,966
Did you not tell Special Effects that
I wanted blood on the wall?

738
00:47:35,675 --> 00:47:39,054
I specifically told you that
I want blood on the wall and the ground.

739
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:40,055
Look at this.

740
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:43,183
Did you see blood on the wall? No.

741
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:47,103
I'm sorry. I think I made a mistake.

742
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:49,272
All right, Garrison.
You know what,

743
00:47:49,356 --> 00:47:51,775
Let's actually do a close-up
on the transition separately and

744
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:53,234
we're going to add it
on the master.

745
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,779
-That's going to work better. Okay?
-All right.

746
00:47:56,655 --> 00:47:57,989
We'll film this scene again.

747
00:47:58,073 --> 00:47:59,574
I know this is hard to interpret.

748
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:02,285
Thank you. I'm sorry.

749
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:10,210
-Could I ask you a small favor?
-What?

750
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:13,296
Would you mind giving me
a little more time to translate?

751
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,341
If I have a few more seconds in between,

752
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:19,302
I think I can do a better job
relaying your message.

753
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:20,553
Okay, I'm sorry.

754
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:23,431
You know, this is my first time working
with a translator.

755
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:26,101
I haven't thought about that.
But I'll give you more time in the future.

756
00:48:26,184 --> 00:48:27,227
Thank you.

757
00:48:27,936 --> 00:48:29,646
I won't make the same mistake again.

758
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:31,064
I hope not.

759
00:48:37,946 --> 00:48:39,948
-What is this?
-A soccer ball.

760
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:41,658
Did you save my number?

761
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:43,868
I did. I should know who it is
that I'm ghosting.

762
00:48:43,952 --> 00:48:46,162
Gosh, you're so obnoxious.

763
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:49,332
-Didn't I tell you to stop doing that?
-Why should I?

764
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,793
-What?
-I smile because I'm happy.

765
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:53,420
Who are you to stop me?

766
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:56,589
Why didn't you come to the premier?

767
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:59,634
And why should you and Seon-gyeom
have a natural encounter?

768
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,345
Mind your own business. Why are you here?

769
00:49:04,055 --> 00:49:06,933
To show you my draft,
but I don't want to anymore.

770
00:49:07,017 --> 00:49:08,393
Picky, aren't you?

771
00:49:08,476 --> 00:49:11,187
Show me. Hurry and show me.

772
00:49:11,271 --> 00:49:13,398
I told you it's not that important.

773
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:15,400
-That's not for you to decide.
-What about you?

774
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:17,694
-I'm the one who decides.
-I'm the artist.

775
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:23,116
If you keep acting this way, kid,

776
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,536
you'll seriously pique my curiosity.

777
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:30,248
And I've never learned how to be patient.
What do you think I'll do?

778
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,043
You'll learn to be patient.

779
00:49:34,544 --> 00:49:37,922
I will see that draft even if it means
I have to lock you up and torture you.

780
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,717
So you'll make time for me?

781
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:43,970
I just can't get through to you, kid.

782
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:48,058
I wish you'd stop calling me that.

783
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:50,351
Then what would I call you, kid?

784
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:55,482
"Yeong-hwa".

785
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:02,447
That's so cringy.

786
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,201
If that's difficult, you can also call me
a bastard.

787
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:08,703
I hope you can cooperate with me on that.

788
00:50:18,546 --> 00:50:20,423
-I'll get going first.
-Sure.

789
00:50:23,885 --> 00:50:25,053
Where are you going?

790
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:27,555
-What's it to you?
-Are you running there?

791
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:32,685
What? What is it? Hold on.

792
00:50:45,365 --> 00:50:46,991
So much for a cooperation.

793
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:53,331
Once you grow up,
you can try get back at me.

794
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:01,881
Cut!

795
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:04,926
All right, that's our martini shot, folks.

796
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:07,137
Let's pack it down.

797
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,555
Good work, everyone.

798
00:51:08,638 --> 00:51:11,766
-I'll give the teams their schedules.
-Good work.

799
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:14,978
-Good work.
-Good work.

800
00:51:21,818 --> 00:51:22,861
What's going on?

801
00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:25,864
Do I have a cold?

802
00:51:28,575 --> 00:51:30,076
I shouldn't get sick.

803
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:54,100
James had asked for a driver
who couldn't speak English,

804
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:56,060
so who hired this one?

805
00:51:57,937 --> 00:51:58,980
You did.

806
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:00,940
Find a replacement at all costs.

807
00:52:01,024 --> 00:52:03,401
Are you discriminating against him
since he's gay?

808
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:05,153
You even let a staff run away!

809
00:52:06,696 --> 00:52:07,864
Stop slacking off.

810
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:11,659
My gosh.

811
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:17,123
Yeom Gang-sun, that bitch.

812
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:22,378
Is this about finding
James' boyfriend's driver?

813
00:52:22,462 --> 00:52:23,296
Yes.

814
00:52:23,379 --> 00:52:26,090
James had asked for a driver
who couldn't speak English.

815
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:29,719
She mistook what he said
and found someone who could.

816
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,971
Then why is she taking it out on you?

817
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:32,931
Exactly.

818
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:35,183
We can talk shit later.

819
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:38,436
One thing for sure is that
his boyfriend is flying in in two days.

820
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,109
Isn't Chan-hui free?
His shoot finished recently.

821
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:47,570
He'll be having a baby soon, so he can't.

822
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:48,655
He is?

823
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:51,991
-No, his wife.
-Right.

824
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:54,786
Where can we find a driver right now?

825
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:58,706
You're right.

826
00:52:59,624 --> 00:53:01,793
Do we need someone who doesn't
speak English, can drive,

827
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:02,877
and is free at the moment?

828
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:05,922
And be presentable.
He requested that specifically.

829
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:08,633
He's perfect.

830
00:53:17,016 --> 00:53:19,978
I know you're doing well,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

831
00:53:20,937 --> 00:53:25,858
Can you drive here tomorrow?

832
00:53:28,611 --> 00:53:29,946
We should make up.

833
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:34,742
Drive safe.

834
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:36,744
I'll text you the address.

835
00:53:38,246 --> 00:53:39,289
Okay.

836
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:40,999
Bye.

837
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:45,545
How selfish am I?

838
00:53:46,504 --> 00:53:47,839
I'll be punished for this.

839
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:17,410
Why isn't she using the blanket?

840
00:54:17,493 --> 00:54:18,745
Was it hot?

841
00:54:22,665 --> 00:54:25,543
Hello? I'm almost there. I'm nearby.

842
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:57,784
CALLING FOR A TAXI NEARBY

843
00:54:57,867 --> 00:55:00,078

CALLING FOR A TAXI

846
00:55:04,582 --> 00:55:06,000
THERE ARE NO TAXIS NEARBY

847
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:11,964
The emergency center…

848
00:55:12,924 --> 00:55:16,636
Damn it. I don't think I saw
any large hospitals nearby.

849
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:22,725
It feels like I'm dying.

850
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:37,073
May, I'm…

851
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:40,284
headed to a nearby hospital.

852
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:44,247
If anything happens,
please fill in for me.

853
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:56,884
You have a fever.

854
00:55:56,968 --> 00:56:00,847
You've just overworked yourself,
so don't worry too much.

855
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:04,058
-Okay.
-Do you do strenuous work?

856
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:06,227
I heard they're filming a movie
around here.

857
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:09,230
Did you work outdoors all day?

858
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:12,400
We are filming a movie but…

859
00:56:12,483 --> 00:56:15,778
We need to give you an IV drip
and lower your body temperature.

860
00:56:15,862 --> 00:56:18,239
Don't overwork yourself
for the time being.

861
00:56:20,283 --> 00:56:21,492
Okay.

862
00:56:38,843 --> 00:56:40,428
Miss, are you okay?

863
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:41,596
What are you sick with?

864
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:45,767
-Pardon?
-Your face is burning red.

865
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,268
Do you have a fever?

866
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:49,520
I…

867
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,733
I'm sorry,
but my head is pounding too much.

868
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,820
Here, have a tangerine.

869
00:56:57,904 --> 00:56:59,697
You need to eat to get better.

870
00:57:03,284 --> 00:57:05,286
Does she not like tangerines?

871
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:06,579
I guess so.

872
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,167
You know, is Jang-seob getting married?

873
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,211
Why did I have to get sick?

874
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:14,545
He has no girlfriend.

875
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:18,925
Why do you keep drawing the curtain?

876
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:20,134
It's me, Ms. Oh.

877
00:57:23,012 --> 00:57:23,888
Are you okay?

878
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:26,516
How did you know I'd be here?

879
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:29,685
May told me to take care of matters
at the hospital.

880
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:32,647
Did you even know I was sick?

881
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:37,318
Are you crying? Are you in a lot of pain?

882
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,488
Seeing you here gives me comfort.

883
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:41,781
I'm in so much pain.

884
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:47,745
What would you like me to do?

885
00:57:55,419 --> 00:57:57,672
-They keep talking to me.
-Okay.

886
00:57:57,755 --> 00:58:01,050
They keep drawing the curtain
when I need to sleep.

887
00:58:04,595 --> 00:58:06,055
Those women?

888
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,434
One minute.

889
00:58:15,481 --> 00:58:17,024
Where are you from?

890
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:19,110
I'm from Seoul.

891
00:58:20,027 --> 00:58:21,696
Are you that sick lady's husband?

892
00:58:22,446 --> 00:58:23,739
-No.
-No?

893
00:58:24,991 --> 00:58:26,826
How are you so handsome?

894
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:29,620
-You have great skin as well.
-Thank you.

895
00:58:30,788 --> 00:58:34,250
By the way, she may hear us,

896
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,586
so let's speak a bit quietly.

897
00:58:36,669 --> 00:58:39,630
-Okay.
-Got it.

898
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:40,631
Thank you.

899
00:58:42,174 --> 00:58:43,050
Goodness.

900
00:58:43,134 --> 00:58:44,427
Mom.

901
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:54,854
You must've had a lot of work.
You look exhausted.

902
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:58,274
I'm better now.

903
00:58:59,525 --> 00:59:00,943
Did I snore?

904
00:59:03,529 --> 00:59:04,655
You looked for your mom.

905
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:06,699
I was? Really?

906
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,831
It's not even funny.

907
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:17,376
-What do you mean?
-Looking for my mom.

908
00:59:18,502 --> 00:59:19,754
Why would that be funny?

909
00:59:22,173 --> 00:59:24,383
I had meningitis when I was young,

910
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:28,012
and the doctor put me in a shared room.

911
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:32,350
They were all kids,
and they were crying in pain.

912
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:35,853
They all looked for their moms,

913
00:59:36,395 --> 00:59:38,272
and their moms would hold their hands.

914
00:59:38,856 --> 00:59:41,150
I thought everyone just cursed
when they were sick.

915
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:46,405
I learned to do that from them
so I could blend in.

916
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:49,742
Kids point out the smallest differences.

917
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:53,287
My parents had passed away
when I was little,

918
00:59:53,371 --> 00:59:56,624
so I had no time to learn those things.

919
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,710
You know what it's like.

920
01:00:00,419 --> 01:00:03,214
You feel safe only when you're
a part of a group as a kid.

921
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:06,968
And, as an adult, you live in fear
of being ostracized.

922
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,261
I know that's not the case for you.

923
01:00:10,763 --> 01:00:13,432
What are you afraid of? Bugs?

924
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:18,562
I wasn't afraid of anything,
but now, I'm about to be.

925
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:22,984
There are a lot of bugs here at night.

926
01:00:27,363 --> 01:00:29,031
Goodness.

927
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:33,369
Is this mold?

928
01:00:33,452 --> 01:00:36,288
Your room is next door.
There are no windows there.

929
01:00:36,372 --> 01:00:38,874
You'll definitely catch something
if you stay here.

930
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,960
Then the bathroom
is going to freak you out.

931
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:43,629
Let me get changed first.

932
01:00:43,713 --> 01:00:46,048
Then we can introduce you
to the staff next door.

933
01:00:46,132 --> 01:00:48,843
Wait. The doctor said you should
keep that on.

934
01:00:48,926 --> 01:00:50,177
-You shouldn't--
-I'm okay.

935
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:52,221
I don't want them to worry.

936
01:00:52,304 --> 01:00:55,141
Let me get changed in a jiffy. Hold on.

937
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:56,267
Okay.

938
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:02,940
There's a cockroach. Oh, dear.

939
01:01:11,323 --> 01:01:13,284
Are you feeling any better?

940
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,119
Today was your day off.

941
01:01:15,202 --> 01:01:17,329
Hello. You took care of her well.

942
01:01:17,413 --> 01:01:20,458
He's the driver. He came today.

943
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,293
These are the producers.

944
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:23,836
Hello, my name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

945
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:26,047
Hello.

946
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,134
I'm Jeong Hui-jin.
We're a bit busy right now.

947
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:32,178
Mi-joo, are you going to join us?

948
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:34,221
Yes, I should.

949
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:37,141
Could you wait a minute?
Make yourself at home.

950
01:01:37,224 --> 01:01:38,350
Seon-gyeom.

951
01:01:39,018 --> 01:01:43,856
The staff who will arrange your vehicle
and accommodation are all here.

952
01:01:43,939 --> 01:01:46,275
It may be boring,
but could you wait for a minute?

953
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:48,694
You can sit there.

954
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:56,202
Do you think we could move here?

955
01:01:57,411 --> 01:01:59,705
We're pretty much set for tomorrow.

956
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:02,249
The problem is the day after.

957
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,294
I'm certain we can't film everything
in 12 hours.

958
01:02:05,377 --> 01:02:07,880
If we need to film extra,
we'll have to eat too.

959
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:09,215
And there's the overtime pay.

960
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:11,842
The director said he had to film
a certain scene then.

961
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:13,094
He said he must.

962
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:16,514
He said it's the most traditionally
Korean scene. That American prick.

963
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,184
Let's set aside money for the food.

964
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:24,563
Total 300,000 won for food.

965
01:02:24,647 --> 01:02:25,731
I'll order burgers.

966
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:27,358
All set for tomorrow.

967
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:30,236
We've planned for the day after too,
so let's end here.

968
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,612
-Okay.
-Okay.

969
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:33,489
Gosh, I'm so tired.

970
01:02:34,698 --> 01:02:36,575
How's your constipation?

971
01:02:38,327 --> 01:02:40,162
I haven't gone in three weeks.

972
01:02:40,246 --> 01:02:43,332
Look at the state of this place.
It's impossible to go.

973
01:02:43,415 --> 01:02:44,792
Here you are.

974
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,837
Would you like some coffee?

975
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,672
You were drinking that.

976
01:02:50,464 --> 01:02:52,258
Mi-joo showed you to your room, right?

977
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:53,509
Yes.

978
01:02:54,343 --> 01:02:57,513
I was wondering if I could move elsewhere.

979
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:02,351
I see. It's a bit shabby here, isn't it?

980
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:05,521
We'd love to as well.

981
01:03:06,397 --> 01:03:09,358
I was searching and found
a decent hotel nearby

982
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:12,153
although it's not five stars.

983
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:15,322
Only the actors and major staff members
are staying there.

984
01:03:16,323 --> 01:03:20,119
The Association hasn't
confirmed our budget yet

985
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:22,079
so we have to save up.

986
01:03:22,163 --> 01:03:25,958
And the best way to cut down on costs
is the staff's accommodation and meals.

987
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,423
Would it be okay
if I were to help you move?

988
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:34,675
Help who?

989
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:36,343
All of you.

990
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:40,389
-What?
-What?

991
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:00,868
Yes?

992
01:04:00,951 --> 01:04:03,871
<i>The clean blanket is mine,</i>

993
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,123
<i>not the motel's.</i>

994
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:10,294
Oh, this? I'll take it with me.

995
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:21,597
It's so easy to tell

996
01:04:23,474 --> 01:04:25,559
that this is hers.

997
01:05:28,956 --> 01:05:30,207
Mom.

998
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,381
What?

999
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:02,948
Ki Seon-gyeom.

1000
01:06:06,035 --> 01:06:08,162
-Mom.
-Ki Seon-gyeom.

1001
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:12,791
Call out to someone
who can be here for you from now on

1002
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:16,378
whenever you're sick or struggling.

1003
01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:26,263
Ki Seon-gyeom.

1004
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:33,687
Ki Seon…

1005
01:06:38,067 --> 01:06:39,860
Why is your name so hard to pronounce?

1006
01:06:49,411 --> 01:06:50,788
I called your name.

1007
01:06:57,711 --> 01:06:59,129
You need to hold my hand.

1008
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:47,161
Subtitle translation by: Ja-won Lee

1009
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:07,656
What if they kidnapped you
and put you on a fishing boat?

1010
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:09,783
I heard you were here.

1011
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:11,869
<i>But why am I so worried?</i>

1012
01:08:11,952 --> 01:08:14,163
I'm a grown man. You don't need to worry.

1013
01:08:14,246 --> 01:08:15,247
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1014
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,415
I'm part-timing as a driver.

1015
01:08:16,498 --> 01:08:18,208
Just come back to being an athlete.

1016
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:20,002
<i>Why are you throwing away
Seon-gyeom's photo?</i>

1017
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:21,962
I'm just making room for something else.

1018
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:23,964
Fuck you too, you punk.

1019
01:08:24,047 --> 01:08:25,007
What?

1020
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,593
-Fuck you!
-Ms. Oh! Are you crazy?

1021
01:08:27,676 --> 01:08:29,011
He started it!

1022
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:30,762
<i>Just let me drink myself to death.</i>

1023
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:31,889
What?

1024
01:08:32,723 --> 01:08:34,975
<i>Did you ever have someone find
something that you hid in your painting?</i>

1025
01:08:35,058 --> 01:08:37,853
-Am I cute?
<i>-Was Ms. Seo your Rapunzel?</i>

1026
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:39,271
<i>-Then what does that make you?</i>
-Lee Yeong-hwa.

1027
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:41,231
Should I just go back to Seoul today?

1028
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:44,860
<i>I've been doing
that thing you asked me to.</i>

1029
01:08:44,943 --> 01:08:46,612
You asked me to like you.
