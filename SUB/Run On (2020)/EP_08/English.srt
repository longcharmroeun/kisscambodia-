1
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,764
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,891
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,437
Aren't you coming?

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,359
I'm really good at finding my place.

5
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,403
Especially since I've been here
countless times.

6
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,243
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

7
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,847
Did they just ignore what I said?

8
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,851
Calm down, Mr. Assemblyman.
There are many people here.

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,063
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

10
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,359
What made you give money
to that interpreter?

11
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,570
It looks like you've been shooting
a soap opera behind my back.

12
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,614
I should look into a few things

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,283
before things really turn
into a daytime soap.

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,868
Look into what?

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,620
Like how to splash her with water?

16
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,207
Let's go.

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,966
He's your father,
and it's regarding your family,

18
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,927
so I don't want to say
anything unnecessary.

19
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,763
But why do I always
have to see you like this?

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,766
I don't really know the right way
to pity someone.

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,728
But you should care for yourself
before you care for others.

22
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,942
And what was that earlier?
A natural encounter with Ms. Seo?

23
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,987
I thought you came here to watch a movie
and drink with me.

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,531
If I came here to meet Dan-ah,

25
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,741
I wouldn't have kept talking to you.

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,035
You and your excuses.

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,581
I doubt you even know
what natural encounter means.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,378
Things just got worse.

29
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,675
EPISODE 8

30
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,138
My goodness.

31
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,523
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,818
Where's Ms. Seo?

33
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,320
She's probably at home.

34
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,865
That seat is taken.

35
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,575
He gave me his ticket.

36
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,910
Why is Ms. Seo at home?

37
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,663
Because she gave me her ticket.

38
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,336
I can't believe this.
I worked so hard to look nice today.

39
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,007
Do you want some?

40
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,342
No, thank you.

41
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,972
But why won't you give me
Ms. Seo's number?

42
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,390
She said it's okay.

43
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,517
Because I feel a bit uneasy.

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,727
What makes you feel uneasy? Me?

45
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,480
Me?

46
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,773
Can't we just…

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,734
The movie is starting.

48
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,046
I think I kind of understand why
you think movie theaters feel safe.

49
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,841
Will you be quiet? The movie just started.

50
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,719
Sorry.

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,891
Your voice was kind of loud.

52
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,032
Seon-gyeom!

53
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,828
Hey, Mi-joo. Just a second.

54
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,794
Are you kidding me?
You said it's right next to her.

55
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,838
But why did Mr. Jeong show up instead?

56
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,174
I guess she didn't come.

57
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,968
Is that why you cried?

58
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,720
No, the movie was touching.

59
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,181
I cry easily. I'm an emotional guy.

60
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,769
You know each other?
When did you become so close?

61
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,772
I guess you two are also acquainted.

62
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,317
Did you get home safely?
I woke up, and you weren't there.

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,152
I guess you did, seeing you're here.

64
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,948
Does that mean you spent the night at…

65
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,368
Why didn't you tell me?

66
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,788
It's been a while, so I thought
you would have forgotten about him.

67
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,249
That's not for you to decide.

68
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,667
Gosh, I had no idea.

69
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,377
I let my imagination run wild.

70
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,716
I guess I'll get going then.

71
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,885
-It's not like we're going to drink.
-Bye then.

72
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,971
It's sad not to drink
after watching a movie.

73
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,141
Let's go drink. I told you
I wanted to drink after the movie.

74
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,937
Right? It'd be a pity to just go home.
Why don't we all go for a drink?

75
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,021
The three of us?

76
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,774
But weren't you two on a date?

77
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,235
Just leave if you know.

78
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,320
Did something urgent come up?
You should go then.

79
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,572
You leave.

80
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,158
I can't leave.

81
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,161
-Then should I leave?
-No. You can't leave either.

82
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,913
Okay, that's enough.
Let's all go for some drinks.

83
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,884
Rather than focusing on the main lead,

84
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,054
I focused more on the customer in that bar

85
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,682
who was searching for happiness
in chance and a glass of alcohol.

86
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,601
"How is he feeling?

87
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,394
What is he drinking?

88
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,522
Why is he sitting in that corner
looking all sad and gloomy?"

89
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,982
That was my approach.

90
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,361
Remember when Choi Tae-ri blows a whistle
when the camera zooms in on the male lead?

91
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,655
I couldn't stop myself from crying.

92
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,782
I think I might cry again.

93
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,744
They showed the ending first
and saved the climax for later.

94
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,995
I see.

95
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,873
But that scene…
The sound of that whistle was so sad.

96
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,501
I totally agree. It was so sad.

97
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,836
Do you think we felt that way

98
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,714
because we're conditioned to think it is?

99
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,716
Or because it just is?

100
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,097
It's interesting how whistles set
a different mood depending on the context.

101
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,934
It changes depending on
the kind of situation you're in.

102
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,770
When I paint,
I put on movies I've already watched.

103
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,771
Mostly black-and-white.

104
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,272
You must like classic movies.

105
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,651
They are simple,
so they don't distract you that much.

106
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,404
Do you do that
so you don't lose focus when working?

107
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,241
And you can also notice things
that you've missed before.

108
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,576
Like how it feels different
when you watch movies from your childhood?

109
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,911
-Yes, exactly.
-Exactly.

110
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,454
-Right?
-You're the best.

111
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,790
You seem to know very well.

112
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,418
By the way, I've seen this film.

113
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,588
We did too.

114
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,968
No, I mean, I watched it a long time ago.
I watched it two times.

115
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,012
I also watched it several times already.

116
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh, I see.

117
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,767
-My gosh.
-Here you go again.

118
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,477
Where did you watch it?

119
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,979
At the film festival.

120
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,522
What? You were there?

121
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,940
Yes.

122
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,608
-I'll take a bottle of soju.
-Sure.

123
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,693
Just a second.

124
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,656
-What are you doing?
-Don't you know what this is?

125
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,824
-What?
-Hey.

126
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,202
-It's that thing.
-What?

127
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,579
It's that thing, right?

128
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,580
No, it's not.

129
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,210
Mi-joo, I recently attended a film class
called "Three Acts and Five Seconds,"

130
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,005
and the movie was quite different
from what I learned in class.

131
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,924
That class sounds so familiar.

132
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,718
Do you go to Myeongin University?

133
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,303
Was it taught by Professor Hwang?

134
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,847
Yes, he came to our school
to teach that class.

135
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,348
I don't go to Myeongin University.

136
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,728
He still teaches that class?
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of it.

137
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,025
By the way,

138
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,821
why would I have a natural encounter
with Dan-ah?

139
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,906
A natural encounter with Ms. Seo? Why?

140
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,575
Why are you so upset?

141
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,955
I would love to be in a natural encounter
with Ms. Seo.

142
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,584
Seon-gyeom, you know her number, right?

143
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,210
Yes.

144
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,920
Tell me.

145
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,965
He can't tell you her number
without her permission.

146
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,800
I got her permission.

147
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,388
If you don't believe me, call her and ask.

148
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,224
Why would he call her and ask?

149
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
Then what should I do?

150
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,477
Why are you asking me?

151
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,561
My gosh.

152
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,690
Wait. I can actually prove it.

153
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,026
Where should we go?

154
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,822
-"Where"?
-Didn't you bring a car to go for a drive?

155
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,991
With a kid like you? In your dreams.

156
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,036
Why would you say that?
That kind of hurts.

157
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,956
-What?
-Can you drop me off on your way?

158
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,750
-Where do you think I'm going?
-Where are you going?

159
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,001
Definitely not where you're going.

160
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,795
-Where do you think that is?
-I don't care.

161
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,006
Mr. Jeong won't give me your number.

162
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,216
What if he never does?

163
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,387
Do everything you can.

164
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,596
Did you just tell me

165
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,808
to do everything I can?

166
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,188
Here. I've done it.

167
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
RECORDING

168
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:38,322
I told him he could have my number.
Are you happy now?

169
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,865
Did you hear that?

170
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,242
You heard her voice, right?

171
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,703
You're being creepy.
Why don't you ask her yourself?

172
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,746
She'll never tell me.

173
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,081
She hasn't memorized it.

174
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,959
She's never memorized her number before.

175
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,210
What a strange woman.

176
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,588
Can I also have your numbers too?

177
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,632
We're neighbors. Maybe not you.

178
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,803
That's more of a reason to tell me.
We won't be able to run into each other.

179
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,555
We can text each other and meet up.

180
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,265
-You know I love you, right?
-No.

181
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,145
Come on. Hurry.
You guys need to save my number too.

182
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,855
I'll send you guys my number.

183
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,108
Here.

184
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,612
RAPUNZEL

185
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,243
What? Why is there no profile photo?

186
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,703
How can I tell it's her?

187
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,163
It's her number.

188
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,791
Why would I lie to you about her number?

189
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,918
What an interesting person.

190
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,753
What? You don't have one either?

191
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,380
Neither do you, Mi-joo.

192
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,216
Is this a trend?

193
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,844
I don't know if it's a trend.

194
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,929
I never had one from the start.

195
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,431
You too?

196
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,933
I don't want to be considered
the same type.

197
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,977
It hasn't been that long
since I deleted it.

198
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,772
This is for self PR.
Why would you leave it empty?

199
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,026
On purpose.
It used to be a vacation photo.

200
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,194
But people kept nitpicking.

201
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,447
Some people didn't seem to like
that I travel abroad.

202
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,408
And I hate how I get weird texts
after someone sees my face.

203
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,368
What's your profile picture?

204
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,870
Mine? Just a second.

205
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,749
This. It's what I'm working on.

206
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,960
What are you painting?

207
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,420
I'll know when I'm done.

208
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,255
I need to finish it first.

209
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:24,386
A CLOUDY SKY TURNS CLEAR
AFTER A RAINFALL

210
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,495
I wanted to read it once more
to understand it properly.

211
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,579
Who is this?

212
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,832
"Lee Yeong-hwa"?

213
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,127
This is my number.
You can ghost me, but at least save it.

214
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,797
You should save it
to know who you're ghosting.

215
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,800
He sounds familiarly arrogant.
I think I know him.

216
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,011
LEE YEONG-HWA

217
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,767
Oh, that kid?

218
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,065
Do people really think a couple of photos
can grab people's attention?

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,404
You're giving him attention
by asking me that right now.

220
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,825
Do you sign artists at your agency now?

221
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,618
He's still in college.

222
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,622
Is he trying to show off
how talented he is or what?

223
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,584
That kind of profile picture
is pretty average.

224
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,043
He's a college student.

225
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
No one around me does this kind of stuff.

226
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,092
-Should I keep it for you?
-Yes.

227
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,887
If they're going to exploit
people's anxieties for money,

228
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,221
couldn't they make it fun?

229
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,557
How can it be

230
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,475
when it's targeting your anxiety?

231
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,313
Don't rich people have their own studies?

232
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,983
It's embarrassing to keep it in my study.

233
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,360
I don't want people to know
that I get anxious.

234
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,114
See you.

235
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,332
YOU'VE DONE WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH

236
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,213
How do you feel?

237
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,634
What a straightforward question.

238
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,886
I'm not sure.

239
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,431
I hope you feel better soon.

240
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,101
How will you be getting to the film site?

241
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,353
By train.

242
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,355
What are you taking to the train station?

243
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,689
A cab.

244
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,900
My car is all fixed.

245
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,693
Congratulations.

246
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,960
-Did you cure your hangover?
-No, I still have it.

247
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,629
Are you working?

248
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,506
Yes, I couldn't focus at home.

249
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,384
It's all in English.
Are you good at English?

250
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,843
Of course. It's my major.

251
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,845
That doesn't always mean
you're good at it.

252
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,139
I wouldn't know. I was always good.

253
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,557
The same goes for me.

254
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,352
If anyone overhears us,
they'd think we're annoying.

255
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,938
Did you skip class
because of your hangover?

256
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,525
I thought about doing that,
but I just went since I paid tuition.

257
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,776
I'm free for three hours.

258
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,611
What a messed up schedule.

259
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,739
I'm not a freshman,
but I still get nervous

260
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,075
when it's time to apply for classes.
It's like a battlefield.

261
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,036
Graduating didn't make things any better.
I'm still in debt.

262
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,454
-Your school loans?
-Yes.

263
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,957
Would I have paid it off
once I reach your age?

264
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm still in debt.

265
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,836
If I cut back on work,

266
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,213
my bank account goes empty
once I pay my mortgage,

267
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,049
and that's when I find work
to make more money.

268
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,427
Gosh, that sounds so miserable.

269
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,303
ARE YOU A CELEBRITY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW TAE-WOONG?

270
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,183
-My gosh. Mi-joo, can I ask you something?
-Yes.

271
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,769
I'm good at everything else but English.

272
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,521
Look. If you look here…

273
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,568
I think she's threatening to kill me.
What does it exactly mean?

274
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,284
She's asking how you know Tae-woong.
She's so curious that it's killing her.

275
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,203
Why won't he unfollow me?
Is he doing this on purpose?

276
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,788
The only Tae-woong I know
is Seo Tae-woong.

277
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,999
Are you also an Alphabet?

278
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,293
What? I'm talking about Slam Dunk.

279
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,629
Gosh, this reminds me of the old days.
I used to love Jeong Dae-man.

280
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,799
-What about you?
-Me? I liked Kang Baek-ho.

281
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,886
I don't want my hair like that.

282
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,846
Make mine look natural.

283
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,640
And how do you think that makes me feel?

284
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,894
I know you have a schedule,
but what about you Tae-woong?

285
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,272
Do you have a date
with the person you're following?

286
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,567
People think you have a secret girlfriend.

287
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,530
Tae-woong, you have a girlfriend?

288
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,867
I have tons of girlfriends.

289
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,119
My fans are my girlfriends.

290
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,621
Another selfie?

291
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,581
You're pretty much addicted.

292
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,750
How can I not get addicted?

293
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,168
Every time I upload a photo,

294
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,588
tens of thousands of people like it.

295
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,175
How are the preparations
for Eun-bi's tournament coming along?

296
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,720
We sent her the outfit and portfolio,
and she's still checking.

297
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,430
We'll receive a feedback soon.

298
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,516
Director Dong.

299
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,144
Eun-bi is finally going to play golf
wearing our outfit

300
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,063
in front of the entire world.

301
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,023
Gosh, I'm so excited.

302
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,903
Did you have to cancel the deal
with Seon-gyeom?

303
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,490
Was it your plan to discard him
once Eun-bi joined the agency?

304
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,325
I know you're fond of him.

305
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,369
The contract was nearing termination

306
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,247
and I figured he won't renew it.
That's why I did it first.

307
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,873
I'm not joking around.

308
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,799
I don't want an athlete
who committed assault.

309
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
It's true that I'm fond of him,

310
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,932
but that never trumps what's important.

311
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,725
My agency matters more to me.

312
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,731
What's so great about an agency
who discards their athletes?

313
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,861
You just let go of him
so you could provide more for Eun-bi.

314
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,865
Wouldn't it be better for our image
to help him get back on his feet?

315
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,867
I think Seon-gyeom will do great.

316
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,369
-You have a point.
-Then why don't you--

317
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,580
I don't want a former athlete
to be an agent.

318
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,582
He'll care for them better than anyone.

319
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,541
That's exactly why.

320
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:33,005
I feel like he'll only focus
on the athletes and nothing else.

321
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,676
You know
I'm in charge of personnel, right?

322
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,512
We're two years in
and should have a manager for athletes.

323
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,932
But I like working with those
who put my priorities above all else.

324
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,894
What would you have done
if you were in his shoes?

325
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,439
What if Mr. Jeong were assaulting me
behind your back?

326
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,445
I doubt he's the one
who'd be doing the hitting.

327
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,532
Is that a compliment or what?

328
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm home. I'll go get changed.
I was at the gym.

329
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,468
Dan-ah, I heard you hit Myeong-min

330
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,304
in front of the employees.

331
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,972
You tattled again?

332
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,182
Dumb and childish.

333
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,851
I didn't say anything.
It wasn't just us there.

334
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,145
Others have eyes and ears too, you know.

335
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,105
Couldn't you have done it discreetly?

336
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,941
-You hurt his pride.
-Father!

337
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,193
Can I kill him if done discreetly?

338
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,319
Hey!

339
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,989
-Of course not.
-He damaged what's mine first.

340
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,492
-Treat me as your older brother.
-I do in public.

341
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,496
Is that brain of yours broken?

342
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,374
Have you forgotten
I was born ten months prior?

343
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,794
It still sickens me to know
that he forged your birth certificate--

344
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,462
-That's enough.
-Be grateful

345
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,757
that I go along with the lie
when we're in public.

346
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,801
Being dumb is no excuse to be an ingrate.

347
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:05,097
If only you each shared
your good qualities.

348
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,351
We might have if we had the same mother.

349
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,019
Unlike me, they're all bastards.

350
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,313
You might not agree,

351
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,524
but you're all equally precious to me.

352
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,694
If you mean that,
prove it with your actions.

353
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,195
I'd love to see that it's true.

354
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,833
Is your second wife setting the table
for your first wife's memorial service?

355
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,835
This is making me sick.

356
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,171
Who are you to shit over
my mom's generosity?

357
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,631
I'm not the one doing the shitting.

358
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,049
Dan-ah,

359
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,468
it's time you let go
of your hatred against her.

360
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,561
Why would I hate her?

361
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,855
I'm not interested enough
to have such feelings.

362
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,482
Seo Dan-ah,
don't talk like that to the chairman--

363
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,900
Seo Myeong-min!

364
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,862
Do you know why I haven't exposed you?

365
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,324
It's for the good of the company
and the CEO.

366
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,076
You two couldn't care less
about the company image.

367
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,704
Only I've been working my ass off
to keep it clean.

368
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,039
It's all my fault, I guess.

369
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,582
I should just die.

370
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,208
Please don't say things like that.

371
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,044
Stop playing the victim here.

372
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,756
And be done with trying
to set me up with a suitor.

373
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,925
These days, being gay isn't a big deal.

374
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,636
Marriage will set you straight.

375
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,772
I won't bother responding to that
since I don't even know where to begin.

376
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,691
I guess it all comes with
being an educated woman.

377
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,860
I'll find an adequate suitor,

378
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,696
so clear your schedule for the wedding.

379
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,989
I'll keep it short.

380
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,451
You'll be in breathtaking outfits
and vow your endless love.

381
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,288
Could it be any more romantic?

382
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,999
I said I didn't want to waste my time
on marriage yet.

383
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,960
Isn't it enough
that you married three times

384
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,754
and had your son married?

385
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,214
You see…

386
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,803
I learned something
on Myeong-min's wedding day.

387
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,766
"I'm glad to have a daughter."

388
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,353
Being able to walk one down the aisle
is crucial to a father.

389
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:22,359
So escorting you down the aisle
with your hand in mine…

390
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,361
is all I need.

391
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,159
I can't stay here anymore.

392
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,873
Dan-ah, where are you going?

393
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,166
Dan-ah!

394
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,626
My youngest is here.

395
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,214
How much of it did you hear?

396
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,259
Myeong-min,
are you seriously talking to me?

397
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,053
What have I said about
speaking casually to me?

398
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,471
-You.
-Yes?

399
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,973
You're in Korea now.

400
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,142
Where are your manners?

401
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,812
I will. I will, but…

402
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,732
Just a second though.
Father, let me be excused.

403
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,784
Dan-ah. Where are you off to?

404
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:14,995
Dan-ah!

405
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,581
Dan-ah.

406
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,750
Your mother's memorial service is today,

407
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,836
so I bought some rice cakes.

408
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,590
That must be how it's done in America.
Why not just crawl back there?

409
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,218
I will if that's what you want.

410
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,055
What about your agency and fans then?
Stop being such an idiot.

411
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,437
Why do you do this when I
make it clear that I don't like you?

412
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,858
Because you at least hate me.

413
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,529
It's better than being treated
as if I'm invisible.

414
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,948
It also takes effort

415
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,451
to hate someone.

416
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,998
You've got to be kidding me.

417
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,377
What did I ever do that was so wrong?

418
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,755
That we have the same dad?

419
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,591
That we don't have the same mom?

420
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,303
Or is it because I'm just me?

421
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,680
Why ask when you clearly know the answer?

422
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,682
It's not like

423
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,062
I can choose my parents.

424
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,189
Exactly.

425
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,652
Why did you have to be born
into this family?

426
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,953
Dan-ah.

427
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
Dan-ah!

428
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,923
I LOVE YOU TAE-WOONG

429
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,219
What's the point of living?

430
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,355
Damn it.

431
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,806
Your painting shines even in the darkness.

432
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,739
Make yourself at home

433
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,034
and feel free
to use anything in the house.

434
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,454
Take this with you.
I made enough for you both.

435
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,624
Please don't skip breakfast.

436
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,295
Wow. Prepped meals?
This will last us two days.

437
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,881
I made sure they'd be easy to eat
even in the car.

438
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,801
We'll get going then.

439
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,927
Come on, we'll be late.

440
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,811
Is she still pretending to be pissed off?

441
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,814
I'd be glad if she was only pretending.

442
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,819
We'll enjoy this. Thank you.

443
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,073
Enjoy it together.

444
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,115
Sure.

445
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,545
Sorry about that.
Eun-bi's meeting was delayed…

446
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,301
You don't have to stop on my accord.

447
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,719
Regarding what?

448
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,429
My sister.

449
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,224
You can talk about her in front of me.

450
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,020
Also, my fingerprint
doesn't seem to be registered

451
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,022
for the front gate.

452
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,316
It wasn't me. Dan-ah delisted you.

453
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,449
Don't tell me that's why you're here.

454
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,742
Of course not.

455
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,036
Here you go.

456
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,583
I wanted to thank you
for giving me Coach Bang's number.

457
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,252
I was able to meet her.

458
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,214
From what I hear,
she's been spotted with a certain team.

459
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,215
Was that your doing?

460
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,927
She never said anything to me,
but I guess that's what she's up to.

461
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,972
And you made her get back out there.

462
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,770
It wasn't my doing.

463
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,897
This was her choice.

464
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,192
-What a waste.
-Sorry?

465
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,572
There's a natural gift you have,
but I bet you don't know what it is.

466
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,700
You motivate people.

467
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,327
I honestly don't.

468
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,830
It's never your intention, but it works.

469
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,623
That's why it's a natural gift.

470
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,670
Director Dong, the report you handed in…

471
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,632
Seon-gyeom. Fate must have
brought us together.

472
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,217
Will you marry me?

473
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,510
I know you're my boss--

474
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,054
I'm sick and tired of these blind dates.

475
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,639
You liked me once, right?

476
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,391
Let's get married. I'll be good.

477
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,145
I've never liked you,
so why do you keep saying that?

478
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,897
-Didn't you like me?
-No.

479
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,025
Why haven't you told me earlier?

480
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,819
You mislead me,
so make up for it with marriage.

481
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,362
How's that logical?

482
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,364
I'm dead serious, so think about it.

483
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:48,661
Here. How about we reduce the front
and elongate the back?

484
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,999
Sometimes, I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

485
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,959
Think of how I must feel.

486
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,587
I said it's not a joke.

487
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,808
-The smell of the sea.
-Gosh.

488
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,228
How peaceful and calm.

489
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,522
What?

490
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,945
It's Hui-jin.

491
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,571
Hey.

492
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,548
Let me tell you who's who.

493
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,008
That's James, the leading actor.

494
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,052
I hear he's part Korean.

495
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,096
Next to him is
the director of photography.

496
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,640
He seems somewhat racist,

497
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,475
but he's still a gentleman.

498
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,185
Weird.

499
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,729
Up there is the movie director.

500
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,106
He's a Korean-American.

501
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,650
He speaks Korean a little,
so it'll make your job easier.

502
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,820
And the lady with red lipstick
sipping her coffee

503
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,281
is the Korean producer Yeom Gang-sun.

504
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,574
She hates her Korean name,

505
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,159
so make sure you call her Julie.

506
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,538
-She still comes to movie sets?
-Do you know her?

507
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,623
She's infamous for being a know-it-all.

508
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,210
She butts in all the time
while people translate

509
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,712
even though she's not that fluent.

510
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,716
I see. Doesn't she have
her own translator?

511
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,384
Of course. Look right next to her.

512
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,886
She slacks off though.

513
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,472
A translator should correct people
when there's any miscommunication,

514
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
but not her.

515
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,436
We wasted a lot of our time because
Ms. Yeom didn't have the facts right.

516
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,687
Oh, dear.

517
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,189
We'll move after this scene,

518
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,400
so you can say hello then and get working.

519
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,981
We'll be filming in five.
Please get ready.

520
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,584
What do track and field athletes do
after they retire?

521
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,920
After retirement,

522
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,047
here I am doing laundry.

523
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,342
Is there anything you want to do?

524
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,606
Ms. Oh, can you get the light?

525
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,149
Sure thing.

526
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,969
What the hell?

527
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,887
The door won't budge.

528
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,976
Come in.

529
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,114
I've slept in all kinds of places,
but this is on a whole new level.

530
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,242
It's very humbling.

531
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,911
I saw a supermarket on my way here.

532
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,913
Should I buy us new covers?

533
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,457
I'm sure it's closed by now.

534
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,252
Anyway, I brought a blanket from home,
so let's sleep under that.

535
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,922
Also, we'll sleep on these towels.

536
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,549
They should be clean at least.

537
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,343
Shouldn't we leave a few
to shower tomorrow?

538
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,096
I brought two from home,
so we'll use those.

539
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:22,018
We were given the corner suite though.
It's tiny but there's even a window.

540
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,978
It has all the essentials.

541
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,695
No wonder Hui-jin's
been constipated for three weeks.

542
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,782
Why does the toilet look so noir-esque?

543
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,549
I wonder if he's doing all right.

544
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,594
OCTOBER 17, SATURDAY

545
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,946
What the…

546
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,492
-Unbelievable.
-What is it?

547
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,910
It's nothing. Go to sleep.

548
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,436
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

549
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,401
Could you recommend a movie
that'll put me…

550
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,968
MYEONGBINJANG INN

551
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,144
May!
Why are you sleeping with your eyes open?

552
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,383
-Hello?
-Hi, son. Where are you?

553
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,677
-On the road.
-You must be driving.

554
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,346
What do you say to some coffee?
Your sister's buying.

555
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,890
Where should I meet you?

556
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,018
IT'S KI EUN-BI'S TREAT!

557
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,562
YOOK JI-WOO IS SO LUCKY
TO HAVE KI EUN-BI AS A DAUGHTER

558
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:01,487
Yook Ji-woo is lucky to also have
a son who comes when she asks!

559
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,323
Sorry about that.

560
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,370
I heard you were the first Korean actress
to skin someone.

561
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,290
Right, it was about 30 years ago.

562
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,333
I was young and fresh at the time.

563
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,753
-Is that also the case today?
-No, I sliced up a person instead.

564
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,132
It required some elbow grease
because I had to be slicing constantly.

565
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,635
-Are you playing another killer?
-No, a vegan murderer.

566
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,471
Can I have two coffees,
one with an extra shot?

567
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,640
-Sure thing.
-Ms. Yook. Who is this?

568
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,393
He's my son. Isn't he pretty?

569
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,187
You could be an actor too.
How about a cameo appearance?

570
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,522
Why not?

571
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,983
What do you say? We can slice together.

572
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,743
Your sister was generous enough
to send a coffee truck to the set.

573
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,745
Shouldn't you be just as generous?

574
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,581
Are you broke now that you're unemployed?

575
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,124
Should I give you some money?

576
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,587
Don't most mothers scold their children
for being unemployed?

577
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,923
Do you miss my nagging
now that you're older?

578
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,094
You never criticized my life,

579
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,889
so how could I criticize or meddle
in yours?

580
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,936
I told you to be a good boy

581
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,397
while I was gone for work.

582
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,737
I told you not to bother Eun-bi
since she was busy for a tournament.

583
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,326
I told you to win a medal

584
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,621
to help your dad get elected.

585
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,542
You did everything we asked you to
without complaining.

586
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,045
It was all for your family.

587
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,840
You may be mild-tempered,

588
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,802
but I know you made an effort too.

589
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,935
I thought it was easy to raise kids.

590
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:02,108
I thought they matured with time.

591
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,697
But it turns out, you raised yourself.

592
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,830
Then you took initiative and told us
you wanted to do something.

593
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,916
I was exhilarated.

594
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,840
Every time you want to do something,
I should just support you.

595
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,426
That's all I can do.

596
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,013
Because every time I asked you
to do something,

597
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,685
you did just that.

598
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,483
I know I look a bit gruesome
to be saying this.

599
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,986
You're still just as beautiful.

600
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,030
I've always been beautiful.

601
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,453
Next time, I'll bring a gift.

602
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,123
-With my fan?
-Your fan?

603
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,042
Oh, her?

604
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,004
Treat her well. After all, she's my fan.

605
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,714
I don't know how you two met,

606
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,134
but if she's close enough
to hold your hand, you treat her well.

607
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,804
Why…

608
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:18,559
did you marry Father?

609
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,897
Because I loved him.

610
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,276
Are you two still on good terms?

611
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,780
No.

612
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,034
That's because

613
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,536
we still love each other.

614
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,832
Are you sure you don't want a part?

615
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,794
Who do you take after to be so stubborn?

616
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,714
In that case, I understand.

617
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,592
Yes, I do.

618
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,835
My mom told me to treat her fan well.

619
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,836
Gosh.

620
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,297
What a cutie.

621
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,260
Thank you, Ji-woo.

622
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,845
Treat me well, then.

623
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,935
I've always wondered what people did
in the countryside after sundown.

624
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,478
They drink.

625
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,940
Why did you skip your meal
and keep an eye on that?

626
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,442
Because no one else did.

627
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,777
Keep that up,
and they'll put you in charge.

628
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,031
Someone was bound to do it anyway.

629
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,199
How's budgeting going?

630
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,702
We just keep talking about it.

631
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,245
How's the interpretation going?

632
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,456
I agreed to do it,
but they're not letting me.

633
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,291
They won't give me any time to translate.

634
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,502
That's why our youngest staff
couldn't take it anymore and left.

635
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,715
I see. And you hid that fact from me.

636
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,176
I can totally relate to them right now.

637
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,802
I love you. Cheers.

638
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,596
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

639
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,392
At first, I had no time
to even think about this.

640
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,854
But now, I sometimes wonder
what I'm doing here.

641
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,190
They talk so much.

642
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,693
I'm on edge because I'd be wasting
their time if I made a mistake.

643
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,655
Since time and budget are linked,
I get nervous.

644
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,824
I feel like I need to work at all times.

645
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,622
But for now, it's still fun.
It's manageable.

646
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,291
It was worse back then.

647
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,586
Back then, I didn't get paid
for working overtime.

648
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,923
I thought that was normal.

649
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,385
It's been six or seven years already.
I was ignorant.

650
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,137
They were the ignorant ones.

651
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,056
-Screw working for free.
-That's right.

652
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,642
You're drinking here again.

653
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,977
We're closing, so get going.

654
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,479
I want to go to bed.

655
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,940
This is our first time here, sir.

656
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,067
I know you're saying that to me, sir.

657
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,112
This is a 24-hour convenience store, sir.

658
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,906
Hold on. Where did I keep the salt?

659
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,412
-What? Salt?
-You must have come here every day.

660
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,064
Have you eaten yet?

661
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,278
Yes, I'm eating right now.

662
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,571
I ate too.

663
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,949
They served doenjang soup
with spinach and bulgogi. It was tasty.

664
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,033
You?

665
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,288
I'm having something tasty too.

666
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,458
By the way, why have you called?

667
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,460
You make it feel so awkward.

668
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,296
I know it's awkward for you,
but it's worse for me.

669
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,090
I feel the most awkward.

670
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,634
Two people I'm used to seeing daily
are no longer here.

671
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,888
Have you met Seon-gyeom again?

672
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,639
No, not yet.

673
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,226
I'm not quite ready yet.

674
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,604
Worry about that once you come back here.

675
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,858
He'll just keep waiting
unless you ask to see him first.

676
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,027
He'll always be so dense.

677
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,657
Just do it.

678
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,494
You're much younger.

679
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,914
Being reckless is a privilege at your age.

680
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,501
-It's okay to do that.
-Okay, I will.

681
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,253
Thank you for your concern.

682
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,589
Okay. Bye.

683
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,676
-Mr. Kim Woo-sik?
-Coming.

684
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,942
Scene 35 will be a long take.

685
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,986
James will make a stuntman trip,

686
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,446
grab the hammer, and attack him.

687
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,241
That's when the staff
can squirt the blood.

688
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,578
Then he'll grab the hammer
and go around the house,

689
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,246
and three enemies will be waiting.

690
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,957
He'll then throw the hammer,
hit the enemy in the center,

691
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,710
run to his right, and climb over the wall.

692
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,666
We'll film this scene again.

693
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,251
I know this is hard to interpret.

694
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
Thank you. I'm sorry.

695
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,625
-What is this?
-A soccer ball.

696
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,335
Did you save my number?

697
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,545
I did. I should know who it is
that I'm ghosting.

698
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,839
Gosh, you're so obnoxious.

699
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,009
-Didn't I tell you to stop doing that?
-Why should I?

700
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,470
-What?
-I smile because I'm happy.

701
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,097
Who are you to stop me?

702
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,266
Why didn't you come to the premier?

703
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,311
And why should you and Seon-gyeom
have a natural encounter?

704
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,022
Mind your own business. Why are you here?

705
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,610
To show you my draft,
but I don't want to anymore.

706
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,070
Picky, aren't you?

707
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,864
Show me. Hurry and show me.

708
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,075
I told you it's not that important.

709
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,077
-That's not for you to decide.
-What about you?

710
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,371
-I'm the one who decides.
-I'm the artist.

711
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,793
If you keep acting this way, kid,

712
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,213
you'll seriously pique my curiosity.

713
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,925
And I've never learned how to be patient.
What do you think I'll do?

714
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,720
You'll learn to be patient.

715
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,599
I will see that draft even if it means
I have to lock you up and torture you.

716
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,394
So you'll make time for me?

717
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,647
I just can't get through to you, kid.

718
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,735
I wish you'd stop calling me that.

719
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,028
Then what would I call you, kid?

720
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,159
"Yeong-hwa".

721
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,124
That's so cringy.

722
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,878
If that's difficult, you can also call me
a bastard.

723
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,380
I hope you can cooperate with me on that.

724
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,100
-I'll get going first.
-Sure.

725
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,730
Where are you going?

726
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,232
-What's it to you?
-Are you running there?

727
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,362
What? What is it? Hold on.

728
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,668
So much for a cooperation.

729
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,232
Good work, everyone.

730
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,443
-I'll give the teams their schedules.
-Good work.

731
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,655
-Good work.
-Good work.

732
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,538
What's going on?

733
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,541
Do I have a cold?

734
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,753
I shouldn't get sick.

735
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,777
James had asked for a driver
who couldn't speak English,

736
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,737
so who hired this one?

737
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,657
You did.

738
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,617
Find a replacement at all costs.

739
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,078
Are you discriminating against him
since he's gay?

740
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,830
You even let a staff run away!

741
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,541
Stop slacking off.

742
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,336
My gosh.

743
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,800
Yeom Gang-sun, that bitch.

744
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:04,055
Is this about finding
James' boyfriend's driver?

745
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:04,973
Yes.

746
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,767
James had asked for a driver
who couldn't speak English.

747
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,396
She mistook what he said
and found someone who could.

748
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,648
Then why is she taking it out on you?

749
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,608
Exactly.

750
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,860
We can talk shit later.

751
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,113
One thing for sure is that
his boyfriend is flying in in two days.

752
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,786
Isn't Chan-hui free?
His shoot finished recently.

753
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,247
He'll be having a baby soon, so he can't.

754
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,332
He is?

755
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,668
-No, his wife.
-Right.

756
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,463
Where can we find a driver right now?

757
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,383
You're right.

758
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,470
Do we need someone who doesn't
speak English, can drive,

759
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,554
and is free at the moment?

760
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,599
And be presentable.
He requested that specifically.

761
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,310
He's perfect.

762
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,655
I know you're doing well,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

763
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:07,535
Can you drive here tomorrow?

764
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,623
We should make up.

765
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,419
Drive safe.

766
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,421
I'll text you the address.

767
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,966
Okay.

768
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,676
Bye.

769
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,222
How selfish am I?

770
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,516
I'll be punished for this.

771
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,087
Why isn't she using the blanket?

772
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,422
Was it hot?

773
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,220
Hello? I'm almost there. I'm nearby.

774
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,461
CALLING FOR A TAXI NEARBY

775
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,755
CALLING FOR A TAXI
AT A 2 MINUTE DISTANCE

776
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,049
CALLING FOR A TAXI
AT A 10 MINUTE DISTANCE

777
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,176
CALLING FOR A TAXI
AT A 30 MINUTE DISTANCE

778
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,677
THERE ARE NO TAXIS NEARBY

779
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,641
The emergency center…

780
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,313
Damn it. I don't think I saw
any large hospitals nearby.

781
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,402
It feels like I'm dying.

782
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,750
May, I'm…

783
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,961
headed to a nearby hospital.

784
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,924
If anything happens,
please fill in for me.

785
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,561
You have a fever.

786
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,524
You've just overworked yourself,
so don't worry too much.

787
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,735
-Okay.
-Do you do strenuous work?

788
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,904
I heard they're filming a movie
around here.

789
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,907
Did you work outdoors all day?

790
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,077
We are filming a movie but…

791
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,455
We need to give you an IV drip
and lower your body temperature.

792
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,916
Don't overwork yourself
for the time being.

793
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,169
Okay.

794
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,105
Miss, are you okay?

795
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,273
What are you sick with?

796
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,444
-Pardon?
-Your face is burning red.

797
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,945
Do you have a fever?

798
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,197
I…

799
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,410
I'm sorry,
but my head is pounding too much.

800
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,497
Here, have a tangerine.

801
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,374
You need to eat to get better.

802
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,963
Does she not like tangerines?

803
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,256
I guess so.

804
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,844
You know, is Jang-seob getting married?

805
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,888
Why did I have to get sick?

806
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,222
He has no girlfriend.

807
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,602
Why do you keep drawing the curtain?

808
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,811
It's me, Ms. Oh.

809
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,565
Are you okay?

810
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,193
How did you know I'd be here?

811
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,362
May told me to take care of matters
at the hospital.

812
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,324
Did you even know I was sick?

813
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,995
Are you crying? Are you in a lot of pain?

814
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,165
Seeing you here gives me comfort.

815
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,458
I'm in so much pain.

816
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,422
What would you like me to do?

817
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,349
-They keep talking to me.
-Okay.

818
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,727
They keep drawing the curtain
when I need to sleep.

819
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,732
Those women?

820
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,111
One minute.

821
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,701
Where are you from?

822
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,787
I'm from Seoul.

823
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,373
Are you that sick lady's husband?

824
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,416
-No.
-No?

825
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,503
How are you so handsome?

826
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,297
-You have great skin as well.
-Thank you.

827
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,927
By the way, she may hear us,

828
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,263
so let's speak a bit quietly.

829
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,307
-Okay.
-Got it.

830
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,308
Thank you.

831
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,727
Goodness.

832
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,104
Mom.

833
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,531
You must've had a lot of work.
You look exhausted.

834
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,951
I'm better now.

835
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,620
Did I snore?

836
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,332
You looked for your mom.

837
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,376
I was? Really?

838
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,508
It's not even funny.

839
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,053
-What do you mean?
-Looking for my mom.

840
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,431
Why would that be funny?

841
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,060
I had meningitis when I was young,

842
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,689
and the doctor put me in a shared room.

843
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,027
They were all kids,
and they were crying in pain.

844
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,530
They all looked for their moms,

845
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,949
and their moms would hold their hands.

846
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,827
I thought everyone just cursed
when they were sick.

847
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,082
I learned to do that from them
so I could blend in.

848
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,419
Kids point out the smallest differences.

849
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,964
My parents had passed away
when I was little,

850
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,301
so I had no time to learn those things.

851
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,387
You know what it's like.

852
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,891
You feel safe only when you're
a part of a group as a kid.

853
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,645
And, as an adult, you live in fear
of being ostracized.

854
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,938
I know that's not the case for you.

855
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,109
What are you afraid of? Bugs?

856
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,239
I wasn't afraid of anything,
but now, I'm about to be.

857
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,661
There are a lot of bugs here at night.

858
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,708
Goodness.

859
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,046
Is this mold?

860
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,965
Your room is next door.
There are no windows there.

861
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,551
You'll definitely catch something
if you stay here.

862
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,637
Then the bathroom
is going to freak you out.

863
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,306
Let me get changed first.

864
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,725
Then we can introduce you
to the staff next door.

865
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,520
Wait. The doctor said you should
keep that on.

866
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,854
-You shouldn't--
-I'm okay.

867
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,898
I don't want them to worry.

868
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,818
Let me get changed in a jiffy. Hold on.

869
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:37,944
Okay.

870
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,617
There's a cockroach. Oh, dear.

871
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,961
Are you feeling any better?

872
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,796
Today was your day off.

873
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,006
Hello. You took care of her well.

874
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,135
He's the driver. He came today.

875
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,970
These are the producers.

876
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,513
Hello, my name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

877
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,724
Hello.

878
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,811
I'm Jeong Hui-jin.
We're a bit busy right now.

879
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,855
Mi-joo, are you going to join us?

880
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,898
Yes, I should.

881
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,818
Could you wait a minute?
Make yourself at home.

882
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,027
Seon-gyeom.

883
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:25,533
The staff who will arrange your vehicle
and accommodation are all here.

884
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,952
It may be boring,
but could you wait for a minute?

885
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,371
You can sit there.

886
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,879
Do you think we could move here?

887
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,382
We're pretty much set for tomorrow.

888
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,926
The problem is the day after.

889
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,971
I'm certain we can't film everything
in 12 hours.

890
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,557
If we need to film extra,
we'll have to eat too.

891
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,892
And there's the overtime pay.

892
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,519
The director said he had to film
a certain scene then.

893
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,771
He said he must.

894
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,191
He said it's the most traditionally
Korean scene. That American prick.

895
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,861
Let's set aside money for the food.

896
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,240
Total 300,000 won for food.

897
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,408
I'll order burgers.

898
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,035
All set for tomorrow.

899
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,913
We've planned for the day after too,
so let's end here.

900
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,289
-Okay.
-Okay.

901
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,166
Gosh, I'm so tired.

902
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,252
How's your constipation?

903
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,839
I haven't gone in three weeks.

904
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,009
Look at the state of this place.
It's impossible to go.

905
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,469
Here you are.

906
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,514
Would you like some coffee?

907
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,349
You were drinking that.

908
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,935
Mi-joo showed you to your room, right?

909
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,186
Yes.

910
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,190
I was wondering if I could move elsewhere.

911
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,028
I see. It's a bit shabby here, isn't it?

912
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,198
We'd love to as well.

913
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,035
I was searching and found
a decent hotel nearby

914
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,830
although it's not five stars.

915
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,999
Only the actors and major staff members
are staying there.

916
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,796
The Association hasn't
confirmed our budget yet

917
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,756
so we have to save up.

918
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,635
And the best way to cut down on costs
is the staff's accommodation and meals.

919
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:14,100
Would it be okay
if I were to help you move?

920
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,352
Help who?

921
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,020
All of you.

922
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,066
-What?
-What?

923
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,545
Yes?

924
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,548
The clean blanket is mine,

925
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,800
not the motel's.

926
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,971
Oh, this? I'll take it with me.

927
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,274
It's so easy to tell

928
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,236
that this is hers.

929
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,884
Mom.

930
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,058
What?

931
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,625
Ki Seon-gyeom.

932
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,839
-Mom.
-Ki Seon-gyeom.

933
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,468
Call out to someone
who can be here for you from now on

934
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,055
whenever you're sick or struggling.

935
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:07,940
Ki Seon-gyeom.

936
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,364
Ki Seon…

937
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,537
Why is your name so hard to pronounce?

938
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,465
I called your name.

939
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,806
You need to hold my hand.

940
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:49,333
What if they kidnapped you
and put you on a fishing boat?

941
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,460
I heard you were here.

942
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,546
But why am I so worried?

943
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,840
I'm a grown man. You don't need to worry.

944
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,924
What are you doing here?

945
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,092
I'm part-timing as a driver.

946
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,885
Just come back to being an athlete.

947
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,679
Why are you throwing away
Seon-gyeom's photo?

948
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,639
I'm just making room for something else.

949
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,641
Fuck you too, you punk.

950
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,519
Ms. Oh!

951
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,688
He started it!

952
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,439
Just let me drink myself to death.

953
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,566
What?

954
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,652
Did you ever have someone find
something that you hid in your painting?

955
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,530
-Am I cute?
-Was Ms. Seo your Rapunzel?

956
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:20,948
-Then what does that make you?
-Lee Yeong-hwa.

957
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,908
Should I just go back to Seoul today?

958
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,537
I've been doing
that thing you asked me to.

959
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,289
You asked me to like you.

960
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:34,461
