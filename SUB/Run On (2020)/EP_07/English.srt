ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,

00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,932
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,648
What did you say?

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,446
Can you…

5
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,574
like me?

6
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,126
I already do.

7
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,779
EPISODE 7

8
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,617
He's like a baby.

9
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,419
Good morning. It really is morning now.

10
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,634
If you're up,
wash up and eat your breakfast.

11
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,404
There.

12
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,948
-Ms. Bang, please have a seat.
-Sure.

13
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,783
-Go ahead.
-Thank you for the meal.

14
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,868
No problem.

15
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,830
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

16
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,707
Thank you.

17
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,760
You seem surprised that it tastes good.

18
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,387
It's absolutely delicious.

19
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,681
Dried radish greens are rare.

20
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,603
Still a picky eater, aren't you?

21
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,107
Aren't you Jeong-do's son?
Where is your dad?

22
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,779
Off to bark at his juniors, right?

23
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,782
Hi, what's your name?

24
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm Bang Bae-jeong.

25
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,701
I'm Ki Seon-gyeom.

26
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,246
Here to watch the athletes
with your father?

27
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,582
Wait, are you really his son?

28
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,459
I am.

29
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,795
I'm here to choose
which event I'll train in.

30
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,172
That's Jeong-do for you.

31
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,967
So, are you even sure you want to compete?

32
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,551
I am.

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,847
You… Let go of me!

34
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,058
-Move it.
-Damn it.

35
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,737
Don't you know that the parents
are already complaining about you?

36
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,114
Because of that temper of yours?

37
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,324
Then should I just stand there
and take it?

38
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,826
That was the least I could do.

39
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,245
Fire me if you want. I don't care.

40
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,914
You and that temper!

41
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,917
Unbelievable!

42
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,013
Why did you beat up that coach then?

43
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,894
You're asking after all these years?

44
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,522
I doubt what everyone is saying is true.

45
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,149
What are people saying exactly?

46
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,985
That the coach
kept making advances at you,

47
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,445
so you beat him to a pulp.

48
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,239
And how is that untrue?
His advances or him bleeding?

49
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,116
You brat.

50
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,872
All I know is that you left
after that incident.

51
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,291
I was forced to leave
the field I loved and trusted.

52
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,794
And now he's the head coach?

53
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,589
I feel bad for the athletes he trains.

54
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,801
Then they should learn
from someone like you.

55
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,012
And teach them what?

56
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,307
-Don't they start training soon?
-What?

57
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,476
Yes. That's right.

58
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,104
Why not join me
for some drinks in the sun that day?

59
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,481
Think of it as a picnic.

60
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,527
I want to know
if Seon-gyeom's doing a good job,

61
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,112
but what would I know?

62
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,405
Right now, all I can do is

63
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,407
trust him whether it's true or not.

64
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,577
But don't you think
the kids deserve better?

65
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,455
That's right. I'm the worst.

66
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,458
I don't have what it takes
to be a good mentor.

67
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,752
And I'm also a bad influence.

68
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,171
Go the other way when you leave.

69
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,340
That'll be faster.

70
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,681
Are you sure about the drinks?

71
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,558
Soju, beer, whiskey--

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,187
Nothing beats drinking during the day.
And makgeolli is pork's best friend.

73
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,855
Will you be there?

74
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,690
I don't know. Maybe if I have the time.

75
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,651
I think she'll be there.

76
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,445
I'm done here, so off you go.

77
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,208
My head hurts.

78
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,960
Tell me whenever you feel queasy.

79
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,922
I'd rather you not wait like yesterday
until you…

80
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,759
-Did I barf yesterday?
-How's your head?

81
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,428
Did I bash it somewhere?

82
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,596
Yes.

83
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,101
I only remember you handing me water.

84
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,729
Can you…

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,941
like me?

86
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,618
Did I really barf yesterday?

87
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,455
I don't remember cleaning it up.

88
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,831
Don't tell me…

89
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,624
You don't remember.

90
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,877
How disappointing.

91
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,213
Sorry I made you clean up.

92
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,592
Get some sleep.
I'll wake you up once we're there.

93
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,718
Sure.

94
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,851
I'm grateful for what you did
yesterday and today.

95
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,563
Just schedule that training session.

96
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,399
The lie just flew out of me.

97
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,779
She didn't quit on her own accord

98
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,615
but was forced out.

99
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,909
Judging by her anger yesterday,

100
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,204
a lot of people must have come
to ask her the same thing.

101
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:17,955
People like me?

102
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,419
I bet she's been lonely. A lot, too.

103
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,560
Seon-gyeom!

104
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,024
-E.T.'s friend?
-Are you going on vacation?

105
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,651
-No.
-Where are you going, then?

106
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,070
-I'm headed to the agency.
-To see Ms. Seo?

107
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,781
-I guess…
-Can I come with?

108
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,366
-No.
-I'll give you a ride.

109
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,583
I guess you're right. We'll take your car.

110
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,481
You do know that you have to be registered
for that to work, right?

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,109
-I do.
-I see.

112
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,486
I only asked just in case.

113
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,864
We should wait until someone opens it.

114
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,117
-Ms. Seo will be here, right?
-No.

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,452
-Why not?
-It's the weekend.

116
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,372
Oh, the weekend.

117
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,500
You're right. I forgot.

118
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,836
Seriously. Is it Sunday?

119
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,380
Guys, it's the weekend.

120
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,966
Lord, I forgot that I had to greet you.

121
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,926
Forgive me for I have sinned

122
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,969
and him…

123
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,097
Are you kidding me right now?

124
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,851
-Is that so upsetting?
-Aren't you here to see Ms. Seo?

125
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,519
You're an athlete signed with her agency.

126
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm here to see Director Dong.
I wanted to thank her.

127
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,072
We're here for two very different reasons.

128
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,074
Why did you come here?

129
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,868
You were supposed to be my excuse.

130
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,497
I handed over some money by mistake

131
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,335
and I'm embarrassed to ask for it back.

132
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,713
I thought I'd follow you here
and casually ask for it.

133
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,591
To me, 500,000 won isn't chump change.

134
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,844
-Just tell me from now on.
-What good would that do?

135
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,680
I'll gladly be your excuse
if it's reasonable.

136
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,224
Seon-gyeom!

137
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,561
You sweet man.
Now I want to take advantage of you.

138
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,604
Jeez.

139
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,444
Gosh.

140
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,905
I'm used to it, you see.

141
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,908
Maybe it's because
people like you that much.

142
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,952
-Is that so?
-Of course!

143
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,038
I think so. It is for me, at least.

144
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,605
Ignoring me again?
The second time isn't charming.

145
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,525
-What should I drink today?
-Seon-gyeom was in the neighborhood.

146
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,235
I guess you succeeded.

147
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,448
How did you know?

148
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,077
So I'm right.
I was only guessing out of curiosity.

149
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,539
Why would you be curious about that?

150
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,998
Because I worry about him.

151
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,209
Well, don't.

152
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,087
What is it about him that makes you
so protective of him?

153
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,338
I never said I liked him.

154
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,300
I'll think of it
as me being intuitive, then.

155
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,261
I'd rather you save it.

156
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,431
Why do I find you so funny?

157
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,851
Well, consider me honored.

158
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,144
Take care, then.

159
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,200
Gosh, that's sweet.

160
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,121
It's nice to be drinking something
other than instant coffee for once.

161
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,831
Poor you.

162
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,583
Should I send a coffee truck to your set?

163
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,418
No, it's all right.

164
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,754
That won't be necessary.

165
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,047
Anyway, Ms. Oh,

166
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,383
are you currently working on a project?

167
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,803
No, I'm not working on anything urgent.

168
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,681
Wait. You're making me nervous.

169
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,434
Then I'll cut to the chase.

170
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,230
The youngest punk in our staff ran…

171
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,483
Sorry about that.

172
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,362
-Anyway, he ran away leaving us in a mess.
-My gosh.

173
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,240
Help a girl out, will you?

174
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,660
I came here to beg in person.

175
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,163
You want me on the set?

176
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,209
You were in a college film club
and can translate English.

177
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,462
On top of that,
you know the ins and outs of the movie

178
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,547
and you're currently without a job.

179
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,927
-That's me.
-Don't worry about your pay.

180
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,095
I'll make sure you receive
more than enough.

181
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,015
Just consider this as
a rush translation job and help us out.

182
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,851
The Blu-ray work is done,

183
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,812
so I am jobless at the moment.

184
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,147
I'll consider it a vacation
and gladly help you out.

185
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,233
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yes.

186
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,361
Thank you so much. Thank you!

187
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,737
Just a second.

188
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,782
Just know that this isn't a bribe.

189
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,868
Gone is the Night
will be released in theaters.

190
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,498
-You're invited to the premiere.
-Gosh, congratulations. Finally.

191
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,793
I'll finally see the movie
on the big screen.

192
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,628
Although, not with my subtitles.

193
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,881
-You gave me two tickets.
-Right.

194
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,094
I was wondering
if Ms. Park was busy these days.

195
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,429
I see.

196
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,935
TRANSITION PROCESS FORM

197
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,732
Hey, May.

198
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,776
Oh, hey.

199
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,780
I've brought some
late-night snacks for you.

200
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,534
Just a second.
I only need to send this email.

201
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,577
Sure.

202
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,334
It's finally over.

203
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,504
You've been busy, right?

204
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,256
We barely see each other at home.

205
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,843
The distribution schedule was moved up
and it ate away my lifespan.

206
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,929
-Why are you here again?
-Oh, right.

207
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,265
Since we're both free,
I thought we could go on a trip.

208
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,683
Sounds good.

209
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,727
Why don't we go to a hotel
and book a spa?

210
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,063
Hui-jin is looking for someone
who can speak English.

211
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,607
Someone must have run away.

212
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,026
-She asked if you're busy.
-Me and my fluent English.

213
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,030
And also if you had no intention
of paying back your debt.

214
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,656
It was her who bought--

215
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,450
Okay, I'll go.

216
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,160
-When is it?
-Next week.

217
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,454
She even invited us to the premiere
for Gone is the Night.

218
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,247
I saw it at the film festival though.

219
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,749
I, for one, don't mind reruns.

220
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,375
It's different every time.

221
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,336
Go with him instead.

222
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,212
Now you have a reason to ask him out.

223
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,548
He doesn't like movies though.

224
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,675
How is that even possible?

225
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,969
Tell me about it. Weird, right?

226
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,062
What was that award you won?

227
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,607
-The Silver Crown Cultural Award.
-Oh, right.

228
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,692
What year was it?

229
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,278
It was 2010.

230
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,988
-Right, 2010.
-Of course.

231
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,367
It was back when the award
was first given out.

232
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,827
-Yes, of course.
-That's right.

233
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,543
I enjoyed your most recent game.

234
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,420
-Sure.
-What nice weather we have today.

235
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,715
-This will be a teaching moment.
-You're already quite good.

236
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,725
Damn bastard.

237
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,604
Your day will end with a meeting
regarding the video content industry

238
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,190
as well as the support project
for movies at 3:00 p.m.

239
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,401
Tomorrow, you have breakfast
with the party delegate.

240
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,236
I'll pick you up on time, sir.

241
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,155
Has there been a word from Seomyung Group?

242
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,323
No, sir.

243
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,659
If your son were selected,

244
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,744
they would have called
to set up the blind date.

245
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,957
I guess I'll have to make it natural.

246
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,750
Make what natural, sir?

247
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,129
Don't you know?

248
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,382
It's about time you thought
about our young voters.

249
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,259
Be more active online.

250
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,594
I will, once you cut back on it.

251
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,347
What about my wife?

252
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,893
She'll be busy working on her movie.

253
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,062
But on Thursday,
she'll be at a movie premiere

254
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,398
to show support for a junior actor.

255
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,316
Why did no one tell me?

256
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,527
-About her movie?
-The premiere.

257
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,322
It'd be nice for a couple
to be seen on a date.

258
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,913
I thought you already briefed me.

259
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,207
I did, but another thing came up.

260
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,834
Lee Yeong-hwa texted you.

261
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,210
"Mr. Jeong, please tell her…

262
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,048
I ordered jjajangmyeon
but no chopsticks came."

263
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,426
Is he asking me to buy him chopsticks?

264
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,428
He hates texting you through me.

265
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,805
Chopsticks are important
when eating Chinese.

266
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,474
Is there more?

267
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
"Mr. Jeong, please tell her

268
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,519
that she shouldn't share the honey
with you."

269
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,856
Who does he think he is
to order me around?

270
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,483
The honey was confirmed

271
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,319
to be from a verified bee farm
in Gangwon Province.

272
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,528
-Also--
-There's more?

273
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:56,158
Assemblyman Ki invited you
to a movie premiere with Ms. Yook.

274
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,372
I guess he wants us to be a thing.

275
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,124
Should I add it to your schedule?

276
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,877
Maybe.

277
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,769
I don't get why you're in awe
of your own painting.

278
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,145
Thanks.

279
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,397
You should enjoy this too.

280
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,568
Did she send you honey again?

281
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,406
-I'm not hungover though.
-You will be today.

282
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,577
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, jjajangmyeon.

283
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,458
MR. JEONG, PLEASE TELL HER THAT
SHE SHOULDN'T SHARE THE HONEY WITH YOU

284
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,585
What's that?
Are you dating an office worker?

285
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,962
It's for a job,

286
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,339
but I'm to speak through him.

287
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,384
Why should I when the painting's for her?

288
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,844
Isn't it weird?

289
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,012
Hence the cryptic message?

290
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,307
This will frustrate her enough
to want to talk to me directly.

291
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,602
The professor relays his messages
through his TA sometimes, right?

292
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,480
I doubt someone who has
their own personal manager

293
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,857
would speak directly to you.

294
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,316
It's one or the other.

295
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,819
She's either a higher-up or a snob.

296
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,864
But the client's preference
is crucial to my work.

297
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,782
What's with all these comments on my SNS?

298
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,368
Wait, they're all foreigners.

299
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,369
What the hell?

300
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,330
-I'll get going, then.
-Sure.

301
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,632
-Are you off somewhere?
-Yes.

302
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,052
You're supposed to answer where and why.

303
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,346
To my parents' house
to get some extra clothes.

304
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,600
Are you also going somewhere?

305
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,602
Yes, I'm meeting someone.

306
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,770
Okay, then.

307
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,524
Don't you want to know who I'm meeting?

308
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,361
-Who are you meeting?
-Don't forget your car key.

309
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,157
It's in the shop.
It kept making a weird noise.

310
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,784
-Oh, I see.
-Aren't you going to answer my question?

311
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,870
People can be really twisted at times.

312
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,748
Now that you ask,
I don't want to tell you.

313
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,270
Furry Kim? Hey, you came early.

314
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,233
-That's you, right?
-How…

315
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,404
It looks like you're doing better.
I thought I'd be here first.

316
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,116
I came a bit early
because I had to buy something.

317
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,701
Next. We're ready for you.

318
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,079
Let me buy that for you. It's okay.

319
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,918
GRADE 9 CIVIL SERVANT TEST
SAMPLE QUESTIONS

320
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,676
Gosh, I wanted to buy you coffee.

321
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,136
You bought me the book.

322
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,847
Thank you. I'll study hard.

323
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,058
Are you studying for a test?

324
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,394
I happened to notice
that it's a test book.

325
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,980
There are a few athletes
who take this route.

326
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,192
This athlete who's retired is
also apparently in Noryangjin right now.

327
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,777
To study for the test?

328
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,821
No, he teaches for the civil service test.

329
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,406
I see.

330
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:27,035
By the way, does Seon-gyeom
also know that you're Furry Kim?

331
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,998
There's no way he'd know.
He doesn't know anything.

332
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,332
But how did you know?

333
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,376
Me?

334
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,920
I tried to find out who Furry Kim was.

335
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,339
I'm pretty good at
looking things up on the net.

336
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,135
Are you getting ready to be a cop
or something?

337
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,640
The coffee is really nice. Maybe it's
because you bought it for me. Thanks.

338
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,523
You interpreted what I said into English,
and that's how I was able to speak out.

339
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,484
And thanks to your translations,
I found out

340
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,862
that you interpreted what I said
word by word.

341
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,573
Thank you so much.

342
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,618
It was going to go viral anyway.
I just sped things up a bit.

343
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,038
Why? Because of Seon-gyeom?

344
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,916
Because I knew I'd do the most
precise job.

345
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,586
You're so cool.

346
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,881
And also because of Seon-gyeom.

347
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,427
He's a really great guy.

348
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,015
Yes, I'm sure he is.

349
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,608
Did I say something wrong?

350
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,276
No, it's not that.

351
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,489
I have no problem
understanding the stuff you say,

352
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,907
but for some reason,

353
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,370
I sometimes find it harder to understand
what Seon-gyeom says

354
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,914
than to translate a two-hour-long
foreign film.

355
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,542
It makes me want to understand him more

356
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,753
and learn more about him.

357
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,383
I'm already busy making a living.

358
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,137
That's nice and cool.

359
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,522
They agreed to let you back
on the team after six months.

360
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,857
-Just keep that in mind.
-I'm not interested.

361
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,984
Really?

362
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,529
Then marry Chairman Seo's daughter.

363
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,698
So I was right.

364
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,285
Will you marry me off to a family
who'll secure your political career?

365
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,373
-You want to marry me off.
-Just stay married for two years.

366
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,000
No. Is there anything else
you need to say to me?

367
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,335
Are you serious?

368
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,964
-What's your problem?
-I don't have a problem.

369
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,632
The problem is you.

370
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,055
I'm not asking you to win a medal

371
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,557
or to set a new record.

372
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,268
All I want you to do
is keep a low profile.

373
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:01,440
You can get divorced and retire
after two years.

374
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,650
I'll let you do whatever you want.

375
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,819
It's my life, Father.

376
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,988
You…

377
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,159
Do you know how much my plan
got messed up because of you this year?

378
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,618
You should be sorry.

379
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,995
But what? It's your life?

380
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,621
Your life isn't yours.

381
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,415
Who gave you that life?

382
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,126
Your parents gave birth to you.
Snap out of it.

383
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,046
Do you think this entire family
is some kind of a tool you can use

384
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,174
to your own advantage?

385
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,384
I get that it's why you made this family.

386
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,262
But I really can't take it anymore.

387
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,226
Seon-gyeom.

388
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,274
Why do you think we supported your dream?

389
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,737
It's so we could share it with you.

390
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,448
How can we share it
when you don't even know what it is?

391
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,909
Were you ever even curious to know
what it was?

392
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,369
Winning a medal. Coming in first place.

393
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,330
Wasn't that it?

394
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,916
Stop using me as the means
to fulfill your dream.

395
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,375
Father.

396
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,755
Can't we at least try to remain
as father and son?

397
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,635
Seon-gyeom.

398
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,097
There's a movie premiere.

399
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,809
Your mom will be there too.
You should drop by.

400
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,400
What is his problem?

401
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,404
I'm still the same person
I've always been.

402
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,824
Maybe it's Seon-gyeom that's changed.

403
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,048
Hey, retired athlete.

404
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,511
Did Father summon you too?

405
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,433
Hey, retired athlete's older sister.

406
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,726
Why did Father want to see you?

407
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,773
Because I signed a deal with
Seo Dan-ah's agency instead of his.

408
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,902
I want to go in there with earplugs.

409
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,404
No, don't eat that.

410
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,656
My gosh.

411
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,036
Did you not renew the contract
because of me?

412
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,873
You're too self-conscious.

413
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,293
I didn't care much about the deal.

414
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,838
But I figured if I signed a deal
with Dan-ah instead,

415
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,339
the news would be all over the web.

416
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,341
And that actually happened.

417
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,260
But it wasn't because of you.

418
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,637
I just happen to be more famous than you.

419
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,140
Why would you sacrifice yourself
because of me?

420
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,434
Because you're my brother.

421
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,686
I'll be off now.

422
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,438
Eun-bi, wait. I have a question.

423
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,443
Is Ryan still alive?

424
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,155
-Probably.
-Are you going to the premiere?

425
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,407
Is Mom's movie out?

426
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,577
I heard she just started shooting.
What premiere?

427
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,955
I have no idea. I don't know what it is.

428
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,843
Sir, I'll get off over there.

429
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,274
Why did you follow me?

430
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,362
Mi-joo, what brings you
to this neighborhood?

431
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,740
I was on my way home.

432
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,367
Me too.

433
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,202
You must live here.

434
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,954
I'll walk you home.

435
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,874
You're too easy.

436
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,131
Did you bring some extra clothes?

437
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,886
My father caught me on my way out.

438
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,808
I hope it didn't seem like
you were running away from home.

439
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,061
Did he scold you for leaving home?

440
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,898
He scolded me for retiring.
He thinks it's absurd.

441
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,526
He must be really upset

442
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,445
considering the effort you put in
to become an athlete.

443
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,658
It won't matter if it's okay with you,

444
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,743
but I feel like you might.

445
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,748
I do think back and reminisce
on my career as an athlete.

446
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,545
What do track and field athletes do
after they retire?

447
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,005
If you were an office worker,

448
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,174
it'd be like quitting early
at a really young age.

449
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,512
You guys spend your entire youth
trying to achieve your dreams.

450
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,267
Some become fitness trainers

451
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,478
since athletes have strong basics.

452
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,148
Some start academies for aspiring athletes

453
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,733
or become coaches.

454
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,652
Some even choose
completely different careers,

455
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,195
and some just disappear.

456
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,991
And you?
Have you thought of those options?

457
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,994
I'm not sure.

458
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,204
I'm sure I'll become something one day.

459
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,334
Is there anything you want to do?

460
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,592
I may not know much

461
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,928
because I was never able to use regret
to motivate myself.

462
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,848
But I think you'd be able to do that.

463
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,435
The stuff you regret about your past.

464
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,520
Turn that into something better.

465
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,609
Then what motivated you?

466
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,113
Stuff like fear and obsession.

467
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,245
So do your best
and give me some positive influence.

468
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,033
Stick to the rules. Don't speak English.

469
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:09,951
Got it.

470
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,788
"I hate going to the dentist."
What's this?

471
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,374
-Why didn't you come?
-I was sleeping.

472
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,128
You don't even follow our members.

473
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,880
Who's this you're following?

474
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,591
What do you mean? I don't follow anyone.

475
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,094
FOLLOWING

476
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,305
LEE YEONG-HWA

477
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,057
LEE YEONG-HWA

478
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,977
I got you.

479
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,688
What? There are no photos of you.

480
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,939
Are you not confident?

481
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,860
What? It's that guy who has no confidence.

482
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,986
Take this.

483
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:52,201
-Are you going to unfollow him?
-Gosh, this hurts my pride.

484
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,496
Damn it! It's all because of this jerk!

485
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,582
-Watch your language.
-Whatever.

486
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,754
That darn jerk.

487
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,095
Yeong-hwa!

488
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,639
Yes? What's up?

489
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,850
-Do you know Seo Tae-woong?
-How do you know him?

490
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,893
"Seo Tae-woong"?

491
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,606
I'm Seo Tae-woong.

492
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,901
What? That was his actual name?

493
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,819
How do you know him?

494
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,572
Why wouldn't we? He's a star.

495
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,324
How do you know him?

496
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,576
Did you meet him? Are you guys close?

497
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,537
Hey, calm down. What's with you guys?
Are you interrogating me?

498
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,331
Yes, of course.

499
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,793
Seo Tae-woong is following you,
and everyone's going crazy about it.

500
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,044
Look.

501
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,881
1 FOLLOWING

502
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,764
He should take better care of his image.

503
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,392
Are you close with him?

504
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,061
-I'm a second generation Alphabet.
-I'm the first.

505
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,938
Can we get his autograph?

506
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:02,939
How are you alphabets?

507
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,068
AtoZ is "A to Z,"

508
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,611
so we call ourselves Alphabets.

509
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,489
We know it's corny.

510
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,740
I never said it was.

511
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,784
Wait.

512
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,162
Seo Tae-woong. Seo Dan-ah…

513
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,416
Are they a family?

514
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,001
They don't look alike.

515
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,004
Seo Tae-woong is your family?

516
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,172
-I wish he were.
-A distant cousin?

517
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,883
-I don't want any competition.
-I'm so jealous.

518
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,427
I wish he were my family too.

519
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,303
I'm so jealous of him.

520
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,973
PRESIDENT SEO DAN-AH

CHILAN MOUNTAIN BEEKEEPING

522
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,995
Dan-ah.

523
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,252
-Make it quick. I'm busy.
-You were spacing out.

524
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,920
Exactly. It's my break time.

525
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,213
Who's Lee Yeong-hwa?

526
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,674
Is he a new athlete?
Or are you seeing a college student?

527
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,594
-Who's Lee Yeong-hwa?
-I asked you first.

528
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,264
LEE YEONG-HWA

529
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,724
The kid who paints for me.

530
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,100
How do you know him?

531
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,185
It was all thanks to you.

532
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,729
Didn't you learn that stalking is illegal
when you were abroad?

533
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,982
Maybe not since you lived in a hospital.

534
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,443
It's a pity that it's not
illegal here yet.

535
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,361
He was looking at you funny.

536
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,113
Just like how my fans look at me.

537
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,908
Why ask an amateur to paint
instead of a pro?

538
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,659
Is he a scholar?

539
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,286
He's even younger than me.

540
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,623
By any chance,

541
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,376
do you still want the gallery?

542
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,422
Listen. Don't get the wrong idea.

543
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,926
It's true that I wanted the gallery.

544
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,845
But the reason I hate you isn't because
you ended up getting it. Got that?

545
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,473
You don't even make time for me.

546
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,475
Who is this guy?
Why do you keep meeting him?

547
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,895
Why do you care who paints for me?
It's none of your business.

548
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,899
Happy now? Now leave. I'm busy.

549
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,069
I'm busy too.

550
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,786
LEE YEONG-HWA

551
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,006
Yes?

552
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,551
Coach Bang called.

553
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,637
Is she coming to training? That's great.

554
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,681
She'll change her mind
once she sees the kids.

555
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,391
You're coming too, right?

556
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,727
-You said you wanted to watch.
-Of course.

557
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,231
I need to leave the city for work
next week.

558
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,819
You're busy both with work and helping me.

559
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,573
A producer I know asked me for help.
She said it's urgent.

560
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,950
It'll last ten days,
so I'm packing little by little.

561
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,579
What about your housemate?

562
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,040
I know you're worried,
but she's coming with me too.

563
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,546
You can make yourself at home
while we're gone.

564
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,508
How can I make myself at home

565
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,677
without the owner?

566
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,306
What?

567
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,684
Why did I just feel a sting in my heart?

568
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,352
Did I upset you or something?

569
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm going to get some air.

570
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,818
What was that? Hey, wait.

571
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,446
What just happened?

572
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,838
DO NOT LITTER

573
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,929
Why is he sitting there like that?

574
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,139
He makes me want to watch.

575
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,266
Seon-gyeom.

576
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,103
Hey, E.T.'s friend.

577
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,735
That's right.

578
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,447
By the way,
I noticed you're pretty amazing.

579
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,824
I've never met a national athlete before.

580
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,327
On top of that,
your mom is the Queen of Cannes.

581
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,497
I looked you up online.

582
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,582
Why didn't you tell me?

583
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,751
I told you my name, didn't I?

584
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,420
And I'm not a national athlete anymore.

585
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,131
-What about your mom?
-She's still the Queen of Cannes.

586
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,717
If you're the queen's son,

587
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,512
that makes you a prince.

588
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,102
What do you do these days?

589
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,020
Are you looking for a new job?

590
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,647
You seem close to being jobless.

591
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,565
I'm not entirely unemployed.

592
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:01,070
I think it's just temporary.

593
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,993
You, amazing man.
Why were you just sitting there?

594
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,369
I had nowhere to go.

595
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,206
Why are you outside
if you have nowhere to go?

596
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,001
Because I think it's time to leave.

597
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,753
I wanted to practice.

598
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,007
Do you want one too?

599
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,399
Why the hospitality?

600
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,444
Maybe I want something from you.

601
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,114
Cheers.

602
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,879
MR. JEONG, HOW DOES MS. SEO
KNOW SEO TAE-WOONG?

603
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,675
Seon-gyeom.

604
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,971
How exactly are you acquainted
with Ms. Seo Dan-ah

605
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,514
aside from work?

606
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,810
Our families are acquainted
with each other. That's all.

607
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,729
Your families?

608
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,358
That sounds unfamiliar.

609
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,943
I can't relate.

610
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,904
Being similar doesn't always mean
you can relate.

611
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,865
She picked me and wanted me,

612
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,534
so I guess I thought we were.

613
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,663
I get anxious when people are close to me.

614
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,173
Do you want to drink?

615
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,674
Yes.

616
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,928
I'm drinking right now.

617
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,639
You can't call this drinking.
This is a beverage.

618
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,224
You're quite funny.

619
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,059
Let's go.

620
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,060
Hurry up.

621
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,989
You're adding honey to the beer?

622
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,242
Honey beer. Don't you know?

623
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,578
You see, I have a lot of honey at home.

624
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,205
Here.

625
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,583
Cheers.

626
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,475
Why do you keep coming here
when this isn't even your neighborhood?

627
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,477
I won't be anymore.

628
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,147
What? Starting when?

629
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,315
Around next week.

630
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,651
Why?

631
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,571
I don't want to be alone.

632
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,615
If you don't want to be alone,

633
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,784
does it mean you've been
with someone all along?

634
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,411
Yes.

635
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,956
I see.

636
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,169
You must've been very lonely.

637
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,969
It smelled like home,

638
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,764
and I could hear them in the house.

639
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,102
I really liked that.

640
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:10,653
Goodness, Ye-jun.
You came to the wrong house drunk again.

641
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,737
You're right.

642
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,615
Who is he?

643
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,824
What?

644
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,368
Oh, he's a friend.

645
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,620
I see.

646
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,413
Bye.

647
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,833
Hey, you said coming home drunk
would make you an ingrate.

648
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,585
I already am.

649
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,295
You can keep being a good son.

650
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,130
I'll clean up and sleep on the floor.

651
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,507
You sleep on the sofa.

652
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,008
No.

653
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,969
I'm leaving.

654
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,016
Sure.

655
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,146
Why did I offer to sleep on the floor
when this is my house?

656
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,791
Hey.

657
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,598
How could a person go in there?

658
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,602
Why not? It's so spacious.

659
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,854
I'm saying he's not in there.

660
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,692
I was going to grab a beer.

661
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,491
-He hasn't texted after leaving?
-No. I sent a few, but he's ignoring me.

662
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,201
Why is he sulking?

663
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,162
Did he break his fingers or something?

664
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,040
Should I file a missing persons report?

665
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,959
You won't be able to
since it hasn't been 24 hours yet.

666
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,253
What if it's too late, then?

667
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,130
It's not.

668
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,091
He's mentally stable and an adult.

669
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,595
You're not worried, are you?

670
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,765
Why should I be?
But I'm worried about you.

671
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,726
Me too.

672
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,316
Could he be crashing someplace else?

673
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,112
Elsewhere?

674
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,615
Damn it.

675
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,771
God, what was that?

676
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,023
Here.

677
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,944
-This is honey.
-Goodness.

678
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,612
-Take them.
-Gosh.

679
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,657
I have too much honey at home.

680
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,283
I have nothing to give you.

681
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,744
Come on, we drank together.

682
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,121
That's enough.

683
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,956
It really is.

684
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,000
This is a problem. Goodness.

685
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,253
Wait.

686
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,337
Here.

687
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,674
Here.

688
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,010
What is this?

689
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,679
You'll be seated next to her.

690
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,473
To Ms. Seo.

691
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,523
They're not broken.

692
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,985
You're even carrying something.

693
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,156
-You slept outside.
-Yes.

694
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,534
After how you acted yesterday,

695
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,703
you spent the night out.

696
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,455
I fell asleep after drinking.

697
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,373
With whom?

698
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,668
You probably wouldn't know anyway.

699
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,048
Right.

700
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,050
I wouldn't know.

701
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,013
Okay.

702
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,892
What's with the honey?
Is he Winnie the Pooh or something?

703
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,329
Ms. Oh, I'm making food for us.

704
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,709
Are you not going to eat?

705
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,101
Are you not…

706
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,986
Ms. Oh.

707
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,200
Can we talk?

708
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,120
Ms. Oh.

709
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,122
Ms. Oh.

710
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,498
Is something wrong?

711
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,835
No, I don't think so.

712
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,128
Stop knocking.

713
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,629
I'm going to bed.

714
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,341
-Are you sleeping during the day again?
-Yes, I'm planning to.

715
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,635
What is it?

716
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,305
Ms. Bang is coming tomorrow.

717
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,432
When should we leave?

718
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,602
I'll be going, so don't worry.

719
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,645
Just text me our departure time.

720
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,650
Did you two fight?

721
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,695
No, I think I upset her.

722
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,530
But she's not hearing me out.

723
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,949
Perhaps you just lost your chance.

724
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,911
-Are you upset?
-Get out!

725
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:34,912
Okay.

726
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,125
She's very upset.

727
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,131
More!

728
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,054
What a shame. You did well. You did.

729
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,181
But don't focus on turning your legs.

730
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,767
Imagine you're anchoring your leg
to push yourself forward.

731
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,395
Just think that you're a spring.

732
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,147
You did well.

733
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,566
I think I'm going to fail the competition.

734
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,403
Don't be too focused
on your current record.

735
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,947
You can trip and make a mistake.

736
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,158
You have many chances,
so just don't get injured. Good job.

737
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,035
And Yun-ho.

738
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,829
Your torso isn't following through.

739
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:18,997
Don't be like that.

740
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,668
Okay. Look here.

741
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,877
Look at this ball.

742
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,504
-It's bouncing.
-Right.

743
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,340
Right? Do this to your body.

744
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,841
Do you understand?

745
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,468
This bounces vertically,

746
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,637
but you should propel forward.

747
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,222
Got it?

748
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,849
I'm really scared because this is
my very first competition.

749
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,560
Give us a minute.

750
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,230
Right, it's terrifying.

751
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,982
While feeling just as terrified,

752
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,610
a runner set a new record
for the junior high 100-meter run.

753
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,861
It was also his first time.

754
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,905
Really? Who was it?

755
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,532
-Kim Woo-sik.
-Kim…

756
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,577
He was the youngest
eligible national athlete.

757
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,162
That just means

758
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,832
you're both capable of doing
the same thing.

759
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,792
We can all do it.

760
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,377
Got that?

761
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,795
"That just means

762
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,756
you're both capable of doing
the same thing."

763
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,176
-Get ready.
-Okay.

764
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,015
-Get ready.
-Did you fight?

765
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,058
No, we didn't.

766
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,144
I guess it was just me again.

767
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,146
I wonder if he even knows the reason.

768
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,856
I'm sure he must have irked you

769
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,984
with his innocent, naive expression.

770
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,695
I'm so happy that you understand.

771
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,322
I'm also here because he irked me.
What an asshole.

772
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,074
Exactly, he's an asshole.

773
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,286
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

774
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,165
Can you be my drinking buddy?

775
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,374
Of course.

776
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,168
But why all of a sudden?

777
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,588
If you become my friend,

778
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,840
I may come to Seoul more often.

779
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,343
He may be an asshole, but I like you.

780
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,555
I feel the same way.
I like myself more too.

781
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,514
Hey.

782
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,061
Come here. What's with your ankle?
Sit down.

783
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,356
It's swollen.

784
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,484
This won't do.
Rest and put a hot towel on it.

785
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,903
What? Why?

786
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,321
Just listen to me.

787
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,822
And you, come here.

788
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,995
Look at that. Why are your shoes so big?

789
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,997
Because I want to grow up quickly.

790
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,460
Hey, who said wearing oversized shoes
would do that?

791
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,295
Was it you?

792
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,716
Wear something that fits.
Change your shoes.

793
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,009
Yes, ma'am.

794
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,428
Why haven't you told them these things?

795
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,514
You still think like an athlete.

796
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm sorry.

797
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,266
You, the ponytail.

798
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,893
-Min-ju.
-Me?

799
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,187
Yes, run over here.

800
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,652
Yes. Since you purposely take
long strides,

801
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,279
you tend to lean back
and can't switch legs quickly.

802
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,491
This time, run with shorter strides.

803
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,575
Go.

804
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,578
By the way, who are you?

805
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,413
Me?

806
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,503
A master in recluse who's just passing by,
if you will.

807
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,879
You reek of alcohol.

808
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,635
This is the smell of a true master.

809
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,725
Run away, guys.

810
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,352
Hey!

811
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,688
Run!

812
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,907
How long will you keep this up?

813
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:46,329
Demand an apology from me
or be openly angry with me.

814
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,706
Let's talk.

815
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,375
I did talk to you.

816
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,794
And you did as well.

817
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,965
I didn't know you'd stay up
to wait for me.

818
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,134
I read your text in the morning.

819
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,344
Then you should have replied
after you woke up.

820
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,429
You could have done that.

821
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,766
But doing that
wouldn't have changed anything.

822
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,603
If that's your reply,
I have nothing to say.

823
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,650
I wasn't trying to be offensive.
Please don't be on edge.

824
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,402
But you're putting me on edge.

825
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,196
Would it break your fingers
to text me back?

826
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,909
Were you not able to call?

827
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,452
You could have called me instead.

828
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,207
Let's say I called you.

829
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,460
Do you think I have the right to be nosy
about your private life?

830
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,379
"Where and what are you doing?
Are you not coming?" Like this?

831
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,966
Why do you need a right
to ask those questions?

832
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,845
Some people feel more comfortable
when they have that right.

833
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,102
Is there another term than "right"?

834
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,480
I think that word

835
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,359
makes me uncomfortable.

836
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,194
Why would you ask me that?

837
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,488
If you feel uncomfortable,
find one yourself.

838
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:14,042
The reason why
I didn't even consider texting you

839
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,670
was because I've never lived
with someone else.

840
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,881
You had to consider doing that?

841
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,678
Are you sure it wasn't because
you knew you'd move out one day?

842
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,639
That's not it.

843
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,684
I was worried about you.

844
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,311
I thought it'd help to keep you company.

845
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,397
That's why I invited you in.

846
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,109
Wasn't that the least you could do?

847
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,779
You always put a wall around yourself,
and now this?

848
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,115
I put up a wall?

849
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,075
You easily set foot into our house,

850
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,244
but you put up a wall between us.

851
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,662
I asked who you drank with,

852
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,957
and what? I wouldn't know?

853
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,251
This is so irritating.

854
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,045
Why did you have to make me say that
and feel so small?

855
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,760
Then you shouldn't have climbed
over the wall I had put up.

856
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,723
You act as if you don't have any walls
and climb over mine so easily.

857
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,101
Ms. Oh.

858
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,853
-How will you get home?
-Stop following me.

859
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,187
I'll manage.

860
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,564
There are many cabs and buses.

861
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,204
Ma'am, I have something to tell you.

862
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,623
Is it that kid again?
Does he have nothing to do?

863
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,916
Let's hear it.

864
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,962
He wants to know your relationship
with Seo Tae-woong from AtoZ.

865
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,841
How dare he pry into my personal life?

866
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,970
I'm going home now. You should too.

867
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,031
What is he waiting for?
I don't have time for this.

868
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,662
So? What's your relationship with him?

869
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,377
We got tangled up
due to a crazy, twisted love affair.

870
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,046
-Is that what you want?
-You came all the way here to say that?

871
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,006
I even waited for you.

872
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,717
I told Mr. Jeong to text you
my private number.

873
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,761
Stop annoying my man and text me instead.

874
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,513
-I'll ignore your texts.
-Your man?

875
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:18,101
You mean that guy
who looks like a gangster?

876
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,894
A gangster? He studied law.

877
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,273
Why is he your man?

878
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,818
I got too upset
and forgot to tell you this.

879
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,987
Stop crossing the line.

880
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,321
-No.
-What?

881
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,574
But you came to see me
because I crossed the line.

882
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:36,202
I thought you should know
why you came here.

883
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,169
Are you working on the draft?

884
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,312
Here.

885
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,606
Are you kidding me?

886
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,940
Why is it so important?

887
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,734
-I might change it.
-Don't talk back.

888
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,028
You've got so many dos and don'ts.

889
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,825
This is a nice car.

890
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,120
The interior is really amazing.

891
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,373
Close the door.
I should walk since I drove.

892
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,214
-Come here!
-Run!

893
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,256
Go!

894
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,217
Shoot!

895
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,844
This way!

896
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,145
It's from a vending machine.

897
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,272
Don't tell me you've never…

898
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,107
That may be the case for wealthy people.

899
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,277
But I never eat anything
that I don't know the origin of.

900
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,780
You're so unappreciative.

901
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,660
What's your connection with Haengun-dong?

902
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,995
My parents live there.

903
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,917
How did you know I had connections
with Haengun-dong?

904
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,627
I looked into where the honey came from.

905
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,212
Tell your parents… Shoot!

906
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,838
-Over here!
-Well done.

907
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,258
Tell your parents I said thank you.

908
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:21,266
I'll drink this, so don't throw it away
and have some when you're low on sugar.

909
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,976
I won't. It didn't do anything wrong.

910
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,852
Then did I do something wrong?

911
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,980
-Kick it back, please.
-Sure.

912
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,232
I'll do it. Your hands are full.

913
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,401
-My feet aren't.
-I don't care.

914
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,739
Thank you.

915
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,075
Go deep!

916
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,416
You're good.

917
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,501
I've always been good at kicking.

918
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,545
Do you like soccer?

919
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,716
I was in a soccer club until my dad's son
tattled on me and I had to quit.

920
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,720
My dream was to become a soccer player.

921
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,265
But I realized dreams were just dreams.

922
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,560
It was just a dream,
and I let go of that dream so easily.

923
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,856
I'm just glad to be able to kick a ball
every now and then.

924
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,861
Although I thought
I'd get more chances than this.

925
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,240
Is that why you always wear sneakers?

926
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,910
You never know when the chance will come.
Just like now.

927
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,544
It's really great…

928
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,089
to learn more about you.

929
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,802
Don't ask about my dreams.

930
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,763
I don't have any.

931
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,183
How's that possible?

932
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,019
I'm too busy with my life right now
to dream.

933
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,772
Right. I did find one recently.

934
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,861
My dream is to talk directly to you
about the painting,

935
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,738
not through someone else.

936
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,700
Let me correct myself.
It's my goal, not a dream.

937
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,911
You just said dreams were unattainable.

938
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,206
What kind of goal is that? Don't you have
so much to look forward to?

939
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:12,543
I guess at my age, people are amazed
to know that I have a goal.

940
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:14,671
How old are you?

941
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,547
I'm 24.

942
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,426
That's a great age.

943
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,347
It sure is.

944
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,022
Where are you? I'll go in first
if you're running late.

945
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,607
I'll be there soon.

946
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,734
Why am I running late?

947
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,654
Okay, hurry up.

948
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,159
Why is he here?

949
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,285
He must have arrived.

950
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,539
I don't like watching movies
I've already seen so I gave him my ticket.

951
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,040
Have a great time.

952
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:58,881
You actually came here?

953
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,801
After I blew up at you this morning?

954
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,511
I want to watch a movie and drink.

955
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,888
You like neither of them.

956
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,060
I had lost my chance last time.

957
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,103
What chance?

958
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,190
Do you know
what people call this kind of stuff?

959
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,235
-A date.
-No.

960
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,362
A chance to watch a movie and drink.

961
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,822
A get-together?

962
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,783
I never said I'd drink with you.

963
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,368
Then at least watch the movie.

964
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,245
I'm going to.

965
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,208
-Is this a recon--
-We're not reconciling.

966
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,710
-I see.
-I'm just being polite.

967
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,798
Some may throw away the ticket
since they're upset and it was free.

968
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,884
But this is my chance to watch it
at the theaters,

969
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,719
and it was someone's gift.

970
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,554
I think it's right that I stay.

971
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,604
As for us, we can talk it out
once we figure out

972
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,439
what the problem is.

973
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,066
I can't seem to figure it out myself.

974
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,152
Even if I do,
I don't want to be the one to say it.

975
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,905
Any objections?

976
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,406
There shouldn't be any.

977
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,828
There are none.

978
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,917
Come.

979
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,838
I knew it the moment I saw Tae-ri
for the first time.

980
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,132
You indeed have the gift of foresight.

981
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,135
Right? I do have a keen eye, don't I?

982
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,595
Yes, I totally agree.

983
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,472
-Right.
-Honey.

984
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,724
I'm sorry for being late.

985
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,309
I was buying some flowers.

986
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,686
I see. What are these flowers for?

987
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,357
They reminded me of you.

988
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,945
How fragrant.

989
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,113
Like everyone has said,
you really love each other.

990
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,115
You guys look wonderful.

991
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,160
I still can't get enough of her.

992
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,455
He never ceases to surprise me.

993
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,502
-Shall we have a talk in private?
-Sure.

994
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,878
Excuse us.

995
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,797
-Sure.
-Okay.

996
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,925
Throw these away.

997
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,594
Ji-woo.

998
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,934
How could you come here
without telling me?

999
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,395
Consider it a surprise event.

1000
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,522
A surprise event should be favorable.

1001
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,524
Are we strangers?

1002
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,860
Can't you see how family-oriented I am?

1003
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:28,239
I'm sorry, but may I take a photo?

1004
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,448
Okay.

1005
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,368
Of course. Stand in the middle.

1006
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,371
All right, let's take it.

1007
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,666
One, two, three.

1008
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,752
-That looks nice.
-Thank you.

1009
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,129
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1010
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,797
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

1011
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,925
That was my fan, and he was asking me.

1012
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,093
Did you hear?

1013
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:53,890
I told Seon-gyeom to keep running,
but he said he'll retire.

1014
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,933
What a bastard.

1015
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,227
Did he find something interesting?

1016
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,022
He even refused to inherit the hotel.

1017
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,066
Why would he do that?

1018
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,652
He should listen to your father.

1019
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,613
Maybe he doesn't have money
for the gift tax.

1020
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,947
Look at that punk.

1021
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:15,578
Does that mean he's considering
donating his money?

1022
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:19,373
Gosh, who does he take after
to be so kindhearted?

1023
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,042
Is it me?

1024
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,794
Why do you keep looking around?
I can't focus.

1025
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,879
Where is she?

1026
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,214
Who? A mistress?

1027
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,551
You're the only one for me.

1028
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,637
God, I feel nauseous.

1029
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,388
Help me look for her.

1030
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,891
The second child of Seomyung Group.

1031
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,144
I'm going to have Ms. Seo
marry Seon-gyeom.

1032
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,066
So this is your next move.

1033
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,652
You want to peak
in both politics and business?

1034
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,529
Don't you want to become a first lady?

1035
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,824
I have a perfect husband and children.

1036
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,786
If I become a first lady on top of that,
God will punish me.

1037
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,372
I'm thirsty.

1038
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,041
I'll get some coffee.

1039
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,004
Gosh, my head.

1040
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,596
Oh, my.

1041
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,139
Isn't that Ji-woo?

1042
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,642
"Ji-woo"? Do you know each other?

1043
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:22,395
Of course I do. Who doesn't?

1044
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,647
She probably doesn't know me.
This is insane.

1045
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,692
Seon-gyeom.

1046
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,319
Are they premiering your movie?

1047
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,612
No.

1048
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,448
Who's she? Won't you introduce her to me?

1049
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,286
-She's your fan.
-I'm your fan.

1050
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,955
Hello, I'm Yook Ji-woo.

1051
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,667
I know. I really want to act
like a little kid right now.

1052
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,961
Honey, here's your coffee.

1053
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,674
Ms. Interpreter,
why are you still with my son?

1054
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,426
You're his interpreter?

1055
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,636
Yes, it was only for a week.

1056
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,265
I thought I told you no funny business.

1057
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,517
So why are you still following him around?

1058
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,105
Thanks to the money you gave,
I've become closer with him.

1059
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:09,692
How dare you come here?
Do you even know why he's here?

1060
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,195
It was for me to watch a movie
with Ms. Seo.

1061
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,366
And this was your attempt
at a natural encounter.

1062
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,161
Do you get it now?

1063
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,165
Don't interfere with them
and sit where you belong.

1064
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,666
Father.

1065
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,876
Stay still.

1066
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,670
There are many people here.

1067
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,385
Okay.

1068
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,888
I'll find my place.

1069
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:40,890
You ought to.

1070
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,933
Enjoy the movie.

1071
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,023
Aren't you coming?

1072
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,528
I'm really good at finding my place.

1073
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,989
Especially since I've been here
countless times.

1074
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:05,498
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

1075
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,761
-We should make up.
-Don't you know what this is?

1076
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,888
Fate must have brought us together.
Will you marry me?

1077
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,431
I'm not joking around.

1078
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,059
-What a strange woman.
-Weren't you two on a date?

1079
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,145
-Just leave if you know.
-What a cutie.

1080
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,648
-Did you save my number?
-Didn't I tell you to stop doing that?

1081
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,484
I smile because I'm happy.
Who are you to stop me?

1082
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,237
How selfish am I?
I'll be punished for this.

1083
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,197
Why does the toilet look so noir-esque?

1084
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,991
They won't give me any time to translate.

1085
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,951
-Screw working for free.
-That's right.

1086
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,705
He'll just keep waiting
unless you ask to see him first.

1087
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,665
He'll always be so dense.

1088
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,710
Your painting shines even in the darkness.

1089
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,378
I wish you'd stop calling me that.

1090
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,589
-Then what would I call you, kid?
-"Yeong-hwa."

1091
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,759
I didn't say that because I hate you.

1092
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,261
So don't hate me for it.

1093
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:48,225
