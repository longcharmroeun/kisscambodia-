1
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,000
Mom!

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>Grandma!</i>

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>Grandma!</i>

4
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,921
CHARCOAL BBQ

5
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,193
HYE-YEONG

6
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,140
Most people don't stare at my face
like you do.

7
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,266
What?

8
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,767
You're already talking like me.

9
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,398
Gosh, who's talking so loudly?

10
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,942
-Stop being so loud.
-What on earth?

11
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,406
When I first saw you,

12
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,908
I thought you were someone

13
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,619
who had loving parents
and a great childhood...

14
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,372
because you seemed so cheerful.

15
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,419
I like it when people tell me...

16
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,337
that I seem cheerful.

17
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,341
Since my parents passed away
on Jeju Island,

18
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,219
I've been emotionally hurt so many times.

19
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,850
Every time I feel hurt,
I consciously try to be more cheerful.

20
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,062
I smile more and study harder...

21
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,857
to make sure I never lose my true self.

22
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,194
From now on, tell me
whenever anyone hurts your feelings.

23
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,239
Don't worry.

24
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,075
I'll continue...

25
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,536
to stay cheerful and strong.

26
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,385
Jojo.

27
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,138
Let's be together starting Monday,
just the two of us.

28
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,308
Are you really not going to go
on the school trip?

29
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,149
Don't even think of spending time
away from me for three days.

30
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,029
Aren't you going to ask why I'm not going?

31
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,073
You can tell me when you want to.

32
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,953
Tell me everything later.

33
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,666
What shall we do together?

34
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,834
Where do you want to go?

35
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,045
What shall we do?

36
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,594
Let's go.

37
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,597
-What?
-Let's go on the school trip.

38
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,225
-No, you don't need to do that for me--
-It's okay.

39
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,894
I don't mind going if I can be with you.

40
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,443
Sun-oh.

41
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,447
Ring my Love Alarm.

42
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,040
LOVE ALARM

43
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,888
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

44
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,128
-Stand there.
-It's weird.

45
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,088
-Gosh, I'm so jealous.
-Come on.

46
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,926
One, two, three.

47
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,971
One, two, three.

48
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,310
-Are you okay holding hands in public?
-Yes. I don't care anymore.

49
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,396
When did you come to Seoul?

50
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,775
I came after my grandma got sick.

51
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,693
-I think it was about four years ago.
-I see.

52
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,780
What do you think?
Has this place changed a lot?

53
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,782
I'm not sure.

54
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,742
But the breeze still feels the same.

55
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,915
I'm glad we didn't meet four years ago.

56
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,124
What?

57
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,627
Back then, I had so many pimples.

58
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,632
So? I think you still would've
looked cute.

59
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,176
No, you definitely would've
made fun of me.

60
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,096
Show me a photo next time, okay?

61
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,060
This feels so strange.

62
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,522
You make me want to tell you everything,
including all the little things.

63
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,454
-Why are you suddenly acting all shy?
-Because you're staring at me like that.

64
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,714
Thank you, Sun-oh.

65
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,264
-Hey, wait for me!
-This is so fun.

66
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,483
-What's this?
-Someone's Love Alarm went off.

67
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,194
-My Love Alarm went off.
-What?

68
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,738
-Unbelievable.
-Who rang it?

69
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,033
-It's ringing.
-Should I also get a haircut?

70
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,119
Congratulations.

71
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,412
My gosh.

72
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,747
I thought Jojo wasn't going to come.

73
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,416
-Exactly.
-Everyone, gather here.

74
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,042
-But she's here.
-Hurry up!

75
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,210
Duk-gu.

76
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,254
-Hey.
-This is your spot.

77
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,964
-Gosh, hey.
-What's wrong with you?

78
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:45,882
Do you want to die?

79
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,592
-Everyone, stop chatting.
-Shoot.

80
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,261
Okay, stand properly.
Make sure we can see all your faces.

81
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,679
-Make sure you're all in.
-Gosh.

82
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,389
Don't blink.

83
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,724
-Shoot.
-Smile, everyone.

84
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,102
One, two, three.

85
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,021
One more time.

86
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,939
-One more time.
-Come on, let's just go.

87
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,193
One, two, three.

88
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,906
Let's go!

89
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,381
She's the only one like this.

90
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,716
Wait, you guys.

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,510
You must be crazy.

92
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,512
Ta-da. I prepared this for you guys.

93
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,388
What do you think? Isn't it cute?

94
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,307
-Gosh, no way.
-What?

95
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,392
-Are you going to wear this on stage?
-What is this?

96
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,644
Did we seriously buy this?

97
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,811
Of course.

98
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,689
-Hey, try it on.
-Why does it have to be pink?

99
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,566
-Go ahead and wear this.
-Gosh, forget it.

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,734
This is ridiculous.

101
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,653
This stands out way too much.

102
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,820
It's cold.

103
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,405
Let me try it on.

104
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,449
-Try it on. Hurry.
-It'll go well with your skirt.

105
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,617
No way.

106
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,458
I've been wanting to talk to you.

107
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,380
Do you want to know Jojo's secret?

108
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,427
What are you going to wear?

109
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,596
-This. Cool, right?
-What's left? What are you wearing?

110
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,431
-I'm going to wear this.
-This one looks nice.

111
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,349
-Hey.
-What's this?

112
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,102
-No, wait.
-You jerk. You're crazy.

113
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,897
To be honest, I'm really grateful.
I really am.

114
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,066
But look at him smiling.
It's getting on my nerves.

115
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,527
-What's with him?
-His Love Alarm went off on the bus.

116
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,529
-Let's just ignore him and drink this.
-My gosh.

117
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,697
Hey, Sun-oh.

118
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,365
His Love Alarm went off three times.

119
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,992
Why is yours so quiet?

120
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,327
I turned it off because it kept ringing.

121
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,205
-He's so annoying.
-Gosh.

122
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,540
He's making me feel so sad.

123
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,836
Why are you telling me this?

124
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,171
Because you're Sun-oh's best friend.

125
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,173
So,

126
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,134
you want me to pass it on to him?

127
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,512
I like Sun-oh.

128
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,850
How do you expect me to stay quiet
when I know what Jojo is really like?

129
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,519
What's wrong with surviving?

130
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,770
Are you serious?

131
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,856
She left her mom and dad--

132
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,983
They shouldn't have put a child
in that situation.

133
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,695
Jojo did nothing wrong.

134
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,992
YEOLRIM HIGH SCHOOL TRIP

135
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,625
Gosh, they're so loud.
My ears are ringing.

136
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,377
Aren't they so good?

137
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,671
I don't know. I didn't pay attention.

138
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,423
Let's go back inside soon.
Our class is next.

139
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,468
Gosh, it's so boring.
I don't want to watch it.

140
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,939
Why are you outside?

141
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,607
I just needed some air.

142
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,904
Hey, you know Hye-yeong, right?

143
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,573
Yes, he's your friend.

144
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,493
What's with the introduction?

145
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,162
I'll head inside, then.

146
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,474
Hey, let me explain--

147
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,395
You are...

148
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,313
You are really horrible.

149
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,026
-Gul-mi--
-Don't say my name.

150
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,114
The thing is, I just...

151
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,033
You just looked so pretty, so I...

152
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,037
I wasn't going to share it with anyone.

153
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,748
Why would you film a video?

154
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,168
I just hate the fact
that you took a video of me.

155
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,796
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,716
I didn't mean to upset you.

157
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,636
Can you please just get out of my sight?

158
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,769
Do you hate me that much?

159
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,853
Yes.

160
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,150
Did you see what the others did to me
when we took the group photo?

161
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,486
They did that because you rang
my Love Alarm.

162
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
Do you know how I feel
every time that happens?

163
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,910
I'm sick of you and the sound of you
ringing my Love Alarm.

164
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,121
Why does that thing even exist?

165
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,207
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,292
Don't ever...

167
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,420
show up in front of me again.

168
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,894
Duk-gu.

169
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,617
-The color's pretty, right?
-A bit more.

170
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,369
-It looks nice on you.
-It's so pretty.

171
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,496
-Does this look nice?
-Isn't it pretty? I bought it.

172
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,831
-Yes, it's pretty.
-Snacks...

173
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,041
-It looks better down.
-We should've bought more snacks.

174
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,377
Let's bring them now.

175
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,294
How's this?

176
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,465
Be careful.

177
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,800
Make sure they don't drop.

178
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,094
-Be careful, okay?
-Don't drop them.

179
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,180
Good job.

180
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,890
Are they cold?

181
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,016
-Yes, totally.
-Nice.

182
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,893
-We should've bought more.
-They'll bring some.

183
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,937
-Didn't we leave the door open?
-Yes, we did.

184
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,146
Hey.

185
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:20,943
What's this?

186
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,153
-Are you guys ready?
-One, two, three. There.

187
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,659
You said it was only going to be the guys
from class five.

188
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,661
You're friends with Il-sik.

189
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,163
So I asked Seong-jun to bring him along.
Good thinking, right?

190
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,749
It wasn't me!

191
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,462
-Hey.
-Seriously, it wasn't me.

192
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,715
-Have you got your hopes up?
-Look at this.

193
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,384
Are we going to play
a game of truth using Love Alarm?

194
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,635
I'm so excited.

195
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,847
-Hey.
-Am I getting ahead of myself?

196
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,348
Ji-yeon, you start.

197
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,808
Okay, then.

198
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,228
Let's turn it on and show it
on the count of three.

199
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,646
Okay.

200
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,525
One, two, three.

201
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,610
Let's go.

202
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,121
-What's this?
-His alarm went off.

203
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,623
That's cheating.

204
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,790
His alarm went off, too.

205
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,627
-Hey.
-Hey, that's cheating.

206
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,420
Are you here to show off?

207
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,755
Stop overreacting.

208
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,007
-You're being so annoying.
-Why didn't you show yours?

209
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,093
-That's fishy.
-You didn't turn it on.

210
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,095
Il-sik didn't show his cell phone either.

211
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,097
What's with you guys?

212
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,390
Why aren't you guys showing us?

213
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,600
What does that make us?

214
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,518
-Exactly. That's not fair.
-You're unbelievable.

215
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,354
Is it because the other person
might find out?

216
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,480
What are you talking about?

217
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,607
No way. Do you like Il-sik?

218
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,443
-What?
-Does Jang-go like Il-sik?

219
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,615
-Go on a date!
-Cut the crap!

220
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,866
Okay, we're sorry.

221
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,826
-He's drunk.
-We're just kidding.

222
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,662
Don't be like that.

223
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,539
-I'm going to have more.
-I told you I didn't want to do this.

224
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,503
-What's wrong with her?
-I bet she's hiding something.

225
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,754
Seriously?

226
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,715
Really?

227
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,425
Gosh, did you drink a lot?

228
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,886
Forget about her. Let's have fun.

229
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,060
Jang-go.

230
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:19,979
Jang-go.

231
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,483
-Jang-go.
-Let me go. I don't want to talk to you.

232
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,402
Why didn't you tell me
that you like Il-sik?

233
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,861
Why?

234
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,072
So you could let me date him?

235
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,951
But then again, you easily
date and break up with guys.

236
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,286
How can you say that?

237
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,374
Isn't that why you were kissing a guy
you barely knew in the alleyway?

238
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,046
I couldn't believe my eyes
as I took that photo.

239
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,840
You were the one...

240
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,092
who took that photo?

241
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,135
Yes.

242
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,053
I took that photo.

243
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,889
How could you do that to me?

244
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,975
Because I like Il-sik.

245
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,284
Is the person you like
in this room or not?

246
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,243
I'm sleepy.

247
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,537
-Gosh, cut the bullshit.
-Hey, drink up.

248
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,664
Don't be like that.

249
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,624
-Drink up.
-Don't be like that.

250
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,502
-Wait. What's this?
-Just answer the question.

251
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,588
-Just drink.
-Don't do that. You're disappointing me.

252
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,590
If you lie,
you'll be single for three years.

253
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,341
-That's right.
-If you don't answer,

254
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,760
-you have to drink.
-That's right.

255
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,428
Okay, then.

256
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,130
Hey, move! Get up!

257
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,799
Where's the fire extinguisher?

258
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,342
-Hey, get up!
-Fire!

259
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,469
-The fire extinguisher!
-Get up!

260
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,560
Move!

261
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,722
Jojo.

262
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,599
-We need to get out.
-Jojo, what's wrong?

263
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,600
We'll die!

264
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,624
Jojo!

265
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,005
Jojo!

266
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,978
-Did she have a seizure or what?
-I don't know.

267
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,229
Gosh.

268
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,524
Gosh, that was scary.

269
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,026
I'm getting goose bumps.

270
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,677
Are you okay?

271
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,056
Sun-oh.

272
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,816
I'm not okay.

273
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,279
This is so hard for me.

274
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,884
I can't breathe.

275
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,928
I want to get out of here.

276
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,699
Sun-oh.

277
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,827
There's a place I want to go to.

278
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,841
It's been ages since I last came here.

279
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,887
Did you come here often?

280
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,394
<i>Goodness.</i>

281
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,483
<i>Goodness me...</i>

282
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,244
<i>Kind of.</i>

283
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,663
<i>I used to come here sometimes...</i>

284
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,335
whenever I got a low test score.

285
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,224
It's my first time smelling the sea here.

286
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,977
I thought you came here often.

287
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,189
Whenever I came with my parents,
we were either in the car

288
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,732
or at the hotel.

289
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,611
I never wanted to come,
but they brought me here,

290
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,948
always left me alone,
and thought of me as a bother.

291
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,243
They pretended to love me
only when other people were around.

292
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,455
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,791
I whined too much, didn't I?

294
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,334
No.

295
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,127
I like hearing you talk.

296
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,972
I've told you all my secrets now.

297
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,993
<i>Thank you, Sun-oh.</i>

298
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,943

00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,881
<i>Sun-oh, listen to me.</i>

301
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,428
<i>Every time we met, my heart fluttered.</i>

302
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,388
<i>Every moment felt precious.</i>

303
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,183
<i>And you made me feel unbelievably happy.</i>

304
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,102
<i>So I didn't want to let you go.</i>

305
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,614
<i>Because I felt like I would never...</i>

306
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,619
<i>be able to hold onto you again</i>
<i>if I let you go now.</i>

307
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,997
I'll tell everyone.

308
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,916
Jeju Island.

309
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,710
What you did in Jeju Island...

310
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,420
How your mom and dad...

311
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,092
<i>Should I have died then?</i>

312
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,095
<i>Are you saying I should have died then?</i>

313
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,471
<i>But, Sun-oh...</i>

314
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,560
<i>maybe I was here all along</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

315
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,364
<i>I might still be...</i>

316
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,286
<i>locked up in that room...</i>

317
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,831
<i>sound asleep.</i>

318
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,797
Mom!

319
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,508
Mom!

320
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,844
Mom!

321
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,056
Mom!

322
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,777
Mom...

<i>Mom!</i>

324
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,496
<i>I might have...</i>

325
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,875
<i>just dreamt that I met you.</i>

326
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,754
<i>So, Sun-oh,</i>

327
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,090
<i>please wake up.</i>

328
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,468
<i>Wake up, Sun-oh.</i>

00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,228
Last but not least, may your lives
be filled with happiness.

354
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,985
Now, would the bride and the groom
please turn around and face the guests?

355
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,322
You can turn around now.

356
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,911
Let's check to see

357
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,456
if they truly love each other
before they walk down the aisle.

358
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,167
Please give the bride and groom
their cell phones.

359
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,087
I'd like all the guests to turn off
their Love Alarms.

360
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,512
Okay, everyone.

361
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,972
The bride and the groom
are the only ones...

362
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,475
-Please. I hope only one rings.
-...who can ring their alarms.

363
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,601
-Let's all count to...
-Why?

364
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,603
-...three together.
-The groom is totally my type.

365
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,979
-Come on.
-One.

366
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,232
-Two. Three.
-Two. Three.

367
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,574
Everyone, their alarms went off!

368
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,910
Let's bless the married couple
with a round of applause!

369
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,581
Everyone, the bride and the groom
confirmed their love

370
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,958
through Love Alarm.

371
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,085
Let's give them another round of applause.

372
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,461
Congratulations!

373
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,945
-One, two.
-One, two.

374
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,709
I'm back.

375
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:23,214
I checked the money you wired.
You wired 100,000 won less.

376
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,841
I'm returning to school next semester.

377
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,134
Goodness.

378
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,512
Why would you live a hard life
by going to college?

379
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,390
If you didn't go to college
and just got a job,

380
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,684
you could have given me more money
and paid off your debt.

381
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,061
I'm looking for another part-time job.

382
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,105
Gosh.

383
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,358
You still have to do everything
you want to do, don't you?

384
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,598
-I packed the underskirt.
-Okay.

385
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,975
The underpants, traditional socks, shoes,

386
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,312
the bride's bag, and her skirt and jacket.
Did you check everything?

387
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,939
-Yes.
-I'll wrap them for you.

388
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,322
BALANCE: 3,850,402 WON

389
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,710
THIS CHRISTMAS,
DECLARE YOUR LOVE WITH LOVE ALARM

390
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,838
Mom. What's that?

391
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,924
-What? What's that?
-What's that? Look at that.

392
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,550
That's so pretty.

393
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,760
That's so big.

394
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,221
-What is it? Love Alarm's Christmas event?
-Wow, it's so cool.

395
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,514
It looks so pretty.

396
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,807
-What's that?
-Isn't it pretty?

397
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,724
Yes, it is.

398
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,643
-Do you want a photo?
-Yes.

399
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,605
-It's pretty. It's huge.
-I know, right? Yes.

400
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,440
That's so cool.

401
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,319
It's so pretty.

402
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,862
My gosh.

403
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,281
That's amazing.

404
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,724
Gosh, I'm sorry.

405
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,036
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

406
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,583
Sun-oh.

407
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,924
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

408
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,077
Sun-oh!

409
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,538
<i>The person you're calling</i>
<i>is not available at the moment.</i>

410
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,040
<i>You will be directed to voicemail</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

411
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,837
SUN-OH

412
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,716
<i>Sun-oh, I'm at the hospital,</i>
<i>but I can't find you anywhere.</i>

413
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,093
<i>Where are you?</i>

414
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,762
<i>I heard you went back to Seoul.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

415
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,974
<i>How are you feeling? It hurts, doesn't it?</i>

416
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,768
<i>Call me as soon as you turn on the phone.</i>

417
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,479
Is Sun-oh absent again?

418
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,733
Gosh, he must've gotten seriously injured.

419
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,902
I knew he'd get in trouble
because of Jojo.

420
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,279
"Because of Jojo"?

421
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,780
She acted all weird on Jeju Island.

422
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,616
That accident happened
because he kept spending time with her.

423
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,953
Are you serious?
How is that because of Jojo?

424
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,997
Answer me. How is that because of Jojo?

425
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,373
I'm sorry.

426
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,625
I'm sorry. I asked
because I was just curious.

427
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,383
So he didn't come to school.

428
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,637
Are you okay?

429
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,139
Yes.

430
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,891
I only got hurt a little.

431
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,561
Have you seen Sun-oh by any chance?

432
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:32,648
Ever since his parents came to the ER,
I haven't been able to get hold of him.

433
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,152
He just got discharged,
so things are probably hectic for him.

434
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,489
By any chance,
can you tell me his address?

435
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,790
Give me your cell phone.

436
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,097
<i>What does it mean to like someone?</i>

437
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,852
<i>The person you're calling</i>
<i>is not available at the moment.</i>

438
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,939
<i>You will be directed to voicemail</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

439
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,906
<i>I thought liking someone...</i>

440
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,658
<i>would be...</i>

441
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,536
<i>something nice and pretty.</i>

442
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,000
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU TURN ON THE PHONE

443
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,184
Jojo!

444
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,478
What? Oh, here you go.

445
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,313
I love you.

446
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,667
Every day, I feel as if
I'm fighting a war against myself.

447
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,423
Do you regret...

448
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,925
ringing Sun-oh's Love Alarm?

449
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,678
I'm scared.

450
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,016
I only want Sun-oh to see my good side.

451
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,185
But I keep overthinking things.

452
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,818
Once you start having feelings
for someone, it's hard to turn back.

453
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,655
Do you still like Gul-mi?

454
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,908
She's the first girl I ever liked.

455
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,372
I've never seen anyone as pretty as her.

456
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,419
And it was my first time
wanting to tell someone how I felt.

457
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,964
But of course,

458
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,426
she was also the first person
who hated me that much.

459
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,019
I don't want you to be heartbroken
like I was.

460
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,333
CHON DUK-GU HAS SENT YOU A PHOTO

461
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,002
YOUR CRUSH'S LOVE ALARM WON'T RING
EVEN IF YOUR LOVE ALARM IS ON.

<i>There's no other shield like this</i>
<i>in the entire world.</i>

463
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,218
<i>I figured you might need it.</i>

464
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,262
<i>Take care, Jojo.</i>

465
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,191
SHIELD. YOUR CRUSH'S LOVE ALARM WON'T RING
EVEN IF YOUR LOVE ALARM IS ON.

466
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,277
THERE'S NO OTHER SHIELD LIKE THIS
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

467
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:11,742
THE WEIGHT OF AFFECTION

468
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,723
<i>Sun-oh's parents are not here.</i>
<i>Can you come now?</i>

469
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,585
Hye-yeong.

470
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,586
Come in.

471
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,532
I'll forgive you
for canceling today's schedule.

472
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,285
But you must come to Hope Orphanage
by 1:00 p.m. tomorrow.

473
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,871
-I'm tired.
-The election is right around the corner.

474
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,499
Tell Sun-oh to upload a family photo
on his social media.

475
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,833
Fine.

476
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,212
If Sun-oh keeps on being useless,
just send him back to the US.

477
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,142
I'm sorry.

478
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,320
I'll tell him to call you.

479
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,863
You should go home for now.

480
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,253
<i>Back then,</i>

481
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,590
<i>I felt smaller the more I liked Sun-oh.</i>

482
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,134
<i>And every day...</i>

483
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,555
<i>I became scared of losing him.</i>

484
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,655

24 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE RELEASE

489
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,467
Come in.

490
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,307
Have you sorted out your dorm?

491
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,393
I have to go a few more times.

492
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,521
Why are you going all the way to Busan
when you got into a college in Seoul?

493
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,897
It's so far away.

494
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,649
You already care for so many people.

495
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,983
I want to unburden you a bit.

496
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,946
Thank you for this.

497
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,659
Is it sweet?

498
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,244
Yes, try one.

Why is it so hard to see you?

508
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,661
I might as well go back to the US.

509
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,914
I came outside for a run.

510
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,500
<i>Why are you running out in the cold?</i>

511
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,585
It's not cold if you run.

512
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,711
Gosh.

513
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,797
So how long are you going to run for?

514
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,508
Honey, you look great,
but take one step back.

515
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,510
-Back?
-Yes, just one step.

516
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,303
-Okay.
-What?

517
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,514
Why are there so many cell phones?

518
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,516
-What is it?
-Goodness.

519
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,059
Look.

520
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,449
Honey, what is this? I'm so scared.

521
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,161
Oh, my gosh.

522
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,330
