What?

<i>The Ringing World.</i>

6

A lot of people follow this account.
It's super popular these days.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,629
The illustrations and writings are nice.

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,843
This is from Congressman Hwang Jae-cheol.

9
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,179
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,194
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,614
I just dropped it off.
I'll leave right away.

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,074
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,998

Okay.

34
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,309
You don't have to eat

35
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,312
I'm fine.

36
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,397
Ma'am.

37
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,857
Eat with us.

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,192
I'll eat later. Eat up.

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,075
Having no one ring your Love Alarm
isn't a big deal. Why take your life?

40
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,703
Young people these days are so weak.

41
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,788
Do you have to talk like that?

42
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,914
I mean, people died.

43
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,167
Nobody told them to die.

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,376
It was their choice.

45
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,462
-But 23 people--
-I heard you got an internship.

46
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,547

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,507
MK Group.

48
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,550

49
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,551
Buy more stocks.

50
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,596
They've got a government-funded project
for next year.

51
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,223
Hey,

52
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,475
-let's go out.
-Sun-oh.

53
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,187
Why are you sitting here
if you can't even eat?

54
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,397
These folks don't even care
about how shocked you are.

55
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,571
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,831
I would've taken my own life too.

57
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,294
Can you imagine your Love Alarm
not going off at all your whole life?

58
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,590
It might have.

59
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,385
What?

60
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,013
Maybe not now,

61
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,016
but it might have rung later on
if they had decided to live.

62
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,893
What if it never rings though?

63
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,322
You see,

64
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,866
even if no one ever rings mine,

65
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,661
being able to ring Love Alarm
for the person I like...

66
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,163
will make me happy.

67
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,541
Goodness.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

68
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,796

69

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,436
I wonder about their lives.

72
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,106
Those people who died.

73
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,527
I'm sure they were born
with blessings from their families.

74
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,946
Hey, stop thinking about it.

75
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,698
It'll just upset you.

76
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,492

79
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,875
we're going to drink every bottle of booze
they have here, okay?

80
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,168
Got it?

81
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,339

whatever the heck he wants to do.

Oh, right.

91
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,156
I saw that girl
at a wedding earlier today.

92
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,782
What?

93
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,118
You know, that girl.

94
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,037
The girl with long hair.

95
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,664
The girl you both had a crush on.

96
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,877
Kim Jojo?

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,379
Yes, Kim Jojo.
I remember she had a unique name.

98
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,175
Well, what was she doing at the wedding?

99
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,594
That I don't know.

100
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,387
You know what though?

101
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,181
I might have been mistaken.

102

<i>The autopsies, which were carried out</i>
<i>to determine the exact cause of death,</i>

<i>Thus, we have concluded</i>

140
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,527

166

00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,451
Christmas happens every year.

179
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
But this Christmas is different
from next year's.

180
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,455
Every day is a different day, you know.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,252
Do what you like
and live every day to the fullest.

182
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,505
Don't hold back.

183
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,884
Good night.

184
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,471
What about you, Mom?

185
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,767
Are you living like that yourself?

186
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,812
I'm doing what I like to do,

187
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,773
which is looking after you.

188
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,733
Sweet dreams.

189
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,701
<i>Today's number one trending keyword</i>
<i>is "Love Alarm 2.0."</i>

190
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,413
<i>Last night, Love Alarm C&C</i>
<i>announced that there will be</i>

191
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,042
<i>an extensive update</i>
<i>for the first time since the app's launch.</i>

192
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,668
<i>The new features will be revealed </i>

193
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,588
<i>at the Love Alarm 2.0 launching</i>
<i>presentation on January 8...</i>

194
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,508
Jeez, enough about Love Alarm.
What's the big deal?

195
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,887
Take the food on the table to Gul-mi.
She wants to eat downstairs.

196
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,931
Okay.

197
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,399
I'll begin my live broadcast now.

198
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,819
Ta-da! Hello, everyone.

199
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,072
Welcome to BJ Gul-mi's
awesome shopping mall, Love Mi.

200
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,117
Today, I'll be recommending the most
flattering color for your complexion

201
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,162
based on your undertone,
which can be either warm or cold.

202
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,373
All right. If you have warm undertones,

203
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,042
how about a warm color like this?

204
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,045
Yellow is one of the best colors
for warm undertones.

205
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,631
Now, if you have cool undertones...

206
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,801
Ta-da!
Blue is the best color, without a doubt.

207
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,970
A versatile shirt like this

208
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,805
goes with anything, you know.

209
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,390
This shirt and this blouse.

210
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,309
They're both available on Love Mi.

211
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,188
What? Can't you see that I'm practicing?

212
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,566
Jeez. Didn't you ask me
to bring your food down?

213
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,484
Hey, I want to see it too.

214
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,486
See what? Cut it out.

215
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,740
I heard Yuk-jo opened a shop in Hongdae.

216
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,785
She's even going to the launch event.
Will I ever catch up with her?

217
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,623
Gosh, I have to join
the Love Alarm Badge Club soon.

218
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,709
I guess you know her.

219
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,502
Lee Yuk-jo.

220
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,963
She's Hwang Sun-oh's girlfriend.

221
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,215
I heard they met in the States.

222
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,342
Bring the tray back when you're done.

223
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,763
Hey! Don't forget that you have to watch
the convenience store this evening.

224
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,151
Sun-oh!

225
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,206
LEE YUK-JO

226
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,710
LEE YUK-JO, ENTREPRENEUR
COMPANY: LOVE JO (CEO)

227
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,674
IMAGES

228
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,587
Look at the camera!

229
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,339
Perfect.

230
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,091
Now, strike a pose for me!

231
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,176
Great!

232
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,303
Now, I want you to look bubbly. Nice!

233
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,846
That's great.

234
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,686
That's it.

235
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,816
-Thank you for everything.
-Thank you.

236
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,192
Great job today.

237
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,404
Everyone is already
at the Badge Club House.

238
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,281
Too bad.
I was hoping it'd just be the two of us.

239
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,909
It looks like we'll have to
hang out with them today.

240
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,954
Why do you care about
the Badge Club members?

241
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,123
Let's just call Hye-yeong
and chill together.

242
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,333
We'll even spend Christmas with him?

243
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,549
Do you want to go there?

244
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:49,967
Yes.

245
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,970
All right, then.

246
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,179
Let's go.

247
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,541
Hi, Jojo.

248
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,669
Do you remember me?

249
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,716
I was waiting...

250
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,802
What?

251
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,596
I was waiting for you.

252
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,229
I got to see you,
so I guess I'll get going.

253
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,396
I'll see you around.

254
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,090
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

255
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,928
3,276 USERS LOVE LEE YUK-JO

256
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,357
4,038 USERS LOVE HWANG SUN-OH

257
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,904
Yuk-jo!

258
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,990
Hey, how have you been?

259
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,033
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for you.

260
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,453
-Go ahead, Sun-oh. I'll meet you upstairs.
-Okay.

261
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,152
Sun-oh.

262
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,115
My gosh,
Hye-yeong went to the library today.

263
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,826
Wow, going to the library on Christmas?

264
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
He's like a pervert, don't you think?

265
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,332
This isn't good.
I should set him up with someone.

266
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,167
Why would you do that?

267
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,295
Because you keep talking about him
even when you're with me.

268
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,174
What's his type?

269
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,051
I'm not sure.

270
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,886
We don't talk about those things.

271
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,597
Really? Don't guys talk about girls?

272
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,808
I'm sure you've at least seen his crushes.

273
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,076
Actually, no.

274
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,578
I've never seen any.

275
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,294
ENTER YOUR MESSAGE

276
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,255
Gosh.

277
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,592
HI, IT'S ME, LEE HYE

278
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,556
IT'S COLD OUTSIDE

279
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,782
Jeez.

280
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,869
Come in.

281
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,291
Hye-yeong, dinner's ready.

282
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,293
Okay, great.

283
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,642
MERRY CHRISTMAS, JOJO

284
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,571
Hey, pay for it first.

285
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,414
Jeez, unbelievable.

286
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,874
What now?

287
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,460
That courier guy who comes every day.

288
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,545
Damn it!

289
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,922
That loser rang my Love Alarm just now.

290
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,052
Oh, that guy with the kind face?

291
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,179
He always has a smile on his face.

292
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,809
Do you look down on me too?

293
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,811
-What?
-Do I look like a joke to you?

294
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,605
Cut it out.

295
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,524
I couldn't debut or get into college.
You look down on me

296
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,444
because I'm just stuck in the basement
trying to become a content creator.

297
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,989
Do you seriously think
a courier guy is good enough for me?

298
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,201
Then what kind of guy
is good enough for you?

299
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,621
I'd say the developer of Love Alarm?

300
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,956
Then I'd consider it.

301
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,211
Hey, how are you even going
to meet that man?

302
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,962
I'll join the Badge Club.

303
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,256
They'll get to meet the developer.

304
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,551
Can't you only join when your Love Alarm
has been rung by a ton of people?

305
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,095
There's always a way.

306
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,644
Hye-yeong.

307
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,481
Hey, Sun-oh.

308
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,691
Hye-yeong went out.

309
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,819
This early?

310
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,612
Where did he go?

311
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,597
Take this seat.

312
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,683
No, it's okay.

313
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,979
Hey, wait...

314
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,119
Here.

315
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,954
What is this about?

316
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,456
Have some coffee.

317
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,917
That's not what I was asking.

318
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,129
You saved a seat for me and got me coffee.

319
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,672
What is all this about?

320
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,840
I texted you too.

321
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,678
That was from you?

322
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,181
Seriously, why are you being like this?

323
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,765
You really don't know the answer?

324
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,937
I'm hitting on you.

325
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,859
This is what people used to do
before Love Alarm was launched.

326
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,112
When someone saves a seat for you
and buys you coffee,

327
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,199
you'd stay up all night wondering
if that guy has a crush on you.

328
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,909
Hey, Hye-yeong.

329
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,912
You remember my name.

330
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,878
I want to try this
the old-school way without Love Alarm.

331
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,257
I can keep coming here
until my internship starts.

332
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,718
Take that time and think about...

333
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,720
how you feel about me.

334
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,256
LIVING AS SOMEONE
WHO CAN'T RING IN THE RINGING WORLD

335
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,930
Hey, you're back.

336
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,306
Hey.

337
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,308
Why did you go to the library
all dressed up?

338
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,440
Because I wanted to impress someone.

339
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,236
What? Who is it?

340
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,077
No way.

341
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,038
Not her, right?

342
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,669
It is her, Kim Jojo.

343
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,717
Do you still have feelings for her?

344
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,056
-No.
-I still have feelings for her.

345
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,643
So, I'll figure out what to do about it.

346
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,688
Hey, you know what Jojo did to me.

347
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,940
Don't you remember?

348
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,919
<i>How can this be?</i>

349
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,630
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

350
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,881
<i>I told you.</i>

351
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,216
I don't like you.

352
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,218
How much time do you need?

353
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,222
It still feels like
you have feelings for me.

354
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,066
INCOMING CALL: YUK-JO

355
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,485
Hey.

356
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,487
<i>Sun-oh, are you on your way?</i>

357
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,821
Yes.

358
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,239
I'll call you when I get there.

359
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,325
<i>Okay, sure. Drive safely.</i>

360
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,004
<i>I want to try this</i>
<i>the old-school way without Love Alarm.</i>

361
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,715
<i>I can keep coming here</i>
<i>until my internship starts.</i>

362
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,052
Take that time and think about
how you feel about me.

363
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,378
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

364
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,337
Hye-yeong wasn't lying.

365
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,743
Sun-oh.

366
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,536
Stay away from Hye-yeong.

367
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,958
I can't see him getting his heart broken.

368
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,504
What did I do?

369
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,340
You dumped me.

370
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,846
No, I didn't dump you.

371
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,097
Then tell me.

372
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,975
Why did you do that to me back then?

373
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,187
Back then, I...

374
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,487
See?

375
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,407
You haven't changed one bit.

376
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,868
You just won't tell me anything.

377
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,704
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize.

378
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,250
I thought of all sorts of scenarios
to hate or to understand you.

379
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,920
"I must've done something wrong.

380
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,798
There must've been a reason
why she had to leave me."

381
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,521
So, stay away from Hye-yeong.

382
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,875
<i>Sun-oh.</i>

383
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,168
<i>I'm not okay.</i>

384
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,629
<i>This is so hard for me.</i>

385
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,964
-Jojo, what's wrong?
-We'll die!

386
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,967
<i>-Did she have a seizure or what?</i>
<i>-I knew Jojo would get him in trouble.</i>

387
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,885
<i>"Because of Jojo"?</i>

388
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,220
<i>-She acted all weird on Jeju Island.</i>
<i>-That was scary.</i>

389
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,722
<i>-That accident happened...</i>
<i>-That's freaky.</i>

390
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,932
-<i>because he kept spending time with her.</i>
-Sun-oh.

391
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,018
<i>Have you seen Sun-oh by any chance?</i>

392
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,855
<i>Ever since his parents came to the ER,</i>
<i>I haven't been able to get hold of him.</i>

393
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,609
<i>If Sun-oh keeps on being useless,</i>
<i>just send him back to the US.</i>

394
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,170
FROM CHON DUK-GU

395
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,422
<i>There's no other shield like this</i>
<i>in the entire world.</i>

396
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,425
<i>I figured you might need it.</i>

397
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,223
<i>Every day, I feel as if</i>
<i>I'm fighting a war against myself.</i>

398
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,809
<i>Do you regret...</i>

399
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,228
<i>ringing Sun-oh's Love Alarm?</i>

400
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,732
<i>I'm scared.</i>

401
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,193
THERE'S NO OTHER SHIELD LIKE THIS
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

402
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:31,449
YOUR CRUSH'S LOVE ALARM WON'T RING
EVEN IF YOUR LOVE ALARM IS ON.

403
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,576
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACTIVATE THE SHIELD?

405
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,165
<i>I don't want you to be heartbroken</i>
<i>like I was.</i>

406
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,555
Right, this is for you.

407
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,185
Thanks.

408
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,197
I wanted to make sure you could meet him.

409
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,158
I'm sorry.

410
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,917
I think some people...

411
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,545
take pleasure
in the misfortune of others.

412
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,719
Don't take what others are saying
to heart.

413
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,235
Thanks for taking my side.

414
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,546
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

415
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,882
-Did you enjoy your food?
-The meat was exceptional.

416
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,177
-Great, thank you. Take care.
-Yes, thank you for the great food.

417
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,971
Pack up your stuff and leave.

418
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,389
I'm sorry, sir.

419
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,767
I'll never miss any shifts again.

420
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,226
I couldn't call you because--

421
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,811
Don't you see the new part-timer there?

422
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,650
-My gosh, hello.
-Oh, hello.

423
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,235
I guess you're here for a team dinner.

424
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,153
-Hello.
-Over there.

425
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,131
<i>I like it when people tell me...</i>

426
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,967
<i>that I seem cheerful.</i>

427
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,513
Since my parents passed away
on Jeju Island,

428
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,765
I've been emotionally hurt many times.

429
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,435
Every time I feel hurt,
I consciously try to be more cheerful.

430
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,648
I smile more and study harder...

431
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,859
to make sure I never lose my true self.

432
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,363
From now on, tell me
whenever anyone hurts your feelings.

433
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,741
Don't worry.

434
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,869
I'll continue...

435
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,497
to stay cheerful and strong.

436
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,754
You're real.

437
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,007
Of course I'm real.

438
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,426
Sorry you couldn't get hold of me.

439
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,972
It must've hurt a lot.

440
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,808
My face is okay though.

441
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,935
I can go back to school now.

442
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,771
Good.

443
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,899
What's with that reaction?

444
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,234
I thought you'd be stoked.

445
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,445
I am.

446
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,574
So go home and get some rest now.

447
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,783
No.

448
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,577
I want to keep admiring your beauty.

449
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,789
I couldn't see you for a few days.

450
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,046
Get going now.

451
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,424
All right.

452
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,509
I'll call you.

453
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,679
Okay.

454
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,379
Sun-oh!

455
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,009
I like you!

456
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,872
<i>Sun-oh.</i>

457
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,960
<i>It's not because I don't like you.</i>

458
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,422
<i>I'm just scared.</i>

459
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,051
<i>There's a long road ahead of me.</i>

460
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,890
<i>But I'm just too weak.</i>

461
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,451
<i>That's why...</i>

462
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,291
<i>That's why I'm leaving you behind, Sun-oh.</i>

463
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,480
When will Sun-oh come back to school?

464
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,372
See? I told you not to go to Jeju Island.

465
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,040
Enough.

466
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,917
Does Sun-oh know

467
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,294
that your mom and dad tried to kill you?

468
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,091
Don't ever bring him up again.

469
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,720
Why not?

470
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,472
Who are you to tell me what not to do?

471
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,141
And stop being so disrespectful to me.

472
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,960
Make sure you check
the cigarette inventory.

473
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,302
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, RING THE ALARM

474
