1
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,778
Say that again.

2
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,197
We're seniors now.

3
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,533
I want to focus on my studies.

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,368
So you're breaking up with me?

5
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,787
I'm exhausted.

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,082
And that has changed my feelings for you.

7
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,835
Let's end things here.

8
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,295
You said you liked me.

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,547
How can your feelings suddenly change?

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,923
I don't know,

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,925
but that's what happened.

12
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,807
There must be a reason.

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,476
How will I know if you don't tell me?

14
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,480
Don't talk to me from now on.

15
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,497
Go and eat somewhere else.

16
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,334
Will you go on being like this?

17
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,212
-I feel uncomfortable sitting with you.
-What's going on?

18
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,590
-Wait, what's going on?
-What's with them?

19
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,886
I just don't get it.
How can you not like me anymore?

20
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,054
What's going on?

21
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,722
-Were they together?
-I don't know.

22
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,641
Must I say it again...

23
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,101
in front of everyone?

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,978
I don't believe you.
It doesn't make sense.

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,944
Everyone, get out.

26
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,364
Get out of the ten-meter radius!

27
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,283
-Hwang Sun-oh.
-Didn't you hear me?

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
Everyone, leave, except for Jojo!

29
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,829
-Is he insane?
-Get out!

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997
Hey, let's go. Let's get out.

31
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,125
Get the hell out!

32
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,755
Gosh, seriously.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,344
-He'll cause a scene at this rate.
-Let's go.

34
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,889
LOVE ALARM

35
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,061
Turn on your Love Alarm.

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,821
LOVE ALARM

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,496
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

38
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,757
-Whose was it?
-Which one rang, his or hers?

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,051
-Did only one go off?
-I think so.

40
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,511
Only one of them?

41
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,597
-Did he get dumped?
-I'd be humiliated if I were him.

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,765
-This is mortifying.
-Wasn't it the other way around?

43
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,184
No way.

44
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,060
I can't believe it.

45
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,478
How can this be?

46
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,731
-He got dumped.
-That's amazing.

47
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,024
He's the only one in love.

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,651
-Gosh.
-Only his alarm rang.

49
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,652
How can this be?

50
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,821
I told you.

51
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,241
I don't like you.

52
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,963
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

53
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,341
Jojo.

54
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,928
Please love me again.

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,265
Please.

56
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,275
-He's doomed.
-He's such a loser.

57
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,903
-That's crazy.
-How will he manage to come to school now?

58
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,595
Sun-oh, where are you going?

59
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
My mom must've done something to her.

60
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,140
Hey.

61
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,185
Even if that's true,
you'll only make things worse for her.

62
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,353
So?

63
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,605
Am I supposed to stop seeing her
just like this?

64
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,357
That's not what I mean.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,443
I just don't understand.
How can she change so suddenly?

66
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,362
Hey, Sun-oh.

67
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,419
GO SUN-I

68
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,984
Grandma.

69
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,407
You can't leave me.

70
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,077
If you do,

71
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,123
I'll really be all alone.

72
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,100
Does it show that I'm hiding here?

73
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,192
Most people don't stare at my face
like you do.

74
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,235
What?

75
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,736
You're already talking like me.

76
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,409
Thanks, Sun-oh.

77
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,380
Why are you following me?

78
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,466
You've been following me, right?
Why are you doing this?

79
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,559
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

80
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,361
This is the last time
I'm coming out to see you.

81
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,822
Do you remember this place?

82
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,158
I do.

83
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,458
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

84
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,461
Turn on your Love Alarm.

85
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,765
LOVE ALARM

86
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,396
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

87
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,866
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

88
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,039
How many times must we do this?

89
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,337
Tell me what I did wrong.
I won't do it anymore.

90
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
Sun-oh.

91
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,798
Do you like someone else?

92
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,051
That's not it.

93
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,970
I want to kiss you.

94
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,098
Don't say things like that.
I don't like you anymore.

95
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,393
Look at me.

96
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,688
Look at me!

97
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,196
How much time do you need?

98
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,701
It still feels like
you have feelings for me.

99
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,709
A kiss could bring back those emotions.

100
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,136
Just now,

101
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,224
I came within 9.99m of your lips.

102
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,233
Is it so hard for you
to move a centimeter forward?

103
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,251
You're heartless.

104
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,175
Never...

105
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,552
turn off your Love Alarm again.

106
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,097
And watch...

107
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,684
as my feelings for you change too.

108
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,625
<i>Today's the 50th day</i>
<i>since Love Alarm was launched.</i>

109
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,505
<i>I ended my brief relationship...</i>

110
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,300
<i>with Sun-oh.</i>

111
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,524
<i>Sun-oh.</i>

112
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,864
You dumped me.

113
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,032
No, I didn't dump you.

114
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,119
Then tell me.
Why did you do that to me back then?

115
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,787
Back then, I...

116
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,862
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

117
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,172
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

118
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,758
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

119
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,510
Let's take another photo.

120
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,137
<i>Time passed...</i>

121
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,639
One, two, three.

<i>...as if nothing had ever happened.</i>

<i>Jojo also...</i>

00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>still likes me back.</i>

130
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,087
<i>She likes me back.</i>

131
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,258
<i>She likes me back.</i>

132
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,302
<i>So...</i>

00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,429

<i>is blocking it.</i>

139
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,808
Park Gul-mi.

140
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,689
<i>I received a text that</i>
<i>three million won was transferred.</i>

141
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>The transfer was made at 9:37 a.m. today</i>

142
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:48,280
<i>at an ATM of the Saebong branch.</i>

143
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,449
I'LL TRANSFER THE MONEY TOMORROW MORNING

144
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,493
<i>Your transaction is being processed.</i>

145
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,914
<i>The following amount</i>

<i>Your transaction is being processed.</i>

148
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,055
I'll join the Badge Club.

149
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,683
They'll get to meet the developer.

150
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,769
Can't you only join when your Love Alarm
has been rung by a ton of people?

151
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,604
There's always a way.

152
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,487
<i>The person you're calling</i>
<i>is not available at the moment.</i>

153
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,372
12 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE LAUNCH
OF LOVE ALARM 2.0

154
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,500
Gul-mi took my money.

155
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,419
And?

156
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,756
Gul-mi stole three million won from me.

157
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,802
Why are you here then?

158
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,181
-Go and talk to her.
-You know it's for my college tuition.

159
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,683
How could you say that?

160
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,146
You should've taken better care
of your precious money.

161
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,900
She's not my problem anymore,
so deal with it on your own.

162
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,527
Damn that girl.

163
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,304
<i>Is something up?</i>

164
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,184
KIM JOJO
IS SOMETHING UP?

165
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,658
You could've just...

166
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,701
asked me for the money.

167
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,370
As if you would've given it to me.

168
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,253
Do you really believe the money
will get you into the Badge Club?

169
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,757
Yes, if joining the Badge Club

170
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,760
gets me a chance to meet the developer
of Love Alarm, then I'll do anything.

171
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,804
What can the developer do for you anyway?

172
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,013
Are you kidding me?

173
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,224
Once I meet the developer,

174
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,560
I'll be able to escape
from this wretched place.

175
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,562
How can you be so sure?

176
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,689
The developer will acknowledge my talent!

177
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,692
I'll pay you back soon.

178
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,945
Once I'm in the Badge Club
and my online shopping site

179
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,405
-hits the jackpot--
-Gul-mi,

180
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,657
get your head out of the clouds.

181
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,744
-What?
-Just look at yourself right now.

182
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,794
Hey.

183
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,715
Do you think you're the only one
trying hard in life?

184
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,175
I've tried hard too.

185
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,262
For six years, I danced every day
at the crack of dawn

186
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,306
to debut as an idol singer.

187
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,434
I stayed at the studio the longest
to practice the same song again and again.

188
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,027
Stop acting like
you know everything about me.

189
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,072
All you want is easy fame.

190
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,492
Whether it's being a singer
or joining the Badge Club,

191
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,204
all you want is to get famous quickly
and live a cushy life.

192
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,580
What's so wrong with that?

193
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,291
Why don't you
take a look at yourself instead?

194
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,669
Instead of lecturing me,
look back on your own life.

195
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,548
You're still mooching off me and my mom.
What can be cushier than that?

196
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,385
You hate me, right?

197
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,429
Then leave.

198
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,892
What are you doing?

199
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,644
-Stop it.
-Let go. Damn!

200
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,480
Stop it.

201
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,067
Leave. Get out.

202
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,420
Just go.

203
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,865
Didn't you hear me?

204
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,786
I did.

205
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,082
I can't leave you
all alone like this, though.

206
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,087
It's fine. I don't feel alone.

207
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,174
That's because
you've felt alone for so long...

208
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,093
that you don't even realize
you feel that way.

209
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,643
And how do you know that?

210
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,606
You don't know me well enough to say so.

211
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,982
How can I not know...

212
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,401
when I see it all so clearly?

213
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,703
Have you been to the Han River
on a snowy day?

214
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,757
Go ahead and scream.

215
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,801
What?

216
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,638
Say whatever's bottled up inside.

217
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,480
But then you'll hear it all.

218
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,648
I won't.

219
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,692
So scream at the top of your lungs.

220
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,580
Can you hear me?

221
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,665
What was that?

222
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,973
You shouldn't have done that.

223
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,350
Just look at me.

224
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,771
I have no parents...

225
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,192
and now I'm all alone.

226
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,073
I feel so lonely.

227
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,707
Mom!

228
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,962
I don't want to work.

229
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,673
I don't want to take time off school.

230
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,511
I don't want to live with Aunt either.

231
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,557
Mom!

232
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,105
Still...

233
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,858
Still, I won't crumble.

234
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,778
I'll survive this!

235
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,449
And...

236
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,078
I'll find happiness!

237
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,372
I promise!

238
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:59,140
Hye-yeong, say what's on your mind too.
It's quite satisfying.

239
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,485
Kim Jojo!

240
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,787
Kim Jojo!

241
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,792
Kim Jojo!

242
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:10,587
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK
AND CAN ONLY SAY TO YOU

243
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,016
I like going to the cinema late at night.

244
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,811
There are fewer people,
so it's easier to focus on the movie.

245
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,232
I hear the night view
from Namsan is beautiful,

246
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,652
but I've never seen it,
even though I live in Seoul.

247
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,072
Wait, have you been on
a pirate ship ride in winter?

248
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,657
It's quite cold, but...

249
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,866
Hold on.

250
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,202
What are you trying to say?

251
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,041
I was wondering
how I could make you happy.

252
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,508
I'll get going. You should go too.

253
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,681
Jojo.

254
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,395
Thank you for being alive.

255
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,776
I'll think a bit more...

256
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,570
about what I can do to make you happy.

257
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,316
Hye-yeong!

258
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,613
Take this.

259
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,494
Thank you for today.

260
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,158
I'm only borrowing the money.

261
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:46,868
I'll pay you back.

262
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,413
Damn.

263
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,297
<i>Thank you for being alive.</i>

264
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,716
I'll think a bit more...

265
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,303
about what I can do to make you happy.

266
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,848
<i>Someone who calls my name...</i>

267
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,059
<i>and thinks about...</i>

268
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,311
<i>how to make me happy.</i>

269
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,778
MERRY CHRISTMAS

<i>You too.</i>

282
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,582
Ma'am, I'll eat later.

283
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,417
Sure.

284
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,684
Aunt,

285
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,438
Gul-mi will pay 200,000 won every month
from now on.

286
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,856
What?

287
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,567
That's how you'll pay back what you stole.

288
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,487
Hey.

289
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,156
I told you, I'm just borrowing it.

290
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,409
Also, you'll watch the store for me
when I'm working at the wedding hall.

291
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,203
You'll do that until you pay me back.

292
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,498
Are you insane? Why would I do that?

293
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,249
Mom, what the hell is she saying?

294
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,835
Didn't you hear her?

295
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,462
You'll watch the store for her.

296
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,172
Mom.

297
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,593
I'll be going back to school
next semester.

298
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,222
-Do what you want.
-Mom! Seriously?

299
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,434
Damn it.

300
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,501
Mom, can we find
another place to live now?

301
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,629
Is that what you want?

302
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,424
Yes, we've been living there long enough.

303
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,219
Try this on.

304
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,140
Go on.

305
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,103
You can find another place.
I'm going to stay.

306
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,939
Why?

307
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,984
Why would I live with my full-grown son?
People will talk.

308
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,954
Gosh,

309
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,206
this looks good on you.

310
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,417
Let's buy this one.

311
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:05,877
We'll take this.

312
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,919
Sure thing.

313
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,422
Mom.

314
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,674
Won't you be lonely?

315
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,885
Hye-yeong,

316
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,431
do you know when the most exciting moment
in my life was?

317
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,520
It's when I kicked open the front gate
and left my old house

318
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,024
after yelling at my mom
that I didn't want to live like her.

319
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,735
Mom.

320
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,028
My heart...

321
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,699
pounded in excitement, and I thought
that I'd be able to do anything.

322
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,036
So don't you ever feel sorry.

323
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,873
You're my pride and joy.

324
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,924
Jojo, look at this.

325
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:55,927
What is it?

326
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,973
The representative of Anti-Love Alarm
will also be there.

327
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,018
It's like they're saying
they're embracing even their haters.

328
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,353
Unbelievable.

329
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,274
But why is the artist
of <i>The Ringing World</i> invited?

330
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,901
Out of curiosity, I guess.

331
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,403
The artwork is often mentioned
alongside Love Alarm.

332
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,156
If I knew this would happen,
I would've drawn something too.

333
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,535
<i>The Trembling World. </i>What do you think?

334
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,495
<i>The Trembling World?</i>

335
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,789
You tremble at the sight
of the person you like.

336
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,875
You start trembling if that person
comes within a ten-meter radius.

337
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,710
Gosh. Am I a genius or what?

338
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,264
LOVE ALARM HAS SENT YOU A TEXT

339
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,851

What are you doing here?

343
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,795
I'm heading to Busan
to sort out my things.

344
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,797
I dropped by before I left.

345
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,727
Get going then.

346
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,271
I...

347
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,943
don't have the time or intention
to date anyone,

348
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,531
-so forget about me and--
-You don't have to like me back...

349
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,534
just because I like you.

350
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,037
How's that fair to you?

351
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,415
-Just receiving your love--
-I just...

352
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,419
wanted you to know how I feel.

354
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,226
I hope the new Love Alarm feature

355
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,355
is something that lets me know
how many times I rang your Love Alarm.

356
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,154
What should we wear
to the Love Alarm 2.0 presentation?

357
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,407
There's only about a week left now.

358
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,369
Do you have a theme in mind?

359
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,123
Should we just go back to the US?

360
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,833
Is something wrong?

361
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,214
Nothing.
It's just that I'm bored with everything.

362
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,301
I'm not interested in that event either.

363
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,056
The movie will be starting soon.

364
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,869
Then we won't go.

365
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,082
We don't have to go
to the Love Alarm presentation.

366
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,960
I don't like what you don't like.

367
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,191
<i>Actually,</i>

368
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,611
I deleted Love Alarm a long time ago.

369
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,281
It scared me, you see.

370
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,451
I thought it would complicate things

371
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,369
if I kept ringing your Love Alarm.

372
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,042
I should've just let it ring though.

373
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,631
I should've told you how I felt.

374
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,429
Not being able to see you
made me realize that.

375
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,808
So I made up my mind.

376
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,979
I promised myself
that I'd ring your Love Alarm...

377
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,649
if we met again someday.

378
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:22,985
Hye-yeong.

379
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,033
I...

380
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,871
<i>My Love Alarm can't ring...</i>

381
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>anyone else's.</i>

382
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,001
Can I ring...

383
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,712
your Love Alarm?

384
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,318
Wearing cream-colored clothes
underneath in winter

385
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,238
makes your style a lot more fashionable.

386
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:12,535
Also, it's prettier
with a pair of wide pants.

387
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,167
THIS IS BORING

388
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,211
LET'S SEE HOW FIT YOU ARE
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF

389
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,712
Why should I take my clothes off?

390
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,674
Also, I didn't get plastic surgery.

391
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,300
Stop spreading lies.

392
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,595
I'm not doing this
to beg for your donations.

393
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,055
YOU'D NEVER GET DONATIONS

394
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,557
WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY SHOUTING?

395
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,357
TARGET DONATION
30,000 REMAINING

396
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,571
I think...

397
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,658
I've been scammed
out of three million won.

398
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,203
No one answers when I call that number.

399
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,001
If I came from a wealthy family,
I'd have easily become an idol singer.

400
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,631
Maybe it's because
my complexion is too dark.

401
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,803
I have no luck.

402
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,433
You know,

403
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,603
I want to join the Badge Club too.

404
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,733
I want to meet
the developer of Love Alarm too.

405
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,157
Please help me.

406
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,208
LUVMIKNIGHT IS SENDING
3,000 DONATIONS

407
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,889
9 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE LAUNCH
OF LOVE ALARM 2.0

408
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,478
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>I deleted Love Alarm a long time ago.</i>

409
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,606
<i>It scared me, you see.</i>

410
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,943
<i>I thought it would complicate things</i>

411
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,986
<i>if I kept ringing your Love Alarm.</i>

412
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,198
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

413
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,286
<i>You haven't changed one bit.</i>

414
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,372
<i>You just won't tell me anything.</i>

415
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,174
<i>Let's meet up at the schoolyard</i>
<i>at 4:00 p.m.</i>

416
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,051
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

417
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,111
<i>When is he leaving?</i>

418
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,154
He left right after lunch.

419
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,824
It's not like internships pay much.

420
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,370
So how much is the rent
for studio apartments these days?

421
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,539
Why do you ask? Are you kicking me out?

422
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,001
I never said it was you.
Hye-yeong's the one moving out.

423
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,502
What?

424
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:12,339
Hye-yeong said he'd tell you.
His work is too far from here.

425
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,485
WHEN LOVE ALARM RINGS, EITHER YOU
OR THE PERSON WHO LIKES YOU IS MOVING.

426
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,863
ONE PERSON CAN RING
YOUR LOVE ALARM CONTINUOUSLY

427
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,241
IF THAT PERSON CONTINUES
TO GO IN AND OUT OF THE 10M RADIUS.

428
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,872
BASED ON <i>LOVE ALARM</i> BY CHON KYE YOUNG
