THIS CHRISTMAS,
DECLARE YOUR LOVE WITH LOVE ALARM

00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>Today's the 1,530th day</i>
<i>since Love Alarm was launched.</i>

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,149
-Mom, what's that?
-What?

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,775
-What's that?
-What's that?

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,402
-Look at that.
-That's so pretty.

6
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,696
-That's so big.
-What is it? Love Alarm's Christmas event?

7
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,697
Wow, it's so cool.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>It's a world where you can't hide</i>
<i>your feelings of love.</i>

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,036
-That's so big.
-Yes.

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,245
That's so pretty.

11
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,663
That's so cool.

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,333
-That's so beautiful.
-Very cool.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,169
-It's so white.
-Wow, it's amazing.

14
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,920
-Gosh, it's huge.
-It's really pretty.

15
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,856
Gosh, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:24,667
LOVE ALARM
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

17
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,384
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,807
Hey!

19
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:36,823
4 YEARS AGO
A WEEK AFTER LOVE ALARM'S LAUNCH

20
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,597
LOVE ALARM

MYEONGHYEON CHURCH
YEOLRIM HIGH SCHOOL

22
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,442
-Hey, this is too fast!
-Go, keep going.

23
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,195
-Ouch! You jerks!
-Hey!

24
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,488
This is so much fun.

25
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,626
Hey, is he coming? Did you call him?

26
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,835
Gosh, I don't know.

27
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,128
Have you heard from him?

28
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,214
Hey, he's here.

29
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,548
Look over there.

30
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,137
Hey. Since one big stride
is about one meter,

31
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,933
if you get to about there,
you should be within a ten-meter radius.

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,100
Right.

33
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,811
Hey, Ji-yeon. Is your Love Alarm on?

34
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,980
I'll turn it on now. Wait.

35
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,818
Gosh, I'm so nervous.
What if only mine rings?

36
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,779
Then I'll go inside the radius with you.

37
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,447
Gosh. Hey, that's not a good idea.

38
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,157
Then we won't know whose phone rang.

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,201
-Go on. Hurry up.
-You'll be fine.

40
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,369
I'll go, then.

41
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,162
Go.

42
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,121
Good luck!

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,833
My gosh!

44
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,184
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, RING THE ALARM

45
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,940
SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU RANG LOVE ALARM

46
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,652
Hey, look. It rang.

47
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,698
See? I told you Love Alarm would
go off between Ji-yeon and Seong-jun.

48
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,325
Gosh, I knew their alarms would ring.

49
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,911
-Hey, see?
-I was right. I was totally right.

50
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,205
Oh, my.

51
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,332
Who's going to ring my Love Alarm though?

52
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,294
Hey, don't say that!
You have such a cute smile.

53
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,087
You think I have a cute smile?

54
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,547
In what way, exactly?

55
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,632
-How cute?
-I take it back.

56
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,926
-How cute is it? Tell me.
-No, forget it.

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,594
Come on. Tell me.

58
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,266
Hey, how come you don't have Love Alarm?

59
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,184
Is this version incompatible?

60
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,061
I don't need it.

61
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,357
Hey, then what about Il-sik? He can't even
ring Love Alarm with you.

62
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,359
Gosh, why does that matter?

63
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,112
You should break up if it doesn't ring.
Why bother dating him?

64
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,449
Why don't you just ask your mom
to get you a new phone?

65
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,702
Gosh, I want to live away from my mom
like you do.

66
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,414
-Your aunt never nags you, right?
-Gul-mi nags me though.

67
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,833
-Right, I forgot about that.
-That's right.

68
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,962
Hey, you'll visit your parents' place
on our school trip to Jeju, right?

69
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,591
Take me and Il-sik too. Let's get
your mom to cook us something nice.

70
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,678
Hey, you'll be late. You should hurry.

71
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,721
Bye, then.

72
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,558
Oh, right. Hey, you have to transfer
to my academy next month, okay?

73
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,769
All right. Bye.

74
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,559
Isn't it nice to be back after two years?

75
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,728
There's somewhere you have to go, though.

76
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,439
Here.

HWANG JAE-CHEOL

78
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,903
Well, Ms. Jeong asked me
to take just one photo.

79
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,738
So...

80
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,659
Hey, don't.
Do you have to do that here? Gosh.

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,496
<i>Where are you?</i>

82
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,164
<i>What are you up to?</i>

83
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,376
<i>What are you doing?</i>

84
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,382
He was number three last time.

85
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,009
How much money did he spend?

86
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,935
<i>I'm Hwang Jae-cheol, candidate number one</i>
<i>from the Future Korea Party!</i>

87
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,563
I wanted to share...

88
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,605
Go, number one!

89
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,650
...my goals and vision with you all.

90
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,405
My dear fellow citizens,
all the values that you wish to protect,

91
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,740
I will protect them for you.

92
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,410
-Please put your faith in me!
-There are many people here.

93
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,203
You can get out now.

94
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,247
I'll break down conservatism
and ideologies,

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,000
and I promise you that I'll become

96
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,544
a warmhearted, trustworthy politician
for you all!

Where's Hye-yeong?

102
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,807
Where is he now?

103
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,117
-That's how it should be done!
-That's impressive.

104
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,161
-Cheers, everyone!
-Cheers!

105
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,704
-Great work.
-Let's drink up!

106
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,414
Yes. Great job, everyone.

107
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,625
-How about karaoke after this?
-Okay, great!

108
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,631
Eat up.

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,925
Eat up.

110
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,678
-This is delicious.
-Try some garlic as well.

111
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,847
Cheers, everyone!

112
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,516
Guys, this is on me.

113
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,436
-The next round is on me, then.
-We'll go to a karaoke bar!

114
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,147
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

115
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,233
Two more servings, please.

116
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,360
-Sure, two more servings?
-Yes, please.

What's this place?

119
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,379
You asked me to take you to Hye-yeong.
He works part-time here, you know.

120
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,673
He works part-time?

121
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,008
Yes.

122
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,552
You didn't know?

123
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,681
Well, I assumed he had told you.

124
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,812
There he is.

125
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,532
I didn't know...

126
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,242
he smoked.

129
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,482
What?

130
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,192
Why is he going that way?

131
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,527
-Hey!
-Min-jae.

132
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,738
Don't call him.

133
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,200
Right, okay.

Look at you, Sun-oh.

Hey, when did you become so tall?

137
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,174
It's you who hasn't grown.

138
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,468
Why did you ignore my calls and texts?

139
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,053
Come on, why do you think?

140
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,056
SPICY CUP NOODLE

141
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,390
I got the things that you like.

142
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,480
Why are you back so late?
You knew I was coming back today.

143
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,816
I work part-time at a barbecue place.

144
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,277
-Is that the only reason?
-Yes.

145
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,116
How was life in the US?

146
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,660
Jeez, get off me. You stink.

147
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,745
-Doesn't the barbecue smell nice?
-No.

148
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,413
I'm back, so quit that job.

149
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,294
Aren't you coming inside?

150
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,589
Get some rest.

151
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,083

00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,399
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, RING THE ALARM

Wake Sun-oh up.
Ms. Jeong is already awake.

155
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,380
Okay.

156
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,975
Hey, you jerk.

157
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,726
Do you have a death wish?

158
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,270
-You piece of...
-You have a huge bed.

159
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,897
-Why sleep here?
-You asshole.

160
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,232
-Hey, stop.
-Hey.

161
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,984
I was sound asleep.

162
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,652
Why, you little...

163
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,445
You jerk!

164
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,282
<i>Isn't that Love Alarm?</i>

165
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,159
-What's going on?
-Is it Love Alarm?

166
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,160
Over there, I think.

167
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,246
-Wasn't that Love Alarm?
-What's up? It's Love Alarm!

168
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,664
Where did it go off?

169
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,999
-Over there.
-Oh, my gosh.

170
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,251
Who's that guy?
My gosh, which class is he in?

171
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,212
Wow, he's so good-looking. Goodness.

172
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,381
Look at him. Gosh.

173
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,050
-Look at that face. Is he for real?
-Seriously.

174
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,262
-He's so hot.
-No wonder Love Alarm is ringing madly.

175
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,514
-Which class?
-Which class is he in?

176
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,020
-He's gorgeous.
-That guy is so good-looking.

177
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,150
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

178
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,490
He's really handsome.

179
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,374
-That's Hwang Sun-oh!
-Unbelievable.

180
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,753
-Goodness, look at that guy.
-I know.

181
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,384
Are you all right?

182
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,927
NO GLORY WITHOUT PAIN

183
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,143
Hey, Jojo.

184
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,812
Did you see my hip throw?

185
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
What? Yes.

186
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,067
Whatever. I know you didn't see it.

187
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,861
-I'm sure it was great. You're--
-Oh, right. Hold on.

188
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,159
I installed Love Alarm too.

189
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,411
Oh, really?

190
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,955
Everyone's done it.
You should install it too.

191
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,749
Well, my phone's version is--

192
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,876
Let's show our friends
our alarms going off.

193
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,544
Why should we do that?

194
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,130
Everyone does it.
It'd be nice to jump on the bandwagon.

195
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,051
Whatever, cut it out.
The teacher wants to see you.

196
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,344
-Now?
-Yes.

197
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,097
Hey, why do you keep trying
to come between us?

198
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,974
What are you talking about?
Hey, you reek of sweat. Go away.

199
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,519
That's only natural.
I just finished my training session.

200
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,104
Whatever. You stink. Go away.

201
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,563
Why, you little...

202
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,023
-I should just...
-What?

203
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,708
KIM JOJO

204
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,654
So, there's no specific reason.

205
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,618
You don't want to go to Jeju Island
because you're from there. Is that it?

206
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,580
Yes. I mean, you could say that.

207
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,374
The trip isn't mandatory, so fine.

208
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,459
Why do you not eat school lunch?

209
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,089
I'm on a diet.

210
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,842
Keeping this figure
does require some effort, you see.

211
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,180
-You may leave.
-Thank you.

212
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>Ms. Lee.</i>

213
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,278
<i>You know Jojo's cousin, right?</i>
<i>The girl who lives with Jojo.</i>

214
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,446
<i>Isn't she in your class?</i>

215
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,281
-You mean Gul-mi?
-Yes.

216
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,658
Did she pay the school lunch fees?

217
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,076
Yes, she did.

218
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,661
Why do you ask?

219
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,920
GRADE 11 SCHOOL TRIP CONSENT FORM
PRINCIPAL OF YEOLRIM HIGH SCHOOL

220
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,047
NOT PARTICIPATING

221
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,538
Hey, Jojo.

222
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,251
Look at this.

223
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,461
Isn't he so hot?

224
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,882
Who knew Hwang Sun-oh
would transfer to our school?

225
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,389
You know who Hwang Sun-oh is, right?

226
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,556
What?

227
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,392
No, I don't.

228
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,105
He was a model for <i>Seventeen.</i>
His mom is Jeong Mi-mi.

229
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,315
I think he looks so-so.

230
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,651
Come on. Il-sik's the one who looks so-so.

231
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,406
Does it taste all right?

232
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,949
It's freaking tasty.

233
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,784
Hey, Han-sol. What's up?

234
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,369
Hey.

235
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,162
-What?
-Why did you install Love Alarm?

236
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,580
-It'll never ring, anyway.
-Hey!

237
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,748
Look who's talking.

238
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,709
Hey, mine is weird though.
Why isn't it ringing?

239
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,961
My friend, your phone isn't the problem.

240
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,462
Guys, can you try ringing me?

241
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,799
<i>Where are you?</i>

242
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,467
<i>The schoolyard.</i>

243
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,429
<i>Why are you there already?</i>
<i>I told you to wait for me.</i>

244
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,848
<i>Hurry up.</i>

245
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,774
Gosh, my back. Why didn't you dodge?

246
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,110
-Because I have you.
-You're crazy.

247
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,494
Hey, if you scar his face, it'll cost you
a fortune. Do you know that?

248
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,542
Oh, right. Hey.

249
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,422
Gosh. Right from the first day.

250
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,842
-How does it feel?
-What about you?

251
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,802
How often does yours ring?

252
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,346
I didn't download it.

253
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,638
Jojo!

254
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,141
Hey, I'm here too.

255
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,435
-It's not for you.
-Jang-go is here too.

256
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,603
-What's that?
-What is it?

257
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,854
-It's for Jojo.
-Give me one.

258
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,606
-Not a chance. Jojo, have a mango.
-Thanks.

259
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,816
-Give me one, too.
-No way. There's none for you.

260
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,901
Do you want mine?

261
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,070
-It's yours, Jojo.
-There's more. I want one.

262
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,738
-This is hers, too.
-I see more. Come on.

263
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,406
Download Love Alarm.

264
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,324
Jojo.

265
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,619
Hey, mine will ring like crazy
if I download it.

266
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,662
But every time it rings,
you'll ask me who--

267
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,624
Just download it
so that I can find out who it is.

268
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,167
-Then what?
-I'll teach her a lesson,

269
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,794
saying, "Who are you to like Hye-yeong?"

270
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,254
Gosh, you're such a stalker.

271
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,715
Hey, let me enjoy some love
from girls too, okay?

272
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,133
Hye-yeong, let go.

273
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,095
Hey, let's go to an internet café.

274
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,930
I changed my LoL skin. It's awesome.

275
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,183
You don't have time for that.
What about the national tournament?

276
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,352
I've got that under control.

277
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,270
Gosh, you're going to be a muscly idiot.

278
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,231
That's what you want, isn't it?

279
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,358
-You're just an idiot. You idiot.
-What the...

280
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,943
ALARM

281
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,403
-Muscly idiot.
-Why, you little...

282
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,154
-Shall I punch you?
-Shut up, buff fatty.

283
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,781
You're a muscly moron.

284
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,792
-Look at that. Over there.
-What's that?

285
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,960
-What's that?
-Look at that.

286
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,295
-What's that?
-What is it? Isn't that Love Alarm?

287
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,839
Where's your phone? Quick.

288
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,799
Gosh, my heart is fluttering.

289
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,467
-That's so cool.
-My gosh.

290
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,553
-That's really cool.
-That's Love Alarm.

291
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,097
-That's so cool.
-Let me take a picture.

292
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,306
Amazing!

293
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,353
-Look.
-Let's take a photo.

294
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,813
-Amazing.
-It's so pretty.

295
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,107
-Hey, what's that? Oh, my.
-What's that?

296
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,151
-Will this be on the news?
-It's so pretty.

297
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,402
Isn't that Love Alarm?

298
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,404
I bet it can be seen most clearly
from our school.

299
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,157
-My gosh.
-Make sure you take good photos.

300
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,743
-What is that?
-That's amazing.

301
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,537
-How is that possible?
-How pretty.

302
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,664
-Incredible.
-How did they make that?

303
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,129
-How could a cloud look like that?
-It's so beautiful.

304
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,225
I did that. I made it.
I drew that cloud in the sky.

305
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,903
-Jojo, look at that.
-What?

306
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,071
That's a heart-shaped cloud there.

307
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,072
-Yes.
-Do you see it?

308
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,657
-I'm looking at it too.
-Well...

309
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,201
Keep looking at it, then.

310
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,785
We can look at it together.

311
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,303
What the heck?
Hey, Ji-hye's Love Alarm rang again.

312
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,388
-Show us.
-Guys, gather here!

313
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,806
-Hey! Gather now or--
-Hurry!

314
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,101
Hey, who is it? Which one of you?
Guys, I know it was one of you.

315
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,896
Hey, show us. Show us your phones!

316
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,189
Come on!

317
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,524
Everyone's going crazy.

318
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,195
Gosh. Remember that cloud we saw earlier?

319
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,030
It was to celebrate ten million downloads.

320
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,866
Love Alarm's promotions
are so large-scale.

321
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,661
Gosh, apparently
it could only be seen from our school.

322
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,915
Seriously? It felt as if the cloud
was giving me a signal.

323
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,417
Hey, wake up.

324
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,045
Had that been a signal,
it would've been for me.

325
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,968
That's Hwang Sun-oh.

326
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,011
-My goodness.
-He's so handsome.

327
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,097
I should download Love Alarm too.

328
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,723
Really? You said trainees can't...

329
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,977
Hey, Duk-gu!

330
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,688
Watch where you're going.

331
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,148
Look at him smirking again.

332
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,984
I can't stand him.

333
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,372
<i>The Tottenham-Liverpool match</i>
<i>is tomorrow, right?</i>

334
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,748
Let's watch it in your room.

335
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,126
I don't think I can watch it.
I'm working tomorrow.

336
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,377
Quit that job.

337
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,921
-I can't.
-Why not?

338
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,549
My bike chain keeps breaking,
so I need a new one.

339
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,093
Just use my bike.

340
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,431
I'd be too scared to ride yours.
It's as expensive as a car.

341
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,974
Then I'll buy you a new one.

342
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,892
Which model do you want?

343
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,687
Why do you always offer to buy me stuff?

344
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,150
It's not like I work for your family.

345
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,374
-Min-jae.
-Yeah?

346
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,334
Follow her.

347
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,919
-Who?
-That girl.

348
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,547
-Hey.
-Oh? Hey, that girl...

349
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,049
The girl Hye-yeong has a crush on.

350
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,259
Am I wrong?

351
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,845
Am I wrong?

352
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,267
You're wrong.

353
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,272
Even without Love Alarm,
you make it so obvious.

354
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,031
Aren't you driving?

355
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,949
Yes, I am.

356
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,771
What?

357
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,940
Do her parents own that building?

358
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,151
Whoa, Hye-yeong.

359
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,697
I guess she is.
Hye-yeong has high standards.

360
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,686
She has a boyfriend.

361
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,522
What's that got to do with you liking her?

362
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,274
You know what.

363
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,153
They obviously like each other.

364
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,864
Not all couples like each other.

371
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,971
Aunt, I can pay
for my school lunch myself.

372
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,902
But I'll be starting classes
at an academy next month,

373
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,529
so you'll have to hire my replacement.

374
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,908
And this Thursday is the 17th
of the month, so--

375
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,117
You have to...

376
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,286
do everything you want to do, don't you?

377
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,732
Hye-yeong.

378
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,777
Does it feel nice to sweat
so early in the morning?

379
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,697
Yes, feel my muscles.

380
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,867
It wasn't because
you hated coming with me?

381
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,327
How could I hate you?

382
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,790
You'll never hate me? No matter what I do?

383
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,292
That's right, dude.

384
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,460
Hey, don't ruin my hair.

385
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,045
You'll ruin my hair!

386
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,630
Gosh, seriously.

387
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,911
Can you light the grill
for table number six?

388
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,677
You should lose about four kilos.

389
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,267
You look okay in person,
but the camera always adds weight.

390
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,854
Watch what you eat.

391
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,192
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,903
Don't call me "ma'am."
It makes me sound old.

00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,322

Hey, Min-jae.

Hey,

414
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,253
when you stormed out of the car
yesterday, I totally thought

415
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,796
you were going to do something.

416
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,423
But what was that?

417
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,675
You want to see me and Sun-oh fight,
don't you?

418
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,136
Cut it out.
If you like that girl, just go for it.

419
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,096
Why do you keep just watching her
from afar?

420
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,765
I told you. You've got the wrong idea.

421
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,226
What are you going to do
if Sun-oh falls for her?

422
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,062
What do you mean?

423
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,438
Who knows?

424
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,106
To tell you the truth,

425
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,525
my biggest worry is
you two falling for the same girl.

426
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,236
I mean, which one of you will give her up?

427
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,240
Min-jae, what are you talking about?
Is a girl an object that you can give up?

428
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,286
That lucky girl will have to choose
one of us.

429
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,664
Aren't you getting in?

430
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,543
I've been working hard to bulk up
my thighs, so I must maintain them.

431
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,337
I'm off.

432
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,970
Oh, right. Come out
as soon as your class is over.

433
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,224
You need to do your hair
before the 5 p.m. appointment.

434
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,435
-The 5 p.m. appointment?
-For Ms. Jeong's book.

she's a total celebrity, isn't she?

438
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,698
Jeez.

439
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,665

-Look straight ahead.
-They'll upload the video on YouTube.

00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,326
-They're dancing in unison.
-Form a line here.

00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,290

00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,807

00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,332
Here.

522
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,043
Good.

523
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,302
One more, eat up.

524
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,763
There.

525
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,545
<i>Jojo, where are you?</i>

526
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,552
<i>Hey, why aren't you here yet?</i>

527
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,137
<i>You have a shift today.</i>

528
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,391
<i>You've read my texts.</i>
<i>Why aren't you replying?</i>

529
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,275
<i>I've already told Aunt. Can't you cover...</i>

530
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,904
<i>You'd better run here now,</i>
<i>or my mom will be so mad at you.</i>

531
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,246
POWER OFF

532
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,646
Why are you following me?

533
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,398
You've been following me, right?

534
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,816
Why are you doing that?

535
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,693
Why do you think I'm following you?

536
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,112
I'm going this way too.

537
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,206
Why are you going this way, though?
Aren't you going home?

538
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,921
How do you know where I live?

539
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,507
Do you not want to go home?

540
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,177
I don't want to go home, either.

541
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,149
That's strange.

542
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,568
What's strange?

543
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,570
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

544
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,781
Is your Love Alarm off?

545
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,577
-No.
-You're an odd one.

546
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,371
You're being ridiculous.

547
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,623
I'm "odd"
because I don't have a crush on you?

548
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,839
If you keep following me,
I'll assume you're interested in me.

549
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,371
Wait.

550
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,916
I've got something to say.

551
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,466
Let's talk over here.

552
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,642
Go ahead. What do you want to say?

553
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,408
Do you want to kiss?

554
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,244
You must be crazy.

555
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,705
I guess you're joking, but it's not funny.

556
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,498
I'm not joking.

557
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,378
If you have nothing else to say, I'm off.

558
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,297
Where are you going?

559
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,678
I'm busy. I have work today.

560
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,889
Why do you have to work?

561
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,321
There's no one else to do it, that's why.

562
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,576
Right, you probably have no idea
what it's like.

563
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,620
I mean, you live in a mansion.

564
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,538
"Mansion"?

565
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,206
Your family is well-off.

566
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,802
We are, but my family is embarrassing.

567
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,847
I don't want to talk about them.

568
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,019
What about you?

569
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,731
I'm...

570
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,612
I don't have any parents.

571
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,490
So I have to work to support myself.

572
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,909
-You don't have parents?
-That's right.

573
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,286
Not everyone does.

574
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,837
Then don't talk about your family.

575
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,714
No one will know,

576
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,925
unless you talk about it first.

577
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,234
What?

578
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,988
You like me, don't you?

579
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,491
Then why act like you don't?

580
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,289
No, I don't.

581
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,667
If you turn on your Love Alarm again...

582
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,504
Yes, you do.

583
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,551
-Whatever.
-Otherwise, why did you follow me here

584
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,094
without even knowing what I'd do?

585
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,888
That's because you said
you had something to say...

586
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,435
Can I kiss you?

587
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,191
You weren't even listening.
That's all you were thinking about, right?

588
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,527
Right. I wasn't listening.

589
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,863
That was all I was thinking about.

590
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,579
You have beautiful lips.

591
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,333
I have a boyfriend.

592
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:50,881
I know.

593
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,885
He's also a good fighter.

594
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,057
If Il-sik finds out about this,
he'll beat you to a pulp.

595
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,185
I'll get beaten up, then.

596
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:36,009
<i>If I had Love Alarm on me then,</i>

597
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,553
<i>would it have gone off?</i>

598
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,640
<i>No.</i>

599
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,311
<i>Both of ours would have stayed silent.</i>

600
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,689
<i>Because the urge to kiss...</i>

601
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,775
<i>came...</i>

602
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,985
<i>before love...</i>

603
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,987
<i>for both of us.</i>

604
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,908
<i>Like the flash of lightning...</i>

605
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,744
<i>before it thunders.</i>

606
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,248
THE FLASH OF LIGHTNING
BEFORE IT THUNDERS

607
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,422
"TO LOVE" MEANS TO HAVE ROMANTIC FEELINGS
FOR SOMEONE

608
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,926
THE OTHER PERSON SHOULD TURN ON LOVE ALARM
IN ORDER FOR YOURS TO RING

609
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:23,390
ONLY YOU CAN KNOW WHETHER
YOUR LOVE ALARM IS TURNED ON OR NOT

610
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,770
BASED ON <i>LOVE ALARM</i> BY CHON KYE YOUNG
