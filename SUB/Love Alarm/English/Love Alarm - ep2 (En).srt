1
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,056
<i>If I had...</i>

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>Love Alarm on me then,</i>

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>would it have gone off?</i>

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,607
<i>No.</i>

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,944
<i>Both of ours would have stayed silent.</i>

6
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,948
<i>Because the urge to kiss...</i>

7
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,075
<i>came before love...</i>

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>for both of us.</i>

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>Like the flash of lightning...</i>

10
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>before it thunders.</i>

11
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,136
Shoot.

12
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,730
Hi, Mom.

13
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,109
Hye-yeong, are you with Sun-oh?

14
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,779
Is that so?

15
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,449
If you get hold of him,
tell him to get home quickly.

16
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,285
Okay.

17
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,504
It will thunder now.

18
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,215
Gosh.

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,510
How did you know?

20
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,556
You learn in grade school
that light travels faster than sound.

21
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,641
Didn't you?

22
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,185
I was a model.

23
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,896
So?

24
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,648
I'm just saying.

25
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,114
Hey, it's raining.

26
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,897
I'm sorry I'm late.

27
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,400
Had you been here
for the last three hours,

28
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,985
I would have made 90,000 won more.

29
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,156
Until when should I suffer
for an old woman I'm not even related to?

30
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,493
I'll work extra shifts on the weekend.

31
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,373
DETAILS OF TRANSACTION
INTEREST PAYMENT

32
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,333
You've been paying me back for 11 years,

33
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,502
but you still have half of it left.

34
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,797
This...

35
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,882
is the debt your mom left behind.

36
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,344
You'll work more on the weekend?

37
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,222
Go on then.

38
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,392
Go in.

39
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,158
My mom wears that
even when she goes to sleep.

40
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,420
Isn't it so tiny?

41
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,215
Can you believe
someone can actually fit into it?

42
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,388
Why are you home so late?
Your mom was upset.

43
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,099
When was she ever not?

44
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,188
Still, you could have been
a good son for an hour.

45
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,524
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's change the subject.

46
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,818
Like what?

47
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,030
You like Jojo, don't you?

48
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,949
You're crazy.

49
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,701
Are you at it again?

50
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,787
Yes. I'll ask until you answer me.

51
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,082
I told you, I don't like her.

52
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,168
Are you sure?

53
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,422
Why do you keep asking?
You won't believe me anyway.

54
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,476
I kissed Jojo.

55
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,339
Get changed. You'll catch a cold.

56
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,387
IL-SIK: OKAY?
3 MISSED CALLS FROM IL-SIK

57
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,280
<i>Jojo, I only spent an hour</i>
<i>at the internet caf√© and then worked out.</i>

58
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,531
<i>Aren't I a good boy?</i>

59
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,701
<i>I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

60
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,327
<i>Okay?</i>

61
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,496
Aren't you going to answer me?

62
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,749
What a persistent jerk.

63
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,542
Will you keep doing this?

64
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,377
Tell me.

65
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,296
Do you really not like Jojo?

66
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,853
What about you?

67
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,817
Why did you kiss her?

68
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,032
I'll answer your question
if you answer mine.

69
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>This 1-minute-and-27-second-long video</i>

70
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,264
<i>was uploaded on the afternoon of the 16th</i>
<i>on the internet.</i>

71
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,060
<i>In the video, there's a heart-shaped cloud</i>
<i>above a high school in Seoul.</i>

72
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,481
<i>This cloud was seen from</i>
<i>around 12:30 p.m. until 1 p.m.</i>

73
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,817
<i>for approximately 30 minutes.</i>

74
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,152
<i>Much speculation followed,</i>

75
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,698
<i>and it turned out this cloud was launched</i>
<i>by the application company</i>

76

<i>that developed Love Alarm to celebrate</i>
<i>its number of users exceeding ten million.</i>

77

78
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,251
-<i>is present within a 10m radius.</i>
-Good morning.

79
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,254
<i>The developer of this application</i>
<i>remains anonymous to this day.</i>

80
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,007
<i>Experts in application development</i>

81

<i>in the foreign markets as well.</i>

82
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,179
Other kids take acting
and dancing classes.

83
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,223
Why can't I get vocal lessons?

84
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,767
You know they cost a fortune.

85
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,603
Next year. I'll let you take
those lessons next year.

86
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,273
Gosh. Whatever. You always say
we have no money.

87
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,358
Hey.

88
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,611
How many times did it go off?

89
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,697
-What?
-Your Love Alarm.

90
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,409
-How many alerts did you get?
-I didn't get any.

91
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,290
It'll be crazy at school today.
I downloaded Love Alarm.

92
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,917
Why would you download it?
It'll be a bother.

93
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,336
I don't care if losers ring my Love Alarm.

94
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,548
I'm way out of their league, Mom.

95
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,633
I'll see you later.

96
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,427
Hwang Sun-oh.

97
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,431
I would say he's the only one
who suits me.

98
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,807
Who is he?

99
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,392
He's a new student at my school.

100
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,061
He used to be a quite successful model.

101
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,481
Hwang Sun-oh.

102
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,775
He'll ring my Love Alarm today.

103
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,441
Are you all right?

104
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,623
Is this hard?

105
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,085
Hey, when should we go shopping?

106
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,088
We're going to Jeju Island.
Let's get some proper photos.

107
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,840
We take plenty of photos every day.

108
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,801
It's not the same
as taking photos on Jeju Island.

109
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,928
You'll come too, right?

110
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,973
Well, I have to go to the academy.

111
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,310
What's famous in Jeju Island?
You must know a lot.

112
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,688
I don't know much.

113
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,275
What was that?

114
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,234
Was it Love Alarm?

115
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,320
Jojo.

116
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,864
What is he doing here?

117
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,490
-Gosh.
-It's Il-sik.

118
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,242
It was him.

119
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,204
You're not mad anymore, are you?

120
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,626
I like it now that you have Love Alarm.

121
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,711
What?

122
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,839
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

123
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,552
I'll go now.

124
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,430
-Class is starting.
-I'll give it to you later.

125
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,639
See you later.

126
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,894
When did you download Love Alarm?

127
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,187
There's someone
who likes you here too, right?

128
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,858
-No, I didn't...
-I'm sure there is.

129
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,944
Guys like quiet girls like Jojo.

130
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,366
I think this is right for the last one.

131
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,201
-He's so cool.
-Who is he?

132
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,828
-Why is he here?
-He's Hwang Sun-oh.

133
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,121
He's Hwang Sun-oh?

134
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,081
-Is his face for real?
-Oh, my gosh.

135
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,500
-He's so hot.
-I am totally going to marry him.

136
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,668
Hey, get out of the way.

137
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,170
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

138
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,005
Gosh, stop it. You're annoying.

139
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,298
Why are you still here?

140
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,674
Let's go.

141
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,052
What are you looking at?

142
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,346
My gosh, it's Sun-oh.

143
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,639
What do I do?

144
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,643
-He's so good looking.
-I know.

145
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,730
Sun-oh is just too handsome, isn't he?

146
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,109
-He's so handsome. It's crazy.
-Hey, stop drooling over him.

147
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,782
-Did you get an alert?
-My gosh.

148
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,783
That's awesome.

149
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,992
-Amazing.
-Is it Sun-oh?

150
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,161
-Seriously? Is it Sun-oh?
-Is it?

151
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,205
-Sun-oh rang Gul-mi's Love Alarm.
-Seriously?

152
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,581
-Who is it?
-Park Gul-mi.

153
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,832
-Park Gul-mi?
-Do you know him?

154
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,542
He must know me.

155
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,587
Similar types of people
attract each other.

156
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,880
I doubt it's him.

157
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,675
His alarm rang so much yesterday,
so a teacher told him to turn it off.

158
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,592
-I'm jealous.
-Look.

159
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,719
His doesn't ring at all
when there are so many girls.

160
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,054
Who is it then?

161
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,973
There must be someone else.
You're popular.

162
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,809
-They make a good couple, though.
-Yes.

163
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,481
Goodness, it's not Sun-oh. It's Duk-gu.

164
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,275
Did Duk-gu ring Gul-mi's Love Alarm?

165
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,193
Gosh.

166
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,445
Look at Gul-mi's face. Oh, no.

167
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,780
What is she going to do?

168
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,116
-Seriously.
-Duk-gu...

169
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,617
Oh, my gosh.

170
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,746
Oh, no.

171
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,665
It's suddenly turned into a tragedy.

172
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
Is there a chance for me
to get Sun-oh now?

173
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,003
I feel sorry for Gul-mi now.

174
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,715
-What do you mean, "sorry"?
-Duk-gu is such a loser.

175
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,092
-Sorry, my ass.
-Oh, my gosh.

176
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,802
-I'm doomed.
-It's okay.

177
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,349
Don't you have anything to tell me?

178
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,735
I'm sorry. You go first.
I forgot my textbook.

179
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,550
3RD CLASS IN MUSIC ROOM

180
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,279
That was the bell. Come on!

181
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,993
Gosh, you startled me.

182
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,215
Why are you avoiding me?

183
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,383
When did I ever do that?

184
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,219
You ran away from me earlier.

185
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,848
-Did you see that?
-Yes.

186
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,686
Why?

187
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,439
Because your heart flutters?

188
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,571
I don't even know your number.

189
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,406
Give me your phone.

190
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,248
Wait.

191
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,626
Not now.

192
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,336
Why not?

193
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,257
I have something to do first.

194
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,135
Then when will it be?

195
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,055
Later.

196
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,890
How much later?

197
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,594
<i>Okay, Jojo.</i>

198
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,929
<i>I'll work out hard. See you later.</i>

199
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,599
Is it Il-sik? What's up?

200
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,852
-It's actually--
-Who's talking in class?

201
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,812
Kim Jojo.

202
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,982
Let's go again.

203
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,652
Let me share your book.

204
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,868
I thought you went to get yours.

205
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,424
TOILET

206
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,476
Why won't he go away?

207
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,602
Gosh.

208
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,104
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

209
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,276
<i>Gul-mi, I'm so happy</i>
<i>that I finally get to tell you how I feel.</i>

210
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,029
<i>There's something</i>
<i>I'd like to give to you today.</i>

211
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,031
He must have lost his mind.

212
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>Meet me after school at Miso Park.</i>

213
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,501
<i>I'll wait until you come.</i>

214
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,586
Gosh.

215
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,756
What the hell is wrong with him?

216
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,967
I hate this.

217
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,615
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

218
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,913
I'd better just turn it off.

219
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,623
No.

220
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,376
I need it so that I can avoid him.

221
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,045
POWER OFF
RESTART

222
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,674
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

223
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,102
IL-SIK, I'M ON MY WAY.
WHERE ARE YOU?

224
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,599
-Bye.
-See you.

225
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,686
Do it properly.

226
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,397
Come out, Hwang Sun-oh!

227
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,525
-What's wrong with him?
-Seriously.

228
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,116
Is this you?

229
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,581
I'm asking. Is this you?

230
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,918
-What if it is?
-Then I'm going to kill you.

231
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,299
What are you doing here?

232
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,967
-Not going to class?
-What?

233
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,928
Il-sik is beating Sun-oh up
in the classroom.

234
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,971
Shoot.

235
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,896
Damn it. Let go!

236
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,696
Someone stop him.

237
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,533
Punch me more. I was expecting it anyway.

238
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,369
You scum. I'll kill you for real.

239
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,331
-Are you crazy? Put your hand down.
-What are you doing?

240
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,582
Leave Sun-oh alone.

241
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,084
-Just back off.
-Don't.

242
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,710
You bastard.

243
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,426
Damn it. I told you to leave him alone!

244
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,679
Stay out of this. He'll only stop
after he's done beating me.

245
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,098
You bastard.

246
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,817
Someone stop him!

247
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,571
-You bastard.
-Stop him. Sun-oh will die at this rate.

248
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,909
Oh, gosh.

249
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,205
-What's going on?
-Please stop him.

250
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,917
Stop him.

251
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,385
IL-SIK

252
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,761
Is Gul-mi not coming?

253
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,265
-What?
-You're her cousin.

254
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,808
You're here instead of her, right?

255
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,518
No, I'm not.

256
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,190
Gul-mi went home in the afternoon.

257
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,150
I see.

258
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,153
Were you guys meant to meet here?

259
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,657
I knew she wouldn't come.

260
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,953
I told her that I like her
on Love Alarm today.

261
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,167
I mean...

262
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,463
-I'm just a bit surprised, that's all.
-It's okay. I wouldn't be happy either.

263
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:07,881
No...

264
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,426
When I rang Gul-mi's Love Alarm before,

265
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,429
the expression on her face was worse.

266
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,062
Do you know what makes it
even more miserable?

267
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,066
That I still like her.

268
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,735
Even when she was frowning...

269
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,699
she looked so pretty.

270
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,503
I want to stop liking her, but...

271
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,236
You're right.

272
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,447
I think it is so unfair
that we can't do anything about...

273
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,449
what our hearts want.

274
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,684
Why did you let him hit you?
I said I'd fight instead.

275
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,314
I'm the one who kissed Jojo.

276
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,070
See? You like Jojo.

277
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,698
-No, I don't.
-Stop lying.

278
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,996
If you keep lying,

279
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,667
I can't help but think
that all the things you've done for me...

280
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,878
were not from your heart.

281
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,757
So, tell me.

282
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,801
Do you like Jojo or not?

283
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,524
No matter how many times you ask,
my answer will remain the same.

284
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,277
I don't like Jojo...

285
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,946
because you do.

286
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,615
Hey.

287
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,826
If one kiss means I like her,

288
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,662
all the girls I've met--

289
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,747
But this time, you're acting differently.

290
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,586
You make it very obvious too.

291
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,179
This will go on forever
if both of us keep denying it.

292
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,515
You're right.

293
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,892
Let's not ask each other
since we'll keep lying anyway.

294
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,187
Instead...

295
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,109
you should download Love Alarm too.

296
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,780
Take it.

297
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,533
What is it?

298
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,876
Why would you give it to me?

299
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,503
Then throw it away.

300
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,755
I don't need it anymore.

301
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,884
I'll get going.

302
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,098

<i>Why did they fight?</i>

318
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,858
<i>Jang Il-sik must be out of his mind.</i>

319
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,998
Let's trust Love Alarm.

320
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,379
The choice...

321
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,883
is up to Jojo.

322
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,888
I stood you up on purpose.

323
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,515
Why did you come here?

324
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,568
-Il-sik--
-Don't say it.

325
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,238
I know what you are going to say.

326
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,617
-Don't.
-Il-sik.

327
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,122
Let's just forget about the fact...

328
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,376
that you kissed Sun-oh.

329
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,421
I'll let it slide just this once.

330
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,633
-How did you know about it?
-So,

331
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,092
don't break up with me.

332
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,053
I can't do that, so don't say it.

333
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:14,933
You even rang...

334
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,435
my Love Alarm this morning.

335
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,107
Jojo.

336
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,026
I like it now that you have Love Alarm.

337
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,617
Jojo.

338
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,244
Ring my Love Alarm again.

339
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,163
Please?

340
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,505
-No.
-I'll forget all about it, so please.

341
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,924
It wasn't me.

342
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,805
Back then,

343
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,391
I hadn't even downloaded it yet.

344
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,437
Il-sik,

345
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,566
I'm sorry.

346
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,736
I'm sorry...

347
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,613
I hurt you.

348
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,868
No, it's fine.
It's fine because I like you.

349
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,664
It's okay as long as
one of us likes the other.

350
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,084
My parents don't even like each other,
but they live together just fine.

351
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,753
We have better chances.

352
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,088
Il-sik.

353
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,261
Yours doesn't ring mine either.

354
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,449
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
You...

356
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,332
don't love me either.

357
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,002
Then...

358
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,588
Then why am I feeling this way?

359
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,632
Tell me.

360
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,808
<i>I don't know.</i>

361
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,896
<i>Maybe we are just...</i>

362
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,691
<i>used to each other.</i>

363
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,862
<i>Il-sik.</i>

364
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,324
<i>We're good friends.</i>

365
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,535
<i>Maybe that is...</i>

366
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,580
<i>not enough to ring Love Alarm.</i>

367
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,756
Then what does it mean to love someone?

368
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,517
You used to run away when you were little.

369
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,894
You're a big boy now,
seeing how you're enduring it.

370
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,524
He's not. A big boy wouldn't
get beaten to a pulp like that.

371
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,403
You said you fell. Did someone hit you?

372
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,696
Where was Hye-yeong?

373
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,992
-We got beaten up together.
-Do you think it's funny?

374
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,787
Why get into a fight you'd lose?

375
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,082
I did get beaten up,

376
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,917
but I didn't lose.

377
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,795
Send him to the hospital.
He can't get photographed like this.

378
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:31,963
Yes, ma'am.

379
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,757
-If you get into a fight next time--
-I won't let them hit my face.

380
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,301
I'll make sure it doesn't show.

381
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,982
Excuse me.

382
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,900
-Hey, try this.
-It's delicious.

383
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,527
-Eat up.
-This is nice.

384
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,280
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

385
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,323
-Tables 4 and 6.
-Table 4 and where?

386
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,408
Table 6.

387
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,661
You should work until closing time...

388
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,496
since you came late today.

389
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,958
I'm sorry, but I need to go as soon as--

390
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,543
Can't you see how busy we are today?

391
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,840
-Excuse me.
-Yes, coming.

392
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,341
Customer's calling. Go on.

393
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,010
Hurry up.

394
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,728
Excuse me, could we get more...

395
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,188
-Sir.
-Yes?

396
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,148
I'll stay until closing time.

397
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,858
What?

398
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,700
It's just this once, okay?

399
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,052
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

400
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,986
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

401
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,054
<i>We keep...</i>

402
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,515
<i>falling for someone.</i>

403
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,105
<i>Even when there's no guarantee</i>
<i>that our feelings will be reciprocated.</i>

404
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,818
<i>Still, why do we devote</i>
<i>our time and effort...</i>

405
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,196
<i>to love someone...</i>

406
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,448
<i>with all our hearts...</i>

407
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,912
<i>when that someone is not even ourselves?</i>

408
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:42,778
THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO
WHEN YOU LIKE SOMEONE

409
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,007
IS THE LOVE ALARM DEVELOPER
A GENIUS HIGH SCHOOLER?

410
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,468
LOVE ALARM WILL NOT REVEAL
THE DEVELOPER'S IDENTITY FOR NOW

411
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,346
Gosh, why are there only losers around me?

412
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,139
Damn it.

413
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,269
Hey, what is this?

414
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,148
It's brand new.

415
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,525
Did you steal it?

416
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,651
No.

417
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,196
How else would you get this?

418
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,241
Duk-gu gave it to me.

419
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,163
-Why would you--
-What the hell?

420
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,415
Why would you take it from him?
It's gross.

421
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,338
And you just took it?

422
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,508
I can't believe you, you tramp.

423
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,759
Oh, my gosh.

424
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,052
I hate him.

425
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,830
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, RING THE ALARM

<i>Let's just forget about the fact...</i>

433
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,982
<i>that you kissed Sun-oh.</i>

434
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:49,989
Wait.

435
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,200
Only Sun-oh and I know about it.

436
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,130
My goodness.

437
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,756
If I were the girl,

438
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,176
I'd pick Hye-yeong.

439
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,221
Why?

440
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,723
Instinctively,

441
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,143
a girl is prone to pick

442
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:23,272
the winner of the fight. Think about it.

443
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,857
If it's you against him,

444
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,650
Hye-yeong will win for sure.

445
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,653
This is why you're single.
What are you saying?

446
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,866
Girls hate it when guys fight.

447
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,495
We now have Love Alarm.
That's all we need.

448
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,705
All right.

449
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,209
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, RING THE ALARM

450
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,052
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, RING THE ALARM

451
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,653
Hey, hold on.

452
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,031
I told you.

453
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,825
One, two. One, one.

454
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,161
Why do you keep getting it wrong?

455
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,413
You're just so not up to my level.

456
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,252
Of course we aren't.

457
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,128
That's why guys like Duk-gu...

458
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,090
"Similar types of people
attract each other."

459
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,973
-What was that?
-Did you see it? Did you get it?

460
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,266
-Hey.
-Did we all get it?

461
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,809
-Wait.
-Are they crazy?

462
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,310
-Oh, my gosh.
-Wait.

463
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,436
This is crazy.

464
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,688
-They must be crazy.
-Gosh!

465
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,273
My gosh.

466
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,649
-Everyone got it.
-My gosh.

467
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,567
What is it?

468
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,068
-I'm so jealous.
-Is this for real?

469
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,405
-It's Kim Jojo.
-Who's Kim Jojo?

470
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,656
Really?

471
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,283
Unbelievable, right? Two guys at once.

472
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,868
-Two guys. I was really shocked.
-The one who kissed Hwang Sun-oh?

473
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,786
Hwang Sun-oh?

474
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,621
-I want to date her.
-This is insane.

475
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,248
-I was so shocked.
-Gosh.

476
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,209
-That's crazy.
-I must say, she is quite pretty.

ARE THEY CRAZY?
HWANG SUN-OH AND KIM JOJO ARE SCUM

480
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,479
-What are you doing?
-How much more must you take from me?

481
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,732
Give it back.

482
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,777
My mom bought this for you,
so give it back!

483
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,821
Are you crazy?

484
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,197
Yes, I am.

485
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,783
You made my family go bankrupt.

486
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,744
Why do you keep stealing from me?

487
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,955
-What have I done now?
-My Love Alarm didn't ring because of you.

488
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,918
Look at you playing innocent again.

489
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,838
This is why everyone thinks
you're the nice one.

490
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,340
Gosh, seriously.

491
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,216
It's not fair.

492
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,927
Only I know how spiteful you are.

493
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,265
I'll tell everyone.

494
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,145
-Tell everyone what?
-Jeju Island.

495
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,238
What you did in Jeju Island.

496
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,240
How your mom and dad--

497
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,161
Should I have died then?

498
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,124
Are you saying I should have died then?

499
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,463
You're a monster if you bring that up.

500
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,677
Has she lost her mind? Hey, Jojo!

501
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,346
What did you say? You think I'm a monster?

502
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,555
-You think so?
-Hey!

503
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,349
You think you're better than me?

504
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,975
Come on! Answer me!

505
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,019
-Go inside now!
-Let go.

506
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,604
Hey!

507
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,064
-What's wrong with you two?
-Let go!

508
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,066
-Let go.
-Let go of me!

509
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,609
-My goodness.
-Answer me!

510
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,195
You're mooching off my family.

511
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,572
She started the fight. Hey, Jojo.

512
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,700
Why don't you go on? Come on!

513
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,201
-I said, stop it.
-What will you say?

514
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,870
Go on. What are you staring at?

515
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,330
Come here. Get out.

516
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,833
-Did you see it?
-Yes.

517
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,711
They grabbed each other's hair.

518
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,754
I see. That's why her hair is like that.

519
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,260
-She's so shameless.
-Where did this happen?

520
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,096
-I can't believe it.
-I know.

521
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,431
Aren't they cousins?

522
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,102
-It's shocking.
-I think we should just...

523
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,322
Jang-go.

524
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,194
Give me your hand.

525
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:24,990
Why?

526
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,201
I want to hold it.

527
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,704
Did he actually say that?

528
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,415
-Oh, my gosh.
-Seriously?

529
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,512
What the hell?

530
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,472
-What's going on?
