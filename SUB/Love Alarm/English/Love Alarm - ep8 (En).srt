00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,066
Kim Jojo!

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>Thank you for being alive.</i>

3
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>I'll think a bit more...</i>

4
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>about what I can do to make you happy.</i>

5
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>I just...</i>

6
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,417
wanted you to know how I feel.

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,044
I should've just let it ring though.

8
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,214
I should've told you how I felt.

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,720
Not being able to see you
made me realize that.

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>Let's meet up at the schoolyard</i>
<i>at 4 :00 p.m.</i>

11
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,977
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

12
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,718
Just hear me out from over there.

13
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,019
Thank you...

14
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,479
for everything.

15
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
But even if you download Love Alarm,

16
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,656
I can't ring your Love Alarm.

17
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,208
It was all my fault
that Sun-oh and I broke up.

18
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,004
I've already decided...

19
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,675
that I wouldn't ever
like anyone else again.

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,053
And I might...

21
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,390
continue to be like that.

22
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,979
Are you okay with that?

23
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,065
Yeah.

24
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,443
All that matters to me...

25
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,487
is that you act on how you truly feel.

26
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,951
If you ignore my texts,

27
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,995
I'll let myself be ignored.

28
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,164
If you stand me up,

29
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,333
I'll let myself be stood up.

30
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,127
And if you dump me,

31
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,588
I'll let myself be dumped.

32
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,092
All of that is romance to me...

33
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,262
because we'd be doing things together...

34
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,098
that I can't do on my own.

35
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,688
<i>The things I can't do on my own.</i>

36
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,903
<i>Being honest about my feelings</i>
<i>and confessing my love.</i>

37
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,614
<i>Sharing the happiness...</i>

38
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,450
<i>and sadness...</i>

39
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,410
<i>instead of running away.</i>

40
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,706
<i>It is emerging</i>
<i>from the basement of one's heart,</i>

41
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,126
<i>and confessing one's true feelings.</i>

42
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,052
Jojo.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,305
Is it okay if I download Love Alarm?

44
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,391
<i>Liking someone...</i>

45
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,185
<i>means mustering up courage.</i>

46
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,446

51
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,243
I rang Kim Jojo's Love Alarm!

52
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,791
I'll ring four years' worth of
Love Alarm right now, Jojo.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,155
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

54
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,708
<i>I have no idea</i>

LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

58
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,552
<i>But thanks to a single person...</i>

59
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,847
<i>who is ringing my Love Alarm...</i>

60
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,100
<i>right now,</i>

61
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,604
<i>I now have hope...</i>

62
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,023
<i>that I can be happy.</i>

63
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,408
<i>One is...</i>

64
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,494
<i>bigger than any other number...</i>

65
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,329
<i>in the world.</i>

66
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,543
ONE IS BIGGER THAN ANY OTHER
NUMBER IN THE WORLD

67
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,303
So, what colors do you like?

68
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,559
I like white and I also like green.

69
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,145
What about music?

70
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,188
Are there any songs you listen to a lot?

71
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,732
Do you like watching movies?

72
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,903
-How many more questions are there?
-What?

73
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,074
Sorry. There is just so much
I want to know about you.

74
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,871
Can I ask you just one more thing, though?

75
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,083
What does your name mean?

76
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,335
"Jojo."

77
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,963
It's such a pretty name.

78
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,275
JOJO

79
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,818
It's written like this.

80
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,778
It means "morning" and "bright."

81
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,365
So, "bright morning"? I like that.

82
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,783
What about your name?

83
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,202
My name?

84
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,621
Hand me that. Thanks.

85
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,835
HYE

86
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,011
HYE-YEONG

87
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,638
So your name means "eternal grace"?

88
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,515
Yeah. My mom came up with it.

89
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,975
That's a nice name.
It suits you perfectly.

90
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,115
Why are you taking that?

91
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,077
Your name is written here.

92
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,207
I'll take yours too, then.

93
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,709
HYE-YEONG

94
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,163
So, it was because of you after all.

95
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,034
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

96
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,413
I really hoped it wouldn't ring this time.

97
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,144
You still like me, don't you?

98
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,606
Look me in the eye.

99
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,610
You like me.

100
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,532
I used to like you.

101
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,286
And I don't know...

102
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,999
if I'll ever like anyone
as much as I loved you.

103
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,340
But not anymore.

104
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,014
I'm the one who ruined our relationship.

105
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,601
I'm the one who broke your trust.

106
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,521
So how could I possibly like you?

107
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,614
Then...

108
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,036
do you like Hye-yeong?

109
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,208
Hye-yeong...

110
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,421
is a warm and kind guy.

111
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,132
I want to try my best.

112
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,301
What about me?

113
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,388
You couldn't try for me?

114
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,392
I'm sorry, Sun-oh.

115
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,936
I was too immature back then.

116
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,063
But now--

117
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,233
Ring Hye-yeong's Love Alarm
in front of me, then.

118
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,235
Then I'll believe...

119
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,655
everything you just said.

120
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,567
<i>There's no other shield like this</i>
<i>in the entire world.</i>

121
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,153
<i>I figured you might need it.</i>

122
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,948
<i>I don't want you to be heartbroken</i>
<i>like I was.</i>

123
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,659
YOUR CRUSH'S LOVE ALARM WON'T RING
EVEN IF YOUR LOVE ALARM IS ON.

124
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,038
WARNING: ONCE YOU ACTIVATE THE SHIELD,
ONLY THE DEVELOPER CAN REMOVE IT.

125
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,414
WOULD YOU STILL LIKE TO CONTINUE?

126
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,836
<i>I stole Sun-oh's smile away from him...</i>

127
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,758
<i>just so I wouldn't feel any pain.</i>

128
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,932
<i>By the time I regretted what I did,</i>

129
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>it was already too late.</i>

130
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>Even though I got a new phone...</i>

131
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,731
WILL YOU DOWNLOAD THIS APPLICATION?

132
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,150
<i>...and reinstalled Love Alarm...</i>

133
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,402
DOWNLOADING APPLICATION

134
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,037
<i>...the shield kept reactivating</i>
<i>on its own.</i>

135
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,541
Jojo. Is it okay
if I download Love Alarm?

136
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>I need to...</i>

137
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,298
<i>get rid of the shield.</i>

138
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,266
<i>The only way to get rid of the shield...</i>

139
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,812
<i>is to meet the developer of the app.</i>

140
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,780
Ta-da! Hello, everyone.

141
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,576
Welcome to BJ Gul-mi's
awesome shopping mall, Love Mi.

142
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,787
Today, I'll show you colors that match

143
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,206
with warm undertones and cool undertones.

144
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,959
First, if you have a warm undertone,

145
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,878
how about you try a warm color like this?

146
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,255
Yellow is the quintessential color
for warm undertones.

147
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,717
Next, if your skin has cool undertones...

148
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,468
Ta-da!

149
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,721
Blue, of course!

150
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,348
As long as you have just one of each...

151
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,756
RENTAL AGREEMENT

152
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,091
So,

153
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,594
have you found a place to live?

154
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,680
I meant to tell you about it sooner, but--

155
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,182
Does it feel good to just leave...

156
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,060
after using me like that?

157
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,146
I used you?

158
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,105
Yeah.

159
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,358
You used me your whole life.

160
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,445
You looked after a wimp like me
your whole life

161
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,197
so you could feel good about yourself.

162
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,993
This was bound to happen sooner or later.

163
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,245
I can't live here forever.

164
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,872
Is it because of Kim Jojo?

165
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,091
Yes.

166
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,269
You know exactly what Kim Jojo did to me.

167
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,272
Yet how could you, of all people,
do this to me?

168
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,899
I told you.

169
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,069
I still like Kim Jojo.

170
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,863
I trusted you.

171
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,495
Looks like you weren't really
on my side either.

172
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:44,169
You smile at the mirror every day,
pretending that you're a good guy, right?

173
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
But I know...

174
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,133
just how much of a bastard you really are.

175
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,687
Go to Kim Jojo.

176
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,566
And don't ever come back.

177
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,746
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

178
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,687
Sun-oh seems upset
that I invited you without telling him.

179
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,571
Here. I know you like this.

180
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,408
Thanks.

181
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,410
Make sure you eat up, too.

182
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,373
I was at the department store not long ago

183
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,376
and saw the Badge Club members
getting their Love Alarms rung constantly.

184
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,129
That must be quite irritating
for you, Yuk-jo.

185
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,256
It makes me happy

186
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,926
because the fact
that they're ringing my Love Alarm

187
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,303
means that they like me.

188
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,225
Well, I guess it's nice
when someone whom you like rings it.

189
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,897
Make sure you ring
Yuk-jo's Love Alarm often, okay, Sun-oh?

190
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,879
YEOLRIM HIGH SCHOOL

191
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,802
CONGRATULATIONS ON GRADUATING

192
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,769
KIM JOJO

193
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,731
<i>Is it because of Kim Jojo?</i>

194
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,942
You know exactly what Kim Jojo...

195
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,611
did to me.

196
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,531
Yet how could you, of all people,
do this to me?

197
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,539
KIM JOJO

198
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,432
I always wondered
what your room looked like.

199
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,309
-Yuk-jo.
-Yeah?

200
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,853
Don't worry about my conversation
with Hye-yeong from earlier.

201
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,076
I'll be better to you.

202
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,663
I'll be your friend...

203
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,790
as well as your girlfriend.

204
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,543
I really am on your side.

205
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,422
Let's go to Gangneung tomorrow.

206
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,966
You always said you wanted
to go there in winter.

207
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,053
Let's go there and ride snowboards,

208
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,554
eat some delicious food,

209
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,098
and enjoy the ocean view. Okay?

210
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,565
Next time.
We have plans tomorrow, after all.

211
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,691
What?

212
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,779
You're going to the presentation?

213
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,158
I thought you didn't want to go.

214
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,243
I'll go.

215
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,664
With you.

216
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,171
You can have it.

217
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,149
Here.

218
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,362
Shall I help you up?

219
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,202
-<i>I'll be on your side.</i>
-You piece of...

220
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,413
-That's right, dude.
-<i>On my side?</i>

221
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,624
-You'll ruin my hair!
-Just think of me.

222
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,130
"I'm happy to have Hye-yeong in my life."

223
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,766
1 DAY LEFT UNTIL LAUNCH OF LOVE ALARM 2.0
DEVELOPER WILL BE REVEALED

224
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,897
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACTIVATE THE SHIELD?

225
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,277
ONCE YOU ACTIVATE THE SHIELD,
ONLY THE DEVELOPER CAN REMOVE IT.

226
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,156
<i>I don't want you to be heartbroken</i>
<i>like I was.</i>

227
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,324
<i>Duk-gu.</i>

228
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,621
<i>Take care, Jojo.</i>

229
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,084
<i>Duk-gu...</i>

230
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,503
<i>is back.</i>

231
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,424
NEW LOVE ALARM 2.0 FEATURE
WILL BE ANNOUNCED

232
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,553
DEVELOPER WILL BE REVEALED

233
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,808
<i>In a moment, the developer of Love Alarm</i>
<i>will reveal himself for the first time</i>

234
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,937
<i>and announce the new feature</i>
<i>of Love Alarm 2.0.</i>

235
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:04,317
<i>The new feature has remained</i>
<i>a complete mystery until now.</i>

236
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,654
<i>Everyone seems to be</i>
<i>quite eager to find out what it is.</i>

237
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,783
<i>Many people are here near the red carpet</i>

238
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,286
so they can get a glimpse
of the Badge Club members.

239
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,038
It seems that the police are also here

240
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,040
to ensure the safety of the spectators.

241
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,500
-You're so pretty!
-I love you!

242
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,377
-How pretty!
-I love you!

243
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,891
These two are the most famous couple
in the Badge Club.

244
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,685
Mr. Hwang Sun-oh and Ms. Lee Yuk-jo
are making their entrance.

245
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,230
They look even more stunning
and glamorous than usual.

246
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,066
I'm definitely going to make it
into the Badge Club, too.

247
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,371
JOJO

248
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,351
-Look over there.
-Look.

249
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,230
Gosh, look at that.

250
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,523
-Amazing.
-What is that?

251
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,233
That's so pretty.

252
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,651
It's amazing.

253
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,448
<i>Now a Love Alarm cloud</i>
<i>has appeared in the sky.</i>

254
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:38,995
<i>The Love Alarm C&C department has made</i>
<i>many Love Alarm clouds appear before.</i>

255
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,414
<i>You can see that this cloud</i>

256
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,751
<i>is much bigger and much more beautiful</i>
<i>than any other in the past.</i>

257
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,597
Look at that. Over there.

258
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,724
-What's that?
-Look at that.

259
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,851
-What's that?
-What is it? Isn't that Love Alarm?

260
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,522
<i>If only...</i>

261
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,817
<i>Love Alarm hadn't been launched</i>
<i>back then...</i>

262
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:10,944
<i>If...</i>

263
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,699
<i>we hadn't realized these kids' feelings,</i>

264
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,830
<i>I wonder...</i>

265
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,207
<i>what we'd be like now.</i>

266
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,805
<i>I deleted Love Alarm a long time ago.</i>

267
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,849
<i>It scared me, you see.</i>

268
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,602
<i>I thought it would complicate things</i>

269
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,353
<i>if I kept ringing your Love Alarm.</i>

270
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,564
Hye-yeong.

271
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,107
I should've just let it ring though.

272
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,069
I should've told you how I felt.

273
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,324
<i>Not being able to see you</i>
<i>made me realize that.</i>

274
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,951
<i>Do you want to kiss?</i>

275
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,798
You're a good boy.

276
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,968
How could you be so sweet?

277
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,763
It makes my heart ache.

278
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,016
Mom!

279
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,852
Sun-oh...

280
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,039
<i>It's fine. I don't feel alone.</i>

281
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,208
That's because
you've felt alone for so long...

282
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,044
that you don't even realize
you feel that way.

283
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,129
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>
-<i>Don't apologize.</i>

284
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,633
I thought of all sorts of scenarios
to hate or to understand you.

285
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,551
<i>Look at me.</i>

286
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,220
Look at me!

287
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,266
It still feels like
you have feelings for me.

288
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,063
Kim Jojo!

289
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,132
<i>I'm off...</i>

290
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,177
<i>to face my feelings head-on.</i>

291
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,807
Look at that.

292
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,526
What?

293
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,291
8 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE LAUNCH
OF LOVE ALARM 2.0

294
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,379
What kind of person do you think
the developer of Love Alarm is?

295
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,631
I don't know.

296
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,508
A person with a lot of secrets?

297
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,762
He has never shown his face
even once in the past four years.

298
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,597
Why do you ask?

299
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,724
Well,

300
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,728
he developed an app that exposes
people's romantic feelings,

301
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,938
so it's weird that he's hiding
his own identity.

302
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,150
I guess he wanted to
completely conceal himself.

303
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,320
Just like the artist of <i>The Ringing World.</i>

304
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,448
JOJO

305
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,668
<i>THE RINGING WORLD</i> BY ??

306
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,051
ONE IS BIGGER THAN ANY OTHER
NUMBER IN THE WORLD

307
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,647
<i>THE RINGING WORLD</i> BY ??

308
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,288
Jojo.

309
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,003
Love Alarm needs to stop
its numbers game this instant!

310
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,215
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

311
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,845
Love Alarm needs to stop
its numbers game this instant!

312
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,889
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

313
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,140
ANTI-LOVE ALARM

314
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,855
-Stop!
-Hey, get out of the way!

315
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:04,153
We're against Love Alarm!
We're against Love Alarm!

316
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,366

320
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,398

321
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,694
<i>so please make your way to the event hall.</i>

322
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,114
<i>Love Alarm needs to stop collecting data</i>

323
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,867
<i>on our feelings and using them!</i>

324
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,661
Stop it! Stop it!

325
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,496
-Over here!
-Do an affectionate pose for us.

326
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,498
-Please smile at the camera.
-Look over here.

327
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,125
Look over here!

328
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,169
You two look great. I love it!

329
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,587
Over here!

330
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,881
Look over here, please!

331
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,843
We're against Love Alarm!
We're against Love Alarm!

332
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,470
Can I see your invitation?

333
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,848
We're against Love Alarm!
We're against Love Alarm!

334
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,476
ARTIST OF <i>THE RINGING WORLD,</i>
YOU ARE INVITED AS A SPECIAL GUEST

335
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,491
I'm Lee Seon-yeong,
the CSO of Love Alarm's C&C department.

336
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,035
Today is a special day

337
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,787
because we will be presenting

338
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,748
the new feature of Love Alarm 2.0
as well as the developer of Love Alarm.

339
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,378
Four years ago, he was just
an average high school student.

340
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,300
<i>But Love Alarm, which was created</i>
<i>in this shy boy's bedroom,</i>

341
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,511
<i>has now completely changed the world.</i>

342
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,305
MYEONGHYEON-DONG

343
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,474
<i>1,500 days after the launch...</i>

344
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,059
LOVE ALARM

345
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,185
...Love Alarm was able to

346
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,439
not only tell you
if someone nearby likes you,

347
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,317
but has even changed the way
we like others.

348
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,195
Now, I'd like to introduce him
to you for the first time.

349
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,323
Please give a warm round of applause
for the developer of Love Alarm,

350
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,574
Brian Chon.

351
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,424
<i>Love Alarm needs to stop collecting data</i>

352
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,760
<i>on our feelings and using them!</i>

353
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,470
Stop it! Stop it!

354
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,436
Every day for the past four years,

355
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:46,107
50 million users have rung Love Alarm
in Korea alone.

356
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,903
We've also analyzed the data

357
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,531
on the hearts of 73 billion people.

358
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,034
Nowadays, we can't even know
how others feel

359
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,995
without relying on Love Alarm.

360
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,041
<i>Furthermore, Love Alarm</i>
<i>has now divided people</i>

361
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,668
<i>into those who belong to the Badge Club</i>
<i>and those who don't.</i>

362
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,254
If you don't like it,
just don't download Love Alarm!

363
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,756
Why are you causing a commotion?

364
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,050
We're against Love Alarm!
We're against Love Alarm!

365
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,593
Get out of here, Anti-Love Alarm!

366
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,346
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

367
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,769
Are you happy that you can only confess
your feelings through Love Alarm?

368
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,645
Love Alarm will now...

369
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,316
be able to predict...

370
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,693
how one's feelings will develop.

371
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,487
This is...

372
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,948
Love Alarm 2.0.

373
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,453
LOVE ALARM 2.0

374
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,793
We're against Love Alarm!
We're against Love Alarm!

375

377
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,295
<i>Love Alarm 2.0 will now be able to</i>
<i>accurately predict</i>

378
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,921
<i>how one's feelings will develop.</i>

379
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,301
<i>It'll be able to tell you</i>
<i>who will ring whose Love Alarm,</i>

380
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,890
<i>and who won't ring whose Love Alarm.</i>

381
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,354
Jojo!

382
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,577
LOVE ALARM
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

383
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,514
I'll introduce the new feature
of Love Alarm 2.0 to you all now.

384
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,354
Allow me to introduce something
that everyone wants to know about...

385
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,107
right now.

386
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,152
"The person you will fall in love with."

387
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:25,201
THE PERSON YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH

388
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,650
LOVE ALARM
