Hye-yeong.

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,759
Who did that to you?

4
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
Calm down. I fell over on my own.

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,971
I heard you fought in the toilet.
Who was it?

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,223
Do you think
anyone could hurt me this bad?

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,768
You're not a kid.
Why would you fall over on your own?

8
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,061
I know, right?

9
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,940
Why do I act like an idiot these days?

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,943
Let's go.

<i>Oh, the guy you were with</i>

15
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,129
Can you light the grill

SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

17
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,724
So you should get a ride in my car
in the morning. Stop being like that.

18
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,520
You said you had to go early today.

19
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,607
Hey, you go home first.

20
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,548
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

21
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,642
Sorry. Did you wait long?

22
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,188
I know. You must be surprised.

23
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,025
I'm dashing even in the morning.

24
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,324
Let's go and have fun by ourselves
during free time on the school trip.

25
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,536
I'm not going.

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,537
What?

27
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,623
Why not?

28
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,588
You don't want to go to Jeju Island
because you're from there. Is that it?

29
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,216
Yes. I mean, you could say that.

30
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,393
Have fun for me.

31
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,478
What are you saying?

32
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,438
No, I won't go either.

33
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,190
Hey, why not? You should go.

34
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,733
It won't be fun without you.

35
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,278
-I'm not going.
-You only just transferred to this school.

36
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,571
Go and make some friends.

37
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,490
I have enough friends already.

38
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,039
I hate to be apart from you.

39
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,085
I almost died yesterday
because I missed you so much.

40
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,182
What?

41
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,520
Everyone is dying to have a chat with me,
but my girlfriend is so indifferent to me.

42
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,693
Don't be like that.

43
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,528
I'll get upset.

44
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,258
"The industry has its eyes on Love Alarm,

45
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,343
an app that has
more than ten million downloads,

46
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,055
for its sales record as well as
its download count records this year."

47
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,307
-My gosh.
-That's crazy.

48
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,391
Isn't it awesome?

49
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,685
The developer must be a romantic.

50
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,644
I know!

51
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,271
Do you know why he made it?

52
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,982
To let his crush know that he likes her.

53
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,110
I am so jealous of that girl.

54
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,237
-I hope he's handsome too.
-Right.

55
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,613
Of course he'd be handsome.

56
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,991
Where are those handsome guys?

57
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,618
If I were her,
I'd go out with him right away.

58
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,370
-I know.
-Of course.

59
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,581
-I'd marry him.
-Hey, Chon Duk-gu.

60
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,791
The teacher wants you.

61
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,175
Hey, Gul-mi.

62
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,260
Does he still ring your Love Alarm?

63
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,887
Are you crazy?

64
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,348
Don't say my name
in the same sentence as his.

65
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,016
It's creepy.

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,853
<i>Have you already left school?</i>

67
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,522
<i>Yes, I'm on my way to work.</i>

68
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,484

SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

70
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,407
Here.

71
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,040
-Jojo, I need you to come with me.
-I need to go to work.

72
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,416
No, you don't.

73
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,044
What if I get fired?

74
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,047
Don't worry. That won't happen.

75
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,842
Where are we going?

76
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,728
What?

77
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,445
Min-jae,

78
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,155
what are you doing here?

79
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,448
I don't know.

80
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,368
I have no idea what I'm doing here!

81
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,453
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,707
I let a girl get in the car
in my free time,

83
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,168
and Sun-oh threatened me
with the dashcam footage.

84
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,586
Sun-oh, that jerk.

85
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,880
He's on a date with a girl himself.

86
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,094
-On a date?
-Yes, he went on a date.

87
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,263
Hye-yeong, bring a box of napkins.

88
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,347
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,476
Gosh, my eyes.

90
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,764
-Why are you smiling when it hurts?
-It doesn't hurt if you smile.

91
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,646
No. It still hurts.

92
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,507
I thought you brought me here
because you were good at this.

93
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,926
I didn't know it'd be this slippery.

94
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,678
Oh, no.

95
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,846
Gosh.

96
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,184
Here.

97
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,066
Fine. I'll go alone.

98
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,652
Hey, don't go.

99
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,702
One, two.

101
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,927
Shall I turn it off?

102
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,888
-What's wrong with it?
-Don't you feel anything?

103
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,683
Other girls are ringing my Love Alarm.

104
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,893
-No.
-Really?

105
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,022
Because you ring mine.

106
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,408
Come on. Hold me.

107
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,493
Stop teasing me.

108
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,377
I won't let go.

109
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,897
It's beautiful.

110
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,192
I didn't know because
I'd never been here at this hour.

111
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,945
-So pretty.
-Right?

112
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,865
Very pretty.

113
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,160
Why are you so pretty?

114
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,870
It makes my heart flutter.

115
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,554
Thank you, Sun-oh.

116
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,481
Jojo. Kim Jojo.

117
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,276
-You can't just leave after that.
-Yes, I can.

118
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,111
-Jojo.
-What?

119
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
I really have to go now.

120
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,423
I'll be late again.

121
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,595
We'll see each other again tomorrow.

122
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,681
We hardly see each other.

123
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,225
Can't we meet freely at school as well?

124
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,063
I'm not comfortable with it yet.

125
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,936
I have something to tell you.

126
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,832

Min-jae worked hard grilling meat today.

133
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,485
Is something up?

134
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,364
I don't know if I did the right thing.

135
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,534
Good night.

136
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,911
Hey, finish what you were saying.

137
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,666
Go on. I'm the only one
you can open up to.

138

No, it's fine.

139
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,178

140

What is it?

141
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,894
Did you guys fight?

142
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,772

you were there for me.

146
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,459
Do the same.

147
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,422

182
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,180
-Thanks.
-Take all of it.

183
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,473
Thanks.

184
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,728
-I thought you were on a diet.
-Hey.

185
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,106
What's wrong with you?

186
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,818
-Thanks.
-Can I eat them all?

187
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,236
That's amazing.

188
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,487
Thank you.

189
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,909
Enjoy your lunch.

190
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,411
You too.

191
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,425
Don't take it.

192
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,969
-It's mine.
-Look at them.

193
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,847
-What's going on?
-They're unbelievable.

194
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,015
Are they going out?

195
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,474
What are you doing?

196
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,061
Eat up, kids.

197
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,233
Eat this.

198
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,611
I have mine here.

199
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,946
Eat more. Eat a lot.

200
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,910
Sit on the other side. It's uncomfortable.

201
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,912
No. I prefer sitting next to you.

202
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,384
How can you be so pretty
even when you're eating?

203
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,680
You don't want me to eat?

204
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,682
No. I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

205
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,267
Eat.

206
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,561
-Oh, my gosh.
-Are they going out?

207
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,982
Wake up.

208
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,118
What are you doing here, skipping lunch?

209
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,371
I didn't skip lunch. I had it already.

210
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,216
Let's eat separately from now on.

211
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,887
It'd be awkward to eat with you and Jojo.

212
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,141
Let's go.

213
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>MY PAST SELF IS A STRANGER TO ME</i>

214
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,522
HEROINE JEONG MI-MI'S LIFE AS AN ACTRESS

215
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:23,240
<i>By the time Sun-oh was ready</i>
<i>to go to elementary school,</i>

216
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,285
<i>I was not a mother but an actress</i>
<i>who wanted to start working again.</i>

217
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,788
<i>Sun-oh probably doesn't remember it.</i>

218
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,749
<i>Do you not want to go home?</i>

219
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,252
I don't want to go home, either.

220
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,337
We are well-off,
but my family is embarrassing.

221
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,548
I don't want to talk about them.

222
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,682
What are you reading?

223
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,143
It's just...

224
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,272
Sun-oh's really cool.
Did you ring each other's Love Alarm?

225
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,275
Yes.

226
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,361
You guys look good together.

227
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,490
Are you going to read those books?

228
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,659
-Well, they're just...
-Excuse me.

229
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,585
HWANG JAE-CHEOL

230
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,627
Hello, sir.

231
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,215
You must be very busy.

232
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,843
You're the only one
who isn't busy in this house.

233
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,722
Have a good day, sir.

234
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,322
Are you going to eat too?

235
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,501
Did you enjoy the school lunch?

236
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,336
Yes.

237
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,754
I didn't.

238
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,924
But then, you should enjoy it.

239
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,717
Your boyfriend paid for it.

240
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,934
-What?
-You sent my mom a text, right?

241
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,229
"Thank you, Aunt.

242
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,147
Thank you for the school lunch."

243
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,611
Did you actually think my mom paid for it?

244
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,156
What are you saying?

245
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,742
You're really startled, aren't you?

246
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,164
Sun-oh paid for it.

247
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,251
I didn't know he was that sweet.

248
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,046
To be honest, I thought he'd detest you

249
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,299
if he found out about your situation,
thinking you're beneath him.

250
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,469
But when I asked him to pay
for your school lunch, he did.

251
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,056
How much did you tell him?

252
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,269
I almost told him about Jeju Island,
but I didn't.

253
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,813
You know,

254
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,524
he's even paying for your school lunch.

255
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,236
If I told him everything, he'll probably
pay your college tuition as well.

256
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,282
Do you have to go this far?

257
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,408
Are you embarrassed?

258
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,536
Then go to Sun-oh and ask him.

259
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,746
Ask him why he paid for your lunch.

260
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,417
Ask him why he's treating you
like a beggar, and break up with him.

261
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,991
SUN-OH

262
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,207
JOJO

263
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,176
<i>The person you're calling</i>
<i>is not available at the moment.</i>

264
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,596
Why...

265
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,140
Why did you do it?

266
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,810
It...

267
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,689
It makes me feel so small.

268
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,124
I called your school.

269
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,169
I told them you'll leave school early
for a shoot.

270
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,132
Your dad will be there, so don't be late.

271
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,176
I never agreed to it.

272
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,887
If you're going to keep lazing around,
go back to the US.

273
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,515
That's just mean.

274
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,478
Get your makeup done before the shoot.

275
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,914
MISSED CALL FROM JOJO

276
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,600
SUN-OH

277
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,150
MISSED CALL FROM SUN-OH

278
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,113
<i>I did nothing wrong.</i>

279
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,160
<i>I know I did nothing wrong, but...</i>

280
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,420
<i>Why aren't you picking up?</i>

281
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,505
<i>Did you have dinner?</i>

282
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,429
TO BE DISCARDED

283
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,034
<i>Jojo.</i>

284
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,037
<i>I'll ring your Love Alarm every day.</i>

285
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,710
<i>But why do I keep feeling...</i>

286
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,962
<i>so small?</i>

287
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,851
Are you really not going to Jeju Island?

288
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,061
No.

289
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,189
It'll just be about
taking photos and drinking.

290
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,983
Your mom thinks you're going.

291
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,946
That just shows how little
she actually knows about me.

292
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,490
That's crazy.

293
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,450
Jojo is like a pigeon.

294
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,787
It's like she's pecking at Sun-oh's vomit.

295
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,915
-That's just gross. What's wrong with you?
-Gosh.

296
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,709
-How can she live like that?
-She's pitiful.

297
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,085
-Hey
-What?

298
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,589
-What did you say about Jojo?
-What?

299
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,552
What about Jojo?

300
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,470
It's just Gul-mi...

301
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,306
I mean, that's what everyone says.

302
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,058
That little...

303
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,184
Hey.

304
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,520
-Oh, gosh.
-What am I going to do?

305
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,938
I don't want this.

306
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,691
-Is it delicious?
-What is it?

307
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,650
It's tasty.

308
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,068
Tasty? It's too salty.

309
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,611
That's better than too bland.

310
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,995
Jang-go.

311
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,622
I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.

312
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,042
I gave it some thought,

313
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,045
and I think I would've gotten mad too
if I were you.

314
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,631
I'm not mad.

315
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,760
Eat up, kids.

316
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,927
I just stopped liking you.

317
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,184
I heard you asked Sun-oh
to pay for your lunch.

318
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,605
Hey,

319
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,231
Sun-oh is--

320
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,864
What's going on?
Did you make up with Jojo?

321
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,574
No, it's not like that.

322
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,867
What about Sun-oh?

323
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,993
What?

324
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,913
You were talking about Sun-oh.

325
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,209
Well, he was going somewhere
with Gul-mi. He looked very serious.

326
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,055
I did it for you

327
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,098
so that you'd come to your senses.

328
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,226
You spread the false rumor for me?

329
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,187
She didn't say anything to you
even after she found out, did she?

330
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,232
See?

331
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,984
People like her only think
about how to mooch off us.

332
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,277
"People like her"?

333
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,864
Yes. Those who keep wanting for more.

334
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,243
That's why people like you and me...

335
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,287
should be wary of them.

336
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,709
Sun-oh.

337
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,838
Sun-oh.

338
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,549
I like you.

339
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,968
I did it because I like you.

340
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,476
Do you know why you like me?

341
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,230
Because I'm rich, my mom's an actress,
and I'm famous.

342
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,275
You like me because you want to use me.

343
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,485
It's not like that, Sun-oh.

344
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,946
-I really think we--
-Use me.

345
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,117
I'll tell others that I'm close to you.
Upload our picture on Instagram.

346
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,328
-Sun-oh.
-You're a trainee at MJ, right?

347
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,956
The CEO is my mom's friend.

348
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,292
I'll arrange a meeting for you.

349
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,168
Do whatever you want. Use me. In return...

350
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,673
never say "we" to me again.

351
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,527
You're so annoying.

352
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,082
Sun-oh.

353
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,465
Sun-oh, look at me.

354
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,927
It's my fault.

355
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,221
I should have asked you first.

356
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,098
I'm sorry.

357
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,444
Jojo.

358
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,239
Don't leave me.

359
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,413
You did nothing wrong.

360
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,166
I would have done the same.

361
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,471
You're a good boy.

362
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,518
How could you be so sweet?

363
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,479
It makes my heart ache.

364
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,381
Why did Sun-oh and Gul-mi fight?

365
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,299
-What?
-Don't you know? It's because of Jojo.

366
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,551
Why else?

367
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,178
That's crazy.
Did Sun-oh pay for her lunch?

368
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,097
-Isn't that great?
-Right?

369
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,599
-What is this?
-What's up?

370
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,435
-What is it?
-Is it Love Alarm?

371
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,478
-It's not mine.
-Whose is it?

372
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,688
-Is it you? Il-sik?
-Isn't it?

373
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,107
-Check yours, Il-sik.
-It's not me.

374
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,650
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

375
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,277
-It is Il-sik's.
-It is Il-sik's.

376
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,070
Who is it?

377
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,613
-Seriously?
-I'm jealous.

378
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,574
Il-sik's Love Alarm rang. Who rang it?

379
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,244
-Why doesn't mine ring?
-Who rang it?

380
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,203
Amazing.

381
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,246
Nice.

382
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm so jealous.

383
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,126
What's wrong with you?

384
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,795
What do you mean?

385
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,214
You rang my Love Alarm.

386
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,885
Does it make you that mad?

387
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,061
Is that why you sent me the photo?

388
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,605
To separate me and Jojo?

389
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,732
I told you before.

390
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,400
It's because Jojo betrayed us.

391
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,318
Hey.

392
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,612
Don't ring my Love Alarm.

393
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,408
I can't control it.

394
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,534
Just don't.

395
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,788
It's not like...

396
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,417
I can ring yours back.

397
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,734
<i>It's like we're having a feast.</i>

398
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,614
-Mi-mi, do you often cook for your family?
-Isn't the shoot over yet?

399
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,366
-No. It's taking forever.
-Well...

400
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,619
I try to, as healthy food is important.

401
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,537
Right.

402
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,039
-I love all the food my wife cooks for me,
-That reporter.

403
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,041
-Isn't she so hot?
-but the best is oyster <i>jeon.</i>

404
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,960
-Oyster <i>jeon.</i>
-Is she even human?

405
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,795
How is she so pretty?

406
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,630
Actually, I found myself

407
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,341
not being able to turn my head
to this side.

408
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,427
He was a model for <i>Seventeen, </i>right?

409
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,681
A lot of fans want to know how you're
doing since you're not active these days.

410
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,101
He's focusing on studying these days.

411
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,812
I wonder how he feels though.

412
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,731
Eat up, Sun-oh.

413
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,902
I'm sure working as a model is
a lot more fun than studying.

414
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,406
I'll be honest.
He's very close to my ideal type.

415
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,580
Mom. I'll do it.

416
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,873
Take a seat.

417
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,588
What happened to your arm?

418
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,964
It's nothing.

419
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,174
Sit down.

420
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,597
Gosh, it must have hurt a lot.

421
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,764
It'll heal itself.

422
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,976
No, it won't. You need to treat it.

423
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,478
Okay. I'll put some ointment on it later.

424
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,862
Hye-yeong.

425
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,282
If it hurts, tell me that it does.

426
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,952
Okay.

427
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,167
Eat this.

428
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,964
Mi-mi, you were the best actress
at the time.

429
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,926
I can't imagine how hard
it must have been for you

430
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,928
to put your career on hold
at the peak of it.

431
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,350
Well, I didn't want to miss
a single moment...

432
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,852
of my son's growth.

433
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,196
Well...

434
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,657
shall we take a ten-minute break?

435
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,700
We'll take a break.

436
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,589
Don't cause trouble.

437
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,216
What more do you want?

438
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,010
Are you going to keep this up?

439
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,144
Shall I tell them everything?

440
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,523
Will you be okay? It'll go on the air.

441
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,775
Do you want me to tell them
what I remember?

442
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,653
What do you mean?

443
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,113
How much you found me annoying.

444
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,199
So much that you wanted me gone.

445
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,079
Hey, can you take Sun-oh?

446
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,957
Drink this.

447
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,297
Why didn't you tell me before?

448
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,010
I thought you wouldn't remember.

449
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,721
You wished that I wouldn't.

450
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,353
Don't act like a baby, please.

451
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,481
Let's just pretend to be a happy family.

452
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,734
Don't get greedy for more.

453
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,362
"Pretend"?

454
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,032
Do it properly, then.

455
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,285
Just...

456
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,080
Just say you're sorry. That's all I need.

457
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,560
Sun-oh, you did a good job.

458
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,416
I know, right? They're crazy.

459
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,628
I won't let them be.

460
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:42,838
Yes.

461
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,257
I'll report Sun-oh for bullying.

462
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,843
What?

463
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,806
I'll just say he pushed me and I got hurt.

464
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,558
SE-JIN

465
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,480
Don't mess with Sun-oh.

466
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,274
You can mess with me, but not him.

467
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,818
Both of you are just...

468
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,903
Do I look like a pushover to you?

469
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,408
Sun-oh feels so sorry for you.

470
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,202
Isn't it great?

471
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,496
This is your chance
to ask him for everything. Right?

472
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,874
The things you want to eat, have,
and do...

473
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,251
Ask for everything.

474
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,796
It's not that he feels sorry for me.

475
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:24,839
What?

476
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,090
He just wants to...

477
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,134
do those things for me.

478
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,303
You don't know what that feels like.

479
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,222
You're still so stuck up.

480
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,851
I get all you see is Sun-oh.

481
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,561
But when he realizes who you really are,

482
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,647
do you think he'll keep on seeing you?

483
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,193
What kind of person am I?

484
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
Is it...

485
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,531
Is it all my fault?

486
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,741
Whose fault is it, then?

487
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,619
Why do you think your mom was in debt?

488
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,330
It was because she had to raise you.

489
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,249
It's all your fault.

490
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,043
That's why you can't date Sun-oh.

491
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,920
You can't eat food that my mom paid for,

492
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,339
and you can't go on the school trip
either. Do you get it?

493
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,634
Hey!

494
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,141
Put that down.

495
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,350
Mom.

496
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,731
You really scare me.

497
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,902
You pretend to be so nice in front of me,
and yet you hit Gul-mi behind my back.

498
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,654
That's not it.

499
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,282
You're two-faced just like your mom.

500
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,534
Look what happened.

501
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,287
She pretended to be just fine,

502
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,582
and then died, leaving all the debt to me.

503
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,541
Aunt.

504
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,796
Still, she was your sister.

505
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,841
Exactly. She was my sister.

506
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,386
That's why I'm letting you stay here.

507
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,473
I...

508
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,392
What more can I do?

509
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,895
If you feel that wronged, get out.

510
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,314
-Aunt.
-Get out, just get out!

511
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,218
Grandma!

512
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,888
Grandma!

513
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:38,175
THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD
IS KNOWING THERE'S SOMEONE ON MY SIDE

514
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,646
LOVE ALARM PROVES THAT
YOU TRULY LIKE THAT PERSON.
