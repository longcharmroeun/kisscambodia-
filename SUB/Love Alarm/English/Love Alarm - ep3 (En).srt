1
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,311
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THIS?
IT'S ALL OVER THE WEBSITE.

2
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,563
IS IT KIM JOJO?

00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,695
YEOLRIM HIGH NEWS
#45553 ANONYMOUS STORY

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,908
Hey, Jojo! What did you say?
You think you're better than me?

5
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,202
-You're mooching off my family.
-Get back inside.

6
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,954
She started the fight.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,498
Get back inside.
All of you, go back to your classrooms.

8
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,004
Go back to your classrooms!

9
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,312
Give me your hand.

10
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,494
-Was it you?
-What's her problem?

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,828
Why is she so mean to you?

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,163
Is that important right now?

13
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,373
Now the whole school knows our secret.

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,543
What are you trying to say?

15
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,090
You sent this, didn't you?

16
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,760
Do you think so?

17
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,393
-Then who else?
-Who cares?

18
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,312
It's true that we kissed.

19
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,286
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,538
Right.

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,915
Lucky you take everything so lightly.

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,126
I never said I did.

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,752
My Love Alarm isn't on.

24
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>Let's trust Love Alarm.</i>

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,411
<i>The choice...</i>

26
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>is up to Jojo.</i>

27
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,834
LOVE ALARM

28
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,134
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

29
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,996
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

30
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,260
What about you?

31
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,846
Did your alarm ring as well?

32
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,183
Your phone is on silent mode now, right?
Let me see.

33
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,740
I'll call you later.

34
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,380
I didn't mean to turn it on without you.

35
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,632
-The photos have been--
-It's okay.

36
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,134
What is?

37
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,303
You don't need to explain.

38
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,722
Jojo rang your Love Alarm.

39
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,684
So? That's it?

40
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,269
Are you really okay?

41
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,897
We said we'd trust Love Alarm

42
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,857
and leave the choice to Jojo.

43
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,735
We already agreed to it.

44
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,739
-Hye-yeong--
-My bike chain broke.

45
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,575
I was going to replace it today anyway,

46
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,452
but it completely snapped on my way here.

47
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,684
-No, I don't want to.
-I don't care.

48
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,060
Guys, Jojo is here.

49
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,937
-Oh, really?
-Jojo is here.

50
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,355
-What? Where?
-Over there.

51
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,233
-Wow, she's back.
-I guess she's not even embarrassed.

52
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,651
-Why is she here?
-I'm surprised.

53
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,820
-She has no shame.
-I know, right?

54
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,655
She's really something.

55
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,615
I thought she'd drop out of school.

56
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,036
Jang-go.

57
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,954
Are you mad at me for something?

58
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
-Ever since yesterday--
-You're really shameless.

59
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,795
Must you and Sun-oh do that
first thing in the morning?

60
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,548
Il-sik skipped his training today
because of you.

61
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,762
Why are you only worried about Il-sik?

62
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,598
You're my friend.

63
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,766
"Friend"?

64
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,393
Hey, you're the one
who ruined our friendship.

65
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,021
Are you mad
because I didn't tell you about Il-sik?

66
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,981
I was going to tell you.

67
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,734
-Also, it's not because of Sun-oh--
-Hey, Jojo.

68
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,780
Is that really the only thing
you didn't tell me?

69
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
What?

70
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,494
The day Il-sik was looking for you...

71
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,037
No.

72
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,831
The day you and Sun-oh kissed,

73
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,294
I went to your academy
because I couldn't get hold of you.

74
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,214
But you weren't even registered there.

75
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,843
You said we're friends.

76
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,138
Then why did you lie to me about that?

77
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,176
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

78
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,517
Jeez, you're too much. Goodness.

79
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,187
Gosh, what the hell?

80
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,274
Wow, look at this punk.

81
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,901
I beat him up, and he still likes me.

82
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,237
You asshole, are you getting aroused?
That's gross.

83
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,536
I'm going to beat you up
until this number is gone.

84
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,373
Hey, what are you doing over there?

85
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,584
-Who's that punk?
-Let's go.

86
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,877
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

87
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,712
Let's just go. He'll get us in trouble.

88
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,422
Hey, he's alone.

89
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,466
Fuck! I said, let's just go.

90
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,092
-Dude. You're scared, aren't you?
-Damn.

91
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,428
-Hey.
-What? Are you really scared?

92
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,180
Hey, wait up!

93
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,807
Hey. Damn, are you all right?

94
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,980
He was in my class last year.
I'll report him.

95
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,858
-Just leave him be.
-Bullies like him must be taught a lesson.

96
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,026
It was my fault.

97
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,947
It all happened
because I rang his Love Alarm.

98
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,785
But if you don't report him,
he'll keep harassing you--

99
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,245
I'm disgusted too!

100
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,456
Fuck.

101
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,792
Why am I drawn to a jerk like him?

102
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,675
What can I do to stop my feelings for him?

103
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,596
There's no such thing.

104
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,059
There's no way you can stop
liking someone.

105
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,728
There isn't.

106
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,442
Eat up, guys.

107
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,944
I'm on a diet.

108
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,426
Give me Jojo's number.

109
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,181
I feel so bad for Gul-mi.

110
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,687
JANG-GO

111
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,211
<i>Are you not in the cafeteria?</i>

112
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,425
<i>Where are you now? Why aren't you here?</i>

113
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,104
<i>Did your alarm ring as well?</i>

114
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,481
Let me see.

115
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,484
I'll call you later.

116
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:20,161
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

117
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,876
<i>The moment Sun-oh rang my Love Alarm,</i>

118
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>I felt this buzzing sensation</i>
<i>throughout my body.</i>

119
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
Why didn't you text me back?

120
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,162
How did you get my number?

121
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,332
I asked you why you didn't text back.

122
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,839
How long did you run for?

123
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,966
Hey, don't come close.
I probably reek of sweat now.

124
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,426
I don't care.

125
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,448
Hey.

126
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,419
What was that?

127
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,087
Why is she so cute?

128
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,802
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

129
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,644
-I bet.
-The timing was awesome.

130
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,604
Our Chinese teacher was nuts today.

131
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,772
Gosh, totally.

132
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,733
Seriously, wasn't he such a nutcase today?

133
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,068
It really was epic. I thought...

134
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,154
Ji-yeon.

135
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,490
Where's Jang-go?

136
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,075
Why ask me about your best friend?

137
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,536
She's not anymore, is she?

138
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,580
-Let's go.
-Okay.

139
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,888
<i>Where are you, Jang-go?</i>

140
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,683
<i>I'll come to you.</i>
<i>I don't want to be on bad terms with you.</i>

141
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,520
What does she want from me now
after doing all that with Sun-oh?

142
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,733
Hey, isn't Jojo unbelievable?

143
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,820
She's not even registered at the academy.

144
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,115
But she used that as an excuse
and never hung out with us, you know?

145
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,624
-Why did you do that?
-What do you mean?

146
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,377
It was your fault
that the photos spread all over school.

147
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,174
Hey, that wasn't me.

148
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,801
I only sent them to you.

149
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
Did you really think
my friends wouldn't do anything?

150
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,348
Well...

151
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,017
We'd still be together
if it weren't for those photos.

152
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
Gosh, I don't even know
what to think anymore.

153
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,486
Hey, Il-sik.

154
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,114
-I did it for your sake.
-Why would you do that for me?

155
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,160
Because we're friends.

156
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,664
Jojo became friends with us later on.

157
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,999
The two of us were friends first.

158
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,210
You aren't my friend anymore either.

159
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,715
I shouldn't have downloaded Love Alarm.

160
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,726
Jojo.

161
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,272
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

162
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,650
You're not mad anymore, are you?

163
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,027
I like it now that you have Love Alarm.

164
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,618
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

165
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,012
What's going on?
Why isn't Jojo picking up?

166
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,042
WHERE ARE YOU, JANG-GO?
I'LL COME TO YOU

167
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,382
Jojo, what are you doing?

168
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,801
-Table four is ready to order.
-Oh, okay.

169
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,181
Aren't you taking our order?

170
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,776
Two servings of marinated beef,
two whole racks of ribs,

171
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,444
and a serving of beef ribs.

172
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,785
Here's your charcoal.

173
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,037
-Hye-yeong works here too.
-He's not working today.

174
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,081
Really?

175
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,934
Give me your hand.

176
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,519
I want to hold it.

177
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,478
The tongs.

178
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,022
-What?
-Pass me the tongs.

179
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,191
Oh, okay.

180
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,951
My friends don't know that I work here.

181
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,745
Let's keep this secret between you and me.

182
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,665
Hey, start with this.

183
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,625
Why are you grilling
the marinated meat first?

184
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,795
Don't eat it, then.
I'll grill them however I want.

185
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,506
You should start with...

186
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,010
Jeez. Oh, right. I should order some soda.

187
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,803
-Excuse me.
-Go and get it yourself.

188
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,432
Myself? Why should I?

189
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,891
Then do you want to grill this?

190
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,312
I can grab it from the fridge, right?

191
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,443
-Excuse me, I'm taking some soda.
-Okay.

192
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,007
What? What do you want?

193
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,512
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

194
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,222
Your Love Alarm isn't on right now, is it?

195
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,559
Let's try again.
I couldn't see it properly earlier.

196
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,451
Why aren't you turning it on?

197
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,661
Turn your Love Alarm on. Please?

198
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,670
For two, please.

199
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,222
So, when are you going
to turn your Love Alarm on?

200
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>Jojo.</i>

201
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,404
I need to check whether or not
your Love Alarm rang this morning.

202
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,865
Come on.

203
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,038
Turn it on already.

204
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,543
-I don't want to.
-Why not?

205
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,087
Turn it on. If you don't,
I'll lie down on the ground now.

206
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,089
Do you want me to throw a tantrum?

207
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,177
Jojo.

208
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,765
I want you to like me back.

209
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,618
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU
LOVE ALARM

210
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,588
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

211
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,049
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

212
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,779
You're pretty.

213
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,846
<i>Sun-oh likes me.</i>

214
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,935
<i>The person I like also likes me back.</i>

215
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,646
<i>It's like a miracle.</i>

216
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,358
THE MIRACLE OF TWO PEOPLE
LIKING EACH OTHER

217
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,860
Thirty-eight...

218
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,282
Thirty-nine...

219
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,537
Forty...

220
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,427
<i>Meet me at that place.</i>

221
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,792
No, it's not that.

222
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,713
I didn't know only the assistant director
would be attending.

223
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,966
It's my first time playing a secretary.

224
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,593
Yes, Director.

225
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,764
Yes, I'll go over the script thoroughly.

226
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,891
All right.

227
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,111
Mom!

228
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,115
Mom, I can count in English now.

229
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,122
Hey, can you take Sun-oh?

230
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,000
Mom, look at me.

231
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,835
-Mom.
-Go away.

232
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,214
Drink this.

233
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,545
You never went up there without my help
when we were kids.

234
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,548
Shall I help you up?

235
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,717
It's too high.

236
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,846
It definitely looks higher
now that I'm older.

237
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,057
Are you an old man or what? Come on.

238
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,744
Sun-oh, are you all right?

239
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,917
I'll be on your side.

240
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,294
On my side?

241
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,131
What does that mean?

242
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,299
My mom told me

243
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,469
that it means punishing those
who are mean to you,

244
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,347
eating with you at every meal,

245
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,017
and being by your side when you get sick.

246
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,229
Then what should I give you in return?

247
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,274
The game console?

248
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,654
You don't need to do anything.

249
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,490
Just think of me.

250
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,622
"I'm happy to have Hye-yeong in my life."
That's what you should think.

251
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,053
I used to get scared up here,
thinking that I might fall.

252
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,606
Hey.

253
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,358
"If I'm going to fall anyway,
I might as well look cool."

254
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,903
Thinking like that took the fear away.

255
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,866
You've grown a lot.

256
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,367
What?

257
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,120
-Oh, no!
-Gosh, hey.

258
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,925
<i>Gosh, I'm so relieved to hear that.</i>

259
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,718
Yes.

260
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:16,056
I was worried because my grandma seemed
to be low in spirits last time I saw her.

261
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,559
Yes, thank you.
I'll be in touch again soon.

262
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,561
Okay.

263
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,909
You can use this.

264
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,788
We used to share things like this,
you know.

265
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,424
Thanks.

266
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,761
When you first came to our place,

267
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,222
I was very fond of you.

268
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,600
That's why I suggested we share a room.

269
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,144
I'm sorry about this morning.

270
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,606
-I didn't mean to--
-Right, you must be sorry.

271
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,651
Then break up with Sun-oh.

272
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,738
-What?
-I had a crush on him first.

273
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,157
I can't do that.

274
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,369
I'm sorry.

275
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,329
You always say that,
but you don't mean it.

276
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,039
Hey, look at me.

277
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,167
My dad is gone
because of your family's debt,

278
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,044
and my mom drinks every single day.

279
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,423
Why can't you give up even just one thing?

280
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,095
Jojo, I just told you that I like him.

281
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,930
Okay? So end it with him.

282
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,559
-If you break up with him now--
-No.

283
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,604
I can't.

284
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,357
My family and I are in this mess...

285
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,694
because of you.

286
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,631
Jojo, look at this. Ta-da!

287
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,133
-A frog!
-Yes, it's a frog.

288
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,552
-Tap.
-Tap.

289
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,096
Tap.

290
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,473
Oh, my. Great job, Jojo.

291
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,101
One more time.

292
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,308
What happened?

293
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,021
<i>A man in his 30s</i>
<i>who assaulted a woman in her 20s</i>

294
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,442
<i>on her way home</i>
<i>at a park in Seoul last night</i>

295
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,860
<i>has been arrested.</i>

296
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,864
<i>A controversy has arisen over Love Alarm</i>
<i>due to the victim's statement.</i>

297
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>Reporter Lee Dong-gyu, tell us more.</i>

298
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,533
<i>Sure.</i>

299
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,746
<i>A man wearing a hat</i>
<i>approaches a woman walking alone.</i>

300
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,581
<i>The woman starts walking faster</i>

301
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,208
<i>and suddenly pulls out her phone</i>
<i>to check something.</i>

302
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,962
<i>Looking relieved, she then</i>
<i>starts walking again at a slower pace.</i>

303
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,256
<i>At that very moment,</i>
<i>the man takes out his weapon</i>

304
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,675
<i>and attacks the woman from behind.</i>

305
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,263
<i>The assailant, Mr. Cha,</i>
<i>had romantic feelings for the victim.</i>

306
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,057
<i>He stated that he assaulted her</i>
<i>because he was angry at her</i>

307
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,643
<i>for not recognizing how he felt about her.</i>

308
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,271
<i>At first, I was scared</i>
<i>because someone was following me.</i>

309
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,357
<i>But right at that moment,</i>
<i>my Love Alarm rang.</i>

310
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,903
<i>Because of that, I let my guard down.</i>

311
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,239
<i>I assumed he was following me</i>
<i>because he was attracted to me.</i>

312
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,784
<i>I see. Meanwhile, C&C,</i>
<i>the company that developed Love Alarm,</i>

313
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,454
<i>has released an official statement</i>
<i>regarding the incident.</i>

314
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,997
LOVE ALARM
THE STABBING CASE IN A PARK

315
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,791
<i>Even before Love Alarm was launched,</i>

316
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,585
<i>crimes like stalking, assault,</i>

317
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,963
<i>and even murder were committed</i>
<i>in the name of love.</i>

318
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,007
<i>So far, there is no case</i>

319
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,260
<i>where Love Alarm misjudged</i>
<i>the users' feelings.</i>

320
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,846
<i>However, when your Love Alarm goes off,</i>

321
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,224
<i>please keep this one thing in mind.</i>

322
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,560
<i>Love Alarm simply lets you know</i>
<i>who is attracted to you.</i>

323
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,978
<i>It does not guarantee</i>

324
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,815
<i>-your safety or happiness.</i>
-Oh, boy.

325
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,109
Love Alarm is the problem.

326
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,613
It rings between people of the same gender
and causes embarrassment.

327
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,491
Even things that you're too shy to confess

328
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,701
are disclosed
when you turn on your Love Alarm.

329
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,498
Please pay extra attention
to this matter, okay?

330
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,251
Oh, dear.

331
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,545
I never liked Love Alarm.

332
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,381
Blindly relying on it
resulted in this kind of tragedy.

333
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,509
I bet this is only the beginning.

334
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,094
Pardon?

335
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,972
We all use Love Alarm,

336
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,517
and yet we blame everything for it
whenever anything happens.

337
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,730
-Come on, sir.
-Why?

338
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,234
I'll say it again. Love Alarm is banned
from our school as of today.

339
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,111
-What do you mean?
-Are you serious?

340
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,698
If you like someone,
just tell that person how you feel.

341
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,199
-How?
-Gosh, this is so annoying.

342
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,909
Open your textbooks!

343
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,662
Question 7 and 8 on page 45.

344
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,289
Gosh, I can't even focus now.

345
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,800
SUN-OH SENT YOU A PHOTO

346
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,759
SILENT MODE

347
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,933
SUN-OH

348
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,066
<i>Let's go together.</i>
<i>Where should we go first?</i>

349
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,154
<i>And here's a gift for you.</i>

350
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,883
-Hey, So-jeong will buy us <i>tteokbokki.</i>
-When did I say that?

351
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,719
You never pay.
Don't you have a conscience?

352
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,679
It's Jojo, Kim Jojo.

353
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,689
-I'll treat you girls today.
-Seriously?

354
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,149
-Gosh.
-You'll spend all your money.

355
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,289
Are you all right?

356
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,918
Why did I think that she'd like me back...

357
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,463
if I showed her how I felt about her?

358
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,800
I shouldn't have rung her Love Alarm.

359
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,927
But there's nothing wrong...

360
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,638
with liking someone.

361
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,307
I know, but it has made her like me
even less now.

362
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,861
Gul-mi, you missed a beat.

363
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,418
That was great.

364
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,715
I want Marx's partner for the opening
performance at JAVA's upcoming concert...

365
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,889
to be Ha-na.

366
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,474
Sure.

367
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,600
Keep up the great work.

368
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,601
One, two, three.

369
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,352
Thank you.

370
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,337
-Hey, that's Marx!
-Seriously?

371
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,506
-Hey, it's for real!
-That's so cool!

372
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,049
We have to take a photo with Marx.

373
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,258
-Let's take a photo.
-Okay.

374
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,760
-One, two...
-Why are they screaming?

375
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,303
-Don't you know JAVA?
-One more!

376
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,556
-One more! One, two, three.
-They're really popular because of Marx.

377
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,974
-He's so handsome.
-Goodness!

378
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,185
-His concert is coming up?
-His face is so tiny.

379
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,104
-Let's go to the concert!
-Don't look.

380
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,730
-Let's go.
-We have to.

381
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,731
All right.

382
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,661
Walking is already tiring.
Why are you studying as well?

383
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,496
Do you give up everything that's "tiring"?

384
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,373
Life is a battle against yourself,
you know?

385
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,166
Why fight against yourself?

386
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,961
You're just like Hye-yeong.
You're always either studying or working.

387
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,462
Hye-yeong?

388
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,092
Oh, the guy you were with
in the schoolyard the other day?

389
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,344
Are you two close?

390
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,770
-What was that about?
-Jealousy.

391
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,274
Don't even look at boy bands,
and don't talk about my friends.

392
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,406
Hey, what's with you?
What if someone sees us?

393
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,159
I'm doing this for people to see
that you're all mine.

394
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,960
Hey, don't be so clingy. It's a turnoff.

395
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,796
Come on, Jojo. Have you forgotten
that you're dating Hwang Sun-oh?

396
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,515
<i>Sun-oh and I are walking on the path</i>
<i>that I used to walk on alone.</i>

397
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,811
<i>The fact that there is a path...</i>

398
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,564
<i>is such a blessing for us,</i>

399
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,066
<i>a couple that's just starting out.</i>

400
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,991
I'm here.

401
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,044
What the heck are you up to these days?

402
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,172
What did you do? Gul-mi doesn't want
to go to school because of you.

403
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,967
I heard you hit her
in front of your classmates.

404
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,763
-Did I raise you so that you can hit her?
-Aunt, that's not what happened.

405
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,598
Gul-mi said that you flirted with a guy,

406
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,936
and he got you a new phone.
Is that a lie too, then?

407
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,565
You're just like your mother, aren't you?

408
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,569
If you want to mess up your life,
do it alone.

409
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,321
Don't drag Gul-mi into your mess.

410
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,624
Did you get a girlfriend?

411
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,839
You've never done this before.

412
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,968
It's quite nice.

413
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,804
Why now?
You'll be in your senior year soon.

414
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,684
What do you think?

415
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,479
-She's young.
-That's it?

416
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,149
-What about her pretty face?
-Being young...

417
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,569
is much better than being pretty.

418
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,615
Don't go overboard.

00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,120
<i>No, I finished some time ago.</i>

423
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,039
<i>Then what are you up to now?</i>

424
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,294
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

425
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,345
<i>Don't say things like, "Dream about me."</i>

426
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,262
<i>Don't dream.</i>

427
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,980
<i>Don't have any dreams.</i>
<i>Just get a restful night's sleep.</i>

428
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,949
<i>I'll see you at school tomorrow.</i>

429
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,424
<i>Thanks.</i>

430
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,760
<i>For what?</i>

431
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,308
<i>For liking me.</i>

432
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,274
<i>Hey, Jojo.</i>
<i>Did you get a good night's sleep?</i>

433
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,609
<i>Yes, what about you?</i>

434
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,654
<i>I didn't sleep well</i>
<i>because I missed you too much.</i>

435
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,541
<i>I want to see you before class.</i>
<i>Meet me on the rooftop.</i>

436
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,294
<i>If you're late,</i>
<i>you have to give me 100 kisses.</i>

00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,455
Hey.

440
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,422
Hey.

441
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,423
You jerk.

442
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,510
I wondered why you kept avoiding me.

443
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,179
The guy you beat up
can't even come to school,

444
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,764
and you were just pretending?

445
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,849
So what?

446
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,060
Are you going to tell everyone?

447
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,107
You'd better apologize to him.

448
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,028
What about you?

449
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,656
Aren't you offended?

450
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,741
That I rang your Love Alarm?

451
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,037
What can you do? It's not like
you can control your feelings.

452
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,082
You're so cool about it.

453
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,835
I've been stressed out,
trying to avoid you.

454
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,463
Then keep it turned off.

455
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,132
You're right.

456
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,676
Why did I leave my Love Alarm on?

457
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,138
Maybe I wanted you to find out.

458
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,934
I'm embarrassed,

459
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,145
but relieved at the same time.

460
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,064
So I guess I had been waiting
to run into you.

461
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,318
I'm going to keep avoiding you,

462
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,986
so don't tell anyone.
