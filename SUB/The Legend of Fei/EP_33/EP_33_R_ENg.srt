133
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,110
Our parents and we lost each other.

134
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,760

He said there was no war in the south.

137

He had planned to take us to the south.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,950
We found this shabby temple on our way

139
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,950
as a temporary shelter.

140
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,950
Where is the teacher, then?

141
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,230
Hearing that the Demons came around,

142
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,830
he’s gone out to see what’s happening.

143
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,670
He’ll be back soon, I guess.

144

145
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,390

I heard of him from the teacher.

152
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,320
Hou Jian was a rebel

Huang Shenbian?

165
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,980
I heard of him from my uncle.

166
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,930
But he’s also been dead
for over twenty years.

167
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,660
Governor Huang fought hard

168
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,930
and pledged to defend His Majesty.

169
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,610
But they’re all dead?

170
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,780
The Xiao family is gone.

171
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,050
His Majesty is gone.

172
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,780
That explains. That explains.

173
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,930
Sir, did you break your head

174
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,780
when you fell?

175
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,050
Let’s go.

176
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,370
The Demons will easily catch up
according to the horseshoe marks.

177
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,930
Go, or it’ll be too late.

178
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,340

So many children in the temple.

182
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,050
Can they leave?

183
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,980
If the Demons track us down,

184
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
they must know

we’ve come this way.

186
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,050
If they fail to find us,

187
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,420
they will hurt these children,

188
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,740
considering how evil they are.

189
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,370
They’re after us!

190
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,810
Why will they hurt these children?

191
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,930
If the Demons were
as simple-minded as you,

192
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,300
the world would have been in peace.

193
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,010
Sir.

194
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,930
If the Demons break in,

195
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,610
we’ll try to hold them back.

196
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,690
You can run away

197
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,740
with these children.

198
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,900
Girl.

199
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,570
You don’t even know who I am.

200
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,220
Why do you help me?

201
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,900
You don’t need to fight the Demons

202
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,420
for a mere stranger.

203
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,900
We, the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

204
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,420
have fought the Demons many times.

205
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,180
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

206
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,370
Who...?

207
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,100
Who is Li Zheng to you?

208
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,610
You know my grandfather?

209
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,010
Sir.

210
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,860
We risked our lives
to keep you safe all the way.

211
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,810
Now you know who we are.

212
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,740
Shouldn’t you tell us who you are?

213
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
I’m Liu Youliang.

214
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,180
I’m just an old grave keeper,

215
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
unknown to the public.

216
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,010
The Demons sent Tong Tianyang

217
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,900
for a mere grave keeper?

218
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,300
What if there’s treasure in the grave

219
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,900
that can conquer the whole world?

220
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Treasure.

221
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,250
Treasure?

222
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,220
Girl, come over.

223
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,300
Don’t go.

224
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,570
Sir, you haven’t answered

225
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,010
our question yet.

226
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,300
Who exactly are you?

227
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,540
You’re so anxious about my identity?

228
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,450
My identity doesn’t matter.

229
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,900
What I’ve been guarding matters most!

230
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,690
I’m a bodyguard
of Governor Huang Shenbian.

231
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,980
When putting down the rebellion,

232
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,900
Governor Huang transferred me
out of the army,

233
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,690
to guard something,

234
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,370
named the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

235
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,050
-The Color of Ocean and Heaven again?
-The Color of Ocean and Heaven again?

236
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,180
Yeah.

237
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,050
Your grandfather was
one of the guardians.

238
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,010
You must have heard of it.

239
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,660
Governor Huang said

240
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,300
he would send someone
with the ripple-shaped object

241
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,690
after putting down the rebellion.

242
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,130
I would help to get out
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

243
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,930
Unexpectedly,

244
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,570
I waited for over twenty years.

245
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,300
Over twenty years?

246
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,900
Sir, were you all alone

247
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,740
during these years?

248
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,340
Yeah, I was all alone.

249
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,570
No.

250
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,570
I don’t even know what I am now,

251
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,370
a lonely human or a ghost?

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,050
All right.

253
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,980
After giving him some energy

254
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,100
and feeding him the decoction,

255
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,450
we can finally keep him alive
for the moment.

256
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,860
Tongming.

257
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,660
How long can the decoction effect last?

258
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
As far as I see,

259
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,450
one month, at most.

260
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,010
<i>Chen Junfu, Immortal of Penglai</i>
You must be kidding.

261
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,980
Even if you go personally,

262
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,300
it’ll take more than one month
to get the Fire Lotus.

263
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Not to mention that young girl.

264
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,340
I trust her.

265
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,130
If she can’t come back in one month,

266
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,130
how...

267
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,250
how can we help Anzhi?

268
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,860
It’s her predestined fate.

269
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180
It’s also Anzhi’s.

270
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,010
The Three-kind Decoction

271
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,780
will force out his last vitality

272
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,450
so that he won’t be a cold dead body

273
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,860
without any movement.

274
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,300
But after taking one dose,

275
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,810
he’ll lose some vitality.

276
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,180
After taking three doses,

277
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,050
if we still can’t find the antidote...

278
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,980
Then why did you use
such a strong decoction?

279
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,980
He fights against Bone-chilling
with his force.

280
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,420
Once he becomes weak,

281
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,930
he can’t be saved.

282
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,130
Even if we find
the Book of Almighty Medicine,

283
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,300
it won’t help.

284
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,900
Have you got any clue about the Book?

285
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,010
His Junior Master Lin and I
have travelled for years,

286
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,780
but haven’t found any clue.

287
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,130
Big Medicine Valley has been destroyed,

288
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,050
even without a single heir.

289
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,780
Maybe the Book of Almighty Medicine

290
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,220
was burnt into ashes

291
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,740
in the fire of Big Medicine Valley.

292
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,690
Go!

293
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,570
Go!

294
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,010
Go!

295
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,420
Forget it.

296
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,050
Since you don’t want to go,

297
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,570
wait here for me.

298
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,180
Excuse me.

299
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,090
Did you see a girl
with a long blade on her back?

300
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,490
Yes.

301
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,060
Did she go that away?

302
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,370
Yes.

303
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,730
I’ve never seen
such a stubborn girl like her.

304
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,610
Do you know her?

305
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,730
It’s very dangerous over there.

306
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,010
There was a snowstorm, wasn’t there?

307
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,490
Yeah.

308
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,090
How did you know?

309
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,460
You’re native?

310
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,970
After the snowstorm,

311
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,490
there’s always an avalanche.

312
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,490
She’s just in time.

313
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,700
You know there was a snowstorm

314
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,660
and you’re still going up the mountain?

315
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,850
Are you trying to kill yourself?

316
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,330
Will a wolf of the snow mountain

317
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,820
fear the snowstorm?

318
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,780
Are...? Are you...?

319
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,540
Snow Wolf?

320
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
It’s said

321
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,420
that you grew up in a wolf’s den,

322
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,940
Snow Wolf is back! Snow Wolf is back!

323
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,970
Snow Wolf is back! Snow Wolf is back!

324
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,370
At first,

325
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
Mr. Chongxiao and I

326
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,010
often wrote letters to each other.

327
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,900
But...

328
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,940
He never told me

329
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,700
there was a new emperor.

330
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,090
I think

331
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,730
he doesn’t want me to leave
without permission.

332
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,250
What is

333
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,820
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

334
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,850
So many people died to guard it.

335
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,900
The saddest part is

336
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,900
after guarding it for over twenty years,

337
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,850
I still don’t know what it is.

338
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,250
Nor do I know

339
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,780
who I should give it to.

340
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Well, this is life.

341
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,540
Well, it’s not the worst.

342
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,730
These days,

343
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,090
Mr. Chongxiao hasn’t written to me.

344
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,180
You can’t imagine

345
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,210
how I felt.

346
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,420
It was so quiet.

347
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,300
Around me,

348
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,460
there were only ghosts and wind.

349
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,180
I couldn’t help leaving that place,

350
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,730
trying to find Mr. Chongxiao.

351
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,180
Mr. Chongxiao?

352
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,250
I heard of him from my brother.

353
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,180
He knew Mr. Chongxiao.

354
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,730
When we’re out of trouble,

355
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,730
I’ll ask my brother to look for him.

356
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,970
It’s too late, I’m afraid.

357
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,490
As soon as I came out,

358
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,580
I knew the ripple pattern
appeared again.

359
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
It’s something

360
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,540
Governor Huang tried hard to hide.

361
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,900
But it was discussed in public

362
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
at the funny
Demon-Extermination Assembly.

363
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,940
How ridiculous!

364
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,820
I had planned to go to the Assembly

365
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,370
and see what was happening.

366
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
Unexpectedly,

367
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,580
an old acquaintance from the palace

368
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,940
found me.

369
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,420
The Demons

370
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,580
also ran after me.

371
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,820
You mean Chu Tianyu?

372
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,780
Girl, you know a lot.

373
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,970
My cousin and Ying Hecong killed him.

374
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,130
I certainly know him.

375
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,300
Something is wrong.

376
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,540
They’re catching up.

377
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,370
Girl, take this.

378
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,330
Sir.

379
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,460
What’s this?

380
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,660
Recite it.

381
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,540
What’s the red part?

382
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,060
Recite the poem at the back.

383
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,970
Poem?

384
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,500
<i>Send stones to the north of the river
and climb the mountain for Ganoderma.</i>

385
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,730
I’m ordered
to guard the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

386
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,090
Except me,

387
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,900
no other living men

388
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,210
know its location.

389
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,460
Now,

390
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,130
I’m giving this secret to you.

391
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,660
Recite the map,

392
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,820
so that the Color of Ocean and Heaven
won’t disappear.

393
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,090
The hard work of a generation

394
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,940
will not be wasted.

395
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,460
-Hyah.
-Hyah.

396
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,920
<i>Music comes everywhere
when four songs are played.</i>

397
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,380
<i>The valley is beautiful
where birds sing beautifully.</i>

398
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,460
<i>Send stones to the north of the river
and climb the mountain for Ganoderma.</i>

399
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,500
<i>I go to Wuzhou to see you
where mountains appear at dusk.</i>

400
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Kids.

401
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,780
No matter what happens,

402
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,660
do not come out.

403
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,460
<i>Lanruo Temple</i>

404
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
<i>Lanruo Temple</i>

405
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,420
Get out of the way and let them leave.

406
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,460
Otherwise,

407
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,010
I’ll tear the map!

408
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,660
Fine. Fine.

409
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,130
Don’t be nervous.

410
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,300
Liu Youliang,

411
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,660
give me the map,

412
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,250
and I’ll let them go.

413
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,460
Sir, don’t give it to them.

414
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,820
If you do, we can’t leave!

415
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,300
Shut up!

416
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,490
Do...? Do you think

417
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,370
you still have the right

418
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,090
to choose?

419
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,610
You must keep your promise.

420
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,090
You!

421
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,730
Sir, don’t give it to him.

422
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,700
Don’t worry, girl.

423
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,730
At last!

424
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,210
At last, I’ve found what Lord wants!

425
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,300
Why is there a poem?

426
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,820
Run!

427
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,610
Sir! Sir!

428
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,010
Run!

429
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,850
Sir!

430
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,210
Go! Hurry!

431
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,060
Sir!

432
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,420
Go!

433
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:50,610
Go!

434
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,780
-Sir.
-Go!

435
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,820
Go!

436
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Why?

437
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,580
What did you do?

438
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,210
Why is it burnt?

439
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,730
You want to know?

440
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,850
But I won’t tell you!

441

442
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,660
It’s been nearly ten days.

443
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,370
Still no message from that girl?

444
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,490
If she travels fast,

445
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,580
she has just arrived at the foot
of the snow mountain.

446
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,060
Be patient.

447
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,460
Look at him.

448
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,330
He’s such a good young man.

449
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,490
He left us for years.

450
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,490
When he comes back, he’s dying.

451
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,610
If I knew it,

452
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,330
I wouldn’t have given Anzhi to Wang Lin,

453
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,490
no matter how he persuaded me.

454
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,820
Anzhi decided

455
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,730
where he would go.

456
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,730
None of us

457
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,250
could decide

458
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,940
for him.

459
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,060
After the mutiny
against the former dynasty,

460
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,820
Anzhi was saved and sent to us.

461
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,330
None of us had raised a baby.

462
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,130
We were busy taking care of him.

463
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,940
When he first stood up,

464
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,210
he was this tall.

465
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,210
When he grew a bit up,

466
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,820
he began to fool us around

467
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,330
every day.

468
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,820
If I remember correctly,

469
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,060
when Wang Lin found us,

470
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,780
he was

471
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,580
just this tall.

472
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,490
Yes. Yes.

473
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,900
Just this tall.

474
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,130
To my waist.

475
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,780
Yes.

476
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,060
At that time,

477
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,610
we quarreled for three days and nights.

478
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,460
You and Lin didn’t want him to leave.

479
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,460
I still remember that very clearly.

480
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,180
We didn’t want that, of course.

481
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,060
Everyone knew

482
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,300
Wang Lin only wanted
to recover the former dynasty.

483
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,330
Later,

484
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,370
you and his Junior Master told me

485
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,370
if I didn’t let him go back,

486
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,610
he would be a mere villager

487
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,130
on Penglai Island

488
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,010
all his life.

489
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,610
Even when he died,

490
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,490
he would only think

491
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,610
this small island was the whole world.

492
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,850
His Junior Master loved him most.

493
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,210
But it was also him

494
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,060
who urged him to leave.

495
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,060
He said Anzhi couldn’t decide
where to live

496
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,180
before he had enough experience.

497
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,010
Could this be

498
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,370
his final destiny?

499
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,330
A generous man like him

500
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,010
would not stay

501
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,780
on Penglai Island

502
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,780
and grew old

503
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,300
with us.

504
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
It was his own choice.

505
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
It was also his fate.

506
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,660
Besides,

507
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,850
if he didn’t go,

508
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,090
he wouldn’t have met the girl

509
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,090
who is taking a great risk

510
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,010
to find the Fire Lotus for him.

511
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,660
Fei.

512
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,130
Be careful, Fei!

513
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,210
Fei.

514
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,780
I met that girl.

515
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,730
She’s faithful.

516
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,210
Anzhi has a good taste.

517
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,850
If Tongming is right,

518
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,250
the Fire Lotus should be
on the top of the snow peak.

519
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,370
I must get it.

520
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,700
He can’t wait for another decade.

521
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,820
Beautiful girl, long time no see.

522
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,370
We met hurriedly
at Demon-Extermination Assembly.

523
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,660
I lost you
before having a talk with you.

524
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,970
You left in such a hurry.

525
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,490
For what?

526
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,660
None of your business!

527
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,180
You killed Chu Tianyu.

528
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Well done.

529
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,700
But you also took away
the Seal of Cautiousness

530
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,660
he snatched from me,

531
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,180
didn’t you?

532
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,460
If I hadn’t taken it,

533
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,180
would I leave it to you for fun?

534
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,850
It belongs to Mr. Huo.

535
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,130
Why did you snatch it?

536
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,250
Did you also believe

537
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,780
what Huo Liantao said

538
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,210
and want to find

539
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,490
the so-called treasure?

540
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,180
Phoenix Master.

541
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,090
If we fight now,

542
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,780
neither you nor I can get any benefit.

543
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,250
How about this?

544
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,780
Let me pick the Fire Lotus first.

545
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,210
Then I can let you punch me three times.

546
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:43,820
What do you think?

547
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,660
Funny.

548
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,370
Since when did I need you

549
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,010
to make a concession?

550
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,330
Don’t think I will show any mercy

551
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,850
just because you look beautiful.

552
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,180
The lotus has nine petals
which blossom every ten years.

553
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,700
When nine pedals blossom,

554
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,490
it’s the perfect time to pick the lotus.

555
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,850
You don’t want to wait
for another decade, huh?

556
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,660
Don’t touch it!

557
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,580
If you want it,

558
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,820
give me the Seal of Cautiousness.

559
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,580
What do you think you are?

560
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,420
How dare you ask
for the Seal of Cautiousness!

561
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,970
Don’t you want it?

562
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,130
Why don’t we cooperate

563
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:30,900
and get it from her?

564
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,700
You know what?

565
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,780
On the snow mountain,

566
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,490
no one can defeat me, Lu Tiankuang.

567
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,370
Snow Wolf Lu Tiankuang
with Demons Manor?

568
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,540
How are you doing?

569
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,460
Funny.

570
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,580
What do you do after you get the Seal?

571
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,210
Will you

572
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,370
cut it into halves?

573
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,660
Everyone with the Demons makes me sick.

574
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,970
Fire Lotus!

575
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,660
Fei.

576
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,850
Fei.

577
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,970
It’s been days and I miss you so much.

578
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
Why do you

579
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,730
look so haggard?

580
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,730
You woke up?

581
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,820
You really woke up?

582
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,250
Are you a bear?

583
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,210
Why are you wearing so much?

584
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,780
It’s cold.

585
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,460
I would be frozen
without so many clothes.

586
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,850
Oh,

587
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,820
where’s the Fire Lotus?

588
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,130
I...

589
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,660
I haven’t found it.

590
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,180
Fei.

591
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,330
Fei.

592
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,370
Anzhi!

593
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,730
Anzhi!

594
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,940
What did he just say?

595
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,900
Merciful Buddha.

596
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,060
How poor he is!

597
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,940
He can hardly enjoy love.

598
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,090
Fei.

599
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,900
Anzhi.

600
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,130
Fei.

601
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:28,780
Anzhi.

602
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,370
Since it’s our destiny,

603
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,180
we can’t change it.

604
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,940
I just want you

605
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,700
to be safe.

606
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,780
But I also told you.

607
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,330
No matter how far it is,

608
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,060
I will go anywhere

609
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
that all ordinary people can go

610
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,940
within the world.

611
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,370
Silly girl.

612
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,010
You’re so exhausted.

613
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,210
Is it worth your while?

614
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,370
Forget it.

615
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,820
Stop looking for the Fire Lotus.

616
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,850
Go back.

617
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,090
It’s worth my while.

618
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,420
Took up your blade
when you just woke up?

619
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,660
You’d like another fight?

620
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
Don’t worry.

621
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,850
I distinguish friends and enemies.

622
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,570
We just fought
against the enemy together.

623
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,700
I won’t fight you when you’re weak.

624
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,050
What’s this?

625
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,260
Dried muskrat.

626
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,420
I ate some

627
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
and dried the rest.

628
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,180
It’s lucky to have some meat now.

629
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,180
Eat it.

630
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,260
Or even if you were strong enough
to fight me now,

631
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,810
you couldn’t get
through the coming snowstorm.

632
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,290
May I have some more?

633
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,050
You’ve come around quickly.

634
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,940
I must survive.

635
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,290
You went up the snow mountain alone

636
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,850
and risked your life for the Fire Lotus.

637
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,740
Why do you value your life now?

638
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,050
I can’t die.

639
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,570
Someone is waiting for me.

640
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,700
I think,

641
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,420
you’re addicted to saving people.

642
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,130
Are their lives
more important than yours?

643
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,740
How impolite!

644
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,420
Their lives aren’t
more important than mine.

645
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,260
But...

646
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
Have you experienced such feelings

647
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,050
that you want to sacrifice everything,

648
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,570
just to make someone

649
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,330
talk to you again?

650
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,050
Why did you help me?

651
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,660
I thought you had great martial arts.

652
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,130
You must have practiced them

653
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,420
for many years.

654
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,810
If you died on the snow mountain
without a reason,

655
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,050
it would be a pity.

656
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,980
Everyone in this world

657
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,050
wants me to die early,

658
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,090
except you.

659
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,900
I’m afraid you’re the only one

660
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,940
who thinks my death would be a pity.

661
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,570
Well, you were the first martial master

662
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,610
I had met after I left home.

663
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,420
You sang the Crying beautifully.

664
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,370
Really?

665
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,180
Would you like to listen?

666
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,020
I’m afraid I’ll cry.

667
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,700
This is the former branch of Qi School.

668
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,900
You can leave me here.

669
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,850
Go back.

670
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,700
Li Sheng.

671
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,290
Shall we go with you

672
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,700
so that we can take care of each other?

673
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,090
This forest is set
according to Qi Men Dun Jia Formation.

674
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,940
Outsiders will get lost in it.

675
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,260
It was built to stop outsiders.

676
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,940
Mr. Chongxiao is a friend of mine.

677
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,050
But when I break in,

678
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,570
I’m already being impolite.

679
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,850
I can’t take anyone else in.

680
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,220
You can wait for me
at the secret service down the hill.

681
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,740
-Aye.
-Aye.

682
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:35,340
<i>Forbidden Forest</i>

683
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,500
Chongxiao, are you still alive?

684
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,330
Are you still making trouble
after you die?

685
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,330
Still making trouble?

686
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,020
The formation again?

687
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,220
When I was little, my father forced me

688
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,610
to recite it so many times.

689
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,610
Why can’t I ever remember?

690
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,370
What Qian, three Yang...

691
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,290
Kun, six Yin.

692
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,180
Zhen...

693
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,180
Zhen what?

694
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,980
Qian, three Yang.

695
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,370
Kun, six Yin.

696
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,290
Zhen...

697
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,260
Zhen, six Yin on the top!

698
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,610
Zhen, six Yin on the top!

699
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:47,370
<i>Forbidden Forest</i>

700
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,500
Zhen, six Yin on the top!

701
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,530
I made it!

702
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,940
<i>Forbidden Forest</i>

703
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,180
Con...

704
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,610
Congratulations, Lord.

705
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,330
Congratulations, Lord.

706
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,330
Congratulations, Lord.

707
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,260
You’ve...

708
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,090
You’ve...

709
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,420
You’ve got better martial arts.

710
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,770
You saw that map, didn’t you?

711
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,330
Lord, I... I did see it.

712
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,290
With... With a glance.

713
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,370
There were a few lines on it.

714
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,900
They looked standardized,

715
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,530
like a poem.

716
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,700
What poem?

717
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,370
Looks...

718
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,740
Looks like...

719
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,020
Looks like words...

720
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,770
Something like

721
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,220
birds, women, martial...

722
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,740
Stones...

723
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,700
What else?

724
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,130
All right. All right.

725
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,980
What else is on the map?

726
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,610
Else...

727
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:57,740
What else...?

728
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,020
Some...

729
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,290
Some things are on it.

730
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,610
What are they?

731
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,290
They are...

732
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,050
Uh...

733
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,660
There’s a...

734
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,090
a gold bracelet.

735
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,020
Yes, Lord.

736
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,370
The bracelet
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

737
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,610
And there’s a longevity lock.

738
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,570
A scab...

739
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,700
Scabbard.

740
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,260
And...

741
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,940
A seal.

742
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,850
Yes. Yes.

743
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,980
A seal...

744
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,220
No. No.

745
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,020
Lord.

746
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,900
What else?

747
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,500
And...

748
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,810
And...

749
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,740
Uh...

750
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,370
A wh...

751
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,050
Whisk!

752
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,020
Yes, Lord.

753
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,610
A barren whisk.

754
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,420
Whisk?

755
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,940
Sure enough,

756
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,460
Chongxiao was also involved.

757
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,940
Ask Gu Tianxian

758
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,130
to keep a close eye on Chongxiao.

759
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,050
Aye!

760
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,850
Lord.

761
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,130
I know you questioned me

762
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,220
so that I could make amends
for my failure.

763
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:07,820
Get out!

764
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,500
Go lock yourself

765
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,660
and think about what else is on the map.

766
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,850
Draw everything out!

767
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:16,930
Get out!

768
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,020
Draw? Draw?

769
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,530
I’ll draw it. I will.
