Coming.

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,360
Excuse me.

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,270
Yes, Miss.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,160
Have you seen a young man
with Double Blades?

00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,830
No.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,120
Think again.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,040
He came from this direction

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,870
and would’ve passed here.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,590
I don’t remember seeing him.

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,190
You can check with others.

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,360
Hello, pretty.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,390
Are you

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,000
looking for your husband?

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,110
Relax.

35
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,960
What was he thinking

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,600
that he left you alone?

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,550
Don’t worry.

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,830
I’ll look after you for him.

39
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,080
Get lost!

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,630
Thank you, sir.

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,360
I’ve seen the one you’re looking for.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,720
Wait, sir.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,000
My lord,

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,630
these are the tongues of those

45
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,600
who insulted Miss Wu.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,270
Feed them to the dogs.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,190
Yes.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,110
Where is she?

49
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,320
I think she’s heading to the woods

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,830
with that strange man.

51
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,270
Don’t worry.

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,670
She’s still under our watch.

53
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,520
Nothing will happen to her.

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,030
How can you be sure?

55
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,910
Where are the woods?

56
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,110
I will go there myself.

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,080
Yes.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,160
And

59
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,470
get me some plain clothes.

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,000
I don’t want her to recognize me.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,880
Yes.

62
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,080
Sir,

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,030
where are we going?

64
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,720
That man is about this tall

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
with Double Blades.

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,160
He seemed to be in a rush

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,360
as if he was looking for someone.

68
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes. That’s him!

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,470
<i>Forbidden Forest</i>
I saw him

70
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,000
going into this forest.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,240
Thank you for telling me.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,960
I’m going in and look for him.

73
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,830
Hold on.

74
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,600
This place is dangerous.

75
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,440
Locals call it man-eating forest

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,920
in which demons disguise as aged plants

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
to mislead humans

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,720
and devour their souls.

79
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,880
Few can come out alive

80
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,670
once they enter there.

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,200
Really?

<i>Forbidden Forest</i>

83
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,600
The terrain seems unusual

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,350
but follows the Eight-trigram.

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,200
I heard some sects would use

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,270
such formations for safety

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,040
to keep outsiders away.

88
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,720
This forest must be one example.

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
I’m surprised

90
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,920
that you’re aware of that.

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,230
Do you know the way out?

92
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,480
I don’t.

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
I’ve only seen it once.

94
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,390
You don’t know?

95
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,440
I thought that man had told you.

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,720
What a waste of time!

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,200
Sir.

98
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,740
<i>Forbidden Forest</i>

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,440
Hey, beauty.

100
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,160
There’s no free meal.

101
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Be honest with me.

102
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,110
Do you have the Seal of Cautiousness?

103
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,670
No.

104
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,720
Liar!

105
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,390
On the day of the Assembly,

106
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,070
the old bastard Chu Tianyu

107
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,830
stole that Seal from me,

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,200
but got killed by you.

109
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,880
If you don’t have it,

110
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,440
where else could it be?

111
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,950
That belongs to the Huos.

112
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,760
Why should I give it to you?

113
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,160
Listen,

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,040
don’t push me!

115
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,790
I thought

116
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,110
Phoenix was decent

117
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,550
and loyal.

118
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,040
Turns out

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,830
you’re no different

120
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,160
from those rats

121
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,510
who’d bite each other’s heads off

122
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,760
only for a bracelet.

123
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,110
Don’t degrade me to their level.

124
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,510
I want the Seal back

125
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,790
simply because it’s the Huos’.

126
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,720
That has nothing to do

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,230
with the bracelet.

128
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
I don’t buy it.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,000
Whatever.

130
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,200
I heard it’s the key to divine skills.

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,040
Don’t you want them, Phoenix?

132
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,600
100 Destructive Palms are enough.

133
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,550
Why do I need other skills?

134
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,790
As inexperienced as I am,

135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,640
I’ve been told

136
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,440
that you’re one of the most

137
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,790
talented.

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
You were aggressive years back

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,830
and your Palms

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,390
are a double-edged sword.

141
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,200
It’s invincible at the peak,

142
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,480
but once you go downhill,

143
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,760
so will your skills.

144
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,070
I had my doubts,

145
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,600
but now,

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
that seems to be true.

147
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,760
When I tested you,

148
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,790
your moves were a bit slow,

149
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,440
especially when I grabbed your jerkies.

150
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,510
Obviously,

151
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,720
your energy was low

152
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,110
which slowed down your Palms.

153
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,160
Otherwise,

154
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,510
how could I’ve dodged

155
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,640
the head of Four Guardians’ move?

156
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,320
Didn’t you see Zheng Luosheng

157
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,390
as the head?

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
He’s nothing!

159
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,070
Hey, beauty,

160
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,040
are you flattering me

161
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,880
or scaring me?

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,110
I know how skilled I am.

163
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,760
I’ve never placed any hope

164
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,510
on that bracelet.

165
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,230
I’m only after that Seal

166
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,440
because no one else deserves it

167
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,960
other than the Huos.

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,200
The snow is about to stop.

169
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,230
Phoenix,

170
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,670
once we’re out,

171
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
we’ll have to battle again.

172
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,470
I must say

173
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,840
you have a big heart.

174
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,080
Do you really believe

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,030
that I won’t kill you

176
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,350
in your sleep?

177
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,200
Phoenix doesn’t kill beauties.

178
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,520
You know me too well.

179
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,520
Fire Lotus is important to her.

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,550
They won’t leave

181
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,230
and must be somewhere close.

182
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,710
Wait.

183
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,080
I’ve been here three times.

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,470
The formation here

185
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,640
is more complicated
than that in the Huo’s.

186
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,400
What to do?

187
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,470
How did Sheng get out last time?

188
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,470
Miss, are you alright?

189
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,520
You’re...?

190
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,640
A...

191
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,000
A woodcutter.

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,550
How did you get through

193
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,790
the Eight-trigram Formation?

194
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,200
I don’t know anything

195
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
other than cutting wood.

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,760
Do you know the routes here?

197
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,710
My friend is inside.

198
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,320
Outsiders don’t know

199
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,080
there’s a cave deep in the woods.

200
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,520
A hothead with
Double Blades came earlier.

201
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,080
You must be looking for him, right?

202
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,880
Yes.

203
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,320
The cave

204
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
belonged to a school

205
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,960
that had been wiped out.

206
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,350
It’s right ahead.

207
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,110
You can go there yourself.

208
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,030
Thanks.

209
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,230
Sheng!

210
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,960
Sheng!

211
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,080
Chuchu,

212
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,350
how did you get here?

213
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,960
I asked around

214
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,670
and learned you left for this direction,

215
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,960
so I followed you here.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
I came to

217
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,520
check on Mr. Chongxiao.

218
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,320
Hadn’t we agreed

219
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
to leave together

220
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
and I’d share your burden?

221
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,440
Yet you sneaked out alone.

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
I’m sorry.

223
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,400
It won’t happen again.

224
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,230
Wu Chuchu,

225
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,110
you’ll regret it.

226
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,710
Are you with the Qi School?

227
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,230
How did you know

228
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,280
the route?

229
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
I come in and out every day

230
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,520
to cut wood for a living.

231
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,230
I know this place like home.

232
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,520
Have you seen someone

233
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,080
with Double Blades?

234
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
You know him?

235
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,790
More than that.

236
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,030
He isn’t our member

237
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,550
but he stole our skills.

238
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,080
I must kill him!

239
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,590
How come no one is here?

240
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,230
It’s where the Qi School used to be.

241
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,710
Did something happen

242
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,080
to Mr. Chongxiao?

243
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,960
Feng Wuyan!

244
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,000
Hand over that thing!

245
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,150
What do you mean?

246
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,280
Don’t play dumb.

247
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,520
I saw you had that whisk at the inn.

248
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,670
Let go of her!

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,320
Only if you give me that whisk!

250
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,320
Don’t.

251
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,470
Get it yourself.

252
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,110
Let’s go!

253
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,110
A token of power.

254
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,520
From now on,

255
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,400
I’m the chief of the Qi School.

256
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
I am the chief!

257
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,030
Are you trying to kill me?

258
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,640
If not,

259
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,760
will you let me live?

260
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,030
Listen,

261
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,840
that old fart Chongxiao is dead.

262
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,520
He was killed

263
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,590
by the one who gave you the whisk.

264
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,760
A dead man’s wish isn’t important.

265
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,080
You will need me

266
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,280
if you want to be the chief.

267
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,350
How so?

268
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,000
If Mr. Chongxiao is gone,

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,520
I’m the only one left

270
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,960
with skills of the Qi School.

271
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,200
Alright.

272
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,200
Tell me everything

273
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,640
that Chongxiao

274
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,280
taught you

275
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,640
if you want to live.

276
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,670
I can do it myself.

277
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,150
One move

278
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,030
and skills of the Qi School
will be gone forever.

279
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,200
When I

280
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,590
see your ancestors down there,

281
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,790
what should I tell them?

282
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,740
<i>Great virtue is like water.</i>

283
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,030
It’s all your fault!

284
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,500
You’re useless.

285
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,790
<i>Great virtue is like water.</i>
Useless!

286
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
Useless!

287
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,030
What’s wrong? Stop beating yourself.

288
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,960
When I was young,

289
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,030
I didn’t take those skills seriously.

290
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,710
But now, they’re almost lost.

291
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,110
No one knows it except for you.

292
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,710
I have to rely on a stranger

293
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,000
to come home.

294
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,910
How could I be a chief?

295
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,200
I let my ancestors down!

296
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,590
My father was the chief,

297
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,050
but I refused to learn skills from him.

298
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,840
So

299
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,590
he favored Chongxiao.

300
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,800
Then I left in a rage.

301
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,560
I once

302
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,000
did the same.

303
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,350
Did you leave for real?

304
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,950
If not,

305
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,800
my father wouldn’t have

306
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,920
made Chongxiao the next chief so easily.

307
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,230
I lost

308
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,700
because I was young and stupid.

309
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,800
It was my fault.

310
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,470
Over the past 20 years,

311
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,160
this is the first time

312
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,410
I’ve ever come back

313
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,820
only to see Qi School become like this.

314
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,320
All these years,

315
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,190
have you regretted it?

316
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,190
Why?

317
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,070
Why should I?

318
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,560
I’m the black sheep of the family,

319
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,070
but everyone else is gone.

320
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,590
The former chief

321
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,520
got killed.

322
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,950
Why?

323
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,430
His skills were poor.

324
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,070
At this point,

325
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,950
only I can clean up the mess.

326
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,950
Tell me,

327
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,110
why should I regret it?

328
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,800
Why should I?

329
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,230
Hey,

330
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,160
others would be at each other’s throats

331
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,280
for that Seal,

332
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,160
while you’d give it up

333
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,350
so easily.

334
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,830
I can’t care less about any token

335
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,520
or that bracelet,

336
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
as long as it doesn’t

337
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,190
fall into the wrong hands.

338
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,590
Alright.

339
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,920
Since you don’t want it,

340
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,190
I’ll finish this show with you.

341
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,280
Once it’s over,

342
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,240
give me the Seal

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,760
and I’ll get you the Fire Lotus.

344
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Sure.

345
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,310
Deal.

346
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
Deal.

347
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,640
Listen, give me the Seal

348
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,830
in exchange for your life.

349
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,310
Or I’ll kill you!

350
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,470
You want that Seal?

351
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,710
Go get it yourself.

352
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,950
You...

Zhou Fei!

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,880
The tips

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,880
are some basic math.

357
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,520
Math again! It gives me a headache.

358
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,590
Everyone has his or her strength.

359
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,400
I wasn’t a talented martial artist

360
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,760
and I always wondered

361
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,950
if I was too dumb.

362
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,110
But I mastered skills

363
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,590
of the Qi School

364
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,950
quite quickly

365
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,880
and learned more
than I had been taught.

366
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,680
You aren’t good at math,

367
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,500
but you’re obsessed with martial arts.

368
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,760
You’ve made great achievements

369
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,450
and don’t need to learn this.

370
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,750
I have to.

371
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040
Or I’d be a laughing stock

372
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,470
if I didn’t have the necessary knowledge

373
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,710
as the chief of our school.

374
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,640
“Thunder is preferred in Eight-trigram,

375
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,230
so it’s placed at the third position.

376
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,590
Three positions form a whole

377
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,520
and shouldn’t be changed.

378
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,190
To guard one’s home,

379
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,190
place thunder at the third position

380
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,680
to create six positions...”

381
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,110
Ripple pattern?

382
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,070
Why is it here?

383
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,070
Is there anything wrong with it?

384
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,680
Sir,

385
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,400
did Mr. Chongxiao ever mention

386
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,160
The Color of Ocean and Heaven to you?

387
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,230
The Color of Ocean?

388
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,230
That geezer secluded
himself in the mountain.

389
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,040
How could he see the ocean?

390
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,110
Never mind.

391
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,760
Just checking.

392
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,190
My lord,

393
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,590
there might be a cave ahead.

394
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,110
Who could’ve gone through the woods

395
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,830
and made this far?

396
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,350
It’s my fault.

397
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,950
I shouldn’t have left those marks

398
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,830
and caused Sheng trouble.

399
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,470
Who are you?

400
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,880
What are you doing here?

401
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,560
My lord,

402
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
those marks found on the trees

403
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
seem to be telling the direction.

404
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,400
Someone must’ve

405
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,920
taken this path before us.

406
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,220
Sir!

407
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,470
She didn’t leave as you wished

408
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,430
but came back instead.

409
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,830
Young man,

410
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,880
there you are.

411
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,560
You must be one of

412
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
the seven stupid Demons.

413
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,800
I’m

414
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,950
Giant Leopard, Gu Tianxian.

415
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,000
You came uninvited.

416
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,160
What do you want?

417
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,640
Greetings, Black Judge.

418
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,520
No.

419
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,680
I’ve become the chief of the Qi School.

420
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,520
Is the whisk at his waist

421
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,280
the one Lord mentioned?

422
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,520
I see.

423
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,710
Chief Feng,

424
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,560
we barely know

425
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,430
or hold a grudge against each other.

426
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,400
A fight is unnecessary.

427
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,680
I don’t want any trouble.

428
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,950
Hand over

429
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,400
your whisk to me,

430
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,230
and we’ll leave

431
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,350
you and your school alone.

432
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,190
Deal?

433
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,470
How dare you steal my spot!

434
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,430
Ripple pattern?

435
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,590
The whisk bears that pattern, too.

436
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,710
Your tricks

437
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,520
are nothing new to me.

438
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,190
Wait.

439
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,520
You seem hell-bent

440
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,400
on battling me.

441
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,830
That brush

442
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,710
isn’t the weapon

443
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,640
members of the Qi School would use.

444
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,920
Those who don’t know

445
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,640
would assume

446
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,000
you had found that whisk somewhere

447
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,110
and proclaimed yourself chief.

448
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,430
Fine.

449
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,950
Let me show you

450
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,900
what our school is capable of.

451
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,430
Sir,

452
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,950
Qi’s skills are most unpredictable.

453
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,350
Weapons don’t matter.

454
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,880
Don’t be fooled by him.

455
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,470
That makes sense.

456
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,000
Too late.

457
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,880
Be careful! The whisk is poisoned!

458
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,230
Liar!

459
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,680
Chuchu!

460
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,430
Chuchu!

461
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,800
Don’t worry about me.

462
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,760
Go after them!

463
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,040
-Yes. Go!
-Let’s go!

464
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,830
Chuchu!

465
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,520
Chuchu!

466
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,160
Hang in there! Stay with me, Chuchu.

467
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,040
Chuchu.

468
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,760
Be careful.

469
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,040
What’s wrong?

470
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,640
I’m fine

471
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,190
with the Muyun Gauze.

472
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,510
Why did you take such a risk?

473
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,310
Let’s go see Madam Nichang.

474
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,590
She cured Fei

475
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,950
when she was badly injured.

476
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,470
I’m sure she can cure you, too.

477
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,950
<i>Lingling Inn</i>

478
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,110
“Back in Wuzhou,

479
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,920
you went uphill to see
Ganoderma sinense,

480
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,560
and sent stones to Jiangbei.

481
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,950
You went uphill
to see Ganoderma sinense”.

482
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,590
A man died to protect that secret.

483
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,640
I must keep it in mind.

484
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,920
Excuse me. Are you Miss Li Yan?

485
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,590
And you are...

486
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,280
Those kids in the temple

487
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,230
call me teacher.

488
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,830
Hearing that you’re
staying at Lingling Inn,

489
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,520
I’m here to thank you.

490
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,590
So you’re their teacher.

491
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,680
I’m sorry.

492
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,280
They got into trouble because of us.

493
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,230
Please have a seat.

494
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,470
Thanks.

495
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,760
Good.

496
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,160
Girls of your Fortress

497
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,920
are well-bred and considerate.

498
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,230
No wonder Anzhi risked his life

499
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,830
to save you.

500
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,920
Anzhi?

501
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,160
That’s Xie Yun’s courtesy name.

502
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,830
<i>Teacher Lin Immortal of Penglai</i>
I’m Xie Yun’s uncle.

503
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,110
Is it true?

504
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,070
I thought

505
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,430
he had come out of nowhere.

506
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,830
It’s true

507
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,000
that he seldom

508
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,680
tells others about his background.

509
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,230
Learning that

510
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,280
he had used the Cloud-impelling Palm,

511
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,590
I knew

512
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,710
his life would be in danger.

513
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,640
That’s why

514
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,760
I came out

515
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,950
to bring him back for treatment

516
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,710
but that old monk Tongming,

517
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,110
Xie Yun’s master,

518
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,310
beat me to it.

519
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,000
So I could only go back.

520
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,110
On my way,

521
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,830
I ran into a group of homeless kids

522
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,000
and couldn’t turn a blind eye to them,

523
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,000
so I planned

524
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,310
to take them to the south

525
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,350
but got stopped by you and the Demons.

526
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,310
You’re Xie Yun’s uncle?

527
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,710
That’s great!

528
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,710
Could you tell him for me

529
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,640
that I’ve found clues to that bracelet?

530
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,110
There’s a poem on a map...

531
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,350
Alright, alright.

532
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,190
Tell him yourself

533
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,000
when you see him next time.

534
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I can’t wait that long.

535
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,430
My memory is bad.

536
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,550
I don’t want to ruin anything.

537
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,560
Young lady,

538
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,520
you’ve managed

539
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,230
to escape

540
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,920
from those Demons.

541
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,920
Don’t underestimate yourself.

542
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,040
I’m going back to Penglai.

543
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,710
Once Anzhi wakes up,

544
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,000
I’ll let him know.

545
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,710
He’ll come to you

546
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,000
if he wants that bracelet.

547
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,560
You’re still here!

548
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,760
Good boy!

549
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,920
Horses are most trustworthy.

550
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,920
Every being should be respected,

551
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,470
not to mention
our most loyal friends, horses.

552
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,560
If you’re good to them,

553
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,230
they’ll live and die with you

554
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,310
and never abandon you.

555
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,310
Thank you, Phoenix.

556
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,280
When I’m back,

557
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,920
I’ll wait for you at Lingling Inn

558
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,710
and give you the Seal.

559
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,350
Here’s a friendly reminder.

560
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,430
Your skills are bad for your health.

561
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,950
Use them as less as possible.

562
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,350
Listen to yourself.

563
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,040
Are we that close?

564
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,760
Why do you care

565
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,350
so much about my health?

566
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,640
Hey, beauty,

567
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,400
this is the last time I trust others.

568
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,280
Don’t let me down.

569
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,430
Xie Meimei, I’m back.

570
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,920
Wait for me!

571
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,640
Excuse me,

572
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,950
have you seen

573
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,310
the heiress to the South Blade,

574
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,160
Miss Zhou Fei?

575
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,800
Sir,

576
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,710
I’m a businessman

577
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,000
and I know little

578
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,310
about those martial artists,

579
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,400
you know.

580
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,230
She’s not too tall

581
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,230
with a long blade,

582
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,950
and she looks fierce and pretty.

583
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,070
Help! Help!

584
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,880
Sir!

585
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,710
Mr. Li, what happened to Miss Wu?

586
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,880
Can’t talk right now.

587
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,950
The Route Gang is well-connected.

588
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,280
Could you ask around

589
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,920
and tell me where Madam Nichang

590
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
and the Yuyi Troupe are?

591
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,950
After the Assembly,

592
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,160
she decided to retire

593
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,760
and returned to Qiaoyun House
in Hengyang.

594
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,830
Hengyang?

595
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,000
-Yes.
-Thanks.

596
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,520
Get me a carriage.

597
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,590
-We’re going there.
-Yes.

598
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,590
Are you Miss Zhou Fei’s cousin?

599
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,640
If you’re in a rush,

600
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,160
you can take our carriage.

601
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,710
Young Master Zhu.

602
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,710
That’s great.

603
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,590
Thanks a ton.

604
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,520
Don’t mention it, Mr. Li.

605
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,430
Let’s go.

606
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,280
Without Miss Zhou,

607
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,040
half of our members would’ve been killed

608
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,800
by Ding Kui before the Assembly.

609
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,350
Now, we’re at your disposal.

610
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,430
Two, three, three, three,
four, left, right.

611
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,710
Left, right.

612
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,230
What is this nonsense?

613
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Are you a member of the Qi School?

614
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,560
If I knew the way out,

615
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,280
I would’ve ditched you long ago.

616
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,430
Alright.

617
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,950
I’ll cut down all trees.

618
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,000
Then we can get out.

619
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,040
I dare you!

620
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,040
Stay away from

621
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
what belongs to our school.

622
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,070
Touch it

623
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,710
and I’ll kill you.

624
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,280
Commander,

625
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,470
Lord doesn’t receive any guests.

626
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,070
I’m here to say goodbye.

627
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,070
Let him in.

628
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,880
Yes.

629
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,560
Tianying,

630
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,080
long time no see.

631
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,520
Your flowers have grown even better.

632
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,190
Did you show up unannounced

633
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,760
only to see my flowers?

634
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,000
I dare not

635
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,600
go anywhere near them.

636
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Then why are you here?

637
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,800
We maintain an army
to use it when necessary.

638
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,280
Ever since General Wu Fei’s incident
was exposed,

639
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,190
tokens with ripple patterns
have appeared,

640
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,630
but the Demons have failed repeatedly.

641
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,680
What’s the point

642
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,650
of supporting them now?

643
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,870
Are you abandoning us?

644
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,080
When Xiao Chuan clobbered you,

645
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,430
you begged me

646
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,670
to poison him with Bone-chilling.

647
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,520
But that didn’t kill him.

648
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,230
That was pure luck.

649
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,500
I didn’t fail.

650
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
Yu Wenzhi,

651
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,080
if you go back on your word

652
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,470
and betray the Demons,

653
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,230
you know the consequence.

654
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,600
A commander like you

655
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,520
should be careful with

656
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,230
what you say and do.

657
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,710
Tianying,

658
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,470
you killed Li Zheng,

659
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,390
poisoned Xiao Chuan
and robbed the Big Medicine Valley,

660
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,560
leaving the world in awe.

661
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,280
That’s why I chose to
work with the Demons

662
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,950
to look for
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

663
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,190
And what now?

664
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,470
You lost miserably

665
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,470
to a little girl.

666
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,630
I’m utterly disappointed.

667
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,040
There’s still hope

668
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,190
before that token is found.

669
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,840
Unless you join the game.

670
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,910
Never mind.

671
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,830
I know you’ve already retired

672
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,800
and you’re too busy enjoying your life

673
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,040
in this manor

674
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,430
with Lord Shen.

675
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,600
You don’t have time

676
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
for my trifle.

677
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,390
I should leave.

678
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,160
Good day.

679
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,880
Hold on.

680
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,710
What did they say?

681
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,080
I didn’t hear it clearly

682
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,800
from afar.

683
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,360
Once it’s done,

684
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,200
you must give Tianshu

685
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,630
whatever he wants

686
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,320
in those treasures.

687
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,600
Only if you find them first.

688
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,560
According to Tong Tianyang’s message,

689
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,040
Chongxiao is one of the guardians

690
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,540
of that bracelet.

691
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,600
If my guess is right,

692
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,750
the hidden treasures must be
near the Big Medicine Valley.

693
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,490
Tianxian,

694
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,320
check that area.

695
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,150
Let me know

696
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,630
if you find anything.

697
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,090
Brother,

698
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,470
I’ll find them for you

699
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,560
at all costs.

700
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,470
My friend,

701
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,800
drink as much as you want.

702
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,390
There’s more.

703
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,790
Miss.

704
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,330
You must be Miss Zhou Fei, right?

705
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,540
You know me?

706
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,520
Anzhi was

707
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,840
mumbling your name

708
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,670
even in his coma.

709
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,670
You found it?

710
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,390
Good!

711
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,800
Excellent!

712
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,910
Miss, Miss!

713
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,150
Miss!

714
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,360
Miss Zhou put her life on the line

715
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,750
and went all the way

716
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,680
to bring this Fire Lotus back

717
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,710
to save you.

718
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,510
That’s cold.

719
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,640
But don’t worry.

720
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,140
Although she drained herself,

721
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,000
she’s back safe and sound.

722
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,080
Heaven must be

723
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,630
having mercy on you for your past

724
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,000
so that you’re still alive

725
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,040
and have met Miss Zhou Fei.

726
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,840
Madam!

727
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,470
Take good care of yourself.

728
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,360
It’s about time that you wake up.

729
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,710
But too bad...

730
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,980
Bad?

731
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,080
What’s bad?

732
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,190
Everything is fine.

733
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,910
Anzhi is feeling much better

734
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,520
after taking the second herb.

735
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,430
When I said bad,

736
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,430
I meant the timing.

737
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,040
The herb brought him
out of his coma.

738
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,430
He was waiting for you

739
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,840
but had to

740
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,390
go back to meditate yesterday.

741
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,120
That’s good news.

742
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,190
I’ll go get him the third herb,

743
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,490
Flaming Sage.

744
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,910
Hold your horses.

745
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,840
It’s seldom seen

746
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,120
and said

747
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,840
to only grow in the hot South Xinjiang.

748
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,280
That’s a thousand miles

749
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,560
from here.

750
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,190
South Xinjiang?

751
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,910
Where the Small Medicine Valley is?

752
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,190
Correct.

753
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,360
As the head of that Valley,

754
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,280
Yang Jin must know something.

755
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,870
Even if he doesn’t,

756
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,000
I can ask Ying Hecong about it.

757
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,520
Zhou Fei,

758
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,000
I know you’re in a rush,

759
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,000
but it’ll take more than two weeks

760
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,490
to get there.

761
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,520
A few moments won’t delay anything.

762
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,290
With

763
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,810
such a long journey ahead,

764
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,720
you should be physically prepared.

765
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,810
Look at you.

766
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,040
When was the last time you slept?

767
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,470
However strong you are,

768
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,200
you can’t keep doing this to yourself.

769
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,520
Who is it?

770
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
If there’s anything good

771
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,080
about that brat,

772
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,150
that is, he has good taste.

773
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,520
Look.

774
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,600
He’s found himself such a pretty girl.

775
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
Have you studied the Four Books?

776
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,150
Which one of the Five Classics
do you like?

777
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,840
I’ve read neither of them.

778
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,760
My father did teach me
Thousand Character Classic though.

779
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,630
I can recite that if you want.

780
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,000
That won’t do.

781
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,360
Listen,

782
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,910
you should study more

783
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,910
if you want to be part of our family.

784
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,560
You are weird.

785
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,910
You didn’t raise me

786
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,390
or teach me anything.

787
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,320
Who are you to lecture me?

788
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,080
Well,

789
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,560
you know,

790
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,670
there are four Immortals of Penglai.

791
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,800
Other than Anzhi’s deceased uncle,

792
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,630
there are

793
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,190
me,

794
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,670
this terrible teacher Lin

795
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,950
and

796
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,000
that old fisherman

797
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,080
who brought you here.

798
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,670
You hear that?

799
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,870
I’m your uncle.

800
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,190
What?

801
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,870
You aren’t qualified.

802
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,520
Alright.

803
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,710
Say whatever you want.

804
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,630
You’ll acknowledge me sooner or later.

805
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,710
Where’s my blade?

806
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,430
Where are your manners?

807
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,840
So rude!

808
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,080
Show some respect!

809
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,280
How were you raised

810
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,760
in your Fortress?

811
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,870
How come you’re nothing

812
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,560
like your cousin?

813
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,600
You’ve seen Li Yan,

814
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,800
my cousin?

815
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,230
Is she in trouble?

816
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,760
Nonsense!

817
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,950
What trouble

818
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,430
could that sweet pea get into?

819
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,430
Come on!

820
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,920
Sweet pea?

821
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,000
Are you sure

822
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,140
that’s our Li Yan?

823
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,560
Don’t practice any skills

824
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,030
before you’re fully recovered.

825
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,030
Your energy is running wild.

826
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,430
Stop using it for a while.

827
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,320
Tianying,

828
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,530
do you think all that I’m doing

829
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,680
is useless?

830
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,400
Do you remember

831
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,630
the first time we met?

832
00:44:20,044 --> 00:44:26,644
