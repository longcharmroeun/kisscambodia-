18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,800
Master.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,950
Does anyone not suffer?

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,480
Those with great luck.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Only when their parents
have suffered for them

22
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,830
can they be born free.

23
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,870
It’s their luck accumulated
in the previous life.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,510
Neither you nor I have such luck.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,910
Your Highness! Your Highness!

26
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,550
Your Highness!

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,480
Your Highness, where are you?

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,390
Your Highness! Your Highness!

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,390
Your Highness!

30
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,390
Don’t be mischievous, Your Highness!

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,110
If you become a monk,

32
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,360
how can you take care of the court

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,960
of your family, Your Highness?

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,910
Your father,

35
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,080
and the late emperor...

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,000
They’re watching you in the heaven!

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,820
Come out, Your Highness!

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,000
Come out, Your Highness!

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,630
Finally, he’s tired

40
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,000
and he has stopped shouting.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,720
I win, at last.

42
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,600
Eunuch Wang.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,110
I’ve brought you some wild fruit
to moisten your throat.

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,160
Eunuch Wang?

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,960
I barely live with my emasculated body,

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,800
failing what His Majesty entrusted me.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,440
I can’t be forgiven.

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,140
If you have pity on me,

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,190
-Eunuch Wang!
-do not make a tomb for me

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,800
in case of weakening my luck
after death.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,750
-Please burn me into ashes,
-Eunuch Wang!

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,520
-and scatter it into the East Sea.
-Eunuch Wang, I know I was wrong!

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,160
In this way,

54
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,750
I can flow all the way north

55
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,080
-to my hometown.
-Eunuch Wang.

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,270
Eunuch Wang, I’m sorry!

57
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,440
I’ll no longer hide anymore.

58
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,680
Come out.

59
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,080
Don’t scare me.

60
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Come over, okay?

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,320
Master, please save him.

62
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,880
Merciful Buddha.

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,760
All people suffer.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,070
Hope he’ll get rid of misery.

65
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,720
Since then,

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,110
he has completely changed.

67
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,850
He worked attentively
on literature and martial arts.

68
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,110
We had thought

69
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,880
he wouldn’t come back
after he left Penglai.

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,070
Unexpectedly, we saw him
shortly after his leaving.

71
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,200
At that time,

72
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,210
he was poisoned with Bone-chilling.

73
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,040
If I knew it,

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,550
I would have allowed your master
to make you a monk.

75
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,720
Junior Master, don’t be sad.

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,350
I feel relaxed, instead.

77
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,480
I’m going to lock Bone-chilling
inside your body

78
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,200
with my force

79
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,320
so that you can live!

80
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,550
But promise me.

81
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,840
<i>Junior Master, Immortal of Penglai</i>
Do not use martial arts anymore!

82
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,200
No wonder

83
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
he always says

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,760
he lives with others’ sacrifices.

85
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,460
But he can’t decide anything

86
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,560
about this.

87
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,800
Miss.

88
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,850
We do need your help.

89
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,730
But...

90
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,570
After experiencing the most pain
and the most pleasure today,

91
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,410
you must be restless.

92
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,940
Why don’t you have some rest?

93
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,010
Anyway,

94
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,650
we’re not in a hurry for the moment.

95
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,730
Since I got out of the secret tunnel
of Mount Heng,

96
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,820
I’ve never met Yin Pei again.

97
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,340
According to you,

98
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,100
Yin Pei didn’t have
such fierce martial arts before.

99
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,730
Last time I met him,

100
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,340
he was in a sorry plight.

101
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,170
I don’t know why,

102
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,690
but when I met him this time,

103
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,540
he looked weird.

104
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,220
Speaking of martial arts,

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,290
some people practice for years

106
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,710
before they achieve something.

107
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,580
Some others take shortcuts.

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,060
But no matter what shortcut he takes,

109
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,070
he must pay a big price.

110
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,410
People risk if they want
to achieve something great.

111
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,620
Looks like he has a meteoric rise.

112
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,850
But he must have paid a lot

113
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,060
that no one can imagine.

114
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,940
In contrast,

115
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,690
making efforts

116
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,900
to practice martial arts carefully

117
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,220
can be the safest way.

118
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,250
But...

119
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,340
But what?

120
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,850
After hearing what you said,

121
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,220
I feel you had much grievance.

Fine, then.

128
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,010
I’ll go to bed early.

129
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,130
Aren’t you going?

130
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,420
I want to stay alone for a bit longer.

131
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,900
All right.

132
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,340
I’m going to sleep, then.

To take revenge,

151
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,720

I’m the new master
of Four-guardian Mountain.

156

It’s Mr. Chongxiao’s whisk.

157
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,780
Why are you having it?

158
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,340
Chongxiao told me

159
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,860
he had taken in a young man.

160
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,980
The young man was very clever

161
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,180
and he learnt formations very quickly.

162

Unfortunately, he was from the Li family
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,220
and he couldn’t be a disciple

Yes, it’s me.

169
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,300

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,740
Looks like you have poor martial arts.

173
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,100
You must be studying on formations

174
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,130
instead of practicing martial arts,

175
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,900
just like Chongxiao!

176
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,010
In the end, you can’t even
protect yourself.

177
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,780
Mr. Yin.

178
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,660
Calm down.

179
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,490
Let go of him.

180
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,900
Chuchu, don’t worry about me.

181
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,830
All right.

182
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,290
I’ll listen to you.

183
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,220
Chongxiao asked me

184
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,490
to give this to him.

185
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,280
Now, I’m giving it
to its rightful owner.

186
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,840
If something isn’t mine,

187
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,400
I don’t want it.

188
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,900
Sheng. Sheng.

189
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,300
Sheng.

190
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,340
Is your neck okay?

191
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,250
Master!

192
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,220
Master, he’s in a critical condition.

193
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,180
Can we really do nothing to help?

194
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,130
Bone-chilling is the No.1 poison.

195
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,450
Since the day he was poisoned,

196
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,250
we’ve been working on the solution.

197
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,420
But we’ve got nothing yet.

198
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,420
People make poison

199
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,930
with something!

200
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,660
Pathetic Clam who poisoned him
has been missing.

201
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,130
I’ll go find her master.

202
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,780
If her master is also dead,

203
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,690
I’ll go find her sect.

204
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,340
I don’t believe she made the poison

205
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,860
out of nothing!

206
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,220
You’re right.

207
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,610
Bone-chilling is made of something.

208
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,130
Something great.

209
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,570
After checking some uncertain records,

210
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,420
I knew Bone-chilling was the No.1 poison

211
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,690
in the Book of Almighty Medicine
of Big Medicine Valley.

212
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,740
If we can find this book,

213
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,100
we may find the formula
for the antidote.

214
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,130
Who has the book?

215
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,540
Where can I find it?

216
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,690
I’m afraid

217
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,010
this book no longer exists.

218
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,220
What?

219
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,540
What are you doing?

220
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,810
Excuse me.

221
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,570
Did you see a girl

222
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,250
like this?

223
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,570
She’s this tall,

224
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,420
carrying a blade behind her back.

225
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,700
She’s beautiful,

226
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,370
but tough-looking.

227
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,850
No. I didn’t see her.

228
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,430
Thank you.

229
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,850
You can’t find Zhou Fei in this way.

230
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,250
You’re not worried, but I am!

231
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
You don’t know how strictly
she keeps her promise.

232
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,780
We agreed to meet.

233
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,730
If she were safe, she would have come.

234
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,580
But she hasn’t come.

235
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,010
Could she be in danger?

236
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,370
No! She’s not like you.

237
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,580
She has great martial arts
and she’s fierce.

238
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,900
There’s a saying that people can
always land on their feet.

239
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,210
I’m sure she’s alright.

240
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,300
What do you mean she’s not like me?

241
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,730
At the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

242
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,210
the condition was so dangerous!

243
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,610
There’re so many bad men

244
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,660
and they’re treacherous.

245
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,780
Did she run into bad men?

246
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,010
No. People with you are sly.

247
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,300
What are you talking about?
Go look for her!

248
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,460
It’s a long story.

249
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,180
Lyu Run wrote

250
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,130
the Book of Almighty Medicine.

251
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,490
He was a great talent.

252
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,820
He spent his life writing this book

253
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,210
with all his poisoning skills
and medical skills.

254
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,330
It’s the treasure
of Big Medicine Valley.

255
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,820
Unfortunately,

256
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,060
it was ruined in that calamity.

257
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,080
We must reap what we have sown.

258
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,660
There’s karma for everything.

259
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,060
It’s not your fault.

260
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,850
It’s Anzhi’s fate.

261
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,210
He shouldn’t suffer it.

262
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,090
I don’t accept such karma.

263
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,370
Look at you.

264
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,490
You were so sad.

265
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,210
You’ve calmed down so quickly?

266
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,730
Since you try to help,

267
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,610
there must be hope.

268
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,540
Or you wouldn’t have told me so much.

269
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,700
Right?

270
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,130
You’re a pure girl.

271
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,580
But you aren’t greedy,

272
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,090
angry or crazy.

273
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,060
You flatter me, Master.

274
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,660
I’m just not greedy

275
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,580
for the same thing

276
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,490
others want.

277
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,850
He always says he isn’t lucky.

278
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,820
But I...

279
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,210
I don’t think so.

280
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,580
Master.

281
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,610
You made a detour.

282
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,300
Now, you should tell me

283
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
what you want me to do?

284
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,300
Within the next few days,

285
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,330
I will take Anzhi back to Penglai.

286
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,370
To save him,

287
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,780
I must use Three-kind Decoction

288
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,730
to keep him alive for the moment.

289
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,660
Three-kind Decoction?

290
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,420
There are three doses.

291
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,300
I’ve been travelling around these years,

292
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,250
just to find the treasure
warding off the cold.

293
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,250
Now, I’ve made the first dose.

294
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,420
After he’s taken back to Penglai,

295
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,010
I’ll feed him with it.

296
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,610
It will keep his heart
from being frozen.

297
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,250
If he can take the last two doses
within three months,

298
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,940
maybe he could wake up.

299
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,580
But we need the hottest poison

300
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,660
to fight Bone-chilling.

301
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,090
This is extremely elusive.

302
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,090
I wonder if you can find it.

303
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
We can only leave it to luck.

304
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,580
Will he be alright
after taking the Decoction?

305
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,420
Three-kind Decoction

306
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,460
is a temporary medical relief.

307
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,330
I really don’t have enough knowledge.

308
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,610
After reviewing all medical books,

309
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,970
I’ve got the only temporary solution.

310
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,130
After taking the Three-kind Decoction...

311
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,250
I see.

312
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,730
Master, just tell me

313
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,370
where I can find these treasures
warding off the cold?

314
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,580
As estimated,

315
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,370
the Fire Lotus in the northwestern
extremely cold place

316
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,540
is going to blossom soon.

317
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,730
It’s a decennial chance.

318
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,180
A lotus has nine flowers.

319
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,490
When nine flowers all blossom,
it’s the best time to pick the lotus.

320
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,540
If you miss it,

321
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,610
you’ll wait for another decade.

322
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,130
It depends on whether you can
get it in time.

323
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,460
I will get it back.

324
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,370
Ask him to wait for me.

325
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,300
Girl.

326
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,820
Have you thought about it?

327
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,370
Even when you travel
throughout the world,

328
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,370
you may not find it.

329
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,210
You’ll get nothing at last.

330
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,940
I walked, carrying him on my back.

331
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,970
At that time,

332
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,820
I thought he was dead.

333
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,780
I was desperate.

334
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,130
But...

335
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,700
Now I know a way to save him.

336
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
It’s hard.

337
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,330
But there’s hope,

338
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,610
isn’t there?

339
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,900
It’s really sensible of you.

340
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,300
Girl.

341
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,090
Go and see Anzhi.

342
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
No.

343
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,730
I’ll come back and see him
after I get the Fire Lotus.

344
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,580
Oh...

345
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,540
You forgot this.

346
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,940
So many people risked their lives

347
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,610
to snatch it.

348
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,660
But look at you.

349
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,300
You dumped it by the roadside

350
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,820
and even forgot it.

351
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,420
It’ll be a burden when I travel.

352
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,940
Keep it for me.

353
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,360
I’ll come and get it when I remember.

354
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,020
The young girl is really extraordinary.

356
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,610
Weird.

357
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,900
Didn’t he just die?

358
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,060
Why is he like an ice cube so quickly?

359
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,580
Mr. Xie.

360
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,090
When you were alive,

361
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,300
I failed to save you.

362
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,420
Now you’re dead.

363
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,300
I’ll use your body
to study on Bone-chilling,

364
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,940
just like doing good deeds for you.

365
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,370
You won’t blame me, huh?

366
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,540
If you don’t reply,

367
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,060
I’ll take it as a yes.

368
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,060
Merciful Buddha.

369
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,090
Master, don’t get me wrong.

370
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,700
Young man.

371
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,780
I’d like to take care
of my own disciple.

372
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,250
You can even take care of a dead man?

373
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,630
He isn’t dead?

374
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,970
Yan, it’s such a desolate place

375
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,180
and no other people come around.

376
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,090
Shall we go back first?

377
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,820
Go if you want it!

378
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,370
How can I leave you alone?

379
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
You have poor martial arts...

380
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,780
Poor what?

381
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,130
No... Nothing.

382
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,420
I mean.

383
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,330
I don’t know how
to explain to your brother.

384
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,700
None of your business!

385
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,370
I don’t need you
to explain to my brother, either.

386
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,580
He stays in the inn,

387
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
waiting for Fei.

388
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,210
He doesn’t even think about it.

389
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,330
What if Fei met the Demons?

390
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,010
You heartless men!

391
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,830
Go over there.

392
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,250
It hurts!

393
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,210
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

394
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,780
I didn’t mean it!

395
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,730
The handkerchief. Take it.

396
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,610
I wonder how Fei is doing.

397
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,730
If she meets the Demons,

398
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,900
is it bad luck for her or the Demons?

399
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,850
Fei has better martial arts than us.

400
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,090
So what?

401
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,460
No one helps if she’s in danger.

402
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,490
I must find her.

403
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,010
Or I won’t go back.

404
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Why is there a man?

405
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,300
Ying Hecong?

406
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,730
Why is he up here?

407
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,010
Go lift him.

408
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,730
Okay.

409
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,970
Sheng, don’t worry too much for Fei.

410
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,370
She’s a clever girl
with great martial arts.

411
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,440
She’ll be alright.

412
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,580
I worry about her?

413
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,300
It’s been over a year
since she came down the mountain.

414
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,130
She’s been much crafty.

415
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,210
Besides,

416
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,850
very few martial artists

417
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,970
can defeat her.

418
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,490
Even fewer men

419
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,090
can deceive her.

420
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,330
Xie Yun is also staying

421
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,580
with her.

422
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,210
She’s showing mercy
when she doesn’t bully others.

423
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,300
You’re right.

424
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,330
Yan has gone to look for Fei
early this morning.

425
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,180
She hasn’t come back yet.

426
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,580
You don’t look worried at all?

427
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,540
Yan is still young.

428
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,460
After experiencing so much,

429
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,900
maybe she hasn’t recovered yet.

430
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,210
But at least,

431
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,010
she began to understand

432
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,540
how evil people were.

433
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,540
You’re worried about Mr. Chongxiao?

434
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,900
He always takes the whisk with him.

435
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,480
Yin Pei shouldn’t have got it easily

436
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,540
even if he stole it.

437
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,300
What do we do?

438
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,180
Sheng! Chuchu.

439
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,380
Come and check on Ying Hecong.

Wake up. Wake up!

443
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,780
What are you doing?

444
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,130
What are you asking?

445
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,130
I got you back!

446
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,130
Tell me. Why did you pass out?

447
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,210
Who knocked you out?

448
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,420
After the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

449
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,970
why did you leave without telling us?

450
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,090
Did you go personally

451
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,010
or did anyone kidnap you?

452
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,850
Yan, don’t be anxious.

453
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,180
Yeah, calm down. Let him relax.

454
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,250
Maybe he’s silly
after being knocked out.

455
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,300
You’re silly!

456
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,900
See? He’s silly.

457
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,660
I...

458
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,090
Tell us. Tell us.

459
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,090
Did you see Fei?

460
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,610
Did you see Mr. Xie?

461
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,180
No.

462
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,900
I left early.

463
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,010
Alone.

464
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,490
That’s weird.

465
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,010
Who knocked you out?

466
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,540
You were strong, weren’t you?

467
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,460
Fine, stop asking.

468
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,540
Maybe he met someone

469
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,210
he didn’t want to tell us.

470
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,780
Yan, don’t push him.

471
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,700
Why can’t he tell us?

472
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Are you a confederate of the Demons?

473
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,660
You are their confederate!

474
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,900
Could you stop bothering me?

475
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,420
Zhou Fei is alright. She’s a tough girl.

476
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,010
Don’t worry.

477
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,370
Didn’t you just say

478
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,900
you met neither of them?

479
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,900
How do you know she’s alright?

480
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh, you lied to me!

481
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,970
I just want to have some snake soup.

482
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,540
I’ll smash it. Don’t you believe?

483
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Don’t. Don’t. I’ll tell you.

484
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,090
I met your cousin and her man
in the forest.

485
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,700
They fought Chu Tianyu.

486
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,300
She met the Demons?

487
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,370
Was she hurt?

488
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,940
Chu Tianyu is dead.

489
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,940
Zhou Fei is alright. She’s safe.

490
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,730
How did she kill Chu Tianyu?

491
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,330
She didn’t do it alone.

492
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,660
Xie Yun was there. I helped, too.

493
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,700
This doesn’t matter.

494
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,660
Stop crowding in on me.

495
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,300
Go, go, go away.

496
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,700
Just tell me.

497
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,130
Stop crowding in on me!

498
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,180
Just tell me! I’m so curious!

499
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,660
Go, go, go away.

500
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,180
Did Zhou Fei use any new martial art?

501
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,130
She didn’t. Stop asking...

502
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,730
-Tell me. Tell me.
-How is she?

503
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,780
How did she kill Chu Tianyu, then?

504
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,370
-Give me some space, will you?
-Tell me!

505
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,540
Go away!

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,970
Servants can’t do this well.

511
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,090
Back in Big Medicine Valley,

512
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,090
no one could grow

513
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,970
this plant.

514
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,610
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>
I had studied on it for a dozen years

515
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,120
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

516
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,130
before I finally naturalized it.

517
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,900
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

518
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,100
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

519
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,700
Madam.

520
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,540
Waiter.

521
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,970
Did you see Mr. Li leaving this morning?

522
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,580
I came down early this morning,

523
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,330
but saw no one out.

524
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,900
Where has he gone?

525
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,330
Don’t worry, Miss.

526
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,780
Maybe he’s gone out so early

527
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,970
that I didn’t see him.

528
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,090
Perhaps he’s coming back soon.

529
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,180
Chuchu.

530
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,010
Chuchu, where are you going?

531
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,490
Yan, did you see your brother?

532
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,940
My brother? What did he do again?

533
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,730
I looked for him, but he’s gone.

534
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,250
His belongings are gone, too.

535
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,250
Has he left without telling us again?

536
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,730
He looked weird yesterday.

537
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,820
He stared at the whisk

538
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,330
and told me he worried
about Mr. Chongxiao.

539
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,460
I guess he has left
to look for Mr. Chongxiao.

540
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,330
Well, I must go and find him.

541
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Chuchu.

542
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,460
It’s too dangerous out there.

543
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,820
You can’t go out.

544
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,610
Yan, your brother kept protecting me.

545
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,780
Now he’s in danger.

546
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,490
I must get over it with him.

547
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,540
Moreover, he’s likely to run into...

548
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,850
Yan.

549
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,370
Wait here until we come back.

550
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,770
I know the location.

551
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,130
I think I’ll find him.

552
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,940
Who will my brother run into?

553
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,130
Master.

554
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,770
Miss Wu you asked us to keep an eye on

555
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,290
has left the inn.

556
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,900
Is she really going back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

557
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,370
with Li Sheng?

558
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,260
She left alone.

559
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,940
Alone?

560
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,090
She doesn’t even have martial arts.

561
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,020
How will she travel alone?

562
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,460
Our men saw that clearly.

563
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,130
But looks like

564
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,500
she isn’t heading
for the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

565
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,740
Ask our men to follow her closely.

566
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,290
Get me a horse. I’ll be right there.

567
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,130
Aye.

568
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,100
<i>Wu Chuchu</i>

569
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,290
Without the eunuch,

570
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,420
flowers blossom more beautifully.

571
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,130
Do you think so?

572
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,530
They do?

573
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,610
When you’re in front of me,

574
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,260
I’ve never paid any attention
to other flowers.

575
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,220
Don’t interrupt.

576
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,700
You know what I mean.

577
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,610
You used others to kill Chu Tianyu.

578
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,980
Even commander-in-chief can’t
have anything on you.

579
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,980
You get me wrong.

580
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
I didn’t use others to kill Chu Tianyu.

581
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,330
I tried to kill two birds
with one stone.

582
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,370
If I had wanted to kill Chu Tianyu,

583
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,420
he would have been dead long ago.

584
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,770
I kept him alive,

585
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,740
as a bait for someone else.

586
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,290
Sorry to have made you aggrieved.

587
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,980
You mean

588
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,130
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

589
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,020
If I guess correctly,

590
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,610
the Color of Ocean and Heaven
will come out soon.

591
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,610
Your old wound can’t
be delayed anymore.

592
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,130
We must open
the Color of Ocean and Heaven asap

593
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,570
and find the Book of Almighty Medicine

594
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,020
to heal you.

595
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,420
You’re so good at making me happy.

596
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,530
If the rumor is right

597
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,420
that someone used
the Cloud-impelling Palm again,

598
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,570
I’m sure

599
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,530
I can help you find the girl

600
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,940
who took away the Seal of Cautiousness.

601
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,770
You always stay indoors,

602
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,570
but you’re well-informed.

603
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,700
I poisoned Xiao Chuan

604
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,290
with Bone-chilling.

605
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,980
He used martial arts recklessly.

606
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,700
He’ll die soon.

607
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,700
If he wants to survive,

608
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,850
he needs the hottest poison

609
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,180
to fight against Bone-chilling.

610
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,180
It’s a decennial chance
for the Fire Lotus to blossom.

611
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,420
I guess the girl is on her way

612
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,740
to pick the Fire Lotus.

613
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,020
Tianying.

614
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,050
It’s so clever of you.

615
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,700
You’re as useful as a thousand soldiers.

616
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,290
Since so,

617
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,660
I’ll go personally.

618
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,940
No!

619
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,460
You nearly went wrong
when practicing martial arts.

620
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,570
And you were wounded
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

621
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,050
You can’t go.

622
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,740
Zhou Fei can already use
the Snow-breaking Blade

623
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,260
in a strong way.

624
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,610
I don’t think

625
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,500
others can deal with her.

626
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,180
Ask Tiankuang to go.

627
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,090
No way.

628
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,180
I said

629
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,020
Lu Tiankuang would only be responsible
for your own safety.

630
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,770
It’s not time

631
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,770
to give him any mission.

632
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,740
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
has been hidden for a dozen years.

633
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,220
It’s finally coming out.

634
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,850
I don’t want to miss it.

635
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:42,610
But...

636
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,370
Tiankuang came from the cold place.

637
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,610
I don’t think Zhou Fei can defeat him

638
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,130
on the snow mountain.

639
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,460
You make sense.

640
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,980
Before coming to us,

641
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,290
he was known as Snow Wolf.

642
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,900
Dried tangerine peel.

643
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,530
Ginger.

644
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,460
Medlar. Red dates.

645
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,460
What else in the prescription
against the cold?

646
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,740
Ginger, red dates and medlar

647
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,260
can detoxify Bone-chilling?

648
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,940
Stop kidding!

649
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,090
Give the medical book back to me.

650
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,220
No! No!

651
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,130
You don’t look for the antidote for him.

652
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,850
Why can’t I do it?

653
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,370
You don’t even let me review the book?

654
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,420
Before you find the antidote,

655
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,330
Mr. Xie may be reincarnated a few times.

656
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,090
What are you talking about?

657
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,180
He’s still alive.

658
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,740
Does any doctor give up on him like you?

659
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,810
Go away. Don’t disturb me.

660
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,940
What are you doing?

661
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,900
Looking for the antidote for Mr. Xie.

662
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,570
But he gave up on Mr. Xie.

663
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,900
You’re the only heir
of Big Medicine Valley.

664
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,500
We all depend on you for the antidote.

665
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
You have poor medical skills, fine.

666
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,770
But why do you even give up?

667
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,500
Anyway, I’m better than you,
the heir of Small Medicine Valley,

668
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,610
who know nothing about medicine.

669
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,700
You!

670
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,530
Besides, Big Medicine Valley is gone.

671
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,700
Give Hongyu to me
and I’m leaving right away.

672
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,810
No way!

673
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,810
Fei is looking everywhere

674
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,020
for the antidote to Bone-chilling.

675
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,260
Mr. Xie is dying.

676
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,810
You mustn’t go
until you find the antidote.

677
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,180
How many times have I told you?

678
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,700
I can’t make the antidote.

679
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,660
Give it to me.

680
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,700
Leave if you want.

681
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,770
Hongyu will not go with you.

682
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,610
Fine.

683
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,130
Let’s see who Hongyu will follow.

684
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,260
What’s wrong with you?

685
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,260
We used to stay happily together.

686
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,020
Now Mr. Xie is dying.

687
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,370
Fei has left.

688
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,570
My brother and Chuchu have left, too.

689
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,530
Even you’re leaving.

690
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,570
Leave if you want.

691
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,700
I’ll find the antidote for Mr. Xie
even if I do it alone.

692
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,740
Do something.

693
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,900
Solve the trouble you made.

694
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,530
I...

695
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,500
I don’t know what to do.

696
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,290
Stop... Stop crying, will you?

697
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,180
No.

698
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,420
I won’t leave, all right?

699
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,020
Help me to find the antidote.

700
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,900
I’ll... I’ll try my best.

701
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,220
Give Hongyu to me.

702
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,740
No way!

703
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,530
Don’t cry!

704
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,660
I saw the waiter coming back

705
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,020
with a few kilos of bullfrogs.

706
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,900
Hongyu... Hongyu will love them.

707
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,770
Well, go downstairs and have a look.

708
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,850
Or other customers will eat them.

709
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,660
Really?

710
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,500
Hongyu, let’s go.

711
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:23,900
Is she

712
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
always like this?

<i>Liu Youliang, Anping Army</i>

00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,570
-Miss.
-Waiter.

715
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,530
I hear you have fresh bullfrogs.

716
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,700
You haven’t killed them, huh?

717
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,290
You’re so well-informed.

718
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,420
They’re still alive.

719
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,330
Wait a minute. I’ll bring them to you.

720
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,020
Okay.

721

<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

722
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,660
Hongyu, you’ll enjoy the bullfrogs soon.

<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

724
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,660
I asked Chu Tianyu to go

725
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,220
so that he would confront
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

726
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,810
We were ordered
to keep an eye on Chu Tianyu.

727
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,940
We found that he asked his men

728
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,220
to stop an old man secretly,

729
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,980
named Liu Youliang.

730
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,580
<i>Lingling Inn</i>

731
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,770
Sir, are you hurt?

732
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,340
-Are you alright?
-Piss off!

733
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,770
Stay away from me!

734
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,770
Sir, don’t be so ungrateful.

735
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,850
I just think your wound needs
to be dressed.

736
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,330
My friend is a great doctor.

737
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,260
He’s right upstairs.

738
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,420
Let me take you up for a check.

739
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,940
Shut up and sit down.

740
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,220
How did you mess up with the Demons?

741
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,770
Cloud-impelling Palm
or Snow-breaking Blade don’t matter.

742
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,570
Because their owners
don’t know the secret

743
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,940
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

744
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,020
The key point

745
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,660
lies on Liu Youliang.

746
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,850
How many of you? Come in, please.

747
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,420
We’re looking for someone. Go away!

748
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,290
Sit tight.

749

If someone asks you about me,

750
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,020
tell them you don’t know me.

It’s okay. They’re my enemies, too.

You’re their enemy.
You must be a nice man.

I will save you. Don’t worry.

What a surprise! You’re old.

758

But you move fast.

759
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,610
To look for you,

760
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,050
we ran throughout the whole town.

761
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,810
Why did you stop?

762
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,330
Too weak to keep running, huh?

763
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,020
What are you talking about?

764
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,570
You found a girl as your assistant?

I’m not an assistant!

Shame on you, Demons!

In broad daylight,

768
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,810
you bully an old man
with so many people!

769
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,940
And you want to hurt a weak man!

770
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,460
If others know, don’t you feel ashamed?

771
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,130
Won’t you bring shame on Lord Shen?
