these two blades

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,210
are made with the new technique.

22
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,660

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,140
With the help of such a technique,

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,570

25
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,700

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,220
Lord Shen,

27
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,010
it’s been confirmed

28
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,860
that Chen Zichen will go hunting soon.

Go, Your Highness!

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,500
Don’t move!

37
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,220
You should

38
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,530
hire better guards.

39
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,010
I didn’t do anything to you.

40
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,170
What are you up to?

41
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,700
You, Chen Zichen,

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,880
are the perfect leverage

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,320
to wipe out the Chens.

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,870
Shen Tianshu,

45
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,800

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,350
I want

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,000
everything you have.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,870
That small sect of yours

50
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,960
is no match for thousands of our troops.

51
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,870
Bring it here.

52
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,910
Watch carefully.

53
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,720
This is your armor.

54
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,960
Just so you know,

55
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,560
this blade is crafted

56
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,150
according to Refinement of Iron

57
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,840
in the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

58
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,350
How is that possible?

59
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Not just that.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,670
Yu Wenzhi’s force
will set out from the north.

61
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,600
You can’t win

62
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,550
a two-fronted war.

63
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,350
The Chens cut the Xiaos off.

64
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,550
Now,

65
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,920
I’m the one

66
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,670
to cut you off.

67
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,790
My lord,

68
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,670
Nanling Prefecture

69
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,950
is to the south of Jiankang.

70
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,350
Once we take it,

71
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,550
it’s only a matter of time

72
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,720
before we occupy Jiankang.

73
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Send scouts there

74
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,320
immediately.

75
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes.

76
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,110
Report!

77
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,000
Lord Shen,

78
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,350
Lord Lu had them make you this Iron Hand

79
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,880
with the new technique.

80
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,600
How’s the production

81
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,510
of weapons going?

82
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,480
My lord,

83
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
we’ve been remaking them

84
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,390
according to
that blacksmith’s original note.

85
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,390
After multiple tests,

86
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,480
we’ve corrected the technique

87
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,550
and been expediting the production.

88
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,000
Lu Tiankuang can no longer be trusted.

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hadn’t you ordered me

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,270
to interrogate that traitor

91
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,350
who claimed to have killed
that blacksmith,

92
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,600
I wouldn’t have discovered

93
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,640
Lu Tiankuang’s plot.

94
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,160
Then I quickly searched

95
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
the blacksmith’s room

96
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,760
and found the original note.

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,200
After comparison,

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,160
the amount of metal

99
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,920
in our note had been altered.

100
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,510
That’s why blades made previously

101
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,760
were fragile.

102
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Lu Tiankuang tampered with the note

103
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,920
in an attempt to kill me.

104
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,480
Should I

105
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,550
call him naive or stupid?

106
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,950
My lord,

107
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,160
what should we do about him?

108
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,230
Pay him in his own coin.

109
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,670
Use

110
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,270
what he gave us

111
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,550
to make him an iron hook

112
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,790
and send it to him secretly.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes.

114
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,400
May I ask

115
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,030
what this secret meeting is about?

116
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,440
We’re here to warn you

117
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,710
that Yu Wenzhi is about to revolt.

118
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,610
Who told you that?

119
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,100
Is there any proof?

120
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,860
Please have a look.

121
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,370
It includes

122
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,220
all Yu Wenzhi’s secret meetings

123
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,130
with General Zhao of Yongzhou.

124
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,220
We also heard

125
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,220
he and Head of Demons Manor,
Shen Tianshu,

126
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,540
would take action together soon.

127
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,370
We believe

128
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,130
they’re about to start a war.

129
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,370
How dare

130
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,900
that Yu Wenzhi

131
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
rebel against us!

132
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,420
He’s evil.

133
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,130
He accused my father of treason

134
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,610
and slaughtered my whole family.

135
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,050
He’s my mortal enemy.

136
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,540
Please help us.

137
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,780
General Wu was loyal.

138
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,050
He would die for the state.

139
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,660
He shouldn’t have ended up like that.

140
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,980
Rest assured, Miss Wu,

141
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,340
I’ll go back

142
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,980
and report everything to His Majesty

143
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,300
to bring him to justice.

144
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Thank you.

145
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,180
Thank you, Vice Censor Guo.

146
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,010
Take the antidote

147
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,860
to my knockout drops.

148
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,300
You won’t be affected

149
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,810
by it for four hours.

150
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,500

never would you’ve guessed

156
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,370
that I’d become

157
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,540

they’re breaking in.

167
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,930
-Zichen, this again?
-This again?

168
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Xie Yun,

169
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,300
I’m sorry.

170
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,860
Oh, save it!

171
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,220
You must pay a bigger price

172
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
for killing my sister!

173
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,450
In your dreams!

174
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,300
Fei,

175
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,250
don’t waste your time on him.

176
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,450
I’ll take care of things here.

177
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,450
Back in the dungeon,

178
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,780
I kept you alive for
giving me half of that bun,

179
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,420
but never did I

180
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,300
see this coming.

181
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,570
Cut it out.

182
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,570
That won’t postpone your death.

183
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,660
What a joke!

184
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,810
Even the top masters

185
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,740
have died in my hand.

186
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,220
I’ll soon have my own empire.

187
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,540
Young lady,

188
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,050
you can’t stop me.

189
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,340
What empire?

190
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,370
More like an evil gang.

191
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,930
Shen Tianshu,

192
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,370
you’re a shameless sinner,

193
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,810
a joke!

258
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,950
Of course.

295
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,580
And I have company.

302
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,650
You’re a big girl.

If that’s what you want,

304
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,380
just go ahead.

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,650
Don’t forget to write to us.

307
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,980
I will.

312
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,980
I’ll stuff that blade

313
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,340
into your stomach.

314
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,500
Well then, I’m busy.

315
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,260
I’m off.

316
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,340
Sheng,

317
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,010
I’ll miss you, Sheng.

318
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,380

319
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,260
You chicken!

320
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,500
You said you’d tell him, didn’t you?

321
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,410
I’m shy.

322
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,380
Chuchu,

323
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,340
what are you doing?

324
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,980
I’ve been

325
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,500
organizing martial arts manuals.

326
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,410
It’s safe now.

327
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,050
So I’m thinking to go out

328
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,500
to bring back manuals I missed

329
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,930
to complete my collection.

330
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,550
You’re leaving, too?

331
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,610
Who else is also leaving?

332
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,860
Yan

333
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,250
insists on going to
the South with Yang Jin.

334
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,510
What are you thinking?

335
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,860
Are you mad?

336
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,890
You’re clearly upset.

337
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,580
I lied.

338
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,650
Masters of all sects have agreed

339
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,290
to deliver the manuals here

340
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,220
to spare me the trip.

341
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,530
Really?

342
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,380
Stop hanging out with Li Yan

343
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,220
or Zhou Fei.

344
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,740
You’ve...

345
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,810
No way.

346
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,740
I enjoy spending time with them.

347
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,500
Choose between me or them.

348
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,740
Which one is it?

349
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,980
I’m going to dry books.

350
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,170
Pieces on the board were messed up.

351
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,860
It took me a while

352
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,500
to reposition them,

353
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,890
but some are still

354
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,410
not the same as before.

355
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,050
I racked my brain to solve it

356
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,580
but the solution is quite simple.

357
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,410
Do you mean

358
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,810
it had been solved?

359
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,890
The game isn’t wrong.

360
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,530
It’s me

361
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,530
who insist on

362
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,460
clinging on to the past.

363
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,170
I should

364
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,980
learn from you in that regard.

365
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,740
I should’ve let go of the past

366
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,260
and moved on long ago.

367
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,620
What about the Anping Army?

368
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,460
The war is over, so they can go home.

369
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,080
It’s good that the masses are safe

370
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,090
and peace is restored.

371
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,580
Yu Wenzhi has been executed

372
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
for rebellion.

373
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,380
His evil nature would lead him

374
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,260
down that road sooner or later.

375
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,170
By the way,

376
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,710
what about Shen Tianshu’s men

377
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,160
and villagers

378
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,640
in the Big Medicine Valley?

379
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,950
While the latter

380
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,880
have returned home safe and sound,

381
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,710
the former have been given amnesty.

382
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,170
I hope the heard-earned peace

383
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,500
will last long.

384
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,580
My daughter is stubborn.

385
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,290
Please bear with her.

I’ve long heard about his reputation.

388
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,290
-Be patient. Keep in line.
-I came all the way for treatment.

389
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,930
Don’t worry.

390
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:51,930
Take enough rest.

391
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,700
Thank you.

392
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,010
Excuse me, do you often
gather herbs here?

393
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,290
Does a famous physician Sun Simiao

394
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,130
live in Taibai Mountain?

395
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,260
Go uphill along the way,

396
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,500
pass the bamboo forest

397
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,050
and you’ll see his cottage.

398
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,340
Are you sick?

399
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,650
Not exactly.

400
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,460
I have something for him.

401
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,170

I am.

Finally!

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,330
it includes advanced techniques

412
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,700
that can produce
better and tougher ironware.

413
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,500
With this book,

414
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,820
many problems at hand can be solved.

415
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,100
This is great! Wonderful!

General Wang

420
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,460
dedicated his life

421
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,330
to building a peaceful
and prosperous state.

422
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,700
Now that peace has been achieved

423
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,330
and rejuvenation can be expected,

424
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,410
he can rest in peace.

425
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,060
I hope people can forever

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,980
Let’s go.

428
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,930
Yes.

429
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,570
Thank you, Miss Wu.

430
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,500
This is really good!

431

-Take care.
-Goodbye.

Let’s go.

435
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,780
-This is a good thing.
-I agree.

436
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,850
-That’s right.
-So good.

437
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,460
Miss Wu,

438
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,260
here are some martial arts manuals

439
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
for you to have a study.

440
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,460
<i>Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors</i>

441
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,740
<i>Loyal and Filial</i>

442
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,620
<i>Loyal and Filial</i>

<i>Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors</i>

444
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,460
Li Sheng,

445
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,850
news came in from our men in Sichuan

446
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,500
that there are bandits

447
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,260
robbing others in the south.

448
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,020
It’s our duty

449
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,130
to protect out there.

450
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,330
Tell them in the letter

451
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,610
that I’ll send our men

452
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,700
to teach those bandits a lesson.

453
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Yes.

454
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,570
Sheng.

455
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,900
<i>Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors</i>

456
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,330
Chuchu.

457
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,300
It’s hot outside.

458
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,460
What brings you here?

459
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,090
To check on you.

460
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,980
I heard you had sent out invitations

461
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,220
to gather martial artists together

462
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,370
on Mid-Autumn Festival.

463
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,370
That’s right.

464
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,090
Your collection of manuals of all sects

465
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,610
is almost complete.

466
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,820
I’d like to

467
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,780
invite them over

468
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,090
to patch things up.

469
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,890
So,

470
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,890
half of all sects will be here?

471
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,610
It’s quite peaceful

472
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,740
in the state,

473
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,410
so they’re free.

474
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,330
Why didn’t you give me a heads-up?

475
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,460
Some of the manuals

476
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,220
are still undone.

477
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,740
What to do?

478
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,260
I can help you.

479
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,780
I’m not busy

480
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,740
with any trouble lately.

481
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,980
You said that yourself.

482
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,570
<i>Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors</i>

483
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,130
Carry them to Li Sheng’s study.

484
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,060
-Yes.
-Yes.

485
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,700
Thanks for your help.

486
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,330
Fei.

487
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,610
Here’s a letter from your cousin.

488
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,890
He’s holding a gathering

489
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,780
at Liu’s Manor for Chuchu.

490
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,060
It’s a big event.

491
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,890
He’s probably nervous,

492
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,410
so he wants you there

493
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,890
to support him.

494
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,650
Will you go, Fei?

495
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,650
I have to be there for them.

496
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,020
It’s not too far anyway.

497
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,930
It’s time for all sects
of Central Plains

498
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,460
to march into a new phase.

499
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,930
Li Sheng ticks all the boxes

500
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,410
in terms of intelligence, ability
and background.

501
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,330
Most importantly, he’s humble

502
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,220
instead of self-conceited.

503
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,300
He’s quite popular

504
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,610
among seniors.

505
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,060
They all favor him.

506
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,570
I bet

507
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,060
all sects are using this chance

508
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,890
to take things up a notch.

509
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,060
Him?

510
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,650
He isn’t

511
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,170
as skilled

512
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,570
as senior masters,

513
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,130
but he’s a rare talent

514
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,170
in the younger generation.

515
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,930
How come he’s a weak nerd

516
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,370
in your eyes?

517
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,930
No wonder

518
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,130
a young and passionate man

519
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,260
like him

520
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,060
is always so modest.

521
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,220
All because he grew up

522
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,650
in a tough environment.

523
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,740
I’d better get more help

524
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,170
for him.

525
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,570
He never gives me a break.

526
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,890
I know, right?

527
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,700
Miss Zhou, you’re an unparalleled

528
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,890
and invincible talent.

529
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,050
Had I known I’d be so lucky to have you,

530
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
back at the Ximo River,

531
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,780
I would’ve dressed up

532
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,170
and looked better

533
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,780
with my Footwork.

534
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,300
There was just a Weed Spirit.

535
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,820
Why would you dress up?

536
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,020
To seduce other girls.

537
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,820
I’ve proposed six times

538
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,020
but only got rejected

539
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,060
by your parents
with all sorts of excuses.

540
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,370
I’m tough enough

541
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,780
to bite through steel now.

542
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,610
What a world!

543
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,060
Fei,

544
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,170
stop bullying me,

545
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,130
or

546
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,740
I’ll write a play about the South Blade,

547
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,170
telling the world

548
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,570
that you’re a bully.

549
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,780
I dare you!

550
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,610
Fei,

551
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,650
how about this?

552
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,820
Let’s swing by Liu’s Manor for the event

553
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,090
and then head to Jiankang.

554
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,890
Once the winter is over,

555
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,890
let’s go to the grassland to see sheep.

556
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,170
Do you have anything else to do

557
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,850
other than having fun?

558
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,980
We can buy lambs

559
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,060
and roast them. Money isn’t a problem.

560
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,460
The skin will taste crispy
and meat tender.

561
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,220
No need to add other spices.

562
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,540
A little bit of salt is enough.

563
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,850
I’ll write to my mother

564
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,170
and let her know.

565
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,060
Sure.

566
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,330
Let’s go.

567
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,410
“Fish either dive underwater”.

568
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,540
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>
“Fish either dive underwater”.

569
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,780
“Or float on the surface”.

570
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,820
<i>School</i>
“Or float on the surface”.

571
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,930
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>
“They’re enjoying themselves there”.

572
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,410
Mine is the best.

573
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,060
It’s won a few times
without losing once.

574
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,060
