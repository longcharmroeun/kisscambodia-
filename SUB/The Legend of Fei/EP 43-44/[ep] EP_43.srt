<i>Episode 43</i>

18
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,410
Have a try.

19
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,340
Madam Li has given me

20
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,580
Mr. Li Zheng’s note of martial arts.

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,940
I’m going to compile the note

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,210
and give her
the Book of Snow-breaking Blade.

23
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,730
Snow-breaking Blade?
You want to learn it?

24
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,620
I don’t.

25
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,210
Madam Li said

26
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,730
when it’s compiled into a book,

27
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,980
it can be passed to others.

28
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,260
Whoever wants to learn it can learn it.

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,450
But Aunt looks weird lately.

30
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,530
Feels like she’s leaving everything

31
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,170
to us all at once.

32
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,340
I feel a bit worried.

33
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,090
Well, we’ve grown up.

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,900
Time to take over her responsibilities

35
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,900
so that she can have a good rest.

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,340
I hear Zhou Fei has gone

37
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,170
to handle the Third Prince.

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,620
You don’t need to worry.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,810
Under such circumstances,

40
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,730
we can allow nothing to go wrong.

41
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,650
Tell them not to let down their guard.

42
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,900
Aye.

43
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,700
Also,

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,730
you asked me to gather intelligence
about the Demons.

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,730
What have you got?

46
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,530
We were just informed

47
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,010
that Yu Wenzhi visited the Demons Manor.

48
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,170
No one was in the Manor,

49
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,620
except Shen Tianshu.

50
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,810
Yu Wenzhi.

51
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,810
Why did he suddenly
visit the Demons Manor?

52
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,900
Have they already known

53
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,290
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,340
Madam, you don’t feel well.

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,290
Why don’t you have a rest first?

56
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,860
No rush to think of a solution now.

57
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,340
Okay.

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,170
Commander-in-chief.

59
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,220
We’ve been hunting down Zhou Yitang.

60
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Seems like

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,340
he isn’t heading
for the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

62
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
That’s not surprising.

63
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,500
If he took an established route,

64
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,130
you would have easily found him

65
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,250
on his way there.

66
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,380
He will certainly make a detour.

67
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,900
After getting rid of you,

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,220
he will head
for the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

69
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,850
Shall we

70
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,730
get our men back first?

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,820
Ask them to search along the route

72
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,570
down the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

73
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,540
Even if they can’t catch Zhou Yitang,

74
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,780
they can put pressure on him,

75
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,380
holding him back from going back home.

76
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,010
If Zhou Yitang goes back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

77
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,730
before I get
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

78
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,250
he will interfere
with Pathetic Clam’s action!

79
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,060
She’ll have trouble
framing Chen Zichen up!

80
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,170
Madam Li.

81
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,380
Shen Tianshu.

82
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,130
Give me the tokens

83
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,850
you’re holding.

84
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,010
Shen Tianshu, come out!

85
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,820
Don’t try to be mysterious!

86
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,380
Come out and fight me!

87
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,690
Don’t forget.

88
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,290
Your father

89
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,850
and your brother

90
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,170
were both killed by me.

91
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,900
Do you think

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,660
you can defeat me?

93
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,970
Madam Li.

94
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,220
If you don’t give them to me,

95
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,250
I’ll kill

96
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,500
all you men.

97
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,900
Come out!

98
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,540
Li Jinrong.

99
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,820
Do you want all your men

100
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,520
to die for you?

101
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,380
Yitang?

102
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,900
Yitang, no... no way!

103
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,250
-Jinrong.
-Yitang!

104
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,220
Jinrong, listen to me.

105
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,290
No!

106
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,250
Put away the tokens.

107
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,900
Don’t show them to anyone.

108
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:37,010
Yitang, no! No!

109
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,690
No! No!

110
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,220
Madam, what happened?

111
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,220
I had a bad dream.

112
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,060
It was a dream.

113
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,850
It’s okay.

114
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,940
What happened? Tell me.

115
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,450
Our secret service caught a furtive spy

116
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,690
down the mountain.

117
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,940
He said he came...

118
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,220
What did he say?

119
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,220
He came to hunt down Lord Gantang.

120
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,620
Lord Gantang was missing

121
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,060
after he was assassinated

122
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,130
and hasn’t been found yet.

123
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,730
Bring the spy to me!

124
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,180
Aye.

125
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,250
Why did you tell the Demons?

126
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,930
We’re short-handed.

127
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,250
When did I tell you
to ask the Demons for help?

128
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,780
You said we couldn’t kill Zhou Yitang

129
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,900
and then you asked Lord Shen for help.

130
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,570
Just because you failed to catch him,

131
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,370
I had to be insulted by Shen Tianshu!

132
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,810
Even his guard

133
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,740
dared to give me that attitude!

134
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,370
Yes. It’s so incapable of us.

135
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,810
A minister dies
when his lord is insulted.

136
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,250
Do you understand?

137
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,250
I’m sorry! Please tell me what you want.

138
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,420
Zhou Yitang!

139
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,130
I want Zhou Yitang! Got it?

140
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,570
I see.

141
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,310
Get out!

142
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,640
Aye.

143
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,450
Kneel!

144
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,130
Commander-in-chief asked Lord Shen

145
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,540
to catch Lord Gantang alive

146
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,530
on his way back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

147
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,740
Just catch him alive?

148
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,810
They...

149
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,780
They wanted him.

150
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
We were ordered to kill him
if failing to catch him alive.

151
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,220
But we failed.

152
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,660
He ran away.

153
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,960
We’ve been looking for him lately.

154
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
When was the order given?

155
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,050
Who gave it?

156
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,690
I don’t know!

157
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,340
A couple of days ago,

158
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,300
Commander-in-chief visited Lord Shen.

159
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,130
Madam, I’ve told you

160
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,450
all I know.

161
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,930
No one told me anything else.

162
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,540
Take him away. Keep him under guard.

163
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,860
-Madam!
-Aye. Take him away.

164
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,570
-Aye. Aye. Go.
-I’ve told you all I know.

165
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,100
Madam!

166
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Madam! Madam!

167
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,220
I’ve told you all I know!

168
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,490
I’ve actually told you.

169
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,980
Madam!

170
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,540
I’m sure the Demons have known
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

171
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,130
Apparently, they want to threaten me

172
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,900
with Yitang’s life.

173
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,930
They haven’t assembled men yet.

174
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,610
But soon they’ll attack us.

175
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,660
Madam.

176
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,610
Madam, I bring you the book.

177
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,980
-Madam.
-Madam. Madam.

178
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,780
Get her in.

179
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,690
Come in!

180
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,980
Madam.

181
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,420
What happened to you?

182
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,220
Let me check on you.

183
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,900
Your Highness.

184
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,490
What’s wrong?

185
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,490
Your Highness.

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,860
Since I failed to propose to Miss Zhou,

187
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,540
let’s go back home.

188
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,980
Your Highness, since you came

189
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,100
in the name
of celebrating Madam Li’s birthday,

190
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,660
you shouldn’t leave

191
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,860
before the birthday party tomorrow.

192
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,100
Or you couldn’t explain to His Majesty.

193
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,420
Miss Zhou is

194
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,490
with Xie Yun.

195
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,740
I should give them blessings, right?

196
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,610
Your Highness.

197
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,420
You come to such a humble place.

198
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,300
But they thought you were weak

199
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,570
and gave you a cold-shoulder.

200
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,610
Since you have been turned down,

201
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,810
why do you bother to stay
for the birthday party

202
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,610
and bring honor to them?

203
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,490
Madam.

204
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,980
I had an idle dream

205
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,250
and one-sided wish.

206
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,930
Don’t bring it up again.

207
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,490
Why does he have a fever?

208
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,180
I’m afraid he’s sick again

209
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,780
because he hasn’t recuperated well

210
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,930
in recent days.

211
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,540
I’m fine.

212
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,540
Your Highness.

213
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,130
Your Highness, are you alright?

214
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,420
Madam, he...

215
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,780
If His Highness stays,

216
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,340
he will feel sad.

217
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,980
He’d better have a good rest

218
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,340
and leave as soon as possible.

219
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
Your Highness, let’s leave.

220
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,540
<i>To Be Self-effacing</i>

221
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,130
<i>To Be Repenting</i>

222
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,420
Madam, you had a serious wound
on your heart.

223
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,930
Without a timely cure,

224
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,900
there’s a lingering problem.

225
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
But there’s no better way

226
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,010
to cure you of your heart.

227
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,050
You should just rest for recuperation.

228
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,540
I just know a few medical skills.

229
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,810
Shall I

230
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,570
get you a doctor?

231
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,420
No. Don’t tell others.

232
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,540
Miss Chuchu, Madam has kept it secret.

233
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,570
Only Doctor Luo knows it.

234
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,340
Even Miss Zhou and Mr. Li don’t know.

235
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
Please keep the secret for her.

236
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Like you said,

237
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,660
I need to rest for recuperation.

238
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,900
It will take a year or two.

239
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,250
If I tell them,

240
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,980
they’ll worry about me.

241
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,810
But Madam...

242
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,690
It’s concerning your health.

243
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,220
If you don’t have timely recuperation,

244
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,660
the problem will get worse.

245
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,860
Chuchu.

246
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,180
Ask Doctor Luo to give me the medicine

247
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,610
she used last time.

248
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,660
I know why you keep it secret.

249
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,300
Don’t worry.

250
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I’ll keep the secret for you.

251
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,720
I’ll go get the medicine.

252
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,860
Lord, how is it going?

253
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,300
The Third Prince
will possibly leave tonight.

254
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,570
I think

255
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,340
it’s when we should take action.

256
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,120
Aye.

257
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,450
You mean you’ll go
and kill Shen Tianshu now?

258
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,490
Yes.

259
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Madam.

260
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,130
You’re still wounded.
You shouldn’t act rashly.

261
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,130
Shen Tianshu is vicious and crafty.

262
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,490
If you fail to assassinate him...

263
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,250
If I don’t go because of my wound,

264
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,100
when the Demons come to attack us,

265
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,930
Fei and Sheng can’t defeat them.

266
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,610
Won’t there be more danger?

267
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,660
Shen Tianshu and I

268
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,490
will certainly have a desperate fight.

269
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,810
I’d like to strike first.

270
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,220
Madam, since you insist on going,

271
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,780
I’ll go with you.

272
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,180
No.

273
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,570
I’m afraid I can’t come back alive.

274
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,980
I’m Xie Yun.

275
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,690
May I speak to Madam Li?

276
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,810
Come in, please.

277
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,980
Madam.

278
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,660
What are you coming for?

279
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,780
I come to ask

280
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

281
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,780
Madam, what are you doing to do

282
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,980
with the five tokens?

283
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,180
I told you not to interfere.

284
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,690
My point is...

285
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,490
Since we have all the tokens,

286
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,130
why don’t we destroy the clue
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven

287
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,420
so that there won’t be more trouble?

288
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,780
This is our own problem.

289
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,130
You shouldn’t interfere!

290
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,450
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
is important without doubt.

291
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,740
So many martial artists

292
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,490
have died to protect it.

293
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,570
Two generations of my family

294
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,660
have sacrificed themselves for it.

295
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,690
How could it just be destroyed

296
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,420
as easily as you imagine?

297
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,570
I’m sorry.

298
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,370
The problem of my dynasty

299
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,010
have got you involved.

300
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,200
To tell you the truth,

301
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,560
I’m dying.

302
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,860
Keeping such treasure

303
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,690
has no more meaning to me.

304
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,850
All rumors
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven

305
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,820
bring nothing, but disaster.

306
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,180
I don’t want you

307
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,610
or your men

308
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,330
to keep dying for it.

309
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,250
Lately, I often see Fei
practicing her blade

310
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,010
in the middle of the river.

311
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,490
I guess she’s doing that

312
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,010
in case of any accident.

313
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,010
When I see her work so hard,

314
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,010
I feel heartbreaking.

315
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,580
Madam.

316
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,300
This problem was caused
by my grandfather.

317
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,250
It has brought so many bloodsheds

318
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,090
to the martial world.

319
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,060
I don’t want to get Fei involved.

320
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,270
After I die,

321
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,000
everything will be over.

322
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,000
No one else will be involved.

323
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,250
Mr. Xie.

324
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,970
I’m not qualified

325
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,790
to destroy what my ancestors died for.

326
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,580
You’re also not qualified to decide it.

327
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,060
It doesn’t matter

328
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,300
what the Color of Ocean and Heaven is.

329
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,130
But it must be a very important thing

330
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,370
to the whole world.

331
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,730
Well,

332
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,540
I have no more reason to persuade you.

333
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,160
I understand what you mean.

334
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,130
But for a dying man like me,

335
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,880
neither righteousness nor responsibility

336
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,710
matters more

337
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,970
than Fei’s safety and happiness.

338
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,580
I don’t have much to give her.

339
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,460
I just want to clear out
all hidden trouble for her.

340
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,420
Mr. Xie.

341
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,610
I can’t decide for her.

342
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,940
Neither can you.

343
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,940
Let her make her own choice.

344
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,780
No matter if she chooses

345
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,700
to take the responsibility

346
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,850
or to live a safe and happy life,

347
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,250
I’ll support her.

348
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,130
Thank you, Madam.

349
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,660
You’ve brought her more trouble

350
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,900
than the Color of Ocean and Heaven

351
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,250
or the dispute of two courts.

352
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,730
There’s more behind them.

353
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,250
I talked to her.

354
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,850
I told her she would suffer all her life

355
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,250
just for a short period of happiness.

356
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,060
Is it worth it?

357
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,650
But she said

358
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,630
she wanted you only.

359
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,000
Don’t worry, Madam.

360
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,290
I’m actually dying.

361
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,130
But...

362
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,090
Before I die,

363
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,180
I’ll stay with her
until the last second.

364
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,700
The poison on Fisherman

365
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,330
could be relieved.

366
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,900
There’s no way to relieve yours?

367
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,560
The Bone-chilling on me

368
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,660
has been sealed.

369
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,210
But when I used
the Soul-searching Needle,

370
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,700
I released it.

371
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,210
Now the poison

372
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,250
is right in my passages.

373
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,470
Soul-searching Needle
from outside the pass?

374
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,700
Why did you have it?

375
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,460
When killing Dragon Master,

376
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,250
the North Blade Mr. Ji used some.

377
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,090
I picked the rest.

378
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,970
I’m sure you know

379
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,820
the Soul-searching Needle
gives people energy.

380
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,580
Whoever uses it will be forcibly strong,

381
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,890
but die in three quarters.

382
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,060
Thanks to the freezing effect

383
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,010
of Bone-chilling,

384
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,580
I managed to live longer.

385
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,780
With the medicine Fei got for me,

386
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,300
I’m still living.

387
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,010
It’s already a miracle.

388
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,900
I don’t know when,

389
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,700
but I’ll die.

390
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,250
Soul-searching Needle.

391
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,820
I only read about it.

392
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,940
I’ve never seen any before.

393
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,730
Do you have any with you?

394
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,700
I’m very interested.

395
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,660
May I keep it for some study?

396
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:27,684
Sub by Dramacool.ae

397
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,540
Sir.

398
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,970
Dan.

399
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,300
We’re leaving right away.

400
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,180
Go get some available men.

401
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,210
Get packed and come to me.

402
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,580
Time is limited.

403
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,730
They’re already hunting down Yitang.

404
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,180
They’ll come to us at any time, I guess.

405
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,660
Now,

406
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,130
I stand a higher chance to win.

407
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,090
Aye.

408
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,330
How do you know

409
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,500
my mother likes wonton
filled with radish leaves?

410
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,810
I’ve got a glib tongue.

411
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,610
Not to mention
your mother’s favorite food,

412
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,930
I can even get to know

413
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,180
all gossips and secrets

414
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,500
in your place.

415
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,830
Just because our men are honest.

416
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,380
You said you didn’t know

417
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,450
what gift to give your mother tomorrow.

418
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,060
I had to

419
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,330
give you advice,

420
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,450
ask about your mother’s favorite
and teach you.

421
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,300
I did hard work at least.

422
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,780
Why don’t you

423
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,420
even praise me?

424
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,540
You’re right.

425
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,060
Mr. Xie.

426
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,540
It’s so virtuous of you.

427
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,330
But I don’t think

428
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,020
you can make them tomorrow.

429
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,900
Shall I make them for you?

430
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,420
You can boil them.

431
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,660
Okay.

432
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,090
Oh, no. This is my gift to my mother.

433
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,020
I’ll do it myself.

434
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,610
I’ll try many more times.

435
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,010
Fine, then.

436
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,810
Look at the wonton.

437
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,610
Your mother will know you made them.

438
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,260
Look what you’ve made.

439
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,850
Isn’t it a rice dumpling?

440
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,970
It doesn’t look like a rice dumpling.

441
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,810
It’s not the way to make the wonton.

442
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,970
You should do like this.

443
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,380
You sound experienced.

444
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,060
But you’re not doing it
very well, either.

445
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,930
I’m doing it very well.

446
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,610
You’re doing it poorly, all right?

447
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,660
Look at this.

448
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,930
Fei, I’m relieved, then.

449
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,610
Before those things happen,

450
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,420
I want you to enjoy more peace.

451
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,810
When I left my room,

452
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,500
I met Dan.

453
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,970
She said you went to see my mother.

454
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,020
She looked hurried.

455
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,900
I didn’t ask much, then.

456
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,180
Why did you go to see my mother?

457
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,350
You know

458
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,020
she doesn’t like you.

459
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,440
But she said

460
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,210
she wanted you only.

461
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,610
I talked with Madam Li

462
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,060
about our future plan.

463
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,020
The water is boiling.
I’ll go boil the wonton.

464
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
Oh,

465
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,570
then,

466
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,660
your mother asked about Bone-chilling.

467
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,640
She also asked me
for the Soul-searching Needle.

468
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,420
Soul-searching Needle?

469
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,180
Why did she ask you for it?

470
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,690
I didn’t dare to ask.

471
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,500
It was her first time
to ask me for something.

472
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,260
I gave her the rest I have.

473
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,180
All?

474
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,540
What an idiot!

475
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,780
Is that a good thing?

476
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,420
Why did you give it to her
just because she asked?

477
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,180
I...

478
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,380
I’ll go ask her.

479
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,660
Looks good.

480
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,090
Not bad.

481
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,420
I’ve thought of what gift
I can give your mother.

482
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,500
What is it?

483
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,090
I’m going to draw
a Longevity Painting for her.

484
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,090
What do you think?

485
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,610
Good.

486
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,300
Sounds like an ingenious gift.

487
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,060
Only you can think

488
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,900
of such a bookish gift.

489
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,180
She’ll know it’s from you.

490
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,930
Sure.

491
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,300
My painting

492
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,330
is worth a lot of money.

493
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,300
Since I’ll give it to her tomorrow,

494
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,500
I must paint it today.

495
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,060
You’re right.

496
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,930
It’ll take a long time.

497
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,660
Go ahead.

498
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,420
If I go,

499
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,570
can you finish it alone?

500
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,140
I can. Go ahead.

501
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,450
Fine. I’ll wait for you in the pavilion
in the middle of the river.

502
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,140
Go ahead.

503
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,730
I’m sure the wonton will be perfect.

504
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,900
Sheng.

505
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,020
Aunt.

506
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,380
What brings you here?

507
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,420
You’ve been handling our business.

508
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,690
Are you used to it?

509
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,090
Aunt, you’ve been in the Repenting Hall.

510
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,850
We worried about you
when we didn’t see you.

511
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,610
Don’t bother.

512
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,850
How are you doing with the business?

513
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,610
Personnel, elite disciples,
provisions, and defenses.

514
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,140
Are you clear about them?

515
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,850
Aunt.

516
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,300
I kind of know about them.

517
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,930
What do you mean kind of?

518
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,690
If you don’t know very well

519
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,140
about our gates and defenses,

520
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,020
when the Demons come to attack us,

521
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,610
what can you do?

522
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,060
I see.

523
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,970
Tell me

524
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,660
what you’ve known now.

525
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,060
There’re a thousand dan of grains.

526
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,260
Fifteen thousand men of all sects.

527
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,450
I’ve made arrangements

528
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,260
for our Fortress.

529
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,500
I put more men to each gate.

530
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,420
Mr. Xie.

531
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,300
Mr. Bai.

532
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Mr. Xie.

533
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,900
His Highness is leaving tonight.

534
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,300
He asked me to say goodbye to you.

535
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,060
He’s leaving so quickly?

536
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,500
His Highness failed his plan.

537
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,610
He wants to go back to Jiankang
as soon as possible

538
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,610
and tell His Majesty about it.

539
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,380
Is Zichen alright?

540
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,850
Shall I see him off?

541
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,690
His Highness said he wouldn’t like
to bother anyone when he left.

542
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,810
You don’t need to see him off.

543
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,540
His Highness feels depressed

544
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,850
and he’s guilty for you.

545
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,930
The doctor asked him
to leave for recuperation.

546
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,760
So,

547
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,330
he wrote a letter to you.

548
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,850
Mr. Xie.

549
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,140
See you, then.

550
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,660
Xie Yun, sorry for disturbing you

551
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,660
and proposing to Miss Zhou.

552
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,060
She doesn’t like me.

553
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,300
I know I shouldn’t have bothered her.

554
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,380
I also know you’ve loved her
for a long time.

555
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,060
I feel myself more ridiculous.

556
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,870
I don’t dare to disturb her again.

557
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,720
I want to leave
as soon as possible.

558
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,330
Wish you would live a harmonious life

559
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,380
and understand each other.

560
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,900
Since you and Miss Zhou love each other,

561
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,060
I feel happy for you, too.

562
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,970
Don’t worry about me.

563
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,900
Sheng, you should also know

564
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,540
which disciples you can use,

565
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,300
which external forces we can draw over

566
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
and what you should guard against.

567
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,500
In this way,

568
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,900
I’ll feel relieved.

569
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,500
Aunt, isn’t this our seal?

570
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,690
I’m giving it to you.

571
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,500
I’m getting old

572
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,690
and far weaker.

573
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,260
I can’t take care
of such business all my life.

574
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,060
It’s time to let young men like you

575
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,300
take the heavy responsibility.

576
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,900
Aunt, what are you talking about?

577
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,500
You’re just forty. You’re not old.

578
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,060
Take... take it back.

579
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,180
Sheng, your grandfather and father

580
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,330
made painstaking efforts

581
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,500
to build our Fortress.

582
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,930
I’ll leave it to you.

583
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,940
Greetings, Madam.

584
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,450
Why isn’t it cooked yet?

585
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,930
Doctor Luo.

586
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,970
I’ve got something urgent to tell you.

587
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,090
What is it, Miss Chuchu?

588
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,140
You look hurried.

589
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,020
You’ve been treating Madam Li.

590
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,850
You know it best, so I’m coming to you.

591
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,060
What happened to Madam?

592
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,140
There was a serious wound on her heart.

593
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,020
She has a relapse out of anxiety.

594
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,690
She even spat out blood.

595
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,330
That’s screwed.

596
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,610
Thank you, Miss Chuchu.
I’ll go right away.

597
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,260
Let me finish.

598
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,810
Madam said we shouldn’t let others know.

599
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,570
You don’t need to check on her.

600
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,090
Just fill the prescription
you used last time

601
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,380
and I’ll take it to her secretly.

602
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,210
My mother is sick?

603
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,180
Why was she wounded?

604
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,850
If she’s badly wounded,

605
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,420
why does she keep it

606
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,500
from everyone else?

607
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,090
She also asked
for the Soul-searching Needle.

608
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,740
<i>Heavy Responsibilities</i>

609
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,130
Why are you standing here?

610
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,730
Where’s my mother?

611
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,260
Aunt isn’t in.

612
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,500
And the Repenting Hall is locked.

613
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,410
I feel something weird.

614
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,650
Today, Aunt even gave me the seal

615
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,500
she always carried with her.

616
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,930
Screwed!

617
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,860
Something is gonna happen.

618
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,930
What is it?

619
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,410
My mother was wounded.

620
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,540
Seriously.

621
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,020
She has kept it from us.

622
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,650
She also asked Xie Yun
for the Soul-searching Needle

623
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,820
and said she would study on it.

624
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,970
Come on.

625
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,340
Even if Aunt is wounded,

626
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,890
few martial artists can defeat her.

627
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,260
Who does she

628
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,860
need the Soul-searching Needle for?

629
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,860
-The Demons!
-The Demons!

630
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,410
I’ll break into the Demons Manor alone.

631
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,060
You just need to help me on the way.

632
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,730
Hope you can all come back safely.

633
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,060
Aye.

634
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,410
Let’s go.

635
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,690
Mother.

636
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,620
Fei? Sheng?

637
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,820
What are you coming for?

638
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,540
You’re wounded.

639
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,820
Where are you going this late?

640
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,170
Such a slight injury isn’t a problem.

641
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,650
I’ll go handle something urgent
down the mountain.

642
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,500
Tomorrow is your birthday.

643
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,020
What kind of urgent thing

644
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,930
needs you to handle personally?

645
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,890
Aunt, you even
shut the Repenting Hall.

646
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,210
It’s my own business.

647
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,650
Stop asking!

648
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,410
Then why do you need
the Soul-searching Needle for?

649
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,620
I’ve got my reason.

650
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,860
None of your business.

651
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,450
Get out of the way!

652
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,410
Mother.

653
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,300
Aunt.

654
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,210
Mother, is it
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

655
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,930
Are you going

656
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,260
to the Demons Manor?

657
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,260
Aunt.

658
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,730
You’re the backbone of our Fortress.

659
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,500
What do we do if you’re away?

660
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,970
If you worry the Demons will attack us,

661
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,890
you should stay

662
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,860
and make concerted efforts with us.

663
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,060
Let’s think of another way, shall we?

664
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,340
If you insist on going,

665
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,300
take us with you.

666
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,170
Fei, what are you talking about?

667
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,730
We brought back the tokens.

668
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,210
We should be responsible.

669
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,210
I said

670
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,930
no one could interfere!

671
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,860
Get out of the way!

672
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,130
No!

673
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,650
Mother.

674
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,620
You’re taking a great risk.

675
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,210
If you insist on going,

676
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,860
defeat us first.

677
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,890
You’re fledged, huh?

678
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,540
You dare to stop me?

679
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,410
Fine.

680
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,650
I’ll see

681
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,690
if you’re capable to stop me.

682
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,100
Madam, show some mercy!

683
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,820
Fei, give in!

684
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,580
I won’t!

685
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,890
If you give in, I’ll stop.

686
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,060
I won’t!

687
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,780
You’ve lost.

688
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,820
Mother.

689
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,650
Here you are.

690
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,320
You practice the blade very well.

691
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,500
You’ve grown up.

692
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,780
And you can take charge.

693
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,780
Well done.

694
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,130
Is my mother angry?

695
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,300
Why do I think

696
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,260
Aunt feels happy

697
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,730
for that?

698
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,700
<i>To Zhou Fei</i>

699
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,220
<i>To Zhou Fei</i>

700
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,940
<i>Nine Moves of the Snow-breaking Blade</i>

701
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,540
<i>Wish Madam Li longevity!</i>

702
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,020
Wake up! Wake up!

703
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,730
Wake up!

704
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,130
Wake up! What happened to you?

705
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,130
What happened to you?

706
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,260
Screwed!

707
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,500
The gift from the Third Prince

708
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,170
is gone!

709
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,210
What?

710
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,450
I’ll go tell Madam.

711
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,620
And you’ll look for it.

712
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,620
Go.

713
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,300
Go.

714
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,370
What are you doing?

715
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,690
Madam is feeling unwell.

716
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,170
She’s resting and won’t see anyone.

717
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,340
This is very urgent.

718
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,620
The Mountain-River Jade
in the Hall of Elders is gone.

719
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,820
There was a thief!

720
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,300
How is it possible?

721
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,930
We haven’t lost anything
within a dozen years.

722
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,170
Did you get it wrong?

723
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,210
Dan.

724
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,100
We’ve searched the Hall of Elders,
but haven’t found it.

725
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,650
We need Madam to give instructions.

726
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,260
Let me in.

727
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,690
What’s the noise?

728
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,300
Madam.

729
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,970
Why was the disciple on duty asleep?

730
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,060
I don’t know.

731
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,410
But it was very weird.

732
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,930
Let’s go have a look.

733
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,020
What, Madam?

734
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,500
Dan.

735
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,410
Here.

736
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,650
Go with him.

737
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,500
Lock the gate and let no one in or out.

738
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,580
I’ll catch up.

739
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,730
Aye.

740
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,060
Aye.

741
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,170
Who?

742
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,060
Madam.

743
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,650
I heard you don’t feel well today.

744
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,930
Who are you?

745
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,970
I’m a doctor
working for the Third Prince.

746
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,300
He knew you felt unwell

747
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,340
and sent me to bring you some medicine.

748
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,690
Take off your veil.

749
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,730
I’ve caught a cold.

750
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,060
If I take it off,

751
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,580
I may pass it

752
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,410
on to you.

753
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,780
Come over.

754
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,260
Aye.

755
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,630
It’s you?

756
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,500
Madam Li.

757
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,620
Here we meet again.

758
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,930
You poisoned my father.

759
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,620
I haven’t taken revenge yet.

760
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,450
How dare you come again!

761
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,650
You mean Li Zheng?

762
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,100
You’re even worse

763
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,620
than your father.

764
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,580
How dare you annoy me!

765
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,450
I know you’re wounded.

766
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,410
Fighting in this way,

767
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,690
you can’t hold for a long time.

768
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,890
Long enough to kill you!

769
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,450
You’re stalling for time?

770
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,780
Yes. I put poison in the candle.

771
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,690
You found it.

772
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,410
But it’s too late.

773
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,500
Madam, the medicine is ready.

774
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,060
Who is it?

775
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,100
Madam!

776
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,370
Repenting Hall?

777
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,860
<i>Wish Madam Li longevity!</i>

778
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,730
Madam.

779
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,020
Fei.

780
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,450
What happened to my mother?

781
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,780
Your mother...

782
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,300
She’s poisoned.

783
00:45:57,324 --> 00:46:11,324
