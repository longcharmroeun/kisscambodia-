<i>Episode 44</i>

18
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,450
What happened?

19
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,380
Aunt!

20
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,090
She had fainted

21
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,020
when I arrived.

22
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,450
The suspect is gone.

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,060
How’s my mother?

24
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,660
She’s poisoned

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,580
with something unknown yet.

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,660
Thankfully,

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,410
it hasn’t damaged her heart vessels

28
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,850
and only put her into a coma.

29
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,380
We must know what it is

30
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,930
in order to remove it.

31
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,850
Who could break in

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,450
and poison her?

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,620
Who did this?

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,530
I saw a woman.

35
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,860
She was fast.

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,170
Most people couldn’t have done that.

37
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,810
The poison

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,980
must’ve been planted in the candle.

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,810
Luckily, Aunt found out

40
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,500
and cut it.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,980
It’s the same method

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,090
Pathetic Clam used

43
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,730
to kill Mu Xiaoqiao.

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,570
Candle.

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,170
That snake keeper said

46
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,090
the Big Medicine Valley

47
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,900
invented such a poisoning method.

48
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,000
This needle

49
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,620
is also the same as
what Pathetic Clam used

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,170
back at the Small Medicine Valley.

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,350
Wasn’t she

52
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,710
killed by Phoenix?

53
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,240
Obviously,

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,990
she’s still alive.

55
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,400
Plus Phoenix did say

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,470
he didn’t see her face clearly

57
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,350
when he killed her.

58
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,120
Why would she

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,910
Poison Madam Li?

60
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,190
She could fail

61
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,210
and get caught by us.

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,660

65
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,990
Fei.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,240
This is Aunt’s letter to you.

67
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,270
Fei,

68
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,320
all the five tokens

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,630
are in Yitang’s favorite weiqi set.

70
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,800
The hidden compartment

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
has been emptied.

72
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,590
We can’t remove the poison

73
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,820
but only suppress it for now.

74
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,590
According to that snake keeper,

75
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,240
she only makes the poison

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,680
but not the antidote.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
I don’t buy it.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
Once we seize that habitual poisoner,

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,280
there must be a solution.

80
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,800
We had the gate closed

81
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,750
on our way here.

82
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,720
She might still be here.

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Sheng, let’s split up.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
You go to the front gate

85
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,590
while I check the other routes.

86
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,000
Sure.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,310
Let’s go.

88
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,240
Take care of my mother.

89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,680
Pass my order.

90
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,630
Form search teams.

91
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,840
Don’t act alone,

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,910
or they might be in danger.

93
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,030
Yes.

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,630
Don’t worry. I’m here to help.

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,000
I was just told to search the area...

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
Hold on.

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
That can’t be right.

98
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,680
Let’s go to the Hall of Elders.

99
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,520
Close the gate to seize suspects.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
Be patient.

101
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,400
You guys check the front side.

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,750
You people go to the riverside.

103
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,470
Check carefully.

104
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,400
Leave no stone unturned.

105
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,440
-Yes.
-Lord,

106
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,680
we should’ve left earlier.

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,840
Now, they’re on alert.

108
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,720
We can’t leave.

109
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,070
Don’t worry.

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,350
Wait until

111
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,840
they catch that useless prince.

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,590
That’ll be our best chance to escape.

113
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,310
The rest of you
go to the front gate with me.

114
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,240
Yes!

115
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,030
Wait. I still feel worried.

116
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,720
Take some men with you

117
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,070
and check that route again.

118
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,520
The one taken by the enemies last time?

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
Outsiders couldn’t have found it.

120
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
Check again, just in case.

121
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,470
-Yes.
-Let’s go.

122
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,870
Come.

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
This is it. Guard the exit.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,070
Yes!

125
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,150
I meant to leave in disguise

126
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,590
but they left me no choice.

127
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,030
They had it coming.

128
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,150
<i>Insightful and Open-minded</i>
How could this happen?

129
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,280
What to do?

130
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,030
Sheng,

131
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,440
is Madam really...

132
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,310
Yang Jin, tell them everything

133
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,400
about what happened
in the Hall of Elders.

134
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
I was practicing skills with others

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
before hearing
the Hall of Elders was robbed

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,680
and came over.

137
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
After searching,
that Mountain-River Jade

138
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,000
was lost.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,190
Who’s the guard there today?

140
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,960
-It’s... It’s...
-Is it you?

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,630
It’s me.

142
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,240
How dare you stop the Third Prince!

143
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,590
This is an act of treason!

144
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,150
We’re following Madam’s order.

145
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,440
The gate is locked for tonight.

146
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,240
No one shall leave.

147
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,520
Young man,

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
His Highness

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,350
is Madam Li’s guest.

150
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,520
There must be a misunderstanding

151
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,630
for you to hold us up.

152
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,240
Here’s the thing, Mr. Bai,

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,680
a thief broke in

154
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,870
and stole Madam’s birthday gift

155
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,390
from His Highness,

156
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,000
hence the lockdown

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,590
to capture that person.

158
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,760
I’m the last person you should halt.

159
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,830
Would I take back

160
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,200
what I had given to others?

161
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
I apologize, Your Highness.

162
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
Before the truth comes out,

163
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
no one is allowed to leave.

164
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,880
Alright.

165
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
Since you’re on a search mission,

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
search us first.

167
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
If we don’t have

168
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,350
what you’re looking for,

169
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,910
please

170
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,350
report to Madam Li and Miss Zhou

171
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,830
to let us leave.

172
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,390
I’m sorry.

173
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,030
Go!

174
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,030
Yes!

175
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
It’s alright.

176
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,270
Let them do their job.

177
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,950
We have nothing to hide.

178
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,240
This is it!

179
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,000
Found it!

180
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,150
Mountain-River Jade!

181
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,470
Take them to the Hall of Elders.

182
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,880
Smells like knockout drops.

184
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,590
Knockout drops?

185
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,680
From whom?

186
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,510
Knockout drops.

187
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,030
What happened before you passed out?

188
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,080
I think

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,710
I saw a girl.

190
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,440
She was a new face

191
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,800
and couldn’t be our own member.

192
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,440
Hey, you.

193
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,390
Mr. Xie.

194
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,760
What happened here?

195
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,240
Where’s Zhou Fei?

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
Madam...

197
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,390
Madam was poisoned.

198
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,710
Miss Zhou is looking for the poisoner.

199
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,950
Poisoned?

200
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,590
Yes, by the Demons.

201
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,640
Elder Zhang has had all members

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,680
search for those bad people.

203
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,950
Oh, no!

204
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,830
Zichen!

205
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,800
The gate is closed.

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,830
This is the only exit.

207
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
Pathetic Clam.

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Seize them all!

209
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,470
They colluded with Pathetic Clam

210
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,030
and poisoned Madam

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,710
Please calm down.

212
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,440
There must be a mistake.

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,030
We can explain

214
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,910
to Madam Li.

215
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,910
You evil thieves!

216
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,080
No wonder you were in a rush to leave.

217
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,910
That explains it.

218
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,590
Seize them!

219
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,000
Go!

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,710
Hold on.

221
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,440
Xie Yun.

222
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,470
Mr. Xie,

223
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,640
what are you doing?

224
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,390
Elder Zhang,

225
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,950
I can vouch for him with my life.

226
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,240
The Third Prince knows nothing about it.

227
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,240
Mr. Xie, you don’t know.

228
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,760
I’ve just found out

229
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,200
that he took Pathetic Clam here

230
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,640
who poisoned Madam.

231
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,680
You... Move!

232
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,800
Elder Zhang, think about it.

233
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
They were never on bad terms.

234
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,640
Why would a prince

235
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,000
hurt her?

236
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,830
The rich and powerful

237
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,440
are a bunch of evil bastards.

238
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,510
Who knows what they’re up to?

239
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,150
Speak!

240
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,800
Did your father

241
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,510
give you the order?

242
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,270
I’m here to propose marriage.

243
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,910
I swear I mean no harm.

244
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,950
That’s your excuse

245
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,390
to bring Pathetic Clam in

246
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,880
to poison Madam.

247
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,510
You’re in cahoots. Stop denying it!

248
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,680
-No way.
-I...

249
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,080
There’s a long-running feud
between the Chens and the Demons.

250
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
That woman must’ve

251
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
set the Third Prince up.

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,390
Xie Yun,

253
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,510
step aside,

254
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,760
or you’re leaving me no choice

255
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,390
but to kill you, too!

256
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,880
Us colluding with Demons

257
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
is utter nonsense!

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,470
That aside,

259
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,350
why are you blaming Xie Yun, too?

260
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,240
Zichen,

261
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
enough. Just go.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,440
Now!

263
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,680
Capture them!

264
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
Master Zhang.

265
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Sheng.

266
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,560
Mr. Xie meant well.

267
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,590
Drop your spear.

268
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,350
Sheng,

269
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,270
he did help us out once,

270
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,910
but Madam was poisoned

271
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,240
by his friend.

272
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,880
How could you trust him?

273
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,800
Master Zhang,

274
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,510
don’t jump to conclusions.

275
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,150
Calm down.

276
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,800
Your Highness,
where are the two doctors?

277
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,470
They left to wait for us outside.

278
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,880
Your Highness, in this case,

279
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,760
that doctor who showed up uninvited

280
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,910
must be Pathetic Clam.

281
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,440
She disguised herself

282
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,150
and sneaked in

283
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,590
in the name of
treating the Third Prince.

284
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,120
She stole the tokens,

285
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,270
and poisoned Aunt,

286
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,000
pinning everything
on the Third Prince

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,390
to play us off against each other

288
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,590
in favor of her.

289
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,390
If her plot worked

290
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,080
that the court and our Fortress
were against each other,

291
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,830
the masses would suffer.

292
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,390
Your Highness,

293
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,800
you may leave.

294
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,200
I’m really sorry.

295
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,080
And I’ll make it up to you.

296
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,590
Pathetic Clam is well-prepared

297
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,440
and must’ve been long gone.

298
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,880
Fei is out looking for her.

299
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,030
We’re going to help her

300
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,510
catch that woman.

301
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,760
She’s there alone?

302
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
Yes. I’m not sure where she is now

303
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
and I’m worried.

304
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Mr. Xie!

305
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,710
My lady, let’s take a break.

306
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,350
We’ve been on the move almost all night.

307
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,270
No one is behind us.

308
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,120
We’ve gotten rid of

309
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,000
those of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

310
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,950
With the tokens on me,

311
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,830
the quicker we get back, the better.

312
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,270
Once we get out of this area,

313
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,210
reinforcements will come.

314
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,200
Do you think I’m afraid of the hunters?

315
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,590
It’s the so-called reinforcements.

316
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,440
We can’t afford to lose the tokens.

317
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,390
Once we’re out of the woods,

318
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,320
contact our agents immediately

319
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,510
and ask them to report to Lord.

320
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,510
Yes.

321
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,000
Rest here for a while.

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,830
I’ll go get water.

323
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,150
Miss Zhou,

324
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,590
without me,

325
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,950
your mother will die.

326
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,710
Let me go

327
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,120
in exchange for the antidote
to Worry-burying.

328
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,240
So that’s what she’s with.

329
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Aren’t you said

330
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,080
to only make the poison

331
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,240
but not the antidote?

332
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,240
That said,

333
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,240
still...

334
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,350
Cut to the chase.

335
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,760
Give me the antidote

336
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,120
if you want to live.

337
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,440
Wait.

338
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,390
There’s a cure.

339
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,150
Tell me about it.

340
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,590
I’ll make my own judgment.

341
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,080
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

342
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Find the treasure.

343
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,440
That’ll cure your mother.

344
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,120
That again!

345
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,950
Don’t you have anything new?

346
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,710
I’m telling you the truth.

347
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,440
Years of working with poison

348
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,110
is killing me slowly.

349
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,560
That treasure is my only cure.

350
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,440
That’s why I need the tokens.

351
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,110
Where are they?

352
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,510
Drop your blade

353
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,030
and I’ll give them to you.

354
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,720
Here they are.

355
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,060
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

356
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
Fei.

357
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,960
Fei!

358
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,080
It’s my fault.

359
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,840
I failed to protect Madam

360
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,150
and got her poisoned.

361
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,270
Don’t be too hard on yourself, Dan.

362
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,510
Nobody could

363
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,600
anticipate that.

364
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
No.

365
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,150
I should have.

366
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,510
I knew they had attempted
to kill Lord Gantang,

367
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,200
and they would

368
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
take further action here.

369
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,230
Uncle was under attack?

370
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,410
What happened?

371
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
Yesterday,

372
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,870
Yu Wenzhi’s spy was caught outside

373
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,270
who failed to assassinate Lord Gantang

374
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,680
and was there

375
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,960
searching for him.

376
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,270
Lord asked us to keep it from you

377
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,390
and look for him secretly

378
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,390
to contain panic.

379
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,560
In this case,

380
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,270
the theft and the assassination

381
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,480
must be related.

382
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,090
They can’t be a coincidence.

383
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,750
They must’ve plotted all that long ago.

384
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,630
I thought so.

385
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,390
I interrogated that spy, too.

386
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,720
But he claimed that
he wasn’t aware of the theft.

387
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,710
Didn’t Madam and Lord Gantang
have a pact?

388
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
He’s survived

389
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,000
and so will Madam.

390
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,560
She certainly will.

391
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,390
You good-for-nothing!

392
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,990
I’m sorry. Please calm down.

393
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,360
Don’t be mad.

394
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,070
The old and new dynasties
are supposed to be mortal enemies.

395
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,280
How come Xiao Chuan
is unaffected?

396
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,510
That walking dead

397
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,030
keeps spoiling my plan.

398
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,320
Xiao Chuan!

399
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,320
Send a message to Shen Tianshu

400
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,360
that I’ll agree to his condition

401
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,360
if he gets rid of Xiao Chuan for me.

402
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,870
Lord Shen has arrived at Hanshui Town.

403
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,440
I heard

404
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
Lord Hu had obtained

405
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,560
all five tokens.

406
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,870
He’s there to pick her up.

407
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,020
I knew Tianying would make it.

408
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,700
Xiao Chuan!

409
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,720
Madam is still in a coma.

410
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,630
Her condition is critical.

411
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,150
I’m entrusting the Fortress to you.

412
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,910
No need to tell us that.

413
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,080
It’s our job.

414
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,800
Where’s Fei?

415
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,270
She’s left to capture Pathetic Clam.

416
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,030
I’m going to join her.

417
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,330
Sure.

418
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,970
I’ll go with you.

419
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,660
Here are a few things
that require your attention.

420
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,010
Pathetic Clam managed to escape

421
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,580
but she might not have gone far.

422
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,210
It’s still our territory outside.

423
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,700
But the Demons might’ve

424
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,370
arranged people to get her out.

425
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,180
Those bastards!

426
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,660
They should know

427
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,130
we aren’t afraid of them!

428
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,210
Yes. We aren’t.

429
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,580
We’ll fight them to the end!

430
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,970
Elder Zhang,

431
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,540
what if Shen Tianshu comes in person?

432
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,490
Yang Jin and I

433
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,130
will leave with our crack troops

434
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,420
to join Fei to capture Pathetic Clam.

435
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,250
It’s not safe inside or outside.

436
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,940
I have great respect for you.

437
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,370
Please guard the Fortress with others

438
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,480
to prevent another attack.

439
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,180
Thank you.

440
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,210
No need.

441
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,820
That’s what we should do.

442
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,090
Consider it done.

443
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,810
That’s our duty.

444
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,900
Chuchu.

445
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,610
Take care of my aunt.

446
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,610
I will.

447
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,730
Where are Xie Yun and Yan?

448
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,540
Mr. Xie has left to find Fei.

449
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,610
There’s still no news from him.
I’m worried.

450
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,250
As for Yan, wasn’t she out shopping?

451
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,820
Mr. Xie said

452
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,330
she’d be back today.

453
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,700
I hope she’ll be fine.

454
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,180
That girl.

455
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,250
How’s she?

456
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,850
Her pulse is as weak as yesterday.

457
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,460
Right now, it’s only a coma,

458
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,580
but it might get worse tomorrow.

459
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,780
Back then

460
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,780
when Old Master was poisoned
by Pathetic Clam,

461
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,050
there was nothing
our physicians could do.

462
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,210
Don’t give up hope yet.

463
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,930
The tougher the situation is,

464
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,640
the more united we should be.

465
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,360
All we can do is to guard the fort

466
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,730
to not hold Zhou Fei and Li Sheng back.

467
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,250
Yes!

00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,210
Behave yourself!

520
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,420
It must be tough

521
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,330
following me all the way here.

522
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,930
I’ll spare you

523
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,780
so that you can
report back to your leader

524
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,090
to leave me alone.

525
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,900
Or the Route Gang will soon be gone.

526
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,330
Yes. Yes.

527
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:15,710
Piss off!

528
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,810
Lord.

529
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,970
The Route Gang never dared to offend us.

530
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,660
This time...

531
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,140
That was for the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

532
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,810
Urge Gu Tianxian

533
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,060
to come quickly with his force.

534
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,020
Yes.

535
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,020
Mr. Li.

536
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,970
You again!

537
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,020
What are you still doing here?

538
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,260
Mr. Bai,

539
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,140
have you found those female doctors?

540
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,380
Mr. Li,

541
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,180
it was my negligence

542
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,420
that led to

543
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,900
Madam being poisoned.

544
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,180
My death isn’t enough
to cover the damage.

545
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,140
But the Third Prince asked me

546
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,610
to help you

547
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,500
to redeem myself.

548
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,850
Whatever you need me to do,

549
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,850
I won’t say no to it.

550
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,330
How can I trust you?

551
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,300
I was the head of the White Bat
of the Route Gang.

552
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,970
Its business covers the entire state.

553
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,540
I still have influence

554
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,450
in the Gang.

555
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,970
What can you

556
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,850
do for me?

557
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,330
The Route Gang

558
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,020
isn’t known for its force,

559
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,450
but it excels at

560
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,850
gathering information.

561
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,210
News just came in

562
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,780
that Shen Tianshu of Demons Manor

563
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,380
is heading this way.

564
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,330
How many people are there with him?

565
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,930
Only enough to form a squad,

566
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,380
but Gu Tianxian

567
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,780
and the main force is right behind.

568
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,420
It seems that

569
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,690
they’re meeting in Hanshui Town.

570
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,540
Luckily, Yang Jin

571
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,730
has left to contact our secret service.

572
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,380
Mr. Bai,

573
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,450
please come with me.

574
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,020
I’m going to need your help.

575
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,900
Mr. Li,

576
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,780
I’m asked

577
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,300
to do my best to help you.

578
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,330
Whatever you need,

579
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,570
just let me know.

580
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,380
Search this place!

581
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,660
Find that girl of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight

582
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,930
even if you have to
tear this town apart.

583
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,930
Yes!

584
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,560
<i>East Point</i>

585
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,500
-This way.
-Let’s go.

586
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,260
-Follow me.
-Yes.

587
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,610
Take that way.

588
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,570
Over there.

589
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,450
That girl of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight?

590
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,690
Do they mean Fei?

591
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,140
Is she also here?

592
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,540
Have you checked that way?

593
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,930
-Come here.
-Yes.

594
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,690
Sir.

595
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,900
Come here.

596
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,330
Found anything in the front?

597
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,260
The Demons are all over the place.

598
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,660
You aren’t a local, are you?

599
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,610
No.

600
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,450
Listen,

601
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,570
here isn’t safe lately.

602
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,970
Don’t wander about at night.

603
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,140
Search it!

604
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,970
Come in.

605
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,020
Where are we?

606
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,420
Those Demons

607
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,180
show up out of the blue.

608
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,900
Demons?

609
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,930
They’re our Fortress’s mortal enemies.

610
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,690
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

611
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,540
Just now, you were out there alone,

612
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,780
looking around.

613
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,690
What if they saw you

614
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,540
and caught you?

615
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,330
Don’t worry.

616
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,500
They wouldn’t dare.

617
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,850
Those notorious villains

618
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,090
would catch everyone in sight

619
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,780
regardless of who they are.

620
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,060
Are you afraid of them?

621
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,300
Our people can deal with them.

622
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,210
As experienced as they seem,

623
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,810
my brother and cousin

624
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,610
killed three of them
soon after they left home.

625
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,090
Now, only four Demons are left.

626
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,610
Why are you hiding here?

627
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,900
I...

628
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,810
I’m outnumbered.

629
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,210
We can hide here for now.

630
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,140
I’ll take you

631
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,610
to our secret meeting point later.

632
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,020
We’ll be safe there.

633
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,380
It was dangerous!

634
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,780
The minute the map popped open,

635
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,260
it burned my hands.

636
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,930
Who else was there?

637
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,570
Poisoner Ying Hecong,

638
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,500
that bonehead of the Cloud Ravine

639
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,330
and a girl of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

640
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,090
She cared a lot

641
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,090
about that map.

642
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,090
Liu Youliang risked his own life

643
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,300
to help them escape.

644
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,210
Is she that girl

645
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,690
Tong Tianyang said?

646
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,540
How come

647
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,690
they sent you here alone?

648
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,260
Don’t be scared.

649
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,380
It’s not the same.

650
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,440
What if I ran into Shen Tianshu?

651
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,560
You don’t know how scary he is, do you?

652
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,420
Alright.

653
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,380
Tell me about it.

654
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,610
How is he scary?

655
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,970
It’s said that man

656
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,180
is invincible.

657
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,610
He’s a highly skilled killing machine

658
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,780
and an evil

659
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,180
ringleader.

660
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,380
Sir,

661
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,660
if you see him,

662
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,380
run as fast as you can.

663
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,450
I’m starving.

664
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,610
Try it.

665
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,060
It’s the specialty here.

666
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,930
Just take it.

667
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,660
You seem old.

668
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,140
Why are you out alone?

669
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,730
Aren’t your family worried?

670
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,260
I have none.

671
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,300
They all died

672
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,090
because of the war years back.

673
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,730
Oh.

674
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,140
I’m sorry.

675
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,850
Are you sad all these years?

676
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,970
There are other ways

677
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,570
to gain happiness
other than being with family.

678
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,660
Isn’t it also fun to gain power?

679
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,140
They’re two different things.

680
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,420
To gain power,

681
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,300
you have to fight for what you want.

682
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,850
Even if you win the whole world,

683
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,850
it comes at a price.

684
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,730
That’s different

685
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,210
from being loved and cared for.

686
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,210
Take my cousin
and cousin-in-law as an example.

687
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,820
Before she said

688
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,260
what she wanted,

689
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,410
my cousin-in-law had found it for her.

690
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,930
When he was sick,

691
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,500
my cousin would save him with her life.

692
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,450
Only you naive kids

693
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,450
would believe that.

694
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,060
That’s not true.

695
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,860
Sir,

696
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,170
you would, too, if you were there.

697
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,540
I envy them.

698
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,730
Your cousin-in-law probably wouldn’t.

699
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,020
Are you a veteran?

700
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,820
How so?

701
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,780
Things you said about power

702
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,170
gave you away.

703
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,260
Why are you here?

704
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,890
I used to

705
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,890
serve in the Anping Army.

706
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,210
I’m here

707
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,060
to visit an old comrade.

708
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,100
Anping Army?

709
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,100
No way!

710
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,790
That’s my uncle’s...

711
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,460
♪Enlisted at 15♪

712
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,460
♪Only to return at 80♪

713
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,010

714

♪Who’s left back home♪

715
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,340
What’s that song?

716
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,450
It’s beautiful.

717
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,410
Song of Anping.

718
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,450
Song of Anping.

719
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,090
How come it sounds familiar?

720
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,090
It’s been over 20 years.

721
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,770
Things in the army

722
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,780
have become vague

723
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,690
except for this song.

724
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,530
I still remember it.

725
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,860
Oh, no!

726
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,370
The Demons are nearby.

727
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,580
What if they heard the song

728
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,780
and came in this direction?

729
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
They wouldn’t.

730
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,820
Let’s go.

731
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,130
Come.

732
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,020
Alright.

733
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,130
I’ll drop you

734
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,650
at our meeting point first.

735
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,370
It’s safer there.

736
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,370
Stop.

737
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,130
Where are you going this late?

738
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,370
Sirs,

739
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,060
my grandfather and I
are going to the morning market.

740
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,130
Are you going there, too?

741
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Yes.

742
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,930
What a coincidence!

743
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,650
We’re leaving.

744
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,650
What’s going on?

745
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,020
How do you feel?

746
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,340
Better now?

747
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,580
Much better.

748
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
The Route Gang said

749
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,450
they had found traces of Pathetic Clam.

750
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,100
She seems to be heading to Hanshui Town.

751
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,620
Fei,

752
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,210
you must be the only one

753
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,300
who can still be so energetic

754
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,970
after being poisoned by Pathetic Clam.

755
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,580
I’m afraid

756
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,130
there’s also bad news.

757
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,170
Shen Tianshu is there already.

758
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,260
He’s fast.

759
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,620
Look,

760
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,500
we must get rid of her

761
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,020
before Shen Tianshu finds her.

762
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,580
Or it’ll be more difficult

763
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,780
once they get together.

764
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,210
Fei,

765
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,100
it’s too risky

766
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,860
to act alone.

767
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,860
Why don’t we

768
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,450
go back to the Fortress

769
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,020
to join the others first?

770
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,170
They left after us.

771
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,180
It’d be too late when they arrived.

772
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,730
Let’s go

773
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,370
and try to stop her halfway.

774
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,210
Even if we failed,

775
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,890
that’d still buy us time

776
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,650
to wait for backups.

777
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,780
Alright. You have a point.

778
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,210
I know you’re worried about me.

779
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,650
That woman is nothing

780
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,970
without her tricks and poison.

781
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,210
As long as I stay alert

782
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,260
and protect myself from them,

783
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,930
there’s a chance to win.

784
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,650
Her poison won’t be a problem.

785
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,060
You have me.

786
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,280
I’m your anti-poison armor.

787
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,820
You’re the sharp blade

788
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,130
while I’m the unbreakable shield.

789
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,920
Use her poison

790
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,520
against her

791
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,960
to not waste

792
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,110
the deadliest Bone-chilling she gave me.

793
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,550
Fine. Next time, when we see her,

794
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,680
we’ll waste no time

795
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,630
and take care of her first.

796
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,590
Deal.

797
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,830
Xie Yun,

798
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,310
hypothetically,

799
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,160
if one day,

800
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,030
I died,

801
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,590
what would you do?

802
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,520
That’d be my bliss.

803
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,070
I’d

804
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,680
have fun in every possible way

805
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,520
together with your share.

806
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,150
Live my life to the fullest

807
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,160
to not waste any second.

808
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,110
Bastard!

809
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,350
Fei,

810
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,630
you know

811
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,960
I’m a coward

812
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,350
struggling to live in chaos.

813
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,960
But after being through
so much with you,

814
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,920
I’ve got used to

815
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,830
putting my life on the line

816
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,760
and I’ve grown more guts.

817
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,920
Really?

818
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,550
Let me see.

819
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,030
Show me.

820
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,310
Wait... wait until they grow even more.

821
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,920
<i>Intelligent and Ingenious</i>
Senior Master Li.

822
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,270
Goodness!

823
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,870
Why are you still here?

824
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,520
You know what,

825
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,000
I almost got caught before the gate

826
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,240
and managed to pull through.

827
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,110
By the way, I got an elder out, too.

828
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,110
Look.

829
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,920
What’s wrong?

830
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,270
My mouth is dry after all the hiding.

831
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,590
We’re safe here.

832
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,030
We can rest at Senior Master Li’s store.

833
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,070
He once

834
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,270
fought against Shen Tianshu.

835
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,310
Really?

836
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,400
Of course.

837
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,000
Hey,

838
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,720
didn’t you say

839
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,030
you’re here to visit an old comrade?

840
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,550
Who is he?

841
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,760
Liu Youliang.

842
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,920
You...

843
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,030
You’re Timber Wolf, Shen Tianshu!

844
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,350
Young lady,

845
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,270
I wish

846
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,960
you didn’t recognize me.

847
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,550
Go, Yan!

848
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,630
Hello, dear.

849
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,680
Where are you going?

850
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,030
<i>Wood Workshop</i>
I poisoned Li Jinrong

851
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,520
to get the tokens out.

852
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,590
Her people

853
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,000
will soon find us.

854
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,680
We’d better leave now.

855
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,400
Not yet.

856
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,200
Gu Tianxian is on the way.

857
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,680
I need some answers

858
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,000
before we go.

859
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,920
Mr. Li, Mr. Yang,

860
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,160
we tried to follow him

861
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,680
but he’s too skilled.

862
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,920
I even lost a man

863
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,680
but still couldn’t get close to him.

864
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,350
Thank you.

865
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,240
Is something else bothering you?

866
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,720
I’m afraid

867
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,110
Yu Wenzhi’s force might also...

868
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,240
Yu Wenzhi?

869
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Yes.

870
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,550
Him again.

871
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,830
One of my contacts

872
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,520
is Yu Wenzhi’s groom.

873
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,030
He told me a while ago

874
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,720
that Pathetic Clam

875
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,070
was incited by Yu Wenzhi.

876
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,520
He even

877
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,070
came to Shen Tianshu for it.

878
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,070
Unexpectedly,

879
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:31,310
Shen Tianshu used
Pathetic Clam’s life as leverage

880
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,960
and they almost fell out.

881
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,240
In that sense,

882
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,270
Pathetic Clam and Yu Wenzhi

883
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,160
worked together to steal the tokens

884
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,960
behind Shen Tianshu’s back.

885
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,870
Correct. All I know

886
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,440
is that Shen Tianshu

887
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,960
was so mad at Yu Wenzhi

888
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,450
that he almost refused

889
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,160
to come to save Pathetic Clam.

890
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,520
Mr. Li,

891
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,760
there’s nothing new

892
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,590
from my contact.

893
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,960
My concern is

894
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,000
if Yu Wenzhi’s force joins them,

895
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,920
our people

896
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,920
won’t be their match.

897
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,920
I can’t wait for a bigger mess.

898
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,400
Once he’s here,

899
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,630
he won’t let Shen Tianshu

900
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,160
take the tokens so easily

901
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,480
after all that he’s done.

902
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,110
When it’s dog-eat-dog between them,

903
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,440
we can take advantage of it.

904
00:46:24,964 --> 00:46:30,964
