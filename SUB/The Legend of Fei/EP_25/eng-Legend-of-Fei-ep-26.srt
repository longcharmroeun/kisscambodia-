-Madam.

67
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,900
-Pull back!
-Pull back!

68
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,850

Here he is!

72
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,220
Be careful.

73
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,780
Pull.

74
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,730
Pull.

75
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,380
Sheng.

76
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,250
Are you all right?

77
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,850
Aunt.

78
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,570

80
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,780

81
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,660
Yes.

82
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,850
I’ll take some sleep.

83
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,500
Go ahead.

84
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
Take good care of Sheng.

85
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,820
I’m going to find things out.

86
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,050
My father always said

87
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,400
this blade was a legacy.

88
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,740
It means to be.

89
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,300
Mother.

90
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,780
Don’t move.

91
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,930
You injured internally.

92
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,690
You’ll be fine soon.

93
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,930
Certainly Ma Jili won’t hit you hard.

94
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,570
What happened with your inner power?

95
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,740
Who did you meet before?

96
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,100
I... A long story.

97
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,250
I met Duan Jiuniang at Huarong.

98
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,100
She transfused Yellow and Green Spirit
into my system,

99
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,420
and told me about her past with Grandpa.

100
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,390
She is a true master.

101
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,900
You were lucky to meet her.

102
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,610
Mother.

103
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,900
Li Sheng...

104
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,780
He’s fine.

105
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,040
Chuchu found him

106
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,280
hanging under the Feihong Bridge.

107
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,250
Just mind your own business.

108
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,010
Mother.

109
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,340
Where is Xie who came back with me?

110
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,220
Do you know who he is?

111
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,690
I do.

112
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,570
He travels around in the world,

113
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,860
and makes a living by selling songs.

114
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,180
With two mustaches,

115
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,130
he’s nicknamed Qian Suiyou.

116
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,900
Back then

117
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,690
he trespassed Ximo River

118
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,150
and was supposed to be punished,

119
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,020
but he was ordered to do so.

120
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,050
-Thanks to him, we could...
-Save it.

121
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,810
Leave his matters aside.

122
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,250
Take a good rest

123
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,740
and get recovered first.

124
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,980
Then explain to me

125
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,220
what you have done during your travel.

126
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,310
Time is running out.

127
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,010
Aren’t you dead?

128
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,370
I am not that easy...

129
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,130
to get killed.

130
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,130
You...

131
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,130
Nice blade.

132
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,660
Do you like it?

133
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,080
But you can’t take it.

134
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,810
I mean,

135
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,490
you are more talented
and have better understanding

136
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,860
in martial arts.

137
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,130
Over so many years,

138
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,980
I’ve been trying to catch up with you,

139
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,540
but I can’t.

140
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,570
I’m reluctant to fall behind.

141
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,570
Don’t gloat.

142
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,050
Listen to me.

143
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,740
The saying has that

144
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,660
he who laughs last,

145
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,010
laughs best.

146
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,780
You’re better than me now,

147
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,660
but soon I’ll surpass you.

148
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,690
Alright.

149
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,930
Wait and see.

150
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,930
Have... Have some tea.

151
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,610
It’s hot.

152
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,050
Thank you, Brother.

153
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,660
Who was talking with me?

154
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,490
I didn’t hear it clearly.

155
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,610
Brother.

156
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,370
Take a good rest.

157
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,570
I’ve got goose bumps.

158
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,450
What is Cloud-impelling Palm?

159
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,010
He is so powerful.

160
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,780
But why did he follow me
all the way here?

161
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,130
What is the tune?

162
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,250
Depart in Departure Sorrow Pavilion.

163
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,370
You’ve heard it a lot along the way.

164
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,810
Why asking again?

165
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,250
I come to see you.

166
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,660
Can I come into

167
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,180
your room?

168
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,540
You can’t.

169
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,340
Something is wrong with my ears.

170
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,250
I can’t hear some words clearly.

171
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,860
Since you say I can,

172
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,740
I’ll come in.

173
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,930
Thanks. Come on.

174
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,100
Come on in. Be seated.

175
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,220
We are not strangers.

176
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,810
No need to receive me outside.

177
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,860
Sit.

178
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,220
Miss.

179
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,340
Why are you staring at me like that?

180
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,930
I’m handsome.

181
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,250
You should pay money

182
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,780
if you keep watching.

183
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,980
No money.

184
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,450
You can watch me, too.

185
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,610
You...

186
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,220
What?

187
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,570
I find that

188
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,940
the more worried you are,

189
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,610
the happier you look.

190
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,330
Yet you talk in a serious way

191
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,540
when you feel relaxed.

192
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,580
Is there

193
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,120
anything you want to ask me?

194
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,250
Shen Tianshu said
you used Could-impelling Palm.

195
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,760
What is that?

196
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,370
You have top martial arts.

197
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,850
How come you were bullied

198
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,900
by a gang of rascals?

199
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,730
Moreover,

200
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,850
what is the Color of Ocean and Heaven
that you are after?

201
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,460
Xie Yun.

202
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,420
Why do you have

203
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,010
so many secrets?

204
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,420
Judging from your look,

205
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,250
you must be thinking

206
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,940
how to fool me with your lies.

207
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,490
I won’t ask.

208
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,010
No.

209
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,850
OK.

210
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,060
I’m leaving

211
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,330
if you don’t.

212
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:52,940
By the way.

213
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,580
Take this back.

214
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,580
Things are done.

215
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,210
You can take it back.

216
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,300
When Miss Wu asks about it,

217
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,610
you can explain.

218
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,130
What is it?

219
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,320
Xie Yun.

220
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,050
Are you pretending nothing happened?

221
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,900
You...

222
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
You...

223
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,970
Where will you stay?

224
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,250
The guest room here.

225
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,130
This place is indeed a wonderland.

226
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,490
It’s cool and pleasing in summer.

227
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,720
I want to stay a while longer.

228
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,300
Get yourself recovered.

229
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,180
Then

230
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,490
take me to have a tour around.

231
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,850
You know the scenes here

232
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,540
better than me, don’t you?

233
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,250
You are acting.

234
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,890
That’s not like what you would say.

235
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,780
What should I say then?

236
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,130
Should I say you may
put on some weight

237
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,490
and be my princess?

238
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,180
Are you all right?

239
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,730
Of course.

240
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,090
I’m absolutely fine.

241
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,210
Why are you after
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

242
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,210
I don’t want it to fall into
the wrong hands.

243
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,490
Since you’ve known it,

244
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,610
I can tell you the truth.

245
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,090
Chuchu’s Longevity Lock,

246
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,530
the Mountain Sword’s scabbard.

247
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,810
And your family’s gold bracelet.

248
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,730
These are

249
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,690
important items to open
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

250
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,370
Alright.

251
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,460
Stop asking.

252
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,580
You have so many questions.

253
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,700
Xie Yun.

254
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,900
I...

255
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,970
I won’t be so impulsive again.

256
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,450
I’ll tell you wherever I go.

257
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,660
I’ll talk to you first.

258
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,850
How is it?

259
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,180
Sure.

260
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,940
Anything else?

261
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,200
And...

262
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,460
No more.

263
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,570
I thought you’d hold back for some days.

264
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
I knew you couldn’t help asking me

265
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,780
and caring about me.

266
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,730
But in this way,

267
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,330
I’ll know, in your heart,

268
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,300
I mean something to you.

269
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,210
I’m just meddlesome, maybe.

270
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,270
Why bother to come here?

271
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,550
Chuchu.

272
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,870
Sheng.

273
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,300
I... I come to see

274
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,730
if you get better.

275
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,900
I... I’m much better.

276
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,090
Sorry

277
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,660
to let you worry.

278
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,830
Now

279
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,970
you are safe here.

280
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,030
Your brother

281
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,010
is out alone.

282
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,540
It’s worrisome.

283
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,420
Why don’t you get him here

284
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,180
to be with you?

285
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,730
You can take care of each other.

286
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,900
It’s fine if you don’t agree.

287
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,930
I agree.

288
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,820
Are you back alive shamelessly?

289
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
He’s my man.

290
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,850
You have no right to punish him.

291
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,660
Tianxian.

292
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,580
Rise.

293
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,780
Lord Shen.

294
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,010
How do you explain it?

295
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,540
My men were about to break through
the gate.

296
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,580
Who ordered

297
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,780
to pull back?

298
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,060
I didn’t expect,

299
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,730
Shen Tianshu, a top master,

300
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,850
the Head of the Demons,

301
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,700
could be defeated by a gang of boys

302
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
from the Fortress.

303
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,090
Who do you mean the boys?

304
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,180
I found it weird in Chunhui Town.

305
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,180
He should have died.

306
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,850
Yet he was alive and kicking,

307
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,370
and played the Cloud-impelling Palm.

308
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,300
The power of the Palm

309
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,240
is impossible for people of his age.

310
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,200
No way.

311
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,060
He got hit by Bone-chilling
ten years ago.

312
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,210
That was the fiercest poison
in the world.

313
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,020
It’s incurable.

314
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,090
How could he survive?

315
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,210
If a great master

316
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,700
used his own energy

317
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,090
to resist the poison in his body

318
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,060
and save him one life for another,

319
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,640
he could have a chance to survive.

320
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,600
Xiao Chuan.

321
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,020
Are you really so lucky?

322
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,560
Not really.

323
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,900
Xiao Chuan survived,

324
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,700
but he couldn’t use his own energy.

325
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,920
Once he uses,

326
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,610
the poison in his system
will be let loose.

327
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,370
His life

328
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,780
can only last for months.

329
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,500
He used Cloud-impelling Palm
against you.

330
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,130
Didn’t he know he’d die?

331
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,830
If that’s the case,

332
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,370
the attack to the Fortress

333
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,250
is worth something.

334
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,080
Although we lost some men,

335
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,680
Xiao Chuan will die soon.

336
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,970
It’s not bad.

337
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,300
Why did he risk his life

338
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,540
to protect the Fortress?

339
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,370
Is he also after
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

340
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,250
It’s hard to tell.

341
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,090
If it’s true,

342
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,730
his men will surely

343
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,580
go after other

344
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,180
Ripple-shaped objects.

345
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,820
Lord Shen.

346
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,210
You’re hurt badly.

347
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,970
Yet we don’t have much time.

348
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,330
I wonder if you can get
the Ripple-shaped objects

349
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,010
before then.

350
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,540
All my lords are

351
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,730
top-notch masters in the world.

352
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,420
If you don’t trust us,

353
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,060
you can have others do it.

354
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,730
Lord Shen.

355
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,060
Lord Shen. I’m joking.

356
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,300
Wish you a quick recovery.

357
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,730
I’m waiting for good news from you.

358
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,860
<i>Tomb tablet</i>

359
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,660
<i>Mourn</i>

360
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,860
Which is Fisherman’s tomb?

361
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,900
He liked to be neat and tidy.

362
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,250
<i>Feng Yuping’s tomb</i>

363
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,540
<i>Feng Yuping’s tomb</i>
I’ll come often to see him

364
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,490
and weed for him.

365
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,700
<i>Mourn</i>

366
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,460
Everyone.

367
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,250
My fortress survived the attack.

368
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,300
It is you who helped us

369
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,730
and defended it with your lives.

370
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,090
<i>Tomb tablet</i>

371
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,540
We will never forget

372
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,780
what you did for us.

373
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,300
Today,

374
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,820
the disciples and I

375
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,090
pay our last respects to you.

376
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,440
The world is full of danger.

377
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,940
No one is immune to it.

378
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,540
As the code of our sect says,

379
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,780
may we live with no regret.

380
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,820
We vow to

381
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,940
wipe out the evil.

382
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,610
-Save the people,
-Save the people,

383
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,060
-and bring justice to the world.

384

385

-All the disciples shall keep the vow.
-All the disciples shall keep the vow.

391
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,090
The view here is stunning,
people extraordinary.

392
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,700
In a turbulent time,

393
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,660
there should be no wonderland like this.

394
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,820
Wait, Young Master.

395
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,490
Madam asks for you.

396
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,250
What’s the matter?

397
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,490
You’ll know

398
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,010
when you meet her.

399
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,850
Please.

400
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,490
Please.

401
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,780
Madam. Mr. Xie comes.

402
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,850
Please, Mr. Xie.

403
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,580
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

404
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,180
The Fortress got attacked.

405
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,090
The injured are being treated around.

406
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,060
It’s inconvenient to talk.

407
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,660
So, I ask you to be here.

408
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,900
Please don’t mind it.

409
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,490
Not at all, Madam.

410
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,730
I’m no longer a stranger here.

411
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,940
Mr. Xie, you helped us

412
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,780
repel the Demons.

413
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,180
I’m grateful.

414
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,180
My pleasure, Madam.

415
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,940
I was just escorting Miss Wu

416
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,090
back to the Fortress.

417
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,330
We encountered the battle.

418
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,300
Given my friendship with Lord Gantang,

419
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,420
and also for the righteousness,

420
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,490
that’s what I should do.

421
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,820
You are young and highly skilled.

422
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,730
Who is your master?

423
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,940
I’m nobody.

424
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
My background doesn’t matter.

425
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,610
I just lead a free life

426
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,010
as I please.

427
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,530
Alright.

428
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,130
Where a hero comes from matters not.

429
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,050
You saved my daughter.

430
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,220
I keep that in mind.

431
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,570
If you need help someday,

432
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,530
the Fortress will help you as we can.

433
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,050
Thank you, Madam.

434
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,610
Miss Zhou fought gallantly

435
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,980
to defend the Fortress with the elders.

436
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,130
I was afraid to hold her back.

437
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,770
Madam.

438
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,050
Please pardon me.

439
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,290
Miss Zhou has been
following your example,

440
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,460
because she wants to

441
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,570
be recognized by you.

442
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,610
I suggest

443
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,220
you may praise her

444
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,480
more often.

445
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,530
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

446
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,290
By the way,

447
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,260
you look kind of pale.

448
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,130
Are you unwell?

449
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,330
Were you injured

450
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,610
by the Demons in the battle?

451
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,330
No. No. I’m fine.

452
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,500
The Fortress

453
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,770
is kind of humid. I’m not used to it.

454
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,130
Glad to hear.

455
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,020
Take good care of yourself anyway.

456
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,290
You are going to leave here.

457
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,130
Be safe.

458
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,050
Madam Li is kicking me out.

459
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,020
This is the token to leave.

460
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,660
<i>Fortress</i>

461
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,810
Have a safe journey.

462
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,260
<i>Fortress</i>

463
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,290
Take care, Madam.

464
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,260
I’m leaving.

465
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,850
She’s kicking me out.

466
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,020
Time to say goodbye.

467
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,180
Chuchu.

468
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,570
Li Yan.

469
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,290
Chuchu.

470
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,980
These cakes are from my brother,

471
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
as a gift for you to move here.

472
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,770
You may take here

473
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,260
as your home.

474
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,570
Thank you.

475
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,130
You’re welcome.

476
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,610
Chuchu.

477
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,420
My brother said

478
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,290
your brother would come here, too.

479
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,610
Tell me your childhood stories.

480
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,610
Nothing special, actually.

481
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,460
I’m serious.

482
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,330
Chuchu.

483
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,180
I only dare to tell you this.

484
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,050
I want a brother as well.

485
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,130
When he comes,

486
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,370
I’ll take him to tour
all over the Fortress.

487
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,850
Keep yourself busy.

488
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,700
Brother.

489
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,610
We can be reunited soon.

490
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,090
That guy hit my drowsy acupoint.

491
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,570
Did he want to run away?

492
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,610
What are you doing?

493
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,220
The friends here are so hospitable.

494
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,370
I eat too much and take a walk here

495
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,420
to digest.

496
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,220
And see the moon.

497
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,980
There is no moon tonight.

498
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,860
What are you looking at?

499
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,750
Are you avoiding me?

500
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,980
No. No. Absolutely not.

501
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Fei. You’re seriously injured.

502
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,090
Go back and rest now.

503
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,570
I’ve slept the whole day.

504
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,370
My injury is not serious.

505
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,050
Come. Let’s go somewhere.

506
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,180
Where to?

507
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,980
Xie Meimei.

508
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,500
I’ve made up my mind.

509
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,110
I’ll go with you to look for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

510
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,130
Why?

511
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,900
Because that item is evil.

512
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,460
A rebellion occurred here ten years ago.

513
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,980
Now it got the Fortress devastated
again.

514
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,730
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
was the cause.

515
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,810
I have to destroy it

516
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,530
before I can feel at ease.

517
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,980
Fei.

518
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,130
There’s no clue

519
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,460
to look for it.

520
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,090
For the Lock, Demons burnt the inn.

521
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,050
For the scabbard, Dragon Master
was after us.

522
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,770
The Fortress suffered great casualties.

523
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,640
Even you nearly got killed.

524
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,850
Why bother to do this?

525
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,660
I still have you.

526
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,810
You are not a jinx.

527
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,440
You are a mascot to me.

528
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,290
You got me out of danger so many times.

529
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,980
What am I afraid of?

530
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,130
What’s wrong?

531
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,810
You are numb today.

532
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,460
It’s not like you.

533
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,810
Nothing.

534
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,530
Maybe it’s too pleasing to live here.

535
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,710
I get idle and lazy.

536
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,940
It’s indeed a good place

537
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,850
