<i>Episode 25</i>

17
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,870
Bonehead.

18
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
No! No! No! Don’t cry!

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
Be quite.

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,650
Other Demons might find us.

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,550
What are you here for?

22
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,590
When I was in town,

23
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,680
I saw Yu Wenzhi’s private army.

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,000
He is a man of noble blood.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,080
Why is his heavy army stationed
at Chunhui Town?

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,910
There is certainly something fishy
about this.

27
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,830
I was worried,

28
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,690
so I came back to take a look.

29
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,370
Who are you worried about?

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,270
None of your business.

31
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,260
It’s definitely not you.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,550
Bonehead.

33
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,240
I’ve never thought that

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,020
I would be so happy to see you.

35
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,620
Don’t try to be smart.

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,390
I’ll leave you alone now.

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,270
Where are you going?

38
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,550
Wait for me.

39
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,000
Why did you leave the Fortress?

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,320
The Demons are plotting against

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,880
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
with Yu Wenzhi.

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,540
My brother asked me to deliver a letter
to look for help in the town.

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
Fine, I’ll go with you.

44
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,390
I’m not afraid of death.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,690
Me neither.

46
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,520
Heaven bless us!

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,030
-Let’s just take them with us.
-Just die together.

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,390
Sister.

49
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,080
Haven’t you just said that
it’s dangerous out there?

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,320
Don’t go out.

51
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
I’m here to protect everyone.

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,870
You’ll be safer inside.

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,730
Young man,

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,960
it’s your responsibility

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,720
to protect everyone here.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
I need to go out to
find some information.

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,670
I’ll be back soon.

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,030
When you grow up,

59
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,670
you can become a real man.

60
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,160
Then, you can protect the nation.

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,030
Okay?

62
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,700
Okay.

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,870
This is how we’re supposed to be.

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,270
We must not let the youngsters beat us.

65
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,300
Slow down.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,360
Bonehead.

67
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
This is not working.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,160
How about this?

69
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,440
That is the road to Chunhui Town.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
You can go find Fei.

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,050
I’ll deliver the letter
to our secret service myself.

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,830
No!

73
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,880
How can you go there on your own?

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,750
I must go with you!

75
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,240
No way!

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,630
You’re a strong fighter.

77
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,750
You’re not afraid to die, too.

78
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,550
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

79
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,240
needs a man like you right now.

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,960
But...

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,470
But what?

82
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,880
My martial art is not as good as Fei’s.

83
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,590
But delivering a letter is an easy task.

84
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,500
No! No!

85
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,800
The Demons have their pawns everywhere.

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,550
What can you do

87
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,600
if they’re after you?

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,160
Besides...

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,190
Bonehead,

90
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,910
this is not the time to worry about me.

91
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,620
Who’s worrying about you?

92
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,350
I’m concerned only because

93
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,510
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
will be upset with me

94
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,240
if you get hurt.

95
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,710
Right.

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,790
That’s it.

97
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,160
Cut it out.

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,480
You’re the master of Cloud Ravine.

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,270
Why can’t you act like one?

100
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,840
Go.

101
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
Yang Jin.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,530
Be careful!

103
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,760
Anybody inside?

104
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,540
You know what you should do, right?

105
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,450
Talk sense.

106
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,550
Go. Open the door.

107
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,650
Who’re you looking for?

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,620
Sir,

109
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,360
why isn’t there anyone outside?

110
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,060
Who’re you?

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,290
I don’t know you.

112
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,620
I’m from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

113
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,090
I’m here to ask for your help.

114
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,450
This letter.

115
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,220
You must give it to
Lord Gantang, Zhou Yitang.

116
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,940
Tell him that

117
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,750
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is under the siege of the Demons.

118
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,010
You’re talking to the wrong person.

119
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,850
I don’t know anyone from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

120
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,680
Sir, please help me.

121
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,340
Young lady,

122
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,660
where are you going?

123
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,060
What do you want?

124
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,130
We’ve been hiding around here for days.

125
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,100
We’ve found this place suspicious
early on.

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
You’re unfortunate
that we catch you today.

127
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,820
So, you’re the secret spy

128
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,250
sent from the Fortress.

129
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,380
You’re here to deliver this letter.

130
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,410
Why is this all blank?

131
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,980
What’s your trick?

132
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,060
Go.

133
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,250
Go now!

134
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,130
May you have all five luck in the world.

135
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,290
May I inquire

136
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,820
What color is the bat?

137
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,410
Actually, I’m not with the Route Gang.

138
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,060
I have an urgent matter.
I need to talk to Chief Xu.

139
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,130
My brother and Fei

140
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,540
must have sent me to deliver this letter

141
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
because they wanted to protect me.

142
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,060
I need to find help.

143
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,690
Report!

144
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,500
We’ve searched everywhere.

145
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,690
But we couldn’t find Li Sheng.

146
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,730
How’s that possible?

147
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,690
We must still be able to

148
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,450
distinguish his remains.

149
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,690
Maybe he has fallen into Ximo River.

150
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,970
What?

151
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,500
Sheng sacrificed himself to protect us,

152
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
to keep away the Demons.

153
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,820
How are we supposed to tell Leader

154
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,500
if we can’t even find his body?

155
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,310
Chuchu,

156
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,510
wait for me.

157
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,850
Those animals!

158
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,690
One day,

159
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,840
I’ll kill them all.

160
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Commander, something went wrong.

161
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,380
Our spy at Fortress of the Forty-Eight

162
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,130
told us that

163
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,410
they have already sent out people to

164
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,050
ask Zhou Yitang for help.

165
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,180
Their reinforcements will arrive

166
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,830
very soon.

167
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,610
How can someone
leave the mountain successfully?

168
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,690
Lord Shen has the fortress surrounded.

169
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,250
Those from Fortress of the Forty-Eight

170
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,690
can’t get away from the main road.

171
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,050
Spinning Wire Formation of Ximo River
has their rear protected.

172
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,370
I suppose they won’t dare to

173
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,610
close the formation.

174
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,340
If those cunning bastards
don’t come out soon,

175
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,930
we have to fight our way in.

176
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,460
But Yu Wenzhi’s defense is impenetrable.

177
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,720
He has his private army
and Mingfeng Building.

178
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,050
We do not stand a chance

179
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,560
if we choose to fight our way in.

180
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,810
Xie Meimei,

181
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,180
you said that Yu Wenzhi
is prone to suspicion.

182
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,690
Spinning Wire Formation failed
last time.

183
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,340
It must have compromised
his faith in Kou Dan.

184
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,300
I’ve heard that there’s a secret path

185
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,400
behind Ximo River going downhill.

186
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,130
Why didn’t you tell us earlier?

187
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,660
It’s just hearsay.

188
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,690
I don’t know if it’s true or not.

189
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,220
Chief Kou,

190
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,730
you’ve been hiding important information
again and again.

191
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,930
What are you plotting?

192
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,610
Fine, Commander.

193
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,340
This is not the time to
fight against one of our own.

194
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,370
Lord is under the siege in the mountain.

195
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,780
Reinforcements from Zhou Yitang
might come at any time.

196
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,810
I think

197
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,810
if that happens, we’ll be screwed.

198
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,900
The most urgent matter right now

199
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,160
is to send out your help immediately.

200
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,800
People are most off guard at night.

201
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,900
We’ll strike then.

202
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,130
I’ll send people to help Lord Shen

203
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,830
right away.

204
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,580
Is there any news about Zhou Fei?

205
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,340
We’ve lost track of them

206
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,080
ever since they rescued the people
at the ancestral hall.

207
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,850
This is not right.

208
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,440
This is not right, everyone.

209
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,630
It’s not safe for me

210
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,510
to stay here anymore.

211
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,980
Ms. Kou,

212
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,300
we’re fooled.

213
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,250
Kou Dan.

214
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,980
It’s indeed you.

215
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,830
Leader,

216
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,050
what are you here for?

217
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,810
General Wen,

218
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,750
I’m here to talk with Yitang.

219
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,690
That’s very unlucky.

220
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,490
Lord Gantang left for
North camp yesterday.

221
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,050
You’ve been really busy recently.

222
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,010
How’s everything going in the camps?

223
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,740
The pressure is
from both inside and outside.

224
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,980
I first met Gu Tianxian

225
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,490
at Hengyang.

226
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,440
Now the enemies in the North
are getting restless.

227
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,450
If you need help, I can arrange someone

228
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,300
to deliver the letter
to Lord Gantang for you.

229
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,370
Leader,

230
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,900
take some rest in the camp.

231
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,970
No need.

232
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Since the Demons have arrived
at Hengyang,

233
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,920
they’re not far from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

234
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,740
Safety comes first. I’ll go back now.

235
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,980
General Wen, goodbye.

236
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,090
Leader, take care.

237
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,930
Where has Yu Wenzhi been?

238
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,860
Don’t worry.

239
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,350
His disguise will crack soon.

240
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
What are you drawing?

241
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,740
Can’t you speak?

242
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,340
If you’ve successfully
sowed discord among them,

243
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,690
with Yu Wenzhi’s suspicious nature,

244
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,900
he will replace his current guards

245
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,740
who’re from Mingfeng Building

246
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,350
with his private soldiers
for the sake of safety.

247
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,420
You mean...

248
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,220
Yu Wenzhi will be at the place
where the Mingfeng guards

249
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,900
have been replaced.

250
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,930
Smart.

251
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,300
If he has replaced those guards

252
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,220
from Mingfeng Building,

253
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,490
our chance of capturing him

254
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,780
will be higher.

255
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,570
Ms. Kou.

256
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,540
It’s time for the shift.

257
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,900
Lord.

258
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,450
There are so many of them.

259
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,930
I’ll create some distractions
to cover you.

260
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,250
Don’t go! It’s too dangerous.

261
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,280
Take care of yourself.

262
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,340
Go after him.

263
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,050
Yes.

264
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:46,420
<i>Li’s Mansion</i>

265
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,940
<i>Li’s Mansion</i>

266
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,500
<i>Li’s Mansion</i>

267
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,780
Lady, may you have all five luck.

268
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,860
This is Route Gang’s Five-bat Token.

269
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,340
Take it with you when you travel.

270
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,300
Route Gang will take care of
everything for you,

271
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,930
from accommodation
to transportation.

272
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,250
My name is Huang Zifu.

273
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,860
I’ve been working undercover here
for a long time.

274
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,980
Chief Xu has given me the secret order

275
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,540
to stay at Yu Wenzhi’s place

276
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,860
and wait for you.

277
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,010
Chief Xu is also at Chunhui Town?

278
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,780
How did he know that
I’m looking for Yu Wenzhi?

279
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,060
I don’t know about that.

280
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,850
Thank you.

281
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,090
Second chief,

282
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,700
Commander-in-chief asked me to

283
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,330
give Lord Shen this present.

284
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,130
Report.

285
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,460
Yu Wenzhi’s private army has arrived.

286
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,540
We can have full control of them.

287
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,700
They come right in time.

288
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
According to our secret spies
in the town,

289
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,330
Kou Dan said that

290
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,000
there’s a secret path
leading into the Fortress.

291
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,730
Hou Zuo. Hou You.

292
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

293
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,250
Arrange a small team to find the path.

294
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,130
Surround their back.

295
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,130
-Yes.
-Yes.

296
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,940
Team number two.

297
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,850
Search the back.

298
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,540
Let’s surround them.

299
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,460
Report!

300
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,420
Report!

301
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,580
Yu Wenzhi’s private army is attacking.

302
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,580
They’re trying to take down the fortress
with Shen Tianshu.

303
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,780
That’s bad!

304
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,210
A lot of Demons have gathered
at the back.

305
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,130
We don’t know what they want.

306
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,330
If this keeps going,

307
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,300
we can’t guard the fortress.

308
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,820
Nonsense!

309
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,250
Whether they’re
plotting something or not,

310
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,700
I just don’t believe that

311
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,580
they can take down
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

312
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,540
with us, Qianzhong Sect, guarding it.

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,180
Everyone, listen up.

314
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,460
Everyone who can still move

315
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
must come with me.

316
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
We must fight them till our last breath.

317
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:45,940
Yes.

318
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,490
Let’s go!

319
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,460
Wait.

320
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,180
I’ll go with you.

321
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,300
Zhao.

322
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,610
Don’t go.

323
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,250
Just guard here.

324
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,540
You must take control of the situation.

325
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
Zhang.

326
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,010
The fortress is about to fall.

327
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,540
There’s no sense in
my giving command here.

328
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,010
What we can do now

329
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,420
is just take our chance.

330
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,330
Fine.

331
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,970
Let’s put our life and death behind.

332
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,330
Let’s fight them.

333
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,090
Zhang.

334
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,370
I’ll leave you to
defend the fortress gate.

335
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,970
I’ll inform Ma Jili to

336
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,420
take the rest of our people

337
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,730
to fight the Demons
at the back of the mountain.

338
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,300
We’ll catch them unguarded.

339
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,180
Great. That’s the way.

340
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,060
Zhang.

341
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,780
If...

342
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,610
If we can’t guard the fortress gate,

343
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,180
do as we’ve planned.

344
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,060
Shoot two whistling arrows in a row.

345
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,660
Inform Zhou Fei and the rest

346
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,850
to abandon the fortress
and flee for their life.

347
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,540
Sure.

348
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,540
Commander-in-chief, report.

349
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,780
Words came from the mountain.

350
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,660
Although the enemies
have burned Feihong Bridge yesterday,

351
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,180
their leader has been captured.

352
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,900
Lord Shen has arrived at the gate

353
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,730
and arranged the formation today.

354
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,730
This fortress

355
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,540
will definitely fall.

356
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,940
I don’t care about
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

357
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,460
at all.

358
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,300
I only want to revive Mingfeng Building

359
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,730
right now.

360
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,940
I hope you can really be so carefree.

361
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,900
-Catch him.
-Hurry.

362
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,850
Stop there.

363
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,840
Who are you?

364
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,300
I’m just a nobody.

365
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,700
Nobody?

366
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
Since when does a nobody

367
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,300
have such great footwork?

368
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,850
It’s just a small trick.

369
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,090
There’s nothing to brag about this.

370
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,460
Come.

371
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,330
Assassin. Catch him!

372
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,730
Lord Gu hasn’t returned till now.

373
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,060
Did anything happen to him?

374
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,940
There’s nothing to worry about that.

375
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,060
Have you finished replacing the guards?

376
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,780
Replacing the strong fighters
from Mingfeng Building

377
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,010
might not be a smart decision.

378
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,490
Really?

379
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,300
But I’ve just received words that

380
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,660
a secret man practicing
Mingfeng’s martial art

381
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,460
tried to catch me.

382
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,880
You have my utmost loyalty.

383
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Even if I believe you,

384
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,970
can I trust every one of your pawns?

385
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,210
Report!

386
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,090
We’ve found an assassin nearby.

387
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,130
How did they find this place?

388
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,490
I’ll arrange reinforcement

389
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,850
to protect your safety.

390
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,700
So, you’re Zhou Fei
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

391
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,090
I’ve heard your name for long.

392
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,700
I expected you to be savage.

393
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,180
But you’re quite pretty.

394
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,250
Surrender yourself today.

395
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,130
The martial art of Giant Leopard

396
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,370
certainly lives up to its name.

397
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,090
I really admire you.

398
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,660
Go after him!

399
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,940
Catch him!

400
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,300
Giant Leopard,

401
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,210
this has been such a long pursuit.

402
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,460
You’ve done a great job.

403
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,250
Stop there.

404
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
He’s fooled us.

405
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,540
Let’s go back to commander-in-chief.

406
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,460
Let’s go.

407
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,210
Go.

408
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,370
You’re not from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

409
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,210
Who are you?

410
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,180
Tell me your name.

411
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,210
Tell you my name?

412
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,180
You don’t deserve to know my name.

413
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,300
You, a bunch of lowlifes.

414
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,360
How dare you act against
a man of noble blood?

415
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,090
No one can get out of
this yard today.

416
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,700
Yang Jin, why are you here?

417
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,370
I met Li Yan on the way.

418
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,330
She told me that
you’re coming to catch Yu Wenzhi.

419
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,060
She cried and begged for me to help you.

420
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,180
She’s so annoying.

421
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,330
I can’t go against her will.

422
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:23,940
Look.

423
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,180
I’ve brought help with me.

424
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,490
Miss Zhou,

425
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,820
I haven’t seen you for a while.

426
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,300
Thank you, Kou Dan.

427
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,780
You can leave the rest to us.

428
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,780
It’s really you?

429
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,820
Commander-in-chief.

430
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,420
This is her trick.

431
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,490
This place is not safe.

432
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,940
Come with me.

433
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,900
Let go of me.

434
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,420
How dare you betray me?

435
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,850
Commander, listen to me.

436
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,540
Back away.

437
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,250
Protect Commander.

438
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,730
Someone!

439
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,820
It seems that I’m faster than you again.

440
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,820
Girl.

441
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
You’re very brave.

442
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,970
I’m not brave,

443
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,540
nor am I a kungfu master.

444
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,330
My success today is

445
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,660
attributable to Kou Dan.

446
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,540
You’re so cunning.

447
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,540
This trick has sowed discord
that I can’t repair.

448
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,060
I didn’t expect that
I’d be defeated by you today.

449
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,090
It seems that you’re even smarter
than Leader.

450
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,010
I’m flattered.

451
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,180
You.

452
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,460
Will you retreat your army or die?

453
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,700
Girl, do you really believe

454
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,210
you can walk out in one piece today?

455
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,300
-Commander-in-chief.
-Commander-in-chief.

456
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,730
Yu Wenzhi.

457
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,460
You’d better behave yourself.

458
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,420
I might accidentally cut you.

459
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Don’t say anything

460
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,780
other than answering my questions.

461
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,610
Don’t make any unnecessary moves.

462
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,660
If you hurt Commander,
even a little bit,

463
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,250
all the army will attack, and everyone
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight

464
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,730
will die a horrible death,
whether you believe it or not.

465
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,090
I surely believe it.

466
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,180
What else are you here for?

467
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,420
Aren’t we already
in the middle of your attack?

468
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,010
-Or are we having a feast?
-You...

469
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,370
Can we really survive

470
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,060
if Yu Wenzhi is not harmed?

471
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,180
A horrible death?

472
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,460
That’s just irrelevant right now.

473
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,970
Let me ask you again.

474
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,180
Will you retreat your army or die?

475
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,490
This South Blade is indeed
a good knife.

476
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,060
But you don’t seem to be a good person.

477
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,630
I didn’t expect that during my stay
at Chunhui Town,

478
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,060
the thing that impressed me most...

479
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,970
Back off.

480
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,870
Back off!

481
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,570
Thanks.

482
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,580
Weed Spirit.

483
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,780
Nice job.

484
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,580
It’s indeed him.

485
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,970
Hold it.

486
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,660
Hold it.

487
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,060
Prepare the arrows. Hurry.

488
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,300
-Yes.
-Yes.

489
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,970
The shield.

490
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,610
Shen Tianshu.

491
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,850
Bastard.

492
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,130
We haven’t seen each other for years.

493
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,540
Your look still disgusts me.

494
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,700
Chief Zhang,

495
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,420
your temper hasn’t changed a bit either.

496
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,820
Great.

497
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,660
Now that you’re here,

498
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,850
let’s fight until death.

499
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,330
Shoot! Kill him!

500
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,250
Chief, are you all right?

501
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,820
Don’t mind me.

502
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,970
Take the injured to get treated.

503
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,090
Okay.

504
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,490
Come.

505
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,060
Come if you’re not afraid of death.

506
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,130
Come.

507
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,460
Hurry.

508
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,010
Hurry.

509
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,610
Chief Zhang. Chief Zhang.

510
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,850
-Why are you here?
-Chief Zhang.

511
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,210
What’s going on at the back?

512
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,370
Shen Tianshu somehow knew

513
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,970
there’s a path at the back.

514
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,060
We’re losing the ground there too.

515
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,540
Where’s Zhao?

516
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,460
Why hasn’t he come back with you?

517
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,370
Chief Zhao

518
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,420
has been severely injured.

519
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,210
Hyah.

520
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,580
Hyah.

521
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,540
Aunt. Aunt.

522
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,210
Aunt.

523
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,540
Yan, why are you here?

524
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,460
Things went sideways
at Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

525
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,370
Mingfeng Building has turned against us.

526
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,060
The Demons have invaded

527
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,460
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

528
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,580
Let’s go.

529
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,850
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

530
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,900
This way.

531
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,850
Don’t mind me.

532
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,330
Mr. Ma.

533
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,540
Miss Chuchu,

534
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,780
why are you here?

535
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,460
Go back.

536
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,330
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
might fall at any time.

537
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,330
I’ll fight with you.

538
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,700
This is dangerous, Miss Chuchu.

539
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,820
Yes.

540
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,180
You’re hurt.

541
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,850
Let me take care of you first.

542
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,400
It will hurt a bit.

543
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,970
Stay here, Miss Chuchu…

544
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,210
Crap.

545
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,900
Come. Let’s take them with us.

546
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,660
Tear Fortress of the Forty-Eight down.

547
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,770
Yes.

548
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,290
What happened?

549
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,220
Lord.

550
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,610
This is the horn for a truce.

551
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,700
Truce?

552
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,770
Report!

553
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,060
Report!

554
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,940
Lord.

555
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,810
Commander-in-chief ordered us

556
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,220
to retreat immediately.

557
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,050
Why?

558
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,560
Because he had been held hostage by
people from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

559
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,420
Retreat. Retreat.

560
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,020
Great! Great! Great!

561
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,660
Retreat.

562
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,930
Ma.

563
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,810
What is this bastard

564
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,820
Shen Tianshu doing?

565
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,130
Chief.

566
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,290
Is that Fei?

567
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:00,960
Where?

568
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,980
Set up the formation.

569
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,770
-That’s Fei.
-Zhou Fei’s back.

570
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,370
That’s Fei.

571
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,940
Hurry.

572
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,050
So, you’re Shen Tianshu.

573
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,460
When I was in the dungeon,

574
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,940
I should have fed the cake

575
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,660
to the dog.

576
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,850
Kid,

577
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,500
you’re so disrespectful.

578
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,220
Fei,

579
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,880
I’ve retreated as you wish.

580
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,510
When will you release
Commander-in-chief?

581
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,260
I’ll release him, but not now.

582
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,610
Why should we trust you?

583
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,340
You have no other choices.

584
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,390
If you want us to perish together,

585
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,200
I won’t complain.

586
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,220
Wait.

587
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,130
The others can leave now.

588
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,420
But Kou Dan has betrayed

589
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,810
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

590
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,660
She has turned against
her masters and ancestors.

591
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,730
She has abandoned her humanity.

592
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,800
Kou Dan must stay.

593
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,760
Betrayed my master?

594
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,940
The reason I’m like this now

595
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,420
is all because of the old loser.

596
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,770
She trapped me here
in this shitty place,

597
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,370
being isolated from the world.

598
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,570
Who have I really betrayed?

599
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,980
Ma Jili,

600
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,770
don’t forget my advice to you.

601
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,370
Chief Kou.

602
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,090
My disciples

603
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,980
told me when they returned
from the town,

604
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,850
they heard that Fei

605
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,130
has gotten herself in a lot of troubles.

606
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,290
You must remind her not to
mess around with the government.

607
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,700
I’m responsible for taking care of her.

608
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,980
I’ll definitely keep her safe.

609
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,610
You watched Fei and those kids

610
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,770
grow up.

611
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,660
If the government is onto them,

612
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,770
the whole fortress will be screwed.

613
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,420
That’s your fault then.

614
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,180
I know.

615
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,750
Go.

616
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,260
Fei has made up her mind to kill.

617
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,130
Ma Jili, do it.

618
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,260
Fei.

619
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,290
Actually,

620
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,220
I can get you out of here.

621
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,130
No,

622
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,700
I must not flee from

623
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,790
my own battlefield.

624
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,290
This item is more valuable than my life.

625
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,940
This item is about a promise
worthy of my life.

626
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,500
Give it to Chuchu for me.

627
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,090
Find someone trustworthy
to take care of this for her.

628
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,940
This is the key
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

629
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,700
This might be the most important key.

630
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,610
You know that

631
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,460
I’ve been investigating
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

632
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,810
I know.

633
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,980
So I trust this one with you.

634
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,220
I need to use the other one

635
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,840
to stop them.

636
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,220
Ma Jili,

637
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,660
you said that Kou Dan is the traitor.

638
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,500
But what are you doing yourself?

639
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,660
Why did you do this?

640
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,020
Yu Wenzhi has royal blood in him.

641
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,050
If you kill him,

642
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,090
You’ll bring destruction to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

643
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,220
As a noble,

644
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,420
Yu Wenzhi harms the civilians wantonly,

645
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,900
and commits all sorts of wickedness.

646
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,530
What’s wrong if I kill him?

647
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,940
Fighters like us

648
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,500
rid the world of evilness,

649
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,220
save people from misery,

650
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,610
and bring righteousness to the world.

651
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,130
We don’t seek immortal fame.

652
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,610
We aren’t afraid of being misunderstood.

653
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,850
But we must not go
against the law of heaven,

654
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,500
the law of earth,

655
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,740
nor our own conscience.

656
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,420
That’s the motto of
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

657
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,520
We’re not taught to be cowards.

658
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,460
I’m sorry.

659
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,010
I was being silly.

660
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,370
Cut the nonsense, Ma Jili.

661
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,330
How can I defeat Zhou Fei
if I don’t lie to you?

662
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,020
Kou Dan.

663
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,250
I’ll kill you.

664
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,570
You shameless traitor.

665
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,330
All the traitors of
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

666
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,180
will be killed by me today.

667
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
You’re no exception.

668
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,940
If I don’t kill you,

669
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,370
I can’t live with my conscience.

670
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,460
Fighters like us

671
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,940
rid the world of evilness,

672
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,920
save people from misery...

673
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,900
Fei.

674
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,290
Are you slacking off again?

675
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,420
Don’t even try to.

676
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,900
You must be diligent.

677
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,220
To be a righteous person,

678
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,090
you must live up to your conscience.

679
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,220
Fei.

680
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,060
I’m sorry.
