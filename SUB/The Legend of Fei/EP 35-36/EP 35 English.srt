<i>Legend of Fei</i>

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,940
<i>Episode 35</i>

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,400
Do you remember

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
the first time we met?

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,310
You were the chief of Anping Army.

21
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,440
I was a disciple expelled
by Big Medicine Valley.

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,680
Master thought

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,360
I was good at poison,

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,120
not medicine.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,230
I was too evil

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,630
to have Book of Almighty Medicine

27
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,360
and be the head of the Valley.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,480
I got in a rage and defected.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,590
It’s you who took me in.

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,680
Instead of learning to heal the weak,

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,830
it’s better

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,750
to make yourself stronger.

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,080
You want me to get you
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,030
as a weapon

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,270
to pacify the world.

37
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,550
I believe

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,800
you’ll become the ruler of the world.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,110
Things have changed.

40
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,470
I’m no longer the chief of Anping Army.

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,960
We haven’t got

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,800
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

43
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,750
What happened, Shen?

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,880
I underestimated these young people.

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,800
Tong Tianyang. Chu Tianyu. Lu Tiankuang.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,830
They were all defeated by some kids

47
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,390
with Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,470
Tianying.

49
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,360
They don’t even know

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,030
what the Color of Ocean and Heaven

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,440
is.

52
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,470
Their victory

53
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,550
is nothing but fluke.

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,270
Sooner or later,

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,470
I will get back

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,190
what they have taken from us.

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,470
What’s your plan?

58
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,720
Zhou Fei has got Fire Lotus.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,910
Her next target

60
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,720
should be the Flaming Sage

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
at Cloud Ravine in the south,

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,360
to resist the poison
in Xiao Chuan’s system.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,750
I’m going to kill her

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,700
and get back the Seal of Cautiousness.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,620
May you come back soon.

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,270
Don’t go astray.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,470
<i>Demons Manor</i>

68
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,160
I was an orphan in the snow mountain,

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,110
living with beasts and
suffering from hunger.

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,750
You saved me

71
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,440
and gave me a new life.

72
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,160
I only

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,630
trust you.

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,720
I have

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,670
a task for you.

76
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,750
Badly, I was still late.

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,910
Liu Youliang who escorted the map

78
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,910
failed to keep the secret.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,240
I had a deal with Phoenix Master.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,880
He helped me get Fire Lotus.

81
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,030
I must

82
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,360
give him the Seal of Cautiousness.

83
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,350
They are all after
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

84
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,070
What is it exactly?

85
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,880
Master.

86
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,390
Do you know it?

87
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,160
Well...

88
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,070
Anzhi is supposed to tell you.

89
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,440
If you are eager to know,

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,270
go ask your father,

91
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,790
Lord Gantang.

92
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,440
My father?

93
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,720
Go to see him

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
and he’ll tell you everything.

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Why don’t you see Anzhi before leaving?

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,070
I...

97
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,110
I won’t.

98
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,320
I’m afraid I can’t leave

99
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,480
if I see him.

100
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,070
Lord Gantang.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,950
Thanks.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,040
Is it from Madam Li?

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,200
Can you tell by a touch?

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,510
I know from this.

105
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,550
Sir. A girl is asking to see you.

106
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,440
She gave me this.

107
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,000
Guards thought it was a prank.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,920
So, they didn’t dare to disturb you.

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,670
I’ve checked it.

110
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,000
I think you may have a look.

111
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,790
Who is so bold?

112
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,950
It’s fine.

113
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,510
Let her in.

114
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,320
Yes.

115
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,550
Alright. You’re free to go.

116
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,270
Yes.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,270
Lord Gantang is in the camp ahead.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,880
Please.

119
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
He’s inside.

120
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,660
Fei.

121
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,270
Father.

122
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,830
Fei.

123
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,920
You look taller, don’t you?

124
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,760
Father, it’s been a while.

125
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,070
Fei.

126
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,950
I didn’t take you with me when I left.

127
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you blame me now?

128
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,670
I know.

129
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,320
My girl is tough.

130
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,160
Tell me.

131
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,670
Where have you been all this time?

132
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,070
Well... A long story.

133
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,760
Let’s talk inside.

134
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,270
Are you all right?

135
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,720
I’m fine.

136
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,550
It’s been windy.

137
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,670
You look thin.

138
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,760
It’s understandable.

139
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,880
In the Fortress,

140
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,000
your mother used to

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,510
go hunting and pick flesh vegetables

142
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,110
for me.

143
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,600
But I got nothing here.

144
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
You still wear this old gown she made?

145
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,230
It’s not old.

146
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,550
The clothes she made are
the best to keep warm.

147
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,150
Is this

148
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,960
the highly praised Anping Army?

149
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,350
In troubled times, there must be someone
standing out.

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Suddenly, I can understand him,

151
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,400
and my mother,

152
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,640
and Xie Yun.

153
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,200
Come. I have a gift for you.

154
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,230
Father.

155
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,880
Is it a welcome gift?

156
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,200
You’re humorous.

157
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,880
Take a look.

158
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,780
<i>Unbreakable</i>

159
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,030
It’s named Unbreakable.

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Is it some poison?

161
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,280
Top poisons are colorless and tasteless.

162
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,320
I’m telling you out of kindness.

163
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,150
Try it.

164
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,280
No.

165
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,670
I won’t.

166
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,030
Why don’t you try it?

167
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,320
If I try,

168
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,840
who will record

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,470
the symptoms and reactions?

170
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,400
Look. I’ve made the antidote for you.

171
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,320
What do you fear of?

172
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,470
Your last poison got me in bed for days.

173
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,080
I won’t do it again.

174
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,960
You asked me to study Bone-chilling.

175
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Is it Bone-chilling?

176
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,880
Bone-chilling is extremely complicated
to prepare.

177
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
The formula is long gone.

178
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,230
The toxicity of this poison

179
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,960
is not even one tenth of Bone-chilling.

180
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,350
Drink it and have the antidote at once.

181
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,200
Nothing will happen.

182
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,520
Why don’t you get Li Yan to try it?

183
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Are you talking about me?

184
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,030
-No, nothing.
-No, nothing.

185
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,320
We... We have new clothes for you.

186
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,200
You said you’d buy new clothes.

187
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,230
So, he wants you to try them.

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,880
That doesn’t matter.

189
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,030
Look, a letter from Fei.

190
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,550
She is safe and sound.

191
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,080
Isn’t Xie Yun dead?

192
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,350
Fei also said

193
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,550
Xie’s master had got the formula.

194
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,200
Fei is

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,590
looking for the ingredients.

196
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,840
Let me see.

197
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
Fire Lotus. Flaming Sage.

198
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
Flaming Sage?

199
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,200
The name rings a bell.

200
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,230
It only grows in Cloud Ravine.

201
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,880
Sir, have you ever heard of it?

202
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,030
You bonehead.

203
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,280
Why did they get you as the leader?

204
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,110
What else did she say?

205
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,590
Would she go to Cloud Ravine?

206
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Father, don’t worry about me.

207
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,150
Ordinary martial artists

208
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,520
are no match to me.

209
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
I’ve also fought Demons more than once.

210
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,760
It’s so kind of you, Father.

211
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,200
You know I need a blade.

212
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,640
Actually,

213
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,790
I’ve been looking for a good blade
for you.

214
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,110
The world has been in chaos.

215
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,840
Good blades are

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,350
getting less.

217
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,230
I also had men find ancient blades,

218
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,400
yet few of them fit you.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,110
Some of the ancient blades

220
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,880
are mediocre in quality.

221
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,150
Some of them are

222
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,550
subject to ominous tales.

223
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,440
Finally, I got this blade.

224
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,790
It’s perfect for you.

225
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,840
Lyu Run,

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
the maker of the blade, is not famous.

227
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,790
This is

228
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,520
the one and only blade he forged.

229
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,000
His name rings a bell.

230
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,520
He’s said to be
the last apprentice of Guigu,

231
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,790
adept at art of war, medicine
and martial arts,

232
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,640
a household name in the former dynasty.

233
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,670
Lyu Run passed his learning

234
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,550
to three apprentices.

235
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,760
One of them set up Big Medicine Valley.

236
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,230
Another set up Qi School.

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,400
The youngest learned the art of war

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,150
and became an officer.

239
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,550
Huang Shenbian is his disciple.

240
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,080
Huang Shenbian?

241
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,230
I think of it.

242
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,670
Lyu Run, the Book of Almighty Medicine

243
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,110
of the Big Medicine Valley.

244
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,910
Exactly, that’s his work.

245
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,550
Is he Huang Shenbian’s grandmaster?

246
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,590
Father, what does he have to do

247
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,440
with the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

248
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,880
You know the secret about it,

249
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
right?

250
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,520
Fei, how many objects of it

251
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,840
have you seen?

252
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,840
If

253
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,230
the ripple pattern means
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

254
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,440
I’ve seen

255
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,230
the gold bracelet of the Fortress,

256
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,350
the scabbard of
Yin Pei’s Mountain Sword,

257
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,990
Wu Chuchu’s Longevity Lock,

258
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,350
Old Master Huo’s Seal of Cautiousness.

259
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,440
So, you are one step closer

260
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,320
to open the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

261
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,030
I’m just wondering

262
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,880
what that item is.

263
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,550
Its name has been haunting me.

264
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,030
It got

265
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,550
so many people around me in danger.

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
My uncle. Chenfei.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Master Ji.

268
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,250
And Xie Yun.

269
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,250
Fei.

270
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,400
Is Xie Yun the friend you mentioned?

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,350
Listen.

272
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,280
Actually,

273
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,670
it’s haunting him,

274
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,580
not you.

275
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,670
How is he?

276
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,400
He’s fine for now.

277
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,090
The chill has got into bones.

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
His organs are nearly frozen.

279
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,200
He...

280
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,000
Don’t worry.

281
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,640
He wakes up from time to time.

282
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,400
He won’t be disturbed

283
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,880
however loud we speak.

284
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,520
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

285
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,480
What are you laughing at?

286
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,230
After he gets recovered,

287
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,000
will he sneak out

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,960
and make troubles again?

289
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,200
He’s young and reckless.

290
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,280
He wouldn’t stay on this isolated island

291
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,210
with a bunch of old men,

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,470
would he?

293
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,030
Generally, kids will come home

294
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,710
once they run out of money.

295
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,030
But he still traveled around

296
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,280
even penniless.

297
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,670
Born with a silver spoon in his mouth,

298
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,470
he has no idea about money.

299
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,530
It’s not a bad thing.

300
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,690
Without suffering,

301
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,640
how can he understand the pain in life?

302
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,070
You have a point.

303
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,640
Sir, would you like some wonton?

304
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
Cloth.

305
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,950
Take a seat, please.

306
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,520
I took lots of money with me.

307
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,310
It’s running out again.

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,560
So much?

309
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,520
Thank you! Thank you!

310
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,160
What can I buy with these?

311
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,310
A bottle of wine and a portion of meat.

312
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,280
Fine. A bottle of wine and
a portion of meat.

313
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,640
Yes, sir.

314
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,230
I’ve run out of money.

315
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,230
What to do in the future?

316
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,950
Pastries.

317
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,070
Take a look.

318
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,470
Flowers. Have a look.

319
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,640
Flowers!

320
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,110
Well.

321
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,190
What happened to that prostitute?

322
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,350
Did she marry that noble?

323
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,230
Yes,

324
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,880
they married

325
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,190
and lived a happy life ever after.

326
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,830
What the heck is that?

327
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,070
How can they get married?

328
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,160
Ridiculous.

329
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,470
Give me some money, please.

330
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,160
Give me some money, please.

331
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,310
You listened to my story

332
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,000
and didn’t pay?

333
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,070
Ridiculous.

334
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,450
Sir.

335
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,950
Your story is too boring.

336
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,920
Can you tell stories?

337
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,000
Listen.

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,110
The noble in your story

339
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,310
is a playboy.

340
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,950
How would he change himself

341
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,710
for a prostitute?

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,190
That prostitute

343
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,110
could finally marry to a noble,

344
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,430
and thought she’d live better.

345
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,760
Unexpectedly,

346
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,760
that noble didn’t cherish her.

347
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,830
She was dumped,

348
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,800
and died of depression.

too pathetic?

351

At this time,

She did come here.

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,710
She got you the medicine

439
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,400
and left with the Seal of Cautiousness.

440
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,590
She knew nothing

441
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,190
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

442
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,160
Why did she take the Seal?

443
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,520
Anzhi.

444
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,310

Liu Youliang reappeared.

That’s not my concern for now.

451
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,400
Master.

452
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,800
Can I keep awake

453
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,640
until Fei comes back?

454
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,800
In the rebellion

455
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,110
twenty-five years ago,

456
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,560
to preserve the strength of our dynasty,

457
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,400
Huang Shenbian got most treasures

458
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,040
out of the palace

459
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,800
with several guardians.

460
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,590
They were hid near Big Medicine Valley.

461
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,350
Those treasures

462
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,640
are the so-called
Color of Ocean and Heaven.

463
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,400
How did you know it, Father?

464
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,800
Wang Lin,

465
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,230
Huang Shenbian’s lieutenant,

466
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,470
was in charge of Anping Army.

467
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,430
At the mutiny,

468
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,400
he was out for a mission
and didn’t participate in it.

469
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,710
So, he didn’t know about it.

470
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,430
Then Huang Shenbian died.

471
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,830
The secret

472
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,400
was somehow leaked out.

473
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,680
That’s why Yin Wenlan got killed,

474
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,430
Big Medicine Valley destroyed.

475
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,190
Wang Lin tried to find the treasures
all his life

476
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,310
to restore the dynasty,

477
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,710
but he had no clue

478
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,160
about the location.

479
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,710
As the lieutenant,

480
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,160
even Wang Lin didn’t know all the clues.

481
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,310
How could Demons

482
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,190
know it more than him?

483
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,880
Because Shen Tianshu

484
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,040
ever served in Anping Army.

485
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,760
Now,

486
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,400
people all know it.

487
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,000
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

488
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,710
is no longer a secret.

489
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,680
Father.

490
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,560
What is it exactly?

491
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,350
Could it really change the world

492
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,880
as they say?

493
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,680
Do you really believe there is something

494
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,830
that can bring back the dead?

495
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,430
I don’t know

496
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,160
what it is.

497
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,710
And I think

498
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,400
no one knows.

499
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,560
But I believe

500
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,190
nothing can change the fate.

501
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,230
Or else,

502
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,830
how could our dynasty fall apart

503
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,920
in an instant?

504
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,560
It’s the greed that drives people

505
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,160
to look for it.

506
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,520
I get to understand

507
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,470
why Xie Yun refused to talk about it.

508
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,520
Some things

509
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,430
are destined.

510
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,560
He is unable to avoid them.

511
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,520
Alright. Father.

512
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,680
I’ve known about it.

513
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,710
I will save Xie Yun.

514
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,560
After he wakes up,

515
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,110
I will help him

516
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,950
whatever he wants to do.

517
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,640
Slowly.

518
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
What are you doing?

519
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,590
I want to draw.

520
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
Draw what?

521
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,190
I’ll draw for Fei

522
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,000
and show it to her when she’s back.

523
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,710
We may leave. Leave.

524
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,350
Let’s go.

525
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,640
Let’s go.

526
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,560
Let’s go.

527
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

528
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,000
I’m here to see Lord Gantang.

529
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,280
He’s in the camp. Come with me, please.

530
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,400
You may wait here.

531
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,430
-Aye.
-Aye.

532
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,160
Please.

533
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,230
Right ahead.

534
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,350
Report.

535
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,590
Lord, the Third Prince comes.

536
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,520
Sure. Invite him in.

537
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,430
Please.

538
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,280
Be sure to keep in mind

539
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,830
what I’ve told you.

540
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,110
Greetings, Lord Gantang.

541
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,830
My respects to you, Your Highness.

542
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,950
Let me introduce.

543
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,470
My daughter, Fei.

544
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,040
Fei, this is the Third Prince.

545
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,040
Your Highness.

546
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,950
Good to see you.

547
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,880
Don’t be so polite to me, Miss Zhou.

548
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,110
Do you know each other?

549
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,400
Fei, why didn’t you tell me?

550
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,470
More than that.

551
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,920
She saved my life before.

552
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,190
Hadn’t she helped me,

553
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,070
I’d have been taken away

554
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,230
by Demons.

555
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,590
My pleasure.

556
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,280
Don’t mention it.

557
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,680
Fei.

558
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,470
As I told you,

559
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,310
at the Demon-Extermination Assembly
in Huo’s Manor,

560
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,710
he encountered Chu Tianyu.

561
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,000
Xie Yun and I protected him

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,560
and let him...
Let His Highness leave first.

563
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,430
I see.

564
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,430
By the way, I...

565
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,110
Father, you must have business
to talk about.

566
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,760
I’ll take my leave.

567
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,190
Alright. Go back then.

568
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,400
Take good care of yourself.

569
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,160
Take care.

570
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,880
Go.

571
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,040
Good day, Miss Zhou.

572
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,470
Welcome,

573
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,560
Your Highness.

574
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,590
What brings you here?

575
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,830
I have good news for you, Lord.

576
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,040
On my way here,

577
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,800
I’ve heard the Anping Army

578
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
is well disciplined

579
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,070
under your command.

580
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,680
Your Highness.

581
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,520
Are you here offering amnesty

582
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,710
by the order of His Majesty?

583
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,870
No, you mistake it.

584
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,710
I’m here

585
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,080
for personal affairs.

586
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
Personal affairs?

587
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,760
We don’t know much about each other.

588
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,520
What is it about?

589
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,360
I heard you did a great job

590
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
in settling the refugees.

591
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,670
I’d like to learn from you.

592
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,470
Please.

593
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,600
Your Highness.

594
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,390
Do you have interest in governance now?

595
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,390
Get to the point, please.

596
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,910
Actually, I’m here

597
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,080
for the affair between Zhou Fei and me.

598
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,670
Your Highness.

599
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,840
I apologize

600
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,600
if she offended you.

601
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,000
No. In the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

602
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,280
Zhou Fei saved my life.

603
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,230
I was deeply impressed by her,

604
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,870
and miss her so much.

605
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,710
That’s why I come to you.

606
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,520
I admire her.

607
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,520
Please allow me to marry her.

608
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,800
Your Highness.

609
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,000
For the sake of your safety,

610
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,320
you’d better not

611
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,910
mess with her.

612
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,260
<i>Qiaoyun House</i>

613
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
Madam.

614
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,280
No man knows to

615
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,630
cherish their love

616
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,010
until they lose them.

617
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,080
Sorry, Madam. I should be blamed.

618
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,910
What’s the use of blaming you?

619
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,870
Poor girl.

620
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,600
She doesn’t practice martial arts.

621
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,390
How could she bear the hit?

622
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,840
You must have a way, right?

623
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,230
I don’t.

624
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,600
Madam.

625
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,670
What are you doing? On your feet.

626
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,150
Rise.

627
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,120
Fine.

628
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,670
Since you’re sincere,

629
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,390
I’ll tell you the truth.

630
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,320
The Muyun Gauze she wears

631
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,630
absorbed most of the energy

632
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,710
from the hit.

633
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,120
The Muyun Gauze is broken,

634
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,520
but she’ll recover soon
after taking the medicine.

635
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,560
Young Master, thank you

636
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,630
for helping us.

637
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,430
I’m flattered.

638
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,470
I happened to be there.

639
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,080
It’s my pleasure.

640
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,430
If you’ll wait for Zhou Fei

641
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,600
in Lingling Inn,

642
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,230
please tell her

643
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,800
Chuchu and I are with Madam Nichang.

644
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,000
She is fine.

645
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,430
I’m going back now. No worries.

646
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,280
I’ll let her know.

647
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,390
Good day.

648
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,080
Is it the Cloud Ravine?

649
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,630
So hot here.

650
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,430
It is indeed a small ravine.

651
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,840
Due to the hot and humid weather,

652
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,280
exotic herbs grow abound here.

653
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,630
Some herbalists came

654
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,430
and set up the sect,

655
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,910
namely the Small Medicine Valley.

656
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,470
Who are you?

657
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,910
I wondered who it was.

658
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,430
So, the Chief is finally coming back.

659
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,390
Greetings, Chief.

660
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,000
Don’t! I didn’t mean to be back.

661
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
My friend needs some medicine here.

662
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
I won’t stay long.

663
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
The location is a top secret.

664
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
It’s the rule of the sect

665
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,630
that no outsiders are allowed here.

666
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,080
Even the Chief can’t break it.

667
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,520
Yes. But they are my friends.

668
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,630
I guarantee

669
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,670
nothing will happen.

670
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,800
Blindfold yourselves and come with me.

671
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,840
My aunt never blindfolds guests

672
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,190
who visit the Fortress.

673
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,000
There are many rules here.

674
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Just do it.

675
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,710
I understand.

676
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,760
In the Small Medicine Valley,

677
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,950
exotic herbs and medicines are all over.

678
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,520
If the evil know

679
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,430
the location here,

680
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,670
it could be in trouble
like Big Medicine Valley.

681
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,150
I don’t think it’s bad.

682
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,710
Alright.

683
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,900
<i>Cloud Ravine</i>

684
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,870
Who are they?

685
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,040
Who are they?

686
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,560
Go by yourself.

687
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,230
Here we are. Snake Keeper.

688
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,710
Take if off.

689
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,040
Elder.

690
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,230
Chief.

691
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,390
You’re back.

692
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Elder. How was the Valley

693
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,670
during my leave?

694
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,190
Good. Everything is good.

695
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,670
If you don’t take outsiders here,

696
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,840
it would be better.

697
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,710
I want some medicine for my friend.

698
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,840
We won’t stay long.

699
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
I can’t understand

700
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,950
why your master

701
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,470
had you be the chief.

702
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,910
One of my friends got poisoned.

703
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,190
His life is on the line.

704
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,520
We need Flaming Sage

705
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,470
to make the antidote.

706
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,390
You...

707
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,150
That’s a poisonous herb of great heat,

708
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,120
growing in the wood full of toxic gas.

709
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,560
Whoever goes there will die.

710
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,630
Tell me.

711
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,910
Who will be the one to die?

712
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,120
I will go.

713
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,280
You’re the Chief.

714
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
It’s a forbidden place, don’t you know?

715
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,800
You are breaking the rule.

716
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Your life is not my concern.

717
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,470
But what would happen

718
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,390
if the Valley lost the Chief?

719
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,600
You... You pissed me off.

720
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,320
How rude. He is hitting him!

721
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,950
I won’t be the Chief.

722
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,600
Take the token.

723
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,560
Get someone else to be the Chief.

724
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,840
I quit now.

725
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,520
My life has nothing to do
with the Valley.

726
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,300
Can I go to get the herb now?

727
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,080
As the Chief, you can’t quit at will,

728
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,600
can you?

729
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,710
You’ve failed your master.

730
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,520
-Soldiers. Seize them.
-Aye.

731
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:05,950
Yes.

732
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,630
Don’t you dare!

733
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,470
Hey, old man.

734
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,910
Let him finish his words, will you?

735
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,560
Yes.

736
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,520
Knock it off!

737
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,360
It’s a misunderstanding.

738
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,120
You bring outsiders here

739
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,040
and threaten me with a blade.

740
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,760
-Yang Jin.
-Do it!

741
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,550
-You do it!
-Which side are you on?

742
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,320
He doesn’t listen.

743
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,520
This is about the sect.

744
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,950
It’s caused by me.

745
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,040
Let them go.

746
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,600
I’ll take the punishment.

747
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,840
Fine. Since you say so.

748
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,360
-Guards.
-Yes.

749
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,000
Seize them.

750
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,280
-Run!
-Yes!

751
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,230
Why are you doing this?

752
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,910
Get them!

753
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,520
-It’s a misunderstanding! Elder!
-Get them!

754
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,470
-Hurry!
-They are my friends! Not bad people!

755
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,760
-Hurry.
-Stop there!

756
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,950
Stop!

757
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,280
Stop there!

758
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,040
Stop!

759
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,430
You two, go that way!

760
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,390
-Aye!
-Aye!

761
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,320
Go.

762
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,870
We got situation here!

763
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,040
-Got it.
-This way.

764
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,710
Go!

765
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Well.

766
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,560
We came here blindfolded,

767
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,230
and don’t know where we are.

768
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,600
Where should we go?

769
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,470
Anywhere,

770
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,430
as long as there is no people.

771
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,910
Go. Go. Go.

772
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
Hurry up. Shut it.

773
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Wait!

774
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,800
I won’t run.

775
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,360
What are you doing here?

776
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,120
It’s the Forbidden Forest ahead.

777
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,320
One step forward and you’ll die.

778
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,600
Who are they?

779
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,040
We are...

780
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,560
I’ll release Condensed Dew

781
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,870
to stall for time.

782
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,150
Alright.

783
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,760
Sorry.

784
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,280
We are friends.

785
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,630
-Friends?
-Friends?

786
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,800
Yes. Yes.

787
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,120
Is your chief Yang Jin?

788
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,230
He is big and tall.

789
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,710
His blade is so long.

790
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,040
Are you his friends?

791
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,390
Yes. We know him well.

792
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,390
We’re sworn brothers,

793
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
aren’t we?

794
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,470
Yes. Yes.

795
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,040
He always makes troubles

796
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,670
in the Valley.

797
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,080
The Elder doesn’t allow him to be here.

798
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,870
You are his friends.

799
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,670
Birds of a feather.

800
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,760
Seize them!

801
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,320
-Run!
-Run!

802
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,000
Wait! Wait!

803
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,710
Let them take this.

804
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,800
One pill each.

805
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,190
They’ll just sleep for half a day.

806
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,000
They won’t die.

807
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,190
Half a day?

808
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,280
Is it enough to find the herb

809
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,430
in such a huge mountain?

810
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,670
A herb?

811
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,470
That’s Flaming Sage,

812
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,080
the top poison in the world.

813
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,760
It must be somewhere extraordinary.

814
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,560
Time is not the problem.

815
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,040
What are you waiting for? Move.

816
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,120
But... Wait... Wait a second.

817
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:56,044
