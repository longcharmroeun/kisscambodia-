<i>Episode 36</i>

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,310
You heard what that Elder said.

19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,230
There’s miasma in the woods.

20
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,510
Guards are outside all year round

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,680
and must have something
to protect themselves.

22
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,510
If we went in without their sachets,

23
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,870
the miasma

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,550
could knock us out

25
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,550
and kill us eventually.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,760
Really?

27
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,310
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,270
Come on.

29
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,510
Slow down.

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,750
Who are you?

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,030
Is this the Cloud Ravine?

32
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,910
No entry for strangers.

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,880
You should go.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
You traitor!

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,720
As the chief,

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,030
you disregarded

37
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,440
the rules.

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,720
Now that

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,830
you’re resigning from your post,

40
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,800
I’ll remove you from it.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,090
But we can’t be leaderless.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,910
I’ve invited you over

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,190
for discussion.

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,830
I think we should select

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,110
a new leader

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,720
from the younger generation.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,170
We’ve been practicing
medicine for generations.

48
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,290
As per the tradition,

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,270
we’ll have a medicine competition.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,190
The winner

51
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,390
will lead us in the future.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Report!

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Bad news.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,190
Those two have poisoned the guards

55
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,390
to break into the Forbidden Forest.

56
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,910
The miasma in the woods could kill them

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,110
if we didn’t get them out quickly.

58
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,910
Go!

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,190
Yes.

60
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,190
Would that bonehead be in trouble?

61
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,240
He would

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,390
with us there.

63
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,360
His own people

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,670
wouldn’t kill him.

65
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,750
Were he safe,

66
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,080
why didn’t he come to join us?

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
He’d better not.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,270
We only have two sachets.

69
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,390
There’s no more for him.

70
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,960
There you are.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,390
Aren’t you looking for the Flaming Sage?

72
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,390
This way.

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,320
Let’s go.

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Wait.

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,200
The forest ahead is filled with miasma.

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,790
There are only two sachets.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,670
We’re running out of time. Let’s go!

78
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,640
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

79
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,200
Hey...

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
Come on!

81
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,350
Yang Jin

82
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,320
is a handful.

83
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,950
Shame on him!

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
Don’t worry too much.

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,550
There’s an easy fix.

86
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,390
If you’re to select the most skilled one

87
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,350
in medicine to be the new chief,

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,950
I can be that person.

89
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,000
That’s bold.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Who are you

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,880
to brag to us?

92
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,070
Let’s see

93
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,920
whether I’m bragging or not.

94
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,920
I can’t go any further.

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,760
Don’t pant

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,550
unless you want more
miasma in your system.

97
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,270
-Bonehead!
-Bonehead!

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,200
You’re weak!

99
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,950
No wonder the Elders say

100
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,720
this place is off-limits

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,230
and heavily guarded.

102
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,920
What should we do?

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,440
We can get another sachet.

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
No.

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
I can’t rob my own people.

106
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,390
But we only have two.

107
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,040
How about this?

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,670
Give me the sachet.

109
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,670
We’ll go.

110
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,270
You know the Valley well.

111
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,670
Just go outside

112
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,040
and find a place to hide.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,320
We’ll join you

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
once we’re out with that herb.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,440
No.

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
You don’t know

117
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,510
how dangerous this place is.

118
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,550
Neither of you is skilled enough

119
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,510
to protect yourself.

120
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,720
Look,

121
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,670
Yan and I will go.

122
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,040
You can hide somewhere.

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,070
Sure.

124
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,510
Just one question.

125
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,070
Do you know

126
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,320
what the Flaming Sage looks like?

127
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,230
In that case,

128
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,390
let’s go get it.

129
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
Yan,

130
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,000
you go hide.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,950
Look at you.

132
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,920
You don’t recognize the herb,

133
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,070
nor do you have enough skills.

134
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,550
You...

135
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,230
You...

136
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,920
Your skills are fine,

137
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,390
but not as good as his,

138
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,230
right?

139
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,110
We’ll be right back.

140
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,350
No.

141
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,070
How could you two

142
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,440
leave me here alone?

143
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,720
You can’t!

144
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
You can’t.

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,230
I won’t leave without you.

146
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,760
Fine.

147
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,550
You are

148
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,070
the heiress to the Big Medicine Valley?

149
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,480
All their members

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,720
were killed 20 years ago.

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,230
Where did you get their prescriptions

152
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,230
and what’s your history with us?

153
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,480
All that can wait

154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,270
after the competition.

155
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,950
Alright?

156
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,600
Elder!

157
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,350
Stop it!

158
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,440
You people

159
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,510
don’t deserve your reputation.

160
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,670
We’ve agreed

161
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,200
that the loser must admit defeat,

162
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,000
alive or dead.

163
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,270
But I don’t understand

164
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,880
how I lost.

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,040
I’ll tell you.

166
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,230
I knew what antidote you’d use

167
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,920
to remove my poison

168
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,440
and the herbs you used

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,600
to make that antidote.

170
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,110
One of them could cure you,

171
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,230
but if taken with liquor,

172
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,670
it’d become poisonous.

173
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,440
Herbs can kill or heal people.

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,950
How did you forget that?

175
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
Don’t worry.

176
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,080
That poison

177
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,880
won’t kill you,

178
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,710
but will only make you too weak

179
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,320
to move.

180
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,670
You drank my liquor.

181
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,350
How come nothing happened to you?

182
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,670
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

183
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,150
Do you mean this?

184
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,230
You meant to poison me

185
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,760
with this spider while I wasn’t looking.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,080
Too bad,

187
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,320
I grew up with things like that.

188
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,640
They can’t hurt me at all.

189
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,910
As poisonous as your spider is,

190
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,440
it wouldn’t go

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
anywhere near me.

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,150
Who are you?

193
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,590
The only heiress to
the Big Medicine Valley.

194
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,320
Don’t you know?

195
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,350
Your ancestor

196
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,250
rose from a quack.

197
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,710
He couldn’t have founded this sect

198
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,030
without our Book of Almighty Medicine

199
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,470
he peeked.

200
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,790
Am I right,

201
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,470
Elder?

202
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,440
We’ve been living in seclusion for years

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,080
and never crossed paths with you.

204
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,470
Why are you coming at us?

205
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,030
It’s good that you admit it.

206
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,640
You aren’t as excelled at poison

207
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,520
as you are at medicine.

208
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,910
And you’ve been holing up here

209
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,080
in an attempt to escape from the chaos.

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,880
Keeping your sect is a waste of space.

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
The world only needs one sect,

212
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,030
that is, Demons Manor.

213
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,710
You’re that traitor

214
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,760
who set the Big Medicine Valley on fire!

215
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,230
Pathetic Clam!

216
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,470
Bonehead,

217
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,960
slow down.

218
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,550
I got it!

219
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,960
If one of you carries me,

220
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,520
I’ll put the sachet near the neck

221
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
and we can share it.

222
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Good idea.

223
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
-You do it!
-You do it!

224
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,440
Bonehead,

225
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,910
do you know where to go?

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Flaming Sage

227
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,840
is poisonous,

228
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,110
so it must be where
the miasma comes from.

229
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,880
Go to the source of this miasma

230
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
and we’ll find it.

231
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,790
Right.

232
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,880
Go straight.

233
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,970
We’ll find it there.

234
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,710
Why did you ask that bonehead

235
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,030
instead of me?

236
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,590
This is his place after all.

237
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,710
Maybe Chief Yang

238
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,640
knows something we don’t.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
What’s wrong?

240
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,200
I’m no longer their chief.

241
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,880
After you left,

242
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,590
they deposed me.

243
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,230
Really?

244
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,440
That bad?

245
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,030
I’m sorry.

246
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,880
I didn’t expect the consequence

247
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
would be so severe.

248
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,590
It’s my fault.

249
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,110
Never mind.

250
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,400
I don’t want it anyway.

251
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,590
I was thinking about

252
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,030
battling others every day

253
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,760
and I was seldom here.

254
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,960
I failed them.

255
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
This gives me a sense of closure.

256
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,520
Let’s go.

257
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,520
The miasma is getting stronger ahead.

258
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,080
We’re going in the right direction.

259
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,550
But we’re no longer safe

260
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,640
even with

261
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,790
the sachets.

262
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
What should we do?

263
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,280
Remember.

264
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,880
Stay calm and focused.

265
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Do not run or fight.

266
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,150
Inhale

267
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,670
as little miasma as possible.

268
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,520
Let’s go.

269
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,030
Let’s go.

270
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,000
Elder,

271
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,200
if you work with me,

272
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,230
I may consider

273
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,110
letting your disciples go.

274
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,640
What do you want?

275
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,030
Have people come here lately

276
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,550
for the Flaming Sage?

277
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,320
No.

278
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,570
It’s the most poisonous herb.

279
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,910
What would others need it for?

280
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,640
Snake keeper,

281
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,230
are we there?

282
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,760
Almost there.

283
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,790
Almost there.

284
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,880
What’s the white thingy?

285
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,110
Flaming Sage’s poison

286
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,880
attracts other poisonous creatures

287
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,550
to nest around it.

288
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,080
They must’ve laid

289
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,110
those white eggs.

290
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,280
I’m not sure what they are,

291
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,200
but I know for sure

292
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,230
that if one is broken,

293
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,110
we’ll be attacked by all of them.

294
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,150
That’s the Flaming Sage.

295
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,840
Elder,

296
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,440
you seldom lie, do you?

297
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Tell me the truth, or I’ll kill him

298
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,960
and the rest of them one by one

299
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,030
until you speak.

300
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,350
Chief is back with his friends.

301
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,640
Shut up!

302
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,710
Please spare me!

303
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,200
Be... Be careful.

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,760
If I accidentally step on the eggs,

305
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,350
I’ll toss the herb to you.

306
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,880
Watch your step.

307
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
You’re back, Miss.

308
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,150
May I have

309
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,000
some hot water?

310
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
Sure. Just a minute.

311
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,340
<i>Liquor</i>

312
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,670
Aren’t you with the Xingnan Sect?

313
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,350
What are you doing here?

314
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,470
Is Miss Wu with you?

315
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,710
No... no... she isn’t.

316
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,030
We parted long ago

317
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,760
and we’re here to
deliver Mr. Li’s message.

318
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,790
What message?

319
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,030
Where are you going?

320
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,440
I’m not done yet.

321
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,880
I... I can’t stay.

322
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
My brother is waiting for me.

323
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,640
Mr. Zhu is also here?

324
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,280
Ying’er.

325
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,790
Sir,

326
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,640
what can I do for you?

327
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,280
Sir?

328
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,230
You’re born too weak

329
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,760
to practice martial arts,

330
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,080
and you’re doomed

331
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,590
to become a failure.

332
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,230
What can you do for me?

333
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,000
So what if I don’t
practice martial arts?

334
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,350
Without them,

335
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,230
you’ll only get bullied.

336
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Actually, I can use a few dogs.

337
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,030
If you bark for me,

338
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,080
I’ll teach you some skills
to protect yourself.

339
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,080
That way,

340
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,840
you can be the bully
instead of being bullied.

341
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,880
As the heir to Xingnan Sect,

342
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,400
I’d never allow such degradation.

343
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,760
Degradation?

344
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,190
Do you mean taking orders from me

345
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,880
or the way I look?

346
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,470
Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.

347
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,800
Mr. Yin,

348
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,680
you stepped forward

349
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,800
and beat back the evil ones
of the Four-guardian Mountain.

350
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,430
Everyone appreciated that.

351
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,040
But look what you’re doing now!

352
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,800
How are you different
from Zheng Luosheng?

353
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,040
Miss Zhou,

354
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
there you are!

355
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,830
Mr. Zhu is attacked by someone inside.

356
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,920
He needs your help.

357
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,710
I see.

358
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,830
Enough of

359
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,110
your lies!

360
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,000
You’re crazy!

361
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,230
Zhou Fei?

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,800
Yin Pei!

363
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,920
Yes,

364
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,880
it’s me.

365
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,110
It’s been a while.

366
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,590
Why are you dressed up like this?

367
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,800
You didn’t learn your lesson

368
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
back at Sanchun Inn, did you?

369
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,760
I should’ve asked Mr. Ji

370
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
to slap you more.

371
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,430
Mind your own business!

372
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,520
What now?

373
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,310
Trying to escape?

374
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,070
After all that you’ve done,

375
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,280
are you still afraid?

376
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,830
I’m done wasting my time on you.

377
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,040
Are you alright?

378
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,470
Miss Zhou,

379
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,190
thanks for saving me again.

380
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,230
-I...
-Don’t mention it.

381
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,040
Miss Zhou,

382
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,310
finally!

383
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,640
Anything about Yang Jin and Poisoner?

384
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,070
They left for

385
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,040
the Cloud Ravine with Miss Li

386
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,470
for some herb

387
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,560
upon receiving your letter.

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,560
Got it.

389
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,760
Sir,

390
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,430
may I borrow the pigeon
of the Route Gang?

391
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,190
Of course.

392
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,310
I’ll go get it.

393
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,160
Miss Zhou,

394
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,880
how’s your injury?

395
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,310
I’m fine. Thanks for asking.

396
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,040
Where’s...?

397
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,590
Where’s Mr. Xie?

398
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,110
He went back to see his master.

399
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,830
I...

400
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,280
Is there anything else?

401
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,430
Mr. Li has a message for you.

402
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,950
He and Miss Wu

403
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,400
are with Madam Nichang at Qiaoyun House.

404
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
They’re fine.

405
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,230
You don’t need to worry.

406
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,830
Message received.

407
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,590
One more thing.

408
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,310
I mean...

409
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,680
I haven’t got to

410
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,920
thank you properly.

411
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,520
If you...

412
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,710
No need.

413
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,880
Don’t take it to heart.

414
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,830
Miss Zhou,

415
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,110
the pigeon is ready.

416
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,920
Please.

417

418
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,310
Is that from Miss Zhou?

419
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,920
Fei

420
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,590
has decided

421
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,470
to give the Seal of Cautiousness
to Mu Xiaoqiao.

422
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,160
If Wang Lin knew that,

423
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,760
he’d dig a way out of his grave.

424
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,350
Few can

425
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,160
overcome their obsession and greed.

426
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,710
I’ve seldom seen people

427
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,830
with a pure mind like Zhou Fei.

428
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,490
Anzhi,

429
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,520
you’re lucky.

430
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,920
I can’t say the same to Fei.

431
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,350
She’s already suffered so much

432
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,470
ever since she met me.

433
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,310
And

434
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,470
I’ll let her down again eventually.

435
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,470
She hasn’t given up

436
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,400
and she’s been doing her best

437
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,280
to collect all the herbs you need.

438
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,640
So

439
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,040
in the meantime,

440
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,470
you should take care of yourself.

441
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,400
Without the third herb,

442
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,350
you’ll become weaker and weaker.

443
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,710
I won’t give up.

444
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,800
But

445
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,520
I can’t bear to think

446
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,310
if all her efforts

447
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,040
turn out to be in vain,

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,040
won’t that

449
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,400
hurt her even more?

450
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,680
Whether we succeed or fail,

451
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,160
we only wish to live
with a clear conscience.

452
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,310
Anzhi,

453
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,560
you should know that.

454
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,640
Yes.

455
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
That’s how Fei is.

456
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,110
Sheng.

457
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,950
Sheng.

458
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,760
Who is it?

459
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,470
It’s me.

460
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,470
Chuchu,

461
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,520
you finally woke up!

462
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,520
How long did I sleep?

463
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,830
You...

464
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,560
You look all haggard and worn.

465
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,680
Really?

466
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,470
Yin Pei killed Mr. Chongxiao.

467
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,040
I’ve been

468
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,400
gathering help to eliminate him

469
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,190
without taking enough rest.

470
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,640
I shouldn’t have bothered you with that.

471
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Do you feel better?

472
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,400
Let me go get

473
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,310
Madam Nichang.

474
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,070
Wait.

475
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,520
I just woke up.

476
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,400
Can you stay with me for now?

477
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,920
Sure. No problem.

478
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,680
Why did you ask

479
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,640
to see me, Madam?

480
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,760
I heard

481
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,680
you’ve been planning to

482
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,350
eliminate Qinghui.

483
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,310
Yes.

484
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,950
That won’t be easy.

485
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Can you make it?

486
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,310
You might think

487
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,400
I’m young and naive,

488
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,470
but after seeing what he’s done,

489
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,880
I cannot just stand by

490
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,190
and turn a blind eye to it.

491
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,640
Whether I’ll succeed

492
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,920
or not,

493
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
I’ll have to

494
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,000
try it first.

495
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,110
Well said!

496
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,760
Youngsters

497
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,160
are indeed brave.

498
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,070
So

499
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,310
how’s it going?

500
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,760
At this point, few are willing to

501
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,680
stick their necks out.

502
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,560
Tell them

503
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,760
you aren’t alone.

504
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,190
Yuyi Troupe

505
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,160
is your ally in this matter.

506
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,680
I know what’s on your mind.

507
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,230
We’ve been protecting ourselves

508
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,070
from the secular world

509
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,040
and we always stay away from trouble.

510
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,280
But this time is different.

511
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,430
Qinghui is Mountain Sword’s son.

512
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,230
I must do something

513
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,000
to stop him from ruining

514
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,110
his father’s reputation!

515
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,400
Wake up.

516
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,140
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

517
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,740
Finally!

518
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,920
You’re too weak!

519
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
You passed out just now.

520
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,920
Did you come from the Cloud Ravine?

521
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,230
Why ask?

522
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,430
What are you up to?

523
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,950
Many have gone in
and out of there lately.

524
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,800
I mean...

525
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
Well,

526
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,350
we heard of the Cloud Ravine

527
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,070
and came for treatment,

528
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,040
but we got lost in the mountain.

529
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,520
You said many have gone in?

530
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,470
Who are they?

531
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,000
Maybe they can take us along.

532
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,470
Just now, a woman

533
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,310
and her followers

534
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,680
asked the way to the Cloud Ravine.

535
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,190
Before leaving,

536
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,280
she fed fruits to a dog at the gate.

537
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,040
It died instantly.

538
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,830
Where is it?

539
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,350
Next to the tree.

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,070
It’s her.

541
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,880
Who is it?

542
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,190
This is the fruit of
the Worry-burying Flower

543
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,070
of the Big Medicine Valley.

544
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,800
Only one person knows

545
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,950
how to grow it.

546
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,040
Is everything alright?

547
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,760
Who is it?

548
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,180
A traitor who defected to Demons Manor,

549
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,470
Pathetic Clam.

550
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,680
According to my observation,

551
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,070
they’ve already taken over the entrance.

552
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,470
Things could only be worse inside.

553
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,070
We have no other choice.

554
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,640
Let’s go. Follow me.

555
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,950
We’re poisoned by Pathetic Clam

556
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,950
without knowing the cure.

557
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,470
-Go find the antidote.
-Don’t move.

558
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,430
Go!

559
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,110
Go!

560
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,950
Trust me.

561
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,640
I’ll come back to save you.

562
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Is Yang Jin

563
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,280
acting on impulse again
and engaging in a fight?

564
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,350
You’d better leave, Yan.

565
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,520
I didn’t stop you

566
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,400
from interfering in others’ business,

567
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,760
but this time isn’t the same.

568
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,310
Didn’t we agree

569
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,640
to come and go together?

570
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,590
You know...

571
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,590
That woman isn’t like other Demons.

572
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,040
You don’t know how capable she is.

573
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Even if she...

574
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,430
Pathetic Clam poisoned
everyone inside.

575
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,920
They can’t move.

576
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,950
I don’t know how to make the antidote.

577
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,230
What to do?

578
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,560
She must’ve

579
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,810
had the antidote with her

580
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
just in case.

581
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,470
What can you do?

582
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,590
Rob her?

583
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,680
She’s occupied our place

584
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,280
and she’s staying at the Hall of Elders.

585
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,310
I have an idea.

586
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,950
I’ll

587
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,310
distract them

588
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,920
while you sneak in to get the antidote.

589
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,940
<i>Chestnut Shells</i>

590
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,280
Those fools

591
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,830
keep so many rare herbs

592
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,230
without using them. What a waste!

593
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,190
Congratulations!

594
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,350
We’re one step closer

595
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,680
to unifying all sects.

596
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,350
Still no sign of that girl?

597
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,640
Bad news!

598
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,830
The front is on fire.

599
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,800
Fire?

600
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
She’s left.

601
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
We must find the antidote

602
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,160
before she’s back.

603
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,950
Let’s go!

604
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,590
You’re our only hope.

605
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,470
Smell this. Is it the antidote?

606
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,070
Is it this one?

607
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,070
She wouldn’t have put it

608
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,590
somewhere so easy to spot.

609
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,430
Then where is it?

610
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,310
Someone’s coming.

611
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,520
How come she’s back so soon?

612
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,710
Did rats sneak in?

613
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,000
No wonder

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,920
there was a fire.

615
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,640
Some rats

616
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,280
set it to lure me out

617
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,710
so that they could steal things from me.

618
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,280
I always hate thieves.

619
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,230
When I was little,

620
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,430
a girl stole my hairpin.

621
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,230
Then I stabbed her eye

622
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,520
with it.

623
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,110
That way,

624
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,560
she could keep it forever.

625
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,920
Master,

626
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,760
where is The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

627
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,560
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

628
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,110
You’re evil-minded.

629
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,760
You’ve spent all your time on poison

630
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,070
instead of medicine.

631
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,190
Now, you can only watch me die

632
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,000
and will never know where that thing is.

633
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,710
Take that as my last lesson to you.

634
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,800
I know who you are looking for.

635
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,710
You must be their escaped chief.

636
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,910
I’m their chief

637
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,430
but I didn’t escape.

638
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,150
Listen,

639
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,040
I know where the people
you’re looking for are.

640
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,360
In the cabinet

641
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,800
which has been poisoned.

642
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,040
Don’t try to fool me.

643
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,800
They can’t go anywhere.

644
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,080
Enough!

645
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,150
Wait.

646
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,040
There’s poison

647
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,710
outside.

648
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,870
These are the antidote.

649
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,910
I made them.

650
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,910
They might not work,

651
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,710
but

652
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,950
we have nothing else.

653
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,390
Take this, too.

654
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,320
I made that powder.

655
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,950
Throw it into the fire,

656
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,520
then the smoke will blind others

657
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,230
and make their eyes tear.

658
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,150
I’ll have to deal with

659
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,560
that evil woman sooner or later.

660
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,080
Leave through the tunnel bonehead took

661
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,760
and bring the antidote to the Elders.

662
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,320
You won’t be able to

663
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,800
get out alive.

664
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,080
Really?

665
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,840
I’ll finish you here and now.

666
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Bring it on!

667
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,280
I’d rather die

668
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,560
than relive that nightmare.

669
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,630
What?

670
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,070
Who are you?

671
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,320
The heir,

672
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,360
the sole heir to
the Big Medicine Valley!

673
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,230
Impossible!

674
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,080
You’re that boy?

675
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,400
Ever since Master died of your poison,

676
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,340
I’ve been working
day and night to remove it.

677
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,710
You rat!

678
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,910
Hu Tianying,

679
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,760
you were

680
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,410
the most talented disciple.

681
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,670
Master meant to give you
Book of Almighty Medicine

682
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,430
and make you the next chief.

683
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,670
But what did you do?

684
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,190
You could only poison others

685
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,710
instead of curing them.

686
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,390
That’s why master changed his mind

687
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,520
to keep the Big Medicine Valley

688
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,000
away from poison.

689
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,600
All these years,

690
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,520
I’ve been studying poison

691
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,600
to use it to save lives.

692
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,870
So I’m known as a physician.

693
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,760
Unlike you,

694
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,230
a despicable

695
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,910
poisoner all along!

696
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,390
Guards!

697
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,470
Guards!

698
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,430
Elder, you...

699
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,560
I’m fine.

700
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,320
She saved us.

701
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,760
Hongqu! Hongqu!

702
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,280
My lady,

703
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,390
their smoke

704
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,560
has blinded us.

705
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:22,840
Let’s go.

706
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,840
Are you alright?

707
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,190
Are you also poisoned?

708
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,630
Back then...

709
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,430
it was just like this.

710
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,040
I was in the cabinet

711
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,840
while she was outside.

712
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,210
I saw how she killed my master.

713
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,800
Finally,

714
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,020
I could

715
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,280
stand up to her.

716
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,640
You’re of great help.

717
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,350
Thanks.

718
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,870
Back at the Fortress,

719
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,120
Uncle once said

720
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,520
those who attempt the impossible

721
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,040
are heroes.

722
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,000
Thank you.

723
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,870
Thank you both.

724
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,670
Take it back.

725
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,910
Don’t throw it away again.

726
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,190
Elder,

727
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,190
you should keep it.

728
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,560
I’m always away,

729
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,870
devoting myself to martial arts.

730
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,600
I’m not fitted to be the chief.

731
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,950
Weren’t you selecting a new one?

732
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,600
Choose a better one.

733
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,470
No.

734
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,190
We were wrong.

735
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,520
When the former chief

736
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,040
made a martial artist

737
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,840
instead of a physician his successor,

738
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,800
we thought he was partial towards you

739
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,470
and didn’t understand him.

740
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,760
But this incident

741
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,280
has proved him right.

742
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,040
He picked you

743
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,120
to protect us

744
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,810
so that we wouldn’t end up
being like the Big Medicine Valley.

745
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,340
<i>Chestnut Shells</i>

746
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,710
Elder,

747
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,390
well...

748
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,600
about the Flaming Sage...

749
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,950
We didn’t give it to you.

750
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,000
The miasma is harmful.

751
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,390
Since you managed to get through it

752
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,320
and find that herb,

753
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,600
why bother asking me?

754
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,670
You can have it.

755
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,430
Really?

756
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,390
Thank you!

757
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,150
Let’s go see Fei.

758
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,320
I’ve got the herb she needs.

759
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,910
She can no longer call me useless.

760
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,840
Come on!

761
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,870
Thank you.

762
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,710
Let’s go.

763
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,470
I’ve warned Tianying

764
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,870
not to underestimate those kids,

765
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,670
but she didn’t listen.

766
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,910
Yes.

767
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,320
News came in

768
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,710
that Zhou Fei is found near Lingling.

769
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,760
She seems to be

770
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,470
waiting for Phoenix, Mu Xiaoqiao.

771
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,120
That girl is really something.

772
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,230
Will Li Yan

773
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,000
get into trouble
at the Small Medicine Valley?

774
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,000
Hey, beauty,

775
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,630
you’re here early.

776
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,150
You’re late, Phoenix.

777
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,360
Where is it?

778
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,040
All yours.

779
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,080
Others would die

780
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,430
for this thing,

781
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,280
and you’re giving it to me so easily?

782
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,360
A promise is a promise.

783
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,670
I’ll certainly keep it.

784
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,390
I don’t need it anyway.

785
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,150
What are you going to do next?

786
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,520
I think Pathetic Clam has reappeared.

787
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,600
She could be the one

788
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,760
who poisoned Mr. Huo.

789
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,360
I’ll get to the bottom of it.

790
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,710
Pathetic Clam?

791
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,800
If there’s anything new about her,

792
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,120
let me know.

793
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,280
I won’t.

794
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,430
She’s my prey.

795
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,870
No one else can take her away.

796
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,840
Fine.

797
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,040
I should go.

798
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,150
Good day.

799
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,560
She isn’t just your enemy.

800
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,870
If you can’t handle her alone,

801
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,000
just say the word.

802
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,930
Don’t be shy.

803
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,040
Hey, wait.

804
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,040
Is that Beggar’s Chicken?

805
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,910
Hey,

806
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,000
you’re still too weak

807
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,670
to digest meat.

808
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,280
I’m healthy.

809
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,430
I’ll eat it for you.

810
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,630
Consider that a favor.

811
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,710
Let me help you.

812
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,910
No, no, no!

813
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,630
Who knows how much I’ll suffer?

814
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,000
I’m finally up

815
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,470
to eat something good.

816
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,950
How could you take it from me?

817
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,800
You get me wrong.

818
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,150
Alright. Fine.

819
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,190
Let’s share it.

820
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,120
Hey,

821
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,080
I had my doubts
when you said you were a beggar.

822
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,910
So

823
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,430
was that true?

824
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,670
Why would I lie?

825
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,710
I’ve tried all walks of life.

826
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,520
I have to say

827
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,280
being a beggar

828
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,800
is quite free.

829
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,360
Fei’s life is not bad, either.

830
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,430
She dashes around all day

831
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,710
without worrying too much.

832
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,120
Listen,

833
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,280
just relax yourself

834
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
and stop thinking too much.

835
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,120
Finish this chicken,

836
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,390
and you’ll feel good.

837
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,190
Let’s eat it together.

838
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,870
Come on.

839
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,870
Eat it.

840
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,710
Have a drumstick.

841
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,600
Eat up.

842
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
Snake keeper,

843
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,390
we’ve obtained the Flaming Sage,

844
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,390
helped bonehead get reinstated

845
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,760
and beat back Pathetic Clam.

846
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,120
Aren’t we good?

847
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,630
Yes.

848
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,080
I’ve decided to stay at
the Small Medicine Valley.

849
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,910
How long will it take to
get to the Small Medicine Valley?

850
00:45:14,943 --> 00:45:24,943
