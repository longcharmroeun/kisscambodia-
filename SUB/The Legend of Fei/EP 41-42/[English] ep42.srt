18
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,900
Father!

19
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,300
Master!

20
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,700
Father!

21
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,140
Yitang stole the commander’s tally

22
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,900
so that we were rescued.

23
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,260
If the Demons come to attack us again,

24
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,930
I can’t get the young generation

25
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,650
in such danger.

26
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,780
Lord Gantang.

27
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
You’re just in time.
I was looking for you.

28
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,570
I’ve arranged military affairs.

29
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,090
Jinrong’s birthday is coming.

30
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,340
I’ll leave tomorrow for home.

31
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,860
What a coincidence! Look.

32
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,700
Here’s a letter from your home.

33
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,500
My daughter has been back home,

34
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,730
with all the tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

35
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,090
Go back home.

36
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,220
I’ll get the horse ready for you.

37
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,980
Okay.

38
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,540
I’ll leave tonight with light luggage.

39
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,940
General Wen knows me very well.

40
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,130
I stole

41
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,660
the commander’s tally.

42
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,410
I sent troops illegally
and broke the military law!

43
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,130
I’m sorry to General Wang
for his care and instruction.

44
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,130
I’m sorry to the whole Anping Army!

45
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,130
I’m guilty!

46
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,340
Yitang!

47
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,060
Yitang! Yitang!

48
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,500
What did you do?

49
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,060
You miser.

50
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,410
You don’t need to buy me drinks anymore.

51
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,620
I’ve destroyed my martial arts.

52
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,130
Wen Yu.

53
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,820
I’ll leave Anping Army

54
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,250
to you.

55
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,780
Hyah!

56
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,900
Hyah!

57
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,220
Hyah!

58
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,690
Assassins! Protect Lord Gantang.

59
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,820
We’re trapped! Go!

60
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,620
Don’t run after them!

61
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,570
Lord Gantang, it’s foresighted of you.

62
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,290
The assassins did attack us tonight.

63
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,570
Right ahead us is the territory
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

64
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,820
If they didn’t attack me,

65
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,620
they wouldn’t have a chance.

66
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,290
What have you got?

67
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,850
The blade looks like a weapon
from the court.

68
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,570
There are always disguises
in the art of war.

69
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,380
We used a trick.

70
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,570
They might have used one, too.

71
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,130
What do you mean, Lord Gantang?

72
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,010
They were very meticulous,

73
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,060
leaving no clue to us.

74
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,660
I’m not sure who they are.

75
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,250
But...

76
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,690
I’m afraid
something terrible may happen.

77
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,500
The world has been in peace
for merely two years.

78
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,250
People can no longer suffer.

79
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,380
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is right there.

80
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,940
I’ll travel all night to get home early.

81
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,660
There won’t be any problem.

82
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,780
General Wen.

83
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,820
Please go back with Anping Token.

84
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,100
Remember.

85
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,170
No matter what rumors you hear,

86
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,850
make sure not to take any rash action.

87
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,660
I can’t leave.

88
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,660
Lord Gantang.

89
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,540
If I leave,

90
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,780
you’ll be alone.

91
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,250
I’m afraid...

92
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,900
What are you afraid of?

93
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,100
Compared to

94
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,010
several hundred thousand people
on the border,

95
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,300
I’m insignificant.

96
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,570
The order cannot be disobeyed.

97
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,740
General Wen.

98
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,010
Take the order.

99
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,570
I...

100
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,690
I take the order.

101
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,220
Bravo!

102
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,220
You moved so swiftly,

103
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,300
like a graceful flying bird.

104
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,340
Don’t flatter me.

105
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,180
Have some hot wine to warm up.

106
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,740
Here.

107
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,860
Your craftsmanship is getting better.

108
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,250
You’ve made so many lanterns.

109
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,810
Are you going to sell them?

110
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,740
No.

111
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,300
We’ll fly them.

112
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,900
Which do you like? Pick one.

113
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,370
That one.

114
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,180
This one?

115
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,690
I painted it very carefully.

116
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,450
Look at the mountain.

117
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,780
You see the details?

118
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,340
The river and the pavilion.

119
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,420
Look. We’re here.

120
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,250
We’ll fly only one lantern?

121
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,180
I’ll pick one, too.

122
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,780
Which one would you like?

123
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,010
This one.

124
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,900
I heard

125
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,180
the lantern would fly

126
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,860
to the heaven.

127
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,930

Zhou Yitang is so crafty!

152
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,900
Wen Yu was the strongest martial artist

153
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,340
working for Wang Lin.

154
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,490
I didn’t expect losers like you

155
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,220
to kill him.

156
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,980
He doesn’t have martial arts.

157
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,540
But he’s more thoughtful

158
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,300
than most people.

159
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,980
We cannot defeat him,

160
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,180
unless Shen Tianshu goes personally.

161
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,100
I just gave him a lesson,

162
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,540
telling them

163
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,420
we’re not pushovers.

164
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,570
It’s been years,

165
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,370
but Shen Tianshu had no breakthrough
on his martial arts.

166
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Seems like he has
his own inner demon, too.

167
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,980
I will make him

168
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,340
help us.

169
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,570
Ask Pathetic Clam
to take action tonight.

170
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,340
Why is there such a weird disease?

171
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,300
The pulse is so weird.
I’ve never seen any before.

172
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,860
I’m a doctor for the Third Prince.

173
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,780
May I have your name?

174
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,740
You use the martial art
of Route Gang,

175
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,250
Chong Vessel.

176
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,250
Chong Vessel sets in your body
with wrong circulation of vital energy.

177
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,180
When you practice rashly,
you have a bellyache.

178
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,010
The weakness of your martial arts

179
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,930
lies in Qichong.

180
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,690
Am I right?

181
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,490
I really underestimated you.

182
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,220
My respects.

183
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,010
Come in, please.

184
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,250
The Third Prince vomits sometimes.

185
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,540
Looks like he has disharmony
of spleen and stomach

186
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,130
-and lower adverse-rising energy.
-Come in, please.

187
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,570
Nonsense! Nonsense!

188
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,900
There’s no heat in his stomach

189
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,810
so that he can’t digest any food.

190
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,100
That’s why he vomits
every time he eats something.

191
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,370
He just needs heat-clearing pills.

192
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,130
He’s got lovesickness.

193
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,570
Nonsense! Ridiculous!

194
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,900
This is nonsense!

195
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,220
He just needs some heat-clearing pills.

196
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,690
Yes.

197
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,690
There’s no heat in his stomach.

198
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,370
It can’t be lovesickness.

199
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,010
No way.

200
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,450
She’s talking rubbish!

201
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,860
His pulse feels...

202
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,450
What is she doing?

203
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,130
How careless she is!

204
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,610
How... how dare she!

205
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,610
What is she writing?

206
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,900
Seriously?

207
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,300
Isn’t...

208
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,130
Isn’t she giving a casual prescription?

209
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,450
Get what’s in the prescription

210
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,300
and put it in the censer.

211
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,610
The Third Prince
will wake up immediately.

212
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,610
But I’m afraid

213
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,940
it’s not easy to cure him completely.

214
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,900
How was it going, Madam?

215
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,660
Such stupid doctors want
to detoxify my poison?

216
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,010
What a fool’s talk!

217
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,370
Doctor! Doctor! Please stay.

218
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,730
Doctor.

219
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,820
When we put the medicine in,

220
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,850
the Third Prince woke up immediately.

221
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,660
You have miraculous medical skills!

222
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,180
You flatter me.

223
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,060
I just restrained the disease

224
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,610
in the body of the Third Prince.

225
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,540
If you want him to get recovered,

226
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,490
I’m afraid

227
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,420
you need to cure him of lovesickness.

228
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,660
Please instruct us, Doctor.

229
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,490
Commander-in-chief, let me go
and tell Lord.

230
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,580
It’s okay. Don’t bother.

231
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,940
I’ll just wait.

232
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,850
Commander-in-chief,
sorry to have kept you waiting.

233
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,940
Lord invited you in.

234
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,540
Lord.

235
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,730
Here comes Commander-in-chief.

236
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,420
Lord Shen, you’ve locked yourself here.

237
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,420
What a comfortable life you live!

238
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,580
I don’t think you allowed me in

239
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,090
only because I waited
for such a long time.

240
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,420
I heard

241
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,010
the assassins you sent
to kill Zhou Yitang

242
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,970
failed their mission.

243
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,330
Without you,

244
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,250
they could do nothing.

245
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,010
You won’t easily give up.

246
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,250
I guess you’ve got a backup plan.

247
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,060
You know me very well, Lord Shen.

248
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,460
I had someone sneak into
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

249
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,940
I must get
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

250
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,490
It would be better

251
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,940
if we could kill Li Jinrong

252
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,250
when the Third Prince was there.

253
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,780
We can only get fish in troubled waters.

254
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,250
Kill two birds with one stone?

255
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,490
It’s greedy of you, Commander-in-chief.

256
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,180
Aren’t you curious

257
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,490
about who I have sent to the Fortress?

258
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,610
Don’t you worry about her safety?

259
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,420
She’s risking her life for you.

260
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
You have the greatest talent

261
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,330
to identify and use people.

262
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,700
If you asked me to kill Li Jinrong,

263
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,580
I might not succeed

264
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,010
even after a desperate fight.

265
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,130
But everything has its vanquisher.

266
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,720
Since Pathetic Clam poisoned Li Zheng,

267
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,010
she can also poison Li Jinrong.

268
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,330
Why must I worry about her?

269
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,820
You don’t worry about her.

270
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,780
But you’re still willing to meet me.

271
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,180
Could you be moved by my sincerity?

272
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,580
Last time, you visited me

273
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,180
and asked me to kill Zhou Yitang.

274
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,540
You didn’t give a good reason,

275
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,850
so that I didn’t feel
any killing intent.

276
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,900
Now you tell me Pathetic Clam went
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight for you.

277
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,460
Commander-in-chief.

278
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,300
I know her best.

279
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,900
In the past few years,

280
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,010
she only cares about flowers
in the manor.

281
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,060
If it weren’t for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

282
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,300
I couldn’t even ask her to do anything.

283
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,090
What did you

284
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,330
give her?

285
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,250
You’d better not know.

286
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,130
I don’t think I can get anything today.

287
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,130
I’d like to go.

288
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,300
She went there for you, Lord Shen.

289
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,850
Your people failed many times.

290
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,180
I told Tianying

291
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,540
I would withdraw everything

292
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,060
for supporting the Demons these years.

293
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,330
She went there, to keep your prestige
among the Demons.

294
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,730
She’s such a good woman.

295
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,780
Do cherish her.

296
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,250
I’ve thought about this.

297
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,060
Seems like

298
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,300
you have no more news to tell me.

299
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,330
Will you really look on and do nothing?

300
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,460
Commander-in-chief.

301
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,730
I’m no longer

302
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,820
a kindhearted young man

303
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,730
who would help people

304
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,820
if he knew they were in trouble.

305
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,700
Pathetic Clam worked for you.

306
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,250
If you want me to help her,

307
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,130
you should at least
give me something attractive.

308
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,820
How much money or grain
do you want this time?

309
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,700
None.

310
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,970
A powerful man like you

311
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,210
lives such a poor life.

312
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,180
You’re either too thrifty,

313
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,460
or

314
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,370
too heartless.

315
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,820
What exactly do you want?

316
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,730
I want you to send troops to help me
get the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

317
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,580
Sure. We promised to join hands

318
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,210
and get it.

319
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,700
Yes, we promised.

320
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,330
Now you want me to kill someone for you.

321
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,900
You need to give me something more.

322
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,250
After we find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

323
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,730
do not

324
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,660
touch anything

325
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,300
in it.

326
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:20,424
Sub by Dramacool.ae

327
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,540
Stop!

328
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,680
Your Highness.

329
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,250
We’ve walked a long way.

330
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,370
Shall we take a rest?

331
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,330
Okay.

332
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,280
Mr. Bai.

333
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,160
How long will it take?

334
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,280
Don’t be anxious, Your Highness.
We’re arriving soon.

335
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,850
Your Highness, you’ve grown up.

336
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,160
You’re going to propose to a girl.

337
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,520
Hope we’ll succeed

338
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,560
and you can get the girl you love.

339
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,970
But Miss Zhou doesn’t look

340
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,960
like Xie Yun’s good friend only.

341
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,920
How shall I propose to her?

342
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,970
Your Highness.

343
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,210
Marriage is usually made

344
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,610
by parents’ order
and match-maker’s word.

345
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,160
Just go propose to Miss Zhou.

346
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,760
If Mr. Xie wants the same thing,

347
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,520
he will do it in his own way.

348
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,400
You won’t be stealing her girl.

349
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,610
Before we left,

350
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,130
most people in the palace knew

351
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,040
you came to propose to her.

352
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,610
If you failed and went back,

353
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,010
I’m afraid you would be laughed at.

354
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,040
Your Highness, before you try,

355
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,970
how do you know you will fail?

356
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,850
Try, as if getting rid
of your inner demon.

357
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,730
Anyway,

358
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,250
you must get rid of your lovesickness.

359
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,970
She’s right.

360
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,520
It’s also for the sake of your health.

361
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,400
Okay. Let’s move on.

362
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,640
Aye.

363
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,450
<i>Token</i>

364
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,400
Without me,

365
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,010
Fei would have lived a carefree life.

366
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,010
Madam, we’ve got a visitor.

367
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,760
Didn’t I tell Sheng

368
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,210
to stop all visitors?

369
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,850
Maybe he can’t stop this one.

370
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,730
Who is it?

371
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,370
The Third Prince.

372
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,250
Stop!

373
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,090
Today, I’ve finally realized

374
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,450
how vast this place can be.

375
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,010
It took us great trouble
to walk halfway.

376
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,210
We could hardly move on.

377
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,760
Luckily, you sent men to help us.

378
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,400
We came up alive, at last.

379
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,040
Your Highness, I heard
you’re seeking talents.

380
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,210
For your marriage,

381
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,330
you’ve racked your brains.

382
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,490
Sure.

383
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,210
This is a heroic place.

384
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,880
If I weren’t sincere to propose,

385
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,610
how could I convince other heroes?

386
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,610
Very well.

387
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,730
We don’t support
either your court or the other.

388
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,560
We have our own rules.

389
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,520
Sorry to have offended you.

390
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,250
Good point.

391
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,250
Mr. Li.

392
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,490
Oh, no, Master Li.

393
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,370
With a heroic cousin like you,

394
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,730
no wonder

395
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,450
Miss Zhou is also a heroine

396
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,760
and an outstanding girl.

397
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,090
Miss Zhou?

398
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,760
Aren’t you going to...?

399
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,160
You want to marry Zhou Fei?

400
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,010
Why do you want to marry her?

401
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,610
To guard your house?

402
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,040
Doctor, are you all right?

403
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,730
She’s alright.

404
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,970
After walking the whole day,

405
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,090
she’s so weak that she needs some rest.

406
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,520
How about this?

407
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,490
I’ll take you to your rooms

408
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,090
for some rest.

409
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,040
Mr. Li.

410
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,450
I’d like to take His Highness

411
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,560
to meet Madam Li.

412
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,210
Your Highness, it’s our honor

413
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,680
to welcome you.

414
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,610
Thank you, Madam Li.

415
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,800
This is the first cup of tea
I’ve had today.

416
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Sorry for the poor condition.

417
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,250
Please forgive us.

418
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,370
Your Highness, I wonder

419
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,800
what you come for.

420
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,280
Lately, I was in danger a few times,

421
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,730
and Miss Zhou saved me.

422
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,130
I heard it’s your birthday.

423
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,490
I bring some gifts

424
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,130
to express my gratitude.

425
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,250
This is the Mountain-River Jade
I’ve treasured.

426
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,450
Seen in the candlelight,

427
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,760
the pattern looks
like the mountain and river.

428
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,800
Take it.

429
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,850
<i>Insightful and Open-minded</i>
I heard martial artists are easy-going.

430
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,850
Madam, you really behave

431
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,130
like departed heroes.

432
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,090
I’ll accept the Jade.

433
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,560
But please take away

434
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,610
the rest of the gifts.

435
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,090
These are...

436
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,090
Madam.

437
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,880
These are betrothal presents

438
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,370
to propose to Miss Zhou Fei.

439
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,450
Your father sent you?

440
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,090
His Highness

441
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,680
likes Miss Zhou.

442
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,850
He came here
with the approval from His Majesty.

443
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Cousin!

444
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,210
Cousin, bad news!

445
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,130
Cousin!

446
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,800
The Third Prince...

447
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,970
He came to propose to you

448
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,450
with a lot of gifts!

449
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,680
What?

450
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,490
The Third Prince?

451
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,280
Propose to me?

452
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,370
Where’s Xie Yun?

453
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,280
Did he know the Third Prince came?

454
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,760
I didn’t see him.

455
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,250
Shall I go find him?

456
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,640
Tell him the Third Prince wanted
to marry me.

457
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,040
See how he responded.

458
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,280
Mr. Xie.

459
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,210
Look what a condition you’re in!

460
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,210
Why are you still here?

461
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,760
I was looking for you everywhere!

462
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,450
What do you mean?

463
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,610
Forget it.

464
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,640
Your sworn brother, the Third Prince...

465
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,210
He has come
and is now in the Hall of Elders.

466
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,210
Zichen has come?

467
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,160
That’s great.

468
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,250
That’s not great!

469
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,520
He came to propose to Fei!

470
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,330
You met my daughter?

471
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,040
A couple of times.

472
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,880
Unfortunately,

473
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,850
we met by chance
and we weren’t very close.

474
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,490
You came to propose to her
after meeting by chance?

475
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,040
It’s so romantic of you, Your Highness.

476
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,130
She met me by chance.

477
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,490
But to me,

478
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,400
I couldn’t forget her
for even one glance.

479
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,510
Your Highness.

480
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,180
This doesn’t work in this place.

481
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,580
Zhou Fei has grown up.

482
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,940
I can’t make decisions for her.

483
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,300
Talk to her personally.

484
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,630
Miss Zhou, what do you think?

485
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,270
Xie Yun?

486
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,460
I heard you were here. This is great.

487
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,060
What are you coming for?

488
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,420
I...

489
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,910
I want to...

490
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,750
I want to marry Miss Zhou.

491
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,510
Father has agreed.

492
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,700
Xie Yun, what do you think?

493
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,820
Are these all for me?

494
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,510
Miss Zhou.

495
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,350
These are betrothal presents

496
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,150
His Highness prepared for you.
Do you like them?

497
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,660
She...

498
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,510
I don’t think

499
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,460
she likes any of this.

500
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,350
This blade looks good.

501
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,940
You have sharp eyes, Miss Zhou.

502
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
Mount Kunwu is said
to be sixty miles east

503
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,420
from the Yi River.

504
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,910
On the mountain is lots of copper
as red as fire.

505
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,150
Made of it,

506
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,390
the blade will cut jade like mud.

507
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,460
This is Kunwu,

508
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,350
the famous blade made of such copper.

509
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,300
What?

510
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,540
You’re also interested in this?

511
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,180
No.

512
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,700
I...

513
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,350
I just...

514
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,110
I just want to have a look.

515
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,510
Sorry, Xie Yun.

516
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,630
I should have told you.

517
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,940
After all,

518
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,540
you’re Miss Zhou’s close friend.

519
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,630
But if you don’t want us

520
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,350
to get married,

521
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,180
I will...

522
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,060
Zichen.

523
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,110
You want to marry me, don’t you?

524
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,540
Why did you ask him for permission?

525
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,500
You only need to ask me.

526
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,670
Come with me.

527
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,470
Wait!

528
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
Don’t follow up.

529
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,910
Tired?

530
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,430
Don’t push yourself.

531
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,060
I’m not tired. For you,

532
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,430
I would do anything impossible.

533
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,020
We just met a few times.

534
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,110
Why do you like me so much?

535
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,980
We grew up
under totally different conditions.

536
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,220
I must behave carefully
since I was little.

537
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,740
I can do nothing wrong.

538
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,740
But you’re always free and bighearted.

539
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,980
You’re the most special girl I’ve met.

540
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,470
So...

541
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,430
How passionate you sound, Your Highness!

542
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,150
But since I was little,

543
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,910
I’ve made a rule for myself.

544
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,670
Whoever wants to marry me

545
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,740
must have better martial arts.

546
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,540
Your Highness, would you like
to compete with me?

547
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,950
I...

548
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,950
I’ve seen your martial arts.

549
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,350
Miss Zhou,

550
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,910
you’re forcing me.

551
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,110
If you don’t want to compete, fine.

552
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,870
Leave as early as possible.

553
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,300
No.

554
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,950
Well,

555
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,390
Miss Zhou,

556
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,390
sorry for the offense.

557
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,910
Fei is great.

558
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,710
She tried to scare him away.

559
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,820
Bonehead, watch and learn.

560
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,190
Learn what?

561
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,260
It doesn’t work on him. Look.

562
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,740
Well, it doesn’t work on an idiot.

563
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,470
Nice move!

564
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,190
Are you alright?

565
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,980
You used great martial arts, Miss Zhou.

566
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,540
Do you get me wrong

567
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,430
or do you get yourself wrong?

568
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,300
Even if I’m fighting someone stronger,

569
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,710
I must have a try.

570
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,300
Or you couldn’t feel my loyalty.

571
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,950
Show your loyalty in our place?

572
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,870
You’ve overestimated yourself.

573
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,300
Everyone in your place is loyal.

574
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,870
I’ve never underestimated you.

575
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,220
Fine. How about this?

576
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,110
I’ve seen the betrothal gifts
you gave me.

577
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,670
I don’t like them.

578
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,060
I want the wild flower in the crevice

579
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,470
in the middle of Ximo River.

580
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,910
If you get it for me,

581
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,390
I’ll marry you.

582
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,540
If you fail,

583
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,980
leave in the way you come.

584
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,260
What do you think?

585
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,470
Fine. It’s a deal, then.

586
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,220
Doomed.

587
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,500
The Spinning Wire Formation
over Ximo River is still on.

588
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,150
The Spinning Wire Formation?

589
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,950
What is that?

590
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,950
What’s this?

591
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,820
The Spinning Wire Formation.

592
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,670
It’s as fast as the wind
and as sharp as a blade.

593
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,470
It’s made against robbers.

594
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,710
With this on,

595
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,110
who can get the wide flower
from the middle of the river?

596
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,740
I first met her

597
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,670
in the Ximo River.

598
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,950
I thought

599
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,190
she was the Weed Spirit in the river.

600
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,220
Your Highness,
would you still like a try?

601
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,150
I...

602
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,740
I’ll have a talk with him.

603
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,500
You’re no longer kids.
Could you stop eavesdropping?

604
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,350
In this world,

605
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,740
seems like only you can do it.

606
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,820
Xie Yun.

607
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,630
You...

608
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,710
You and Miss Zhou...

609
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,630
Did I... did I do something wrong?

610
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,190
Zichen, did your father really
allow you to come?

611
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,390
He ordered you to come?

612
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,020
I insisted on coming.

613
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,910
Father didn’t agree at first.

614
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,670
We even quarreled.

615
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,220
Zichen, you always say
you’re inferior to me.

616
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,500
But I can’t propose to my beloved girl

617
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,020
like you do.

618
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,910
If you really like her,

619
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,950
why don’t you tell her?

620
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,950
I’m dying. Even if I told her,

621
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,470
nothing would change.

622
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,220
I’m living a good life already.

623
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,350
Staying with her every day

624
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,950
makes me satisfied.

625
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,110
I want to be married to her.

626
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,300
Unfortunately, I...

627
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,020
But Xie Yun...

628
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,020
You’re a prince. How can you...

629
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,390
It doesn’t matter.

630
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,350
I should have been dead
in the war years ago.

631
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,740
I lived for extra years,

632
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,390
which was already a blessing.

633
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,390
I’ll certainly live in the way I like.

634
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,430
I prefer to teach students in this place

635
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,220
under her prestige,

636
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,910
and be a rent collector.

637
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,670
I feel my life satisfied, then.

638
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,300
Pretend I was married to her for peace.

639
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,060
What do you think?

640
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,630
Xie Yun, have you made up your mind?

641
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,740
Yes. The fiercer Fei is, the better.

642
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,780
In this way,

643
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,150
no one but me dares to marry her.

644
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,540
Fei?

645
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,060
Your Highness, did you understand?

646
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,740
You may leave us.

647
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
I...

648
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,430
Fei, you heard us?

649
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
I’m fierce?

650
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,940
Not really.

651
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,190
Not really?

652
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,630
No, no, you’re not fierce.

653
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,220
Zichen is young and naive.

654
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,250
Don’t take it seriously.

655
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,730
I don’t care what he said.

656
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,490
But...

657
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,320
I just heard someone said

658
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,770
he would like to be married to me.

659
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,360
Fei, you know that.

660
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,810
I was born with bad luck
and I won’t live long.

661
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,640
Bah!

662
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,120
What bad luck?

663
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,600
I haven’t despised you.

664
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,880
How can you despise yourself?

665
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,270
♪Travel freely♪

666
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,010
Miss Zhou.

667
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,910
♪With the flute♪

668
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,970
♪You got me caged in your heart♪

669
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,500
I never have good luck, good health

670
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,430
or even families.

671
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,500
Now I’ve got nothing, but a title.

672
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,980
I have no wealth and I’m dying.

673
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,670
My only betrothal present

674
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,950
is the wild flower.

675
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,740
If you don’t hate me for my short life,

676
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,980
please marry me.

677
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,710
With the landscape as our matchmaker,

678
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,910
we’ll share weal or woe.

679
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,820
We won’t leave each other unless we die.

You used such a great move
on the training ground.

691
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,260
Nice move. Let’s have a competition.

692
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,110
-Mr. Yang, I’ve got work to do.
-Just one competition.

Thank you, Mr. Xie.

How is it going?

699
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,470
Rest assured. I’m sure
Fei will be surprised

700
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,630
so that she’ll forget

the martial art thing.

702
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,390
Oh, there’s some vintage wine

703
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,300
in Hanshui Town near here.

704
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,710
It’s her favorite taste.

705
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,020
Could you

706
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,390
get one pot for me?

707
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,630
Hanshui Town?

708
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,980
Where the best dough figurines are sold?

709
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,910
Precisely.

710
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,020
You’re most familiar with this area.

711
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,910
Your problem is mine, Cousin-in-law.

712
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,710
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.

713
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,980
Thanks.

714
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,910
Bonehead, go down the mountain with me.

715
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,980
Go.

716
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,950
Man.

717
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,580
What you did on the training ground

718
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,950
was a nice move.

719
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,540
No. No. You used a better one.

720
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,260
No.

721
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,950
-If only Bonehead...
-Let’s teach each other.

722
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,820
-could be half as romantic as Mr. Xie.
-What do you think?

723
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,110
Let’s go. Go.

724
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,110
Let’s compete. Go.

725
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,020
I’ll go alone, then.

726
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,430
We’re busy up here.

727
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,110
You must tell our men

728
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,350
to strengthen the patrol
in and out of the Fortress.

729
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,740
Tomorrow,

730
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,500
we’ll celebrate Aunt’s birthday.

731
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,390
We mustn’t be careless on the patrol
outside the mountain, either.

732
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,190
We must be very cautious. Got it?

733
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,580
Aye!

734
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,020
Sheng.

735
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,190
