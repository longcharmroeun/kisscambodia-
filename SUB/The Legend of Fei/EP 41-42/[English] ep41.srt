If they’re not coincidences,

94
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,740
Yeah.

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,760
Since the former dynasty,

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,550
it has been haunting people.

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,870
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
was the treasure

98
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,320
taken out of our palace in the mutiny.

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,710
My grandfather buried it,

100
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,430
so that his descendants can
bring about an upswing.

101
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,430
Sadly, time brings great changes.

102
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,040
An upswing is nothing,

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,660
but a dream.

104
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,440
So,

105
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,760
I deceived myself and escaped.

106
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,150
I don’t know why,

107
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,130
but the Demons knew about the secret

108
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,920
so that two generations
of martial artists were involved.

109
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,300
It also resulted

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,970
in Yin Pei’s tragic life.

111
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,090
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
belongs to the Xiao family.

112
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,560
I’m a descendant of the Xiao family.

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,840
I should have buried it.

114
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,490
Don’t think too much.

115
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,490
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
has involved the whole martial world.

116
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,170
It’s no longer related to you alone.

117
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,800
Every one of us

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,210
has the duty to guard it.

119
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,560
Yeah.

120
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,890
Let’s take it back

121
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,210
and think of a way to keep it

122
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,210
so that it won’t hurt more people.

123
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,610
Mr. Xie, don’t think too much.

124
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,890
To get the tokens,

125
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,720
the Demons attacked our Fortress
a few times.

126
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
As long as my aunt is there,

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,210
we’re never afraid.

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,450
Let’s first take the tokens back

129
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,240
and meet my mother.

What’s on your mind?

133
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,890
I’m thinking...

134
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,280
I’ve been away from home
for such a long time.

135
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,000
When I suddenly go back,

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
I wonder

137
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,520
if she will beat me.

138
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,840
I don’t think she’ll beat you.

139
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,120
But she’ll certainly kick me out.

140
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,890
Think about it.

141
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,960
I first persuaded your father to leave.

142
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Then I took you away.

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
Think about these things...

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,770
Screwed.

145
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,770
What if your mother really beats me?

146
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,330
I can’t run away this time.

147
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,170
I don’t know what to do, either.

148
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,450
No way!

149
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,090
I must think of a way

150
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,050
to flatter your mother.

151
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,170
When you annoyed your mother,

152
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,720
how did you make her happy?

153
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I never tried to make her happy.

154
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,610
Only my father can make her happy.

155
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,170
Go ask him.

156
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,120
Forget it.

157
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,090
I’ll figure out a way myself.

158
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,120
Shall I write an opera

159
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,280
to flatter her?

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,210
Don’t worry.

161
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,090
When I write it personally,

162
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,890
I’m sure I’ll spread her fame

163
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,720
throughout the world.

164
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,330
Then my mother will surely kill you.

165
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,210
I can’t help you, then.

166
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,120
Fei, don’t leave me alone.

167

Let’s fight again.

172
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,000
No.

173
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,530
-Bonehead.
-Yan?

174
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,040
Are you challenging them again?

175
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,330
Yeah.

176
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,770
They’re so scared of you.

177
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,480
How will they compete with you again?

178
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,120
Yeah, Mr. Yang.

179
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,650
We won’t compete with you.

180
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,970
But aren’t martial artists supposed to

181
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,090
compete with each other,

182
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,410
regardless of life?

183
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,330
Yeah.

184
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,530
Mr. Yang.

185
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,000
We’ll go and guard the gate.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,210
-We’ll leave you alone.
-We’ll leave you alone.

187
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,090
Go. Go.

188
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,770
Don’t go!

189
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,730
How about this?

190
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,560
If you defeat me,

191
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,000
I’ll guard the gate for you for one day.

192
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,890
Come on.

193
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,680
You always say that.

194
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,480
But have you ever lost?

195
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,530
Let’s go. Go.

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
People with your sect

197
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,800
don’t practice martial arts every day.

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,680
And you don’t have courage at all!

199
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,410
Bonehead, what did you say?

200
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,040
Are you risking your neck?

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
-Mr. Yang, it’s a deal, then.
-Let’s fight.

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,480
-Decide the days on the number of us.
-Sounds interesting.

203
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,800
-Guard the gate for one day if you win.
-Yan.

204
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,970
-Come. Come.
-If we win,

205
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,740
-guard the gate for three days, okay?
-You’ve come, too?

206
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
All right.

207
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,480
Wait a minute.

208
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,770
Why must I guard the guard anyway?

209
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,360
Whatever.

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,890
Elder Zhang is our judge.

211
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,240
Don’t waste our time.

212
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Mr. Bai.

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,330
Give him a good lesson

214
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,000
so that he’ll suffer!

215
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,530
Watch it!

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
What? I didn’t agree to fight you.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,330
-You!
-The others

218
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,000
don’t deserve my time.

219
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,770
What’s your look?

220
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,890
He can’t defeat me at all!

221
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,850
Fight me, all of you.

222
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,210
Run! Run! Run!

223
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,850
Get down!

224
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,240
Give in, won’t you?

225
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,730
Give in to your poor martial arts?

226
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,210
How are my martial arts?

227
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,480
Great!

228
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,330
Go.

229
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
Yan, don’t go too far.

230
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,970
Mr. Yang, we lost.

231
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,600
You won.

232
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,890
What about me? I won, too.

233
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,040
Whoever won will go guard the gate.

234
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,480
Go, then. Who cares?

235
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,290
Are you going?

236
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,730
-Yes!
-Go, then.

237
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,560
Wait.

238
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,360
Mr. Bai.

239
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,160
Were you hurt?

240
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
No.

241
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Does he look like he was hurt?

242
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Silly girl. Take this.

243
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,770
See you.

244
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,330
Take care.

245
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,970
Go.

246
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,920
Coming!

247
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,240
Madam.

248
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,450
Madam, what’s wrong?

249
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,480
Did you have a relapse

250
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,160
of the old wound?

251
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,240
I’m fine.

252
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,360
Madam.

253
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,890
Go back to your room for a rest.

254
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,290
I’ll go get you a doctor.

255
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,000
No.

256
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,530
Didn’t I tell you?

257
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,850
Don’t tell anyone I was wounded,

258
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,330
especially when I’m having a relapse.

259
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,240
Uh...

260
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,600
Shall we get back for some rest?

261
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,890
Come on.

262
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,480
Come over.

263
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,730
Is that Miss Zhou?

264
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,560
Looks like her.

265
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,160
I think so. Go have a look.

266
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,730
Who are those people over there?

267
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,450
Who are they?

268
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,330
I’ll go have a look.

269
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,290
Well, hand over the work to us.

270
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,920
We come to take the shift.

271
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,530
You’ll work personally?

272
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,450
And me.

273
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,800
Miss Li.

274
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,560
Miss Zhou and Mr. Li are back!

275
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,850
It’s them!

276
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,530
Miss Zhou and Mr. Li are back!

277
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,040
My brother and my cousin are back?

278
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,090
Oh,

279
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,090
go tell Madam Li.

280
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,920
Aye.

281
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,480
Brother!

282
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,970
Brother!

283
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,730
Fei!

284
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,040
You’re finally back.

285
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,530
What happened?

286
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,770
Why are you guarding the gate?

287
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,000
Where are the others?

288
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,920
You have no idea.

289
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,480
He has been asking everybody
for a competition.

290
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,730
Others are fed up with him.

291
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,240
They then asked him to guard the gate

292
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
each time he challenges others.

293
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Then he keeps quiet for days.

294
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
I defeated him once.

295
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
Today, I guard the gate with him.

296
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,560
Very well.

297
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,040
When you help to guard the gate,

298
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,360
keep an eye on him.

299
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,600
Without my permission, he mustn’t leave.

300
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,850
You idiot!

301
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,290
I haven’t got in yet,

302
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,680
and you’re setting rules for me?

303
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,800
Don’t worry.

304
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,680
This is such a nice place.

305
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,530
Even if you kick me out,

306
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,730
I won’t leave.

307
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,410
Wonderful!

308
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,480
Aunt’s birthday is coming
in a couple of days.

309
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,530
I want to hold a big party for her.

310
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,120
You’re all back.

311
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,210
We’ll have fun this year!

312
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,530
Mother is having her birthday?

313
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,240
It’s the 13th day of the twelfth month
so soon?

314
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,360
Yeah.

315
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,040
You’ve been out of the Fortress.

316
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,090
You don’t even remember the date.

317
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,650
Let’s go.

318
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,770
Stay and work hard.

319
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,040
Guard the gate carefully.

320
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,450
Brother!

321
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,240
Chuchu.

322
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,120
Did you make trouble?

323
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,850
Did you?

324
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,240
Mother, we didn’t make trouble
when we were away.

325
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,770
Yeah, you didn’t.

326
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,920
You just punched Chu Tianyu,

327
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,480
killed Tong Tianyang

328
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,830
and fought against Lu Tiankuang.

329
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,450
They were mere Demons.

330
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,970
You always ran after danger?

331
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,300
You think you’re getting braver?

332
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,260
We were just going to tell you, Aunt.

333
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,820
We rushed all the way back

334
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,300
and didn’t even remember the date.

335
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,850
Luckily, we’re back in time

336
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,380
for your birthday.

337
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,850
Yeah, Madam.

338
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,180
Fei and Sheng were away from home
for such a long time.

339
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,700
They didn’t admit,
but they really missed you.

340
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,450
Right?

341
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,800
Take care of yourselves.

342
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,970
Don’t bother to miss me.

343
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,560
Chuchu.

344
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,800
You just learnt martial arts.

345
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,890
You had a hard time
when involved in so much trouble.

346
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,040
With everybody around,

347
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,250
we always came safely out of danger.

348
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,010
Madam.

349
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,040
Here we meet again.

350
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,370
Mother.

351
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,800
I asked him to come back with me.

352
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,560
I’ll get even with you later.

353
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,730
I heard about what had happened to you

354
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,090
through secret services.

355
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,370
You did a good job.

356
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,130
Demons like Tong Tianyang
should be killed.

357
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,730
Well done.

358
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,850
You didn’t disgrace our Fortress.

359
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,570
You also did a good job

360
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,400
in Liu’s Manor.

361
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,210
Thank you, Aunt.

362
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,040
Fei helped a lot

363
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
with many things.

364
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,490
You had a long trip.

365
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,680
Since you’re back,

366
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,400
have a good rest.

367
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,130
Mother.

368
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,040
We have brought you

369
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,330
several things.

370
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,610
What are they?

371
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,130
Tokens of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

372
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,450
I didn’t expect Mr. Chongxiao’s whisk

373
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,800
to be the last token.

374
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,450
Destiny makes fool of us.

375
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,400
People who guard the tokens

376
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
were all dead for them.

377
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,760
Even Father and Jinfeng were...

378
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,640
To get these tokens,

379
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,250
the Demons did all the dirty things.

380
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,760
Unexpectedly,

381
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,040
we have all the tokens now.

382
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,450
Each token

383
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,610
has gone through blood.

384
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,250
For a legend that isn’t sure to be true,

385
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,330
so many people have been involved.

386
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,490
Mother.

387
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,850
Now,

388
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,760
we have all the tokens.

389
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,370
The Demons will come sooner or later.

390
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,370
We should have a plan
as soon as possible.

391
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,010
We’ve collected the tokens.

392
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,560
The truth will come out soon.

393
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,400
Madam.

394
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,730
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

395
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,610
was the hidden trouble
of the former dynasty.

396
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,800
It’s more or less related to me.

397
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,920
As for how to deal with the tokens,

398
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,400
do you think...?

399
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,370
Let me keep the things.

400
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,560
I’ll think about how to deal with them.

401
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,680
Don’t bother about it.

402
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,130
Fine. We’ll be at your service.

403
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,610
You may leave.

404
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,860
<i>Repenting Hall</i>

405
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,400
Father.

406
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,450
Jinrong.

407
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,130
Father, is this for me?

408
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,680
It’s kids’ stuff.

409
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,090
I’ll keep it for you.

410
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,520
When you want it,

411
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,250
I’ll give it to you.

412
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,610
You’ve given it to me.

413
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,970
You can’t take it back.

414
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,760
Put it away carefully.

415
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,640
Don’t let anyone see it.

416
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,130
Let me put it on you. Come on.

417
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:59,304

418
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
Father. Father!

419
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,640
You’re just in time.

420
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,400
Father.

421
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,850
We both use Snow-breaking Blade.

422
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,870
Why do I use it more poorly than you?

423
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,090
I’ve made a blouse for you.

424
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,800
Come and have a try.

425
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,760
Father. I’m no longer a kid.

426
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,210
I can make it if I need one.

427
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,680
Nonsense.

428
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,920
Look at your blouses.

429
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,090
The sleeves are so short.

430
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,880
But you haven’t made a new one.

431
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,850
A girl like you is so stubborn.

432
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,800
I wonder who you’re like.

433
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,210
How will you live your life
after getting married?

434
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,800
Yitang has a good temper.

435
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,680
Father.

436
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,210
Take it back and try it on.

437
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,850
I can alter it if it doesn’t fit you.

438
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,640
Come on.

439
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,640
Jinrong.

440
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,970
Father.

441
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,450
Even before you died,

442
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,610
you didn’t tell me
the truth of the Bracelet.

443
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,250
I know you didn’t want us
to be involved.

444
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,250
I’m now wounded.

445
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,130
If the Demons come again,

446
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,950
what do we do?

447
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,730
Can I still defeat Shen Tianshu?

448
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,730
Father.

449
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,800
You didn’t want
to leave the burden to me.

450
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,520
How can I leave it
to the younger generation?

451
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,280
Madam.

452
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,640
Come in.

453
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Madam, you wanted to see me?

454
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,560
Dan.

455
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,250
Ask the secret services to gather spies

456
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,400
so that they can go to Demons Manor

457
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,330
and check what they’re doing.

458
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,850
Demons, what will they do?

459
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,370
Fei came back

460
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,160
with the other tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

461
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
The Demons haven’t known it yet.

462
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,610
Once they know,

463
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,840
they’ll all come and fight us.

464
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,740
What are you going to do, then?

465
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,760
Since we steal a march on them,

466
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,880
we can’t await our doom.

467
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,160
Waiting for their attack
will be the worst plan.

468
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,040
We should fight them by surprise.

469
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,920
You want to go to Demons Manor

470
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,100
and screw their nest?

471
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,040
But Demons Manor is heavily guarded

472
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,490
with a large number of minions.

473
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,040
We don’t have enough men.

474
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,880
I’m afraid we can’t take them down.

475
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
No.

476
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,800
We can’t attack Demons Manor

477
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,680
with our men.

478
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,800
What if I sneak in alone

479
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,350
and assassinate Shen Tianshu?

480
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,600
When Shen Tianshu dies,

481
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,280
the Demons will collapse.

482
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,680
The problem will be solved once for all.

483
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,210
But Madam, this is too risky.

484
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,520
It’s worth a try.

485
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,210
If I don’t go,

486
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,160
our place will be in danger.

487
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
Madam.

488
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,160
Think carefully about it.

489
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,450
You want to risk your life
to kill Shen Tianshu.

490
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,260
What do we do if you’re dead?

491
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,490
And Miss Zhou.

492
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,370
How sad she will be!

493
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,090
Madam.

494
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,850
Fei.

495
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,160
Do you remember the first time

496
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,530
I met you by Ximo River?

497
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,890
What?

498
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,440
You still miss the day
we risked the Spinning Wire Formation?

499
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,280
My cloud-impelling palm
isn’t unsurpassed.

500
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,530
But it is still unrivalled.

501
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,080
I nearly failed to dodge.

502
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,960
Weird.

503
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,920
When did you have a secret teacher

504
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,320
and learn this from him?

505
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,410
When I stayed with Mu Xiaoqiao,

506
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,890
we talked about 100 Destructive Palms.

507
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,610
I studied it by myself.

508
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,730
But... wait...

509
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,370
Him?

510
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,370
What did you talk about?

511
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,160
Come on, Zhou Fei.

512
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,410
You shouldn’t have done that.

513
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,250
You used to be sparing in speech.

514
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,530
When I teased you,

515
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,940
you became angry.

516
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,010
Why did you talk so much
with someone else?

517
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,440
When?

518
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,680
When you lay in bed by the East Sea.

519
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,560
Good.

520
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,730
You did that when I couldn’t see you.

521
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,770
Wait...

522
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,130
You like a sexy man like him?

523
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,080
I can do this, too.

524
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,960
Behave yourself.

525
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Fei.

526
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,850
I’m going
to take up my profession tomorrow,

527
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,800
living on writing operas.

528
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,770
It would be better

529
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,320
if I had my own troupe.

530
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,250
It would be the best

531
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,800
if we could stand up to Yuyi Troupe.

532
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,170
Here you go again.

533
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,490
Don’t you fear
my mother will punch you?

534
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,610
Well, before your mother finds it,

535
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,850
let’s run away

536
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,920
and travel all over the world.

537
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,890
No way.

538
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,530
My mother is having her birthday.

539
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,310
I’m afraid there’s much fun to see here.

540
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,610
Then after seeing the fun,

541
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,040
let’s leave

542
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,160
and travel around the world, okay?

543
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,410
We will go

544
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,890
to any place you like.

545
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,250
Go see the sea by Penglai Island,

546
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,490
go fishing by the Dongting Lake

547
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,920
and go basking in the south.

548
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,680
All right.

549
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,200
Let’s go basking in the south.

550
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,730
It’s good for your health.

551
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,130
There are many beautiful flowers

552
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,890
in the south,

553
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,040
which you can’t see here.

554
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,960
Girls there like
to put flowers in their hair.

555
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,890
They look much prettier
than gold hairpins.

556
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,530
By then,

557
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,920
I’ll get many beautiful flowers for you.

558
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,370
Smile if you agree.

559
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,040
Come on. Have some.

560
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,680
Mother, you wanted to see me?

561
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,010
Be seated.

562
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,130
You’re handling business?

563
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,160
Yes.

564
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,960
Now, we have all the five tokens.

565
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,490
We must strengthen our defense.

566
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,770
Or when the Demons come,

567
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,740
we will be hurt.

568
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Don’t worry.

569
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,320
If the Demons

570
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,800
come to us,

571
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,730
I’ll kill them.

572
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,530
Fei.

573
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
Xie Yun has

574
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,650
a complicated background.

575
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,500
All kinds of connections are with him.

576
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,530
If you’re related to him,

577
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,650
and get involved,

578
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,490
I’m afraid you can never get rid of it.

579
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,200
Mother.

580
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,770
I care for Xie Yun.

581
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,370
Such political disputes

582
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,890
have nothing to do with me.

583
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,250
I also hear

584
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,130
the Bone-chilling on him
is getting worse.

585
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,370
You know he’s dying.

586
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,890
Is it still worth your time?

587
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,610
Just because he’s dying,

588
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,770
even a single second

589
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,250
can be precious to me.

590
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,730
I’m not afraid of the future.

591
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,250
I only want to seize the day.

592
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,280
Since I’ve decided to love him only,

593
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,850
I will not regret.

594
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,280
Have you made up your mind?

595
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,280
Don’t do stupid things on impulse.

596
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,560
I saw him

597
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,850
die in front of me.

598
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,090
For him,

599
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,960
I will do all the stupid things.

600
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,020
I will protect him myself.

601
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,250
Bone-chilling is the most poisonous,
so what?

602
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,940
Before he dies,

603
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,280
I’ll keep looking for the antidote

604
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,650
and fighting against it.

605
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,730
Fine.

606
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,370
It’s your decision.

607
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,440
Do it as long as you don’t regret.

608
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,490
As long as he’s Xie Yun.

609
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,960
Mother.

610
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,920
How...

611
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,250
How are you?

612
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,610
I’m fine. I just had a cold.

613
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,850
Well, take care.

614
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,410
I’ve got business to do.

615
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,650
You may leave.

616
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,650
Aunt.

617
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,010
Sheng.

618
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,960
What are you coming for?

619
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,440
These are visiting cards
from martial artists down the hill.

620
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
They knew about your birthday

621
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,920
out of nowhere

622
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,440
and wanted to celebrate it.

623
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
But we had rules

624
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,250
that we should seldom contact others.

625
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,370
Our disciples didn’t know what to do.

626
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,920
They wanted me to ask you.

627
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,730
Return the visiting cards to them.

628
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,770
This is our family dinner.

629
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,320
There’s no room for others.

630
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,850
Fine. I’ll go handle it.

631
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,010
Sheng.

632
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,960
Isn’t it the map

633
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
for our Fortress?

634
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,160
Yes.

635
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,530
It’s the map

636
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,490
for our defense and sentries.

637
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,010
Sheng.

638
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,490
We’ve suffered big problem this time.

639
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,730
We’re short of men

640
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,080
and we’re rehabilitating our place.

641
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,770
Since we have all the tokens

642
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,680
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

643
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,530
from today on,

644
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,730
I want you and Bai Neng

645
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,080
to gather our disciples

646
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,490
and strengthen the defense
for everywhere.

647
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,010
Aunt, it’s such a big responsibility.

648
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,680
Why do you suddenly leave it to me?

649
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,010
Li Sheng.

650
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,320
Can you handle it?

651
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,610
Yes, no problem.

652
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,370
People say you’re good
at making strategies.

653
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,680
You did a good job in Liu’s Manor.

654
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,070
You got famous in the martial world.

655
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,320
Aunt.

656
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,200
People flatter me.

657
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,490
Well, keep doing a good job.

658
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,680
Don’t waste your talent.

659
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,530
I see, Aunt.

660
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,800
Commander-in-chief.

661
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,920
What brings you here?

662
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,920
Last time, you left so angrily.

663
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
I thought you made up your mind

664
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,850
to break up with us.

665
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,830
You must be kidding, Lord Shen.

666
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,080
Zhou Fei and Xiao Chuan are back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

667
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,730
Li Jinrong will have
her fortieth birthday soon.

668
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,040
Zhou Yitang will leave his battalion
to go back home.

669
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,800
You want me to assassinate him?

670
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,920
When Zhou Yitang is dead,

671
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,920
no one will lead the army
of the former dynasty.

672
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,890
They’ll no longer be a threat.

673
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,920
Xiao Chuan is dying.

674
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,160
I don’t need to kill him.

675
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,920
As long as you kill Zhou Yitang,

676
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,440
Xiao Chuan’s army will be gone.

677
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,770
Commander-in-chief.

678
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,320
I’m different

679
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,240
from Qiu Tianjin or Chu Tianyu.

680
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,610
They prefer to work for you

681
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,580
like a dog.

682
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,760
But I...

683
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,760
I never do a money-losing business.

684
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,850
Commander-in-chief, see you.

685
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,090
Lord Shen.

686
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,800
Everyone in this world
can be bought with something.

687
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,210
I’m afraid

688
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,520
you don’t like to give me what I want.

689
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,890
Lord Shen,

690
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,170
I don’t understand that.

691
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,970
It doesn’t matter.

692
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,480
Somebody, walk him out.

693
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,130
Don’t move when you’re poisoned
with my Twining Thread.

694
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,240
Or you’ll die sooner.

695
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,040
You’re Pathetic Clam?

696
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,890
I am.

697
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,650
For a mad girl,

698
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,060
he transferred the poison to himself.

699
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,000
He was just too stupid.

700
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,210
He abandoned
his unassailable martial art.

701
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,760
You claimed to be our enemy,
didn’t you?

702
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,690
You’re the only master alive
in the martial world.

703
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,080
After you die,

704
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,320
who else can destroy us?

705
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,970
Even without the North Blade,
the Mountain Sword and I,

706
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,840
there will be new masters.

707
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,040
You bully Jiuniang
when she’s still young.

708
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,720
Given some time,

709
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
she’ll frighten you
with peerless Yellow and Green Palm.

710
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,520
There’re always new masters.

711
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,170
It’s the way the world functions.

712
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,320
Talking stubbornly when you’re dying?

713
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,560
You’re just dying
for interfering with other’s business.

714
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,610
Who did you remove the poison
for Duan Jiuniang?

715
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,560
If you have something

716
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,650
to tell Duan Jiuniang,

717
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,650
I can pass it on to her.

718
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,210
Shen Tianshu.

719
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,560
You have good martial arts.

720
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,800
But you never understand
people’s hearts.

721
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,650
I have nothing to tell her.

722
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
I don’t need her to thank me, either.

723
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,000
I just want her to live a good life

724
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,560
and not meet you again.

725
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,970
Let him go.

726
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,280
He just has the last strength.

727
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,760
He was so stupid

728
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,480
that he took over the insoluble poison,

729
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,280
ruining his South Blade

730
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,210
and the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

731
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,320
We’re going to attack the Fortress.

732
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,760
Hope we won’t suffer
like we did last time.

733
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,670
<i>Fei is back, when will you come back?</i>

734
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,480
Father.

735
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,970
It’s been months since you left.

736
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,410
You’re finally back.

737
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,450
Pull out your blade.

738
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,040
Awesome!

739
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,930
From now on,

740
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,480
you’ll take care of the Fortress.

741
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,210
Elders.

742
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,040
You’re the witnesses.

743
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,450
-Yes.
-Don’t worry.

744
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,240
What’s wrong, Sister?

745
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,720
Jinfeng.

746
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,170
Father asked us
to send a secret letter to Jiankang.

747
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,450
Nothing else?

748
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,520
Father said it was a secret letter
to Mr. Zhou

749
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
and we must give it to him personally.

750
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,190
What, Sister...?

751
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,520
Weird.

752
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,000
I could have sent the letter alone.

753
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,320
When all our elite disciples go,

754
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,560
won’t we be more eye-catching?

755
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,000
Sister, you defeated Father
the other day.

756
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,240
Does he think you’re strong

757
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,080
so that he wants us to go with you

758
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,450
and fight for military exploit
in Anping Army?

759
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,480
Nonsense.

760
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,610
Since our Fortress was built,

761
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,280
we’ve never interfered with politics.

762
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,370
Yitang worked for the former dynasty.

763
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,130
He can work in the army now.

764
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,130
Father won’t let us get involved.

765
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,610
Then why did he send us?

766
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,370
Sister, what are you doing?

767
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,800
It’s a secret letter!

768
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,760
Jinrong.

769
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,410
I’m badly poisoned and can’t be cured.

770
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,560
The Demons will certainly attack us

771
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,480
with Yu Wenzhi.

772
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,410
Hope you can leave
with young disciples from the trouble.

773
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,720
I’ll ask Yitang
to protect you for a while.

774
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,450
After the Demons leave,

775
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,320
hope you can come back to our Fortress

776
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,840
and rebuild it.

777
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,760
<i>From Li Zheng</i>
Remember not to be impulsive.

778
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,720
Do not fight who you can’t defeat.

779
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,370
General Wang!

780
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,800
Our Fortress is in crisis.

781
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,280
General Wang!

782
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,720
My father Li Zheng has never

783
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,720
asked you for help.

784
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,520
But for righteousness,

785
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,130
he helped you a few times!

786
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,850
Now he’s in danger!

787
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,370
I beg you

788
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,210
to help us!

789
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,040
The situation is critical.

790
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,130
Many enemies cast covetous eyes on us.

791
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,170
It’s not that I don’t want to help him.

792
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,690
But I’m too weak to go.

793
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,480
Jinrong. Jinfeng.

794
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,160
I’m sorry.

795
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,690
Wang Lin!

796
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,930
We have helped your army!

797
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,800
But I must stick to the national cause!

798
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,450
Let’s go back

799
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,400
and fight it out with them!

800
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,720
Father!

801
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,650
Father!

802
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,170
Father!

803
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,560
-Father!
-Father! Father!

804
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,690
Father, are you alright?

805
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,410
Father.

806
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,610
Jinrong, keep the Bracelet carefully.

807
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,450
Give this silk bag

808
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,930
to Jiuniang.

809
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,890
Promise me

810
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,610
you won’t be hard on her.

811
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,800
She’s not to blame for my poisoning.

812
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,610
Father, say no more!

813
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,560
I’ll go get the doctor!

814
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,080
Jinrong.

815
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,040
Jinrong.

816
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,320
I’ll leave the Fortress

817
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,210
to you.

818
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:12,520
Yitang, Wang Lin didn’t send the troops.

819
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,080
You did, right?

820
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,210
Yes.

821
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,130
Do you remember

822
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
our rules?

823
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,360
Recite them to me.

824
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,080
Fighters like us rid
the world of evilness,

825
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,790
deliver people from misery,

826
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,240
and bring righteousness to the world.

827
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,400
We don’t seek immortal fame.

828
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,410
We aren’t afraid of being misunderstood.

829
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,970
But we must not go
against the law of heaven,

830
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,650
the law of earth,
nor our own conscience.

831
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,610
Father!

832
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,040
Master!

833
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,370
Father!

834
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:15,600
