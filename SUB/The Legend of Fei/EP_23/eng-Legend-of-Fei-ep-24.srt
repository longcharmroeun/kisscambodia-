<i>Legend of Fei</i>

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 24</i>

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
Alright.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,190
Get some rest while you still can.

19
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,550
Miss Wu,

20
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
you’re safe here.

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Wait for me.

22
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,030
I’ll be back soon.

23
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,550
Li Sheng,

24
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,600
Demons are heartless and cruel.

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,080
Don’t put yourself

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,460
in danger.

27
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,030
Don’t worry.

28
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,520
Members of the Fortress

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,640
are the best of the best.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,810
And we know this place the best.

31
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,100
Those Demons

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
aren’t our match.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,080
I know.

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,030
I’m sure Fei is more than capable

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,960
to capture Yu Wenzhi

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,910
and put an end to everything.

37
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,330
I’m sorry

38
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,550
that you still have to live in fear

39
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,810
even in the Fortress.

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,650
I’m fine.

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
I have no fear

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,630
as long as I’m with you.

43
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,680
Nothing will happen to you

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,010
or the Fortress.

45
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,650
Sheng...

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,300
I have faith in you.

47
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,190
Chuchu,

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
wait for me.

49
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,860
<i>My dear wife...</i>

50
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,470
Fei.

51
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,880
Mr. Ma.

52
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,620
<i>My dear wife...</i>

53
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,550
Coming.

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,110
Come in, Fei.

55
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,270
Mr. Ma,

56
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,720
are the ten top talents

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,980
I asked for ready?

58
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,500
Oh, that.

59
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,460
Fei,

60
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,790
are you sure about what you’re doing?

61
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,700
I am.

62
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,370
Mr. Ma, I know you care about me,

63
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,040
but

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,160
I’m not a little girl anymore.

65
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,030
It’s time for me to pitch in.

66
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,370
Look,

67
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,620
I’m not nagging you,

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,480
but you know, most talents

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,880
were just like you

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,270
who believed they could save the world

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,440
on their own

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,830
but only got themselves killed

73
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,940
eventually.

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,070
I watched you grow up

75
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,510
and the last thing I want

76
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,600
is to see you end up like them.

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,550
You know?

78
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,600
I do.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,270
Although they were brave,

80
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,640
they lost their lives

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,000
for nothing.

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,270
I’m not that kind of person.

83
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,760
And

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,380
I’m not going to die.

85
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
That’s why I need the others

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,320
to guard the Fortress with me.

87
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,380
Alright.

88
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,210
You’ve made your decision.

89
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,140
I understand that.

90
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,700
I’m counting on you

91
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,880
for information

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,360
later.

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
People you asked for

94
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
are in the Hall of Elders.

95
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,050
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

96
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,270
Fei.

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,270
One more thing.

98
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,860
I believe

99
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,300
Mingfeng must’ve

100
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,160
betrayed us long ago.

101
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,220
It’s better not

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,300
get involved

103
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,790
with the court.

104
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,820
Alright.

105
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,590
I see.

106
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,510
Luckily, Fei and I

107
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,350
always took this path

108
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,440
to sneak out when we were little.

109
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,880
Check the front.

110
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
Yes.

111
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,370
How did they get here?

112
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,540
Someone is there.

113
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,200
Go! Go!

114
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,320
Stop!

115
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,290
Stop!

116
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Stop there!

117
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,920
Stop! Go!

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Stop!

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,720
Stop!

120
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,910
Weed Spirit is coming downhill.

121
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,000
Two Demons and their lackeys are there.

122
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,500
They outnumber her.

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
Zhang.

124
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,550
We’ll hold the fort and give orders.

125
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,830
Yes.

126
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,760
Ma,

127
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
check all posts.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
Arrange them for defense.

129
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,110
Yes, I’m on my way.

130
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,760
Deng Zhen,

131
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
you and Li Sheng take our men

132
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,030
to guard every entry.

133
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,630
Yes.

134
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,250
Deng Zhen,

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
we’re shorthanded.

136
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,840
What to do?

137
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,230
The first gate is the key

138
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,200
and must be heavily guarded.

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,230
If we lose it,

140
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,080
Feihong Bridge is the next.

141
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,710
That should be

142
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,320
our second line of defense.

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,560
What if we lose that, too?

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
What to do then?

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,330
In that case,

146
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,470
Demons can charge into our Fortress.

147
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,390
We’ll be in grave danger.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,590
How dare Demons and Yu Wenzhi

149
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,030
raid Chunhui Town and harm the innocent

150
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,590
in the name of suppressing bandits!

151
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,990
That’s unforgivable!

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,290
I think there’s more to it.

153
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,150
Yu Wenzhi is calculating and scheming.

154
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,370
If he intended to isolate the Fortress,

155
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,760
he wouldn’t need those civilians.

156
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,280
Are you saying

157
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,350
they’re up to something else?

158
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,660
You aren’t that stupid.

159
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,780
Fortress of the Forty-Eight is renowned.

160
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,080
Attacking it

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,670
without a cause

162
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,000
will raise condemnation.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,350
I believe

164
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,670
he needs a proper excuse

165
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,250
at this point.

166
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,620
So

167
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,520
he’s trying to pin the abduction

168
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,110
on our Fortress,

169
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,350
portraying us as bandits.

170
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,050
Correct.

171
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,300
That will justify

172
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,500
their raid.

173
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,980
You aren’t too dull.

174
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,980
Where is she?

175
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,130
She was here just now.

176
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,050
Go.

177
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,490
Take that way.

178
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,660
Yes.

179
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,610
Let’s go.

180
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,810
Go!

181
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,740
Come!

182
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,450
Xie Meimei,

183
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,250
where do you think Yu Wenzhi will camp

184
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,930
as the Commander in Chief?

185
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,180
It should be easy to organize defense,

186
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,780
such as a walled-in enclosure.

187
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,530
Crowded dwellings
in the southwest are ruled out.

188
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,780
And

189
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,450
it should be at a convenient location

190
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,250
for supplies

191
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,580
and retreat.

192
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,220
The northwest leads to mountains

193
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,430
with blocked roads.

194
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,060
So that won’t be it.

195
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,910
If he isn’t in any of those places,

196
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,090
where exactly is he?

197
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,530
If you ask me.

198
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,450
the official’s residence in the east

199
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,100
ticks all the boxes.

200
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,300
Yu Wenzhi is most likely to be there.

201
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,490
What about the hostages?

202
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,450
Where are the civilians he captured?

203
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,420
Civilians?

204
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,100
There’s an ancestral hall

205
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,420
with enough space.

206
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,610
They’re probably kept there.

207
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,010
Fei, stick to the priority.

208
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,050
Track down Yu Wenzhi first.

209
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,340
I understand.

210
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,500
But I can’t
turn a blind eye to the others.

211
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,050
Can you

212
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,490
check the ancestral hall

213
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,930
while we look for Yu Wenzhi?

214
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,100
Keep me updated.

215
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,710
Yes.

216
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,610
We haven’t recovered

217
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,690
from the huge loss

218
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,500
brought by the previous attack.

219
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,570
It’s too soon

220
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,220
to go back,

221
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,610
don’t you think?

222
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,450
Your troops are well-trained, Commander.

223
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,340
Why don’t you ask them

224
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,690
to finish the job?

225
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,050
Lord Shen,

226
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,220
your members have been there once.

227
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,900
They know that Fortress

228
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,690
better than my people,

229
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,990
hence the best fit
for the second attack.

230
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,420
Lord.

231
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,690
What’s up?

232
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,450
They’re out as expected.

233
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,860
What do we know?

234
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,610
I received a tip-off,

235
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,010
saying those of the Fortress

236
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,820
are out to capture you.

237
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,100
They’re highly skilled.

238
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,450
We must stay alert.

239
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,610
Commander,

240
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,080
security should be tightened.

241
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,570
No need.

242
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,050
Let them in.

243
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,090
What?

244
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,780
Let them in.

245
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,600
We can play along

246
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,070
and catch them once and for all.

247
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,450
Commander,

248
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,450
what do you say

249
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,930
about the deployment

250
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,870
of our forces?

251
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,930
You and your men

252
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,310
should lead the attack.

253
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,120
If you mean to preserve your strength,

254
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,160
I don’t think I can still trust you.

255
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,160
Alright.

256
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,420
If so,

257
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,340
I’ll attack

258
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,300
from Ximo River with my troops

259
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
while you take the gate.

260
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,860
They’ll be caught in the middle.

261
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,540
Deal.

262
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,100
Deal.

263
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,740
I’ve finally got them off my tail.

264
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,180
That was so close.

265
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,610
Let us out! Let us out!

266
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,220
Help!

267
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,930
Help!

268
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,810
-Let us out!
-Let us out!

269
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,660
Stop!

270
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,810
Let us out!

271
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,300
Let us out!

272
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,130
Enough!

273
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,450
-Let us out!
-Let us out!

274
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,660
Don’t look at them.

275
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,340
The dead can’t be brought back to life.

276
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,900
Focus on the living ones.

277
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,180
We must do something

278
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,420
or the town will be ruined

279
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,660
before we catch Yu Wenzhi.

280
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,540
Zhou Fei,

281
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,690
civilians are caged
in the ancestral hall.

282
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,690
And...

283
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,180
And some have been tortured.

284
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,980
Fei,

285
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,860
calm down.

286
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,300
Don’t forget what we’re here for.

287
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,340
Saving them now

288
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,940
will only alert the enemies.

289
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,940
Yu Wenzhi,

290
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,850
I’ll find you, bastard!

291
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,580
Fei.

292
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,900
Change of plans.

293
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,540
Both Yu Wenzhi and the civilians

294
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,970
are important.

295
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,660
Let’s split up.

296
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,730
You guys

297
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,610
hide in houses near the ancestral hall.

298
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,180
People there know

299
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,660
you’re with the Fortress

300
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,960
and will surely help you.

301
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,650
Wait for my order.

302
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,540
Once Yu Wenzhi is captured,

303
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,060
get the civilians out

304
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,660
when you hear the whistle.

305
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,260
Yes.

306
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,730
Follow me.

307
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

308
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,300
Xie Meimei,

309
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
let’s go get Yu Wenzhi.

310
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,610
You’ve got the look

311
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,000
and the brain.

312
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,630
Knock it off!

313
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,370
I can’t help growing fond of you.

314
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,700
What to do?

315
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,660
Hold it.

316
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:55,260
<i>Tian’s Mansion</i>

317
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,210
Tianxian,

318
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,780
while I’m out,

319
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,330
you stay here.

320
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,580
Lord,

321
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,580
may I ask...?

322
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,700
I don’t believe

323
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,520
a word Yu Wenzhi says.

324
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,740
Stay with him in the name of protection.

325
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,540
Watch his every move.

326
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,710
Yes.

327
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,330
Pass my order.

328
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,780
We wait until Shen Tianshu

329
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,900
breaks into the Fortress.

330
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,850
Those inside

331
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,470
will flee to Ximo River.

332
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,490
Then we can attack

333
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,940
to reap what others have sown.

334
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,380
<i>Tian’s Mansion</i>

335
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,780
<i>Tian’s Mansion</i>

336
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,660
<i>Tian’s Mansion</i>

337
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,730
Xie Meimei.

338
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,180
Hey,

339
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,940
can you teach me Footwork?

340
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,820
It can be useful to me.

341
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
We’re going to need it

342
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,330
to seize Yu Wenzhi anyway.

343
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,940
The highest level of the Footwork

344
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,210
is about integration.

345
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,090
It’s untraceable and invisible.

346
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,900
First, imagine yourself
as the wind, water

347
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,540
and shadow.

348
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,580
That kind of skill

349
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,010
is usually practiced by assassins.

350
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,850
The South Blade

351
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,970
is too noble

352
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,780
to learn that skill.

353
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,060
All that is an excuse to turn me down.

354
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,210
Fine. I won’t force you.

355
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,300
Let go!

356
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,300
Hey,

357
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,540
what does Yu Wenzhi look like?

358
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,820
Why ask?

359
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,660
Do you want to be
a concubine in the palace?

360
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,160
I’m sorry.

361
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,250
That’s Yu Wenzhi.

362
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,250
He’s most concerned about his safety.

363
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,850
How come he’s out
with only a few guards?

364
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,660
Something is off.

365
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,940
Fei,

366
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,330
where are we?

367
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,210
At the foot of the mountain.

368
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,420
Technically,

369
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,970
it still belongs to your Fortress

370
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,660
and houses tons of skilled members.

371
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,300
Were you the Commander in Chief,

372
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,180
would you

373
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,130
send all Demons away

374
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,580
and hang out in the street

375
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,310
with a few guards?

376
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,930
Yu Wenzhi is luring us out.

377
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,150
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

378
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,310
could only catch me in their dreams!

379
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,700
You’re wise, Commander,

380
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,420
by misleading them into thinking

381
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,400
you’re still at the base camp.

382
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,170
This place must be a trap.

383
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,540
We cannot rush in.

384
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,660
Fei,

385
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,420
get out of here with your men.

386
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,600
What do you mean?

387
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,720
What about the civilians

388
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,780
and that villain?

389
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,020
Are all your people trustworthy?

390
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,850
What makes you think
there are rats among us?

391
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,210
I don’t have the proof yet,

392
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,610
but I have a feeling in my guts.

393
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,300
Your guts tell you to trust no one?

394
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,420
Fei,

395
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,370
betting on trust is risky.

396
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,820
You could lose everything,

397
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,770
you know?

398
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,850
I know.

399
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,670
I can’t afford it.

400
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,580
Neither can I act

401
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,700
simply based on your hunch.

402
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,660
I don’t think

403
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,890
I can do that either.

404
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,580
Think about it.

405
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,940
If we leave now,

406
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,180
both the Fortress

407
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,780
and the civilians will be in danger.

408
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,550
All our efforts will be in vain.

409
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,690
You have a point.

410
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,550
Hey,

411
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,480
I propose a compromise.

412
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,330
Let’s first get the civilians out.

413
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,460
That’ll probably mess up their plan.

414
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,420
In that case,

415
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,700
we can lie in wait

416
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,290
to catch Yu Wenzhi off guard.

417
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,630
Look,

418
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,540
we can split up.

419
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,300
I’ll distract those guards

420
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,410
while the rest of you
go rescue hostages.

421
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,680
Sure.

422
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,130
Protecting me is your only task.

423
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,420
What happened to Spinning Wire

424
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,940
cannot happen again.

425
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,700
You should know

426
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,490
which side you’re on.

427
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,460
Go, go, go!

428
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,780
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>
Thanks! Thank you!

429
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,140
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>

430
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,850
Don’t be scared.

431
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,900
We’re sent by the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight to save you.

432
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Mother!

433
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,130
We’re safe now.

434
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,700
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>
Escort them to a safe place.

435
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,250
Yes.

436
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,540
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>
-Thanks. -Thank you so much.

437
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,260
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>

438
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,700
Let’s go.

439
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,240
Array!

440
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,610
-Array!
-Array!

441
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,820
Let’s go.

442
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,090
Strike again!

443
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,540
Kill them!

444
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,900
Who’s that?

445
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,210
Shen Tianshu.

446
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,540
Lord,

447
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,700
I’m sorry

448
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,110
that I failed to break in.

449
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,130
Change the position!

450
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,850
Now, you little cowards

451
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,970
are holing up in there.

452
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,010
Do you remember
what happened in Huarong?

453
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,420
Many were burned to death in the inn.

454
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,430
Although I saved one of your members,

455
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,250
you had him killed.

456
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,370
Eventually,

457
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,130
that old hen Wang died

458
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,460
to cover you.

459
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,310
Ms. Wang?

460
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,040
Didn’t you say

461
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,940
she and Chenfei

462
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,590
are on their way back?

463
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,180
They’ve passed away.

464
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,180
I’m sorry, Deng Zhen.

465
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,420
Do you expect me

466
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,930
to clean up your mess?

467
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,940
Deng Zhen!

468
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,460
Shen Tianshu,

469
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,970
I’ll kill you!

470
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,090
Guard the gate!

471
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,940
Yun Xiao,

472
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,010
retreat to Feihong Bridge!

473
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,180
Let’s go!

474
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,460
Open the gate!

475
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,970
Charge!

476
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,900
Let’s go!

477
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,850
Let’s go!

478
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,700
That brat

479
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,970
has got some skills.

480
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,330
Cover us!

481
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,490
Release the whistling arrow!

482
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,060
Be careful.

483
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,210
What’s going on?

484
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,370
Li Sheng and Deng Zhen failed.

485
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,660
Guard the Fortress.

486
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,250
Hang in there, Deng Zhen!

487
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,820
Leader,

488
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,250
I’m sorry.

489
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,940
Archers,

490
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,250
follow me.

491
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,180
I failed in my duty.

492
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,250
No,

493
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,180
Deng Zhen.

494
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,660
There was

495
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,900
a massacre in my village.

496
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,280
Ms. Wang

497
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,290
saved me

498
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,330
and treated me

499
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,540
as her own grandson.

500
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,600
Otherwise,

501
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,940
I wouldn’t have

502
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,210
come here

503
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,190
and met all of you.

504
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,230
I’m lucky enough

505
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,630
to have you

506
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,820
as my sworn brother

507
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,820
and Ms. Wang as my grandmother.

508
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,180
My life is worth it.

509
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,610
Deng Zhen! Deng Zhen!

510
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,300
Shields!

511
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,460
Charge.

512
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,540
Stay in line.

513
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,330
Once the smoke is gone,

514
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,250
they’ll be exposed.

515
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,570
Li Sheng,

516
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,260
no arrows!

517
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,500
Escort Deng Zhen back for treatment.

518
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,610
Go back, all of you.

519
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,220
What about you?

520
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
We won’t leave you here alone.

521
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,330
-Listen to me.
-Yes.

522
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,610
That’s to protect the Fortress.

523
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,260
Go!

524
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
-Li Sheng!
-Go!

525
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,610
Leave!

526
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,980
Go back!

527
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,180
-Go!
-Li Sheng!

528
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,850
The first gate is the key.

529
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,740
Once we lose it,

530
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,530
Feihong Bridge is the next.

531
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,740
That should be

532
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,770
our second line of defense.

533
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,980
<i>Kerosene</i>

534
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,300
<i>Kerosene</i>

535
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,060
<i>Kerosene</i>

536
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,980
We can’t lose the second gate.

537
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,300
<i>Kerosene</i>

538
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,420
Kerosene!

539
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,660
<i>Kerosene</i>

540
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,420
Line the bridge with kerosene.

541
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,850
Set it on fire

542
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,610
when necessary.

543
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,260
Go back!

544
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,020
Retreat!

545
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,330
Get out of here!

546
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,700
Go! Go!

547
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,740
-Retreat!
-Go!

548
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,570
Sheng!

549
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,570
Let him be.

550
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,220
We can use some rest.

551
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,570
Stay alert.

552
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,570
Anything from Gu Tianxian?

553
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,770
Yes.

554
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,220
Lord Gu said

555
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,980
Yu Wenzhi was quiet.

556
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,020
He didn’t go to the designated location.

557
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,500
Just as I expected.

558
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,570
Tell Ma Jili

559
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,850
to send more archers

560
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,770
to the southeast, southwest

561
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,090
and northwest posts.

562
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

563
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,900
Zhao,

564
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,130
let me go out.

565
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,290
Report!

566
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,770
We’ve lost the first gate

567
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,020
and treated to the Feihong Bridge.

568
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,090
It’s time for me

569
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,500
to join the battle.

570
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,770
Fetch me my spear.

571
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,770
Zhang,

572
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,770
now isn’t the time to be hot-tempered.

573
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,290
Other than the first gate,

574
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,610
we have people
at the Bridge and the inner gate.

575
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,180
How long

576
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,020
can they hold?

577
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,530
The enemies have broken in

578
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,020
as if they’re unstoppable.

579
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,570
Yet you’re telling me to hide here.

580
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,810
Deng Zhen, Li Sheng and Yun Xiao

581
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,900
are our own members.

582
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,700
-Don’t you trust them?
-I...

583
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,900
If you leave for the front,

584
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,460
who will give the command?

585
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,170
Fei,

586
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,810
do what you have to.

587
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,770
The blade

588
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,090
is still in your hand.

589
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,500
Guys,

590
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
don’t you know

591
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,830
what we are here for?

592
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,270
That is to capture Yu Wenzhi alive.

593
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,290
Ignore what’s happening in the Fortress.

594
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,460
Think about it.

595
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,020
Our members

596
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,180
and Elders are all there.

597
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,110
Aren’t they stronger than us?

598
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,610
Hasn’t Shen Tianshu come before

599
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,670
and got kicked out?

600
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,090
That’s right.

601
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,610
Divide yourselves into three groups.

602
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,370
Take the civilians to safe places

603
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,940
and protect them

604
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,610
until we repulse Yu Wenzhi
and Demons’ attacks.

605
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,530
-Yes.
-Yes.

606
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,180
Follow me.

607
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,610
This way. Let’s go.

608
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,810
This way.

609
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,940
How’s the Fortress?

610
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,610
Sweetie,

611
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,770
where are you going?

612
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,220
I can join my elder brother

613
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,290
to kill bad people and protect everyone.

614
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,290
You’re brave.

615
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,980
Can you promise me something?

616
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,570
Yes.

617
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,570
Come.

618
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,130
Sit.

619
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,420
Can you wait here?

620
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,810
Your brother will pick you up

621
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,500
once he wins the battle.

622
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,420
Alright.

623
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,220
From now on,

624
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,770
you should practice hard

625
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,260
to be a hero like him.

626
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,260
Why haven’t we heard anything?

627
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,020
How are they?

628
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,770
Have they

629
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,810
all been killed?

630
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,090
What should we do?

631
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,900
We’re doomed this time,

632
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,090
aren’t we?

633
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,980
We won’t surrender no matter what.

634
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,610
If those bastards break in,

635
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,420
I’ll kill them at all costs!

636
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,610
Yes. Kill them at all costs!

637
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,810
-Please bless us.
-Kill them at all costs!

638
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,130
Calm down, everyone.

639
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,900
Attention, please.

640
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,370
Settle down.

641
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,940
Look,

642
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,420
others are outside
putting their lives on the line.

643
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,660
How could we go out

644
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,740
and distract them?

645
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,610
We’d only be a burden.

646
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,740
-That’s right.
-She’s right.

647
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,610
Merciful Buddha.

648
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,570
Fei,

649
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,610
are you giving Yu Wenzhi up?

650
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,850
I see.

651
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,900
You’ve driven the others away.

652
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,810
If there are moles among them,

653
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,220
they’ll send wrong messages

654
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,330
to buy us more time.

655
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,180
We still have to try our best

656
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,560
to seize Yu Wenzhi.

657
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,290
Are there other ways

658
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,610
to find him?

659
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,710
Given the chaos we’ve caused,

660
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,220
if my guess is correct,

661
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,980
he’ll

662
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,340
tighten the security.

663
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,080
So

664
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,700
he should be somewhere

665
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,630
heavily guarded.

666
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,850
Commander,

667
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,850
they’ve got

668
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,910
the civilians out.

669
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,140
How come they didn’t rise to the bait?

670
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,900
I think

671
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,920
that’s only part of their plan.

672
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,330
I guess

673
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,050
they must’ve known

674
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,130
that I’m somewhere else.

675
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,740
Get Tianxian back.

676
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,570
And

677
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,120
tighten the security here

678
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,460
for my safety.

679
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,090
I’ll arrange the best members

680
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,250
of Mingfeng to protect you.

681
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,270
Go south.

682
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,770
Hey,

683
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:06,760
that’s north.

684
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,940
Just tell me left or right, can’t you?

685
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,290
While we patrol,

686
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,460
you take care of master,

687
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:22,980
understand?

688
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,770
<i>Stationery</i>
Yes.

689
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,700
Let’s go.

690
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,850
Our men

691
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,980
have tightened the security here.

692
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,380
No one can get in.

693
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,480
Good.

694
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,280
Anything about
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

695
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,840
Not yet.

696
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,700
According to the spy sent previously,

697
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,180
the South Blade’s granddaughter Zhou Fei

698
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,220
is in charge of the squad outside.

699
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,740
And she’s

700
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,020
with a young man

701
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,220
whose footwork is excellent.

702
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,150
A young man with excellent footwork.

703
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,550
What’s wrong?

704
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,020
Nothing.

705
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,850
That reminds me

706
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,670
of one of my old opponents.

707
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,290
This seems

708
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,290
to be the best-guarded place.

709
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,770
I bet Yu Wenzhi has moved here.

710
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,500
Kou Dan must’ve had skilled members

711
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,850
of Mingfeng to protect him.

712
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,700
Fei,

713
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,610
stay calm.

714
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,180
Let’s wait and see first.

715
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,910
Where are you going?

716
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,770
Sir,

717
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,900
I’m going back to the village.

718
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,200
Hold on.

719
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,900
I’ve been told

720
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,330
that someone is
walking downhill sneakily.

721
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,260
Speak! Where were you?

722
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,840
I...

723
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,580
I...

724
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,630
Stop!

725
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:18,904
