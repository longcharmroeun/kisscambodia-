<i>Legend of Fei</i>

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 23</i>

17
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,400
Where are Ms. Wang and Chenfei?

18
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,230
If I tell him now...

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,720
What’s wrong?

20
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,550
Nothing.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,270
Ms. Wang and Chenfei

22
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,440
travelled a bit slower than us.

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,000
They’re on their way, I guess.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,950
Why didn’t they come back with you?

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
When they protected us,

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
they were wounded.

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,630
Wounded? Was it serious?

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,680
Not serious.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,510
That’s fine, then.

30
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,720
Time is running out.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,270
Let’s go to the Fortress.

32
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,600
We must defend our Fortress.

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,240
Only in this way

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
can Ms. Wang and Chenfei

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,030
come back safely.

36
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,110
Did you travel all the way

37
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,000
and sneak into our fortress

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,320
just for sightseeing?

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,750
You’re wrong.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,600
We come here

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,910
to offer amnesty.

42
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,270
As long as you abandon this place

43
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,080
and work for commander-in-chief,

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
you will be

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,600
treated very well.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
What commander-in-chief?

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,670
Yu Wenzhi, isn’t he?

48
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,190
You think he’s a powerful man.

49
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,910
But we don’t care about him.

50
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,800
And you, as a martial artist,

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
you work for local authorities

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,550
and kill other martial artists!

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,830
Don’t you fear you’ll be mocked?

54
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,600
And Kou Dan.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,390
She suddenly betrayed us.

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,390
What does she want?

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,550
Me?

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,720
I want nothing special.

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,720
I just want the token

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,800
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

61
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,190
You know what?

62
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,190
If Mr. Gu hadn’t told me,

63
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,750
I wouldn’t have known

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,000
our sect was close to him

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and our token was right in the fortress.

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
You ignorant woman.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,880
What the hell are you talking about?

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
What Color of Ocean and Heaven?

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,240
To hide it,

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,630
the previous head of Mingfeng

71
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,470
sent Fisherman personally.

72
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,440
Because of that,

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Fisherman was poisoned
by Pathetic Clam with Bone-chilling.

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
Bone-chilling is

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
one of the eight evilest poisons.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,750
Fisherman was supposed

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,320
to be dead now.

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,800
But to keep him alive,

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,550
the previous head took him here.

80
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,520
That old dog.

81
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,360
I didn’t expect him to live

82
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,910
until he got old.

83
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,960
If he hadn’t been killed,

84
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,160
he would live forever!

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,070
Fei.

86
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,160
Earlier,

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,550
news came from our secret services,

88
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,920
saying that we had

89
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,200
a great heir of the South Blade

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
who killed Zheng Luosheng.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,350
I wondered

92
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,880
who the great heir would be.

93
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,510
Seems like

94
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,110
you must be

95
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,880
the great heir.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,230
What?

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,040
You killed Zheng Luosheng?

98
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,880
What’s your point?

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,320
You know exactly

100
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,070
what I mean.

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,160
It’s farsighted of Leader Li.

102
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
In the name of helping people,

103
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,510
she’s been satisfying her own desire.

104
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,830
Shut up!

105
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,550
If you keep misleading people,

106
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,830
I’ll cut you into pieces!

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,110
Elders.

108
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,670
How innocent you are!

109
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,550
If my guess is right,

110
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,880
there are tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

111
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,320
Leader Li has one.

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,830
General Wu Fei has one.

113
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,200
I’m sure Yin Wenlan had one, too.

114
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,670
That one was very likely

115
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,070
to be taken away by Zheng Luosheng.

116
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,670
Leader Li first got back
General Wu’s daughter

117
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,640
and sent her own daughter

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,160
for a random reason

119
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,000
to find Zheng Luosheng.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,230
She killed her enemy and built prestige.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Now,

122
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
she must have three tokens.

123
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,880
She may have found more.

124
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,390
What a good plan!

125
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,830
Nonsense!

126
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,160
Ask her

127
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
and you’ll know if it’s nonsense.

128
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,010
It’s nearly time.

129
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,950
Our main force

130
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,070
are coming up soon.

131
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,390
Hurry! Drag them in!

132
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
Sheng!

133
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,600
Everybody.

134
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,070
The Demons
in the Forbidden Forest have left.

135
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,830
No enemies have been found

136
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,270
in other places.

137
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,920
But, many subordinates of Timber Wolf
are coming up,

138
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,510
getting closer to the outer gate.

139
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,720
Where are Fei and other elders?

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,000
They are

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
confronting Kou Dan and Gu Tianxian

142
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,600
in the forest by Ximo River.

143
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
This may be the enemies’ plot.

144
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,390
First, they pin down the Elders

145
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,480
and our elite men

146
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,110
by Ximo River.

147
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,640
Then they break through the outer gate

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,320
when we have weak defense.

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,760
Under such circumstances,

150
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,270
we will have enemies

151
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,200
front and rear.

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,670
We must take a risk.

153
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,230
Bai.

154
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,110
Go inform the Elders and Fei.

155
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Remember to bluff.

156
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,040
Tell them loudly

157
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
that we have eliminated all enemies

158
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,040
and took control of the outer gate.

159
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Aye!

160
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,270
Deng.

161
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,230
We must take back the outer gate asap.

162
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,590
Yun Xiao.

163
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,640
Get our men

164
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,110
to defend this place.

165
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,230
Aye.

166
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,470
The rest of you.

167
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,790
Take up your weapons

168
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,880
and let’s take back the outer gate!

169
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,030
Aye!

170
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,550
Whether you die or live

171
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,440
depends on yourselves.

172
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,790
Let me tell you.

173
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,550
First, put down your weapons

174
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,960
and surrender.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
Second,

176
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,760
Miss Zhou,

177
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,960
give me the things

178
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,470
you got from the Wu family
and Zheng Luosheng.

179
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,640
Third,

180
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
please write a letter

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,030
to Leader Li

182
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,790
and ask her to come back early

183
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,440
and give me the token

184
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,910
she has kept.

185
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,760
Not harsh conditions, huh?

186
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
No.

187
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,910
Not harsh at all.

188
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey, you!

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,710
I can get everything done for you,

190
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,350
as long as you kneel down
and call me Father,

191
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,550
and kowtow to us ten times.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
We’ll get you everything

193
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,450
you expect.

194
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,110
Report!

195
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,470
Elders,

196
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,520
the defense in Forbidden Forest
is ready.

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,320
The Demons there have been killed.

198
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
Report!

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,790
Disciples of Mingfeng
have been eliminated.

200
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,960
Spinning Wires have been removed.

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,520
Report!

202
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,880
We’ve taken back the outer gate!

203
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,910
The men with Timber Wolf were stopped.

204
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,320
The defense is ready.

205
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
That’s what they’ve got?

206
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,280
So weak!

207
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,230
They seem to be in a bad condition.

208
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,200
Wrong. It’s not bad.

209
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
but very bad.

210
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Shoot!

211
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,550
Mr. Gu.

212
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,320
You travelled all the way here.

213
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,670
Why don’t you get in and have some tea?

214
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,710
Let’s sit down and talk.

215
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,790
You...!

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,350
Miss Zhou.

217
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,910
You sound sharp!

218
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,840
I like that!

219
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,790
Ready to leave.

220
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,670
Hurry if we’re leaving.

221
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,350
Why?

222
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,280
Fisherman had a backup plan.

223
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,470
After being shut down,

224
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,520
the Formation will restart in two hours.

225
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,280
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

226
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,710
I thought we would win.

227
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,030
I never expected to leave
from Ximo River.

228
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,000
Everybody.

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,790
They’re trying to run away.

230
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,350
Besiege them!

231
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,840
Don’t let them run!

232
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,670
Stop!

233
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
I haven’t had enough fun of fight yet.

234
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,030
Stop!

235
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,110
Mr. Zhang, the condition isn’t clear.

236
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,960
Don’t run after the tottering foe.

237
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
Don’t?

238
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,230
Then we won’t run after them?

239
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,150
We’ll watch the traitor running away?

240
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,200
Mr. Deng takes charge of the defense.

241
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,440
In case of emergency,

242
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,000
he could have kept a low profile.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,030
He didn’t need to declare the condition

244
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,960
in such a big way.

245
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
So, I guess,

246
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,320
they were just bluffing.

247
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,470
Right?

248
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,590
Li Sheng sent us here.

250
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,200
How bold you are!

251
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
Zhang.

252
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
You’re getting old,

253
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
but you haven’t made any progress.

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,550
You can only bark or bite.

255
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,670
You aren’t even as sensible
as a young girl.

256
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,110
I didn’t know they were bluffing.

257
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,200
Somebody!

258
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,960
Leave twice as many people
to defend Ximo River.

259
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,440
Search the mountain

260
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,790
and don’t miss anyone of Mingfeng.

261
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,380
Aye.

262
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,280
Fei, come with me to the Hall of Elders.

263
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,880
Your mother is away.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
We should treat you as an adult.

265
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,670
I want to check the pavilion
in the middle of the river.

266
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,840
Kou Dan and her men
stopped the Spinning Wire Formation.

267
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,230
I want to make sure it will restart

268
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,750
and take Fisherman back.

269
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,000
There’s the sound of fight.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
Everybody, listen.

271
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,840
Rush in immediately!

272
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,470
Shut the gate!

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,910
Hold on! Hold on!

274
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,470
Shut the gate!

275
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,960
Hurry. Shut the gate!

276
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,790
Are you alright?

277
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,670
Yes.

278
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,320
The gate has been shut.

279
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,760
What do we do now?

280
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,760
Put up defense again for the outer gate.

281
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,640
They’re colluding with inside enemies.

282
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,150
When the latter know

283
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,790
we have repelled the outer enemies,

284
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,520
they won’t take rash action.

285
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,520
Well, Sheng.

286
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,910
I’ll take care of this place.

287
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,910
Take the wounded disciples away

288
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,080
for treatment

289
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,220
in case of their sneak attack.

290
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,200
Okay.

291
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,030
Chuchu.

292
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,880
Would anything happen

293
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,400
to Fei or my brother?

294
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,840
Yan.

295
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Do you know

296
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,230
where the wounded men are kept?

297
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,670
The injured area, I guess.

298
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
Take me there, then.

299
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
I know some medical skills.

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
Maybe I can help.

301
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
But...

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,520
Fei asked us to stay here.

303
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Yan.

304
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,110
Everybody is doing

305
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,350
whatever they can.

306
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,030
No one is unoccupied.

307
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,840
You used to protect me.

308
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,790
Now the Fortress is in danger.

309
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,200
I should help, too.

310
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,150
Fine, then. Let me take you there.

311
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,310
Fei.

312
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,230
We’ll all have the day.

313
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,590
It’s his destiny.

314
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,400
You freaked me out!

315
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,830
What are you doing?

316
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,110
Why are you coming again?

317
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,280
How annoying!

318
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,560
His hands are still warm.

319
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,310
Maybe he can make it.

320
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,760
Go get someone to save him!

321
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,960
Go!

322
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,790
Bone-chilling is

323
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,940
the No.1 poison.

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,920
Poisoned people die with chilling faces.

325
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,900
That’s how it was named.

326
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,590
Why did you tell me this?

327
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,490
Reborn Pill is said to detoxify it.

328
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,970
But whoever takes it
will be easily short of water.

329
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
All his life,

330
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,690
he must live
where there’s rich water vapor.

331
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,190
So?

332
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,570
After he died,

333
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,700
you would find his hands still warm
within a short time.

334
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,350
Calm down.

335
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,230
Take distracting thoughts
out of your mind

336
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,710
one by one

337
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,160
and throw them away.

338
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,160
Then you’ll feel

339
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,470
the direction.

340
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,110
Close your eyes,

341
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,520
feel it with your heart,

342
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,280
and calm down.

343
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,070
Lord, report from the mountain.

344
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,230
Mingfeng’s spies failed.

345
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,040
They’re coming down with Mr. Gu.

346
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,560
Both gates
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

347
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
have been taken back.

348
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Leave.

349
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,420
Aye.

350
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,720
Lord, what do we do now?

351
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,100
Don’t be anxious.

352
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,780
Against such strong enemies,

353
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,730
I must have a backup plan.

354
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
Besides,

355
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,950
commander-in-chief is helping us.

356
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,950
From now on,

357
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,920
<i>Yu Wenzhi</i>
to put an end to resistance,

358
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,270
lock everyone up,

359
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,560
male or female, strong or weak!

360
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,150
Send more men to defend
the granary of Chunhui Town.

361
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,510
And make sure all families

362
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,440
hand in all their grain.

363
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,320
Leave not even a single grain of rice
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

364
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,230
Aye!

365
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,360
You, search one family after another!

366
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,200
Aye.

367
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,910
Without the granary of Chunhui Town,

368
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,120
I’ll see how long they can last.

369
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,440
There’s really something wrong
with the Spinning Wire Formation.

370
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,440
Zhou.

371
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,230
A message from down the mountain

372
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,440
that Yu Wenzhi is suppressing bandits

373
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,680
with his private soldiers.

374
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,510
He wants to shift the blame to us.

375
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,870
Many people are locked up.

376
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,030
Suppressing bandits?

377
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Only ordinary people live in the town.

378
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,840
Who can be bandits?

379
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,150
I’m right.

380
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,630
Seems like

381
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,510
they won’t easily leave.

382
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,110
Demons Manor colludes
with Yu Wenzhi’s private soldiers.

383
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,200
This time,

384
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,320
they must be fully prepared.

385
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,390
There will be a desperate fight.

386
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,870
It is serious.

387
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,510
Will you send a message to Leader

388
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,270
so that she’ll come back soon?

389
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,840
I don’t even know where my mother is,

390
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,390
not to mention sending her a message.

391
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,510
Demons Manor is attacking us

392
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,390
with Yu Wenzhi’s private soldiers.

393
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,230
Such news spreads very quickly.

394
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,270
My mother will hear of it soon.

395
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,150
Fei.

396
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,390
Time is running out.
Restart the Spinning Wire Formation

397
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,150
to keep this place safe.

398
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,110
Then, we’ll discuss the solution.

399
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,110
Bai.

400
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,720
Go and call our disciples together

401
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,030
to gather in the Hall of Elders.

402
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,230
I’ll meet you

403
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,630
after restarting the Formation.

404
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,910
Aye!

405
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,660
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

406
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,440
Sit down for some rest.

407
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,390
Excuse me!

408
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,510
Come over.

409
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,360
Take care of him.

410
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Yan, are you alright?

411
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,200
Miss Chuchu.

412
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,990
What happened to Yan?

413
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,390
She isn’t used to the smell

414
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,510
and goes out.

415
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,750
Why are you here?

416
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,080
I know some medical skills.

417
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
I want to come for help.

418
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
You’re wounded?

419
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Sheng, come and sit down.

420
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,390
Let me cleanse your wound.

421
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,440
I’m fine.

422
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,230
It’s someone else’s blood, I guess.

423
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,080
It should be cleansed, too.

424
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,990
Sorry.

425
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,720
I thought you would be safe

426
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,990
when you came here.

427
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,230
I didn’t expect this.

428
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,750
Don’t say that.

429
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,320
It’s not your fault.

430
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,930
In Huarong,

431
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,110
Fei killed Qiu Tianjin for me.

432
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,490
But it didn’t satisfy me.

433
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,840
I know

434
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,110
he wasn’t the only man

435
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,440
who killed my parents.

436
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,390
His whole sect did that.

437
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,750
Now your home is in danger, too.

438
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,800
I will never forgive them.

439
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,110
Miss Chuchu.

440
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,270
You should have stayed away,

441
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,680
instead of living in hatred.

442
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,600
The whole world is in chaos.

443
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,270
Who can live a stable life?

444
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,440
Fei told me not to be scared

445
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,630
when there were troubles.

446
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,680
Responsibility matters more than life.

447
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,440
I must be responsible
for my families and friends.

448
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,910
I’ll also be responsible for myself.

449
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,750
I’ll go check the wounded disciples.

450
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,800
Let me check on you.

451
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,390
Lord.

452
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,840
I had meant to attack them by surprise!

453
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,150
Unexpectedly,

454
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,300
they successfully defended the outer gate!

455
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,150
Otherwise,

456
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,820
I would have taken over
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight!

457
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,480
<i>All Respect</i>

458
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,080
It’s easy to defend it
but hard to attack it.

459
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,150
We can’t easily take it down.

460
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,080
We’ve got other plans.

461
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
Don’t be anxious.

462
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,200
And you...

463
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,440
Ms. Kou.

464
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,150
The Spinning Wire Formation
wasn’t destroyed

465
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,750
and it would restart in two hours?

466
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,150
I didn’t expect that, either.

467
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,800
The Spinning Wire Formation
could still work

468
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,870
after it was destroyed.

469
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,110
It’s not all her fault.

470
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,320
If someone had got up the mountain

471
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,440
with private soldiers,

472
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,200
we would have taken down

473
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,630
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

474
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
Mr. Shen,

475
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,440
you were also radical.

476
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Before my soldiers arrived,

477
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,030
you attacked anxiously.

478
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,480
You alerted them,

479
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,510
didn’t you?

480
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,600
Fine.

481
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
Then,

482
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,710
please kindly instruct us.

483
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,360
Focus.

484
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,150
Imagine what Fisherman would do

485
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,270
if he were here.

486
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,800
It works?

487
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,990
Don’t be too sad.

488
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,990
Or Fisherman would be sad, too.

489
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,600
He had taught me

490
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,150
a lot of things.

491
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,030
Everyone thinks

492
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,510
Fisherman used to be a greedy spy

493
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,400
who only worked for money.

494
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,270
But since I knew him,

495
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,160
he has been kind and fair.

496
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,750
I think,

497
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
after he was poisoned,

498
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,190
he must have regretted

499
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,750
for what he did.

500
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,840
That’s why he decided to stay here,

501
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,470
turn over a new leaf

502
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,270
and live a new life.

503
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,320
He has guarded the Formation

504
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,270
all his life.

505
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,470
When the Formation stays,

506
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,750
he stays, too.

507
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,200
Fei.

508
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight

509
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,190
matters a lot to you, right?

510
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,990
Of course.

511
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,080
But I’m too weak.

512
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,400
Everyone treats me like a kid.

513
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,990
In case of any danger,

514
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,920
they only ask me to leave.

515
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,190
When you grow up,

516
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,920
those who support you

517
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,800
will gradually leave you.

518
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,430
You will suffer countless hardships.

519
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,800
You will find your life always at risk

520
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,560
and you can’t slacken off at any moment.

521
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
But do you know

522
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,470
that’s already the luckiest thing

523
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,970
in this world?

524
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,470
You have the sharp blade.

525
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,360
When you fight,

526
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,950
you can break through obstacles

527
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,990
and go anywhere you want.

528
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,640
Aren’t you lucky enough?

529
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,270
In such a world,

530
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,510
a lot of people
have lost their families.

531
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,800
But you know what?

532
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,560
Most of them could do nothing

533
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,080
but drift with the current,

534
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,120
because of their poor background

535
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,750
or poor qualification.

536
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,020
But you...

537
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,390
You can choose.

538
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,860
I’ve made a choice.

539
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,560
Heroine.

540
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,230
Look forward,

541
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,710
care for the living men

542
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,850
and find a way out.

543
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,360
Miss Zhou.

544
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,880
Don’t be impulsive!

545
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,510
We’re going to the Hall of Elders.

546
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,670
Yes.

547
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,160
After I cut off the murderer’s head,

548
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,120
I’ll bury it with Fisherman.

549
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,990
<i>Insightful and Open-minded</i>

550
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,560
Now, we must send more men

551
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,360
to defend all posts.

552
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,190
Demons Manor and Yu Wenzhi

553
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,400
are hurting people in the town.

554
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,120
But it may be a bait.

555
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,430
Now we should stand still

556
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,800
and do nothing.

557
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,470
What are you talking about?

558
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,400
I’m so fed up with the way you think!

559
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,800
They’re already encamping themselves

560
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,880
at the foot of our mountain!

561
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,840
Right near us!

562
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,560
But we are hiding here as cowards

563
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,510
and do nothing!

564
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,880
Who do you mean cowards?

565
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,600
You!

566
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,640
We don’t know
what our enemies are up to.

567
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,430
Rash actions will lead to more losses.

568
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,950
Don’t find excuse for your cowardice.

569
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,800
Elder Zhang. Elder Zhao.

570
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,230
Quarreling is useless.

571
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,270
It doesn’t help at all.

572
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,360
All right. All right. I’ll stop.

573
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,080
Don’t get angry.

574
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,600
Let’s calm down

575
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,400
and figure out what to do.

576
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
I think

577
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
they must be up to something

578
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,230
when besieging Chunhui Town.

579
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,840
Think about it.

580
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,600
Chunhui Town is a mere pass

581
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,470
for our communication.

582
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,030
Or more importantly,

583
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,230
we transfer provisions through it.

584
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,160
Do they want to

585
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,080
cut all our provisions

586
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,950
so that we don’t have anything to eat?

587
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,360
Then we’ll be in big trouble.

588
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,400
Yes. But don’t forget.

589
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,230
People in Chunhui Town

590
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,800
have been suppressed as bandits.

591
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,920
Some were caught

592
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,160
and some were killed.

593
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,950
Will we just let that happen

594
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,230
and do nothing?

595
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,510
How cruel we are!

596
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,470
Uh...

597
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,470
I’ve got a plan.

598
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,470
You’re a girl.

599
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,230
Why do you always...

600
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,320
Fine. Fine.

601
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,750
Show us your good idea, then.

602
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,350
Tell us about it.

603
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,230
Elder Zhang.

604
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,430
In my opinion,

605
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,560
our stored grain

606
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
can hold out for a moment

607
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,670
if we defend our place to the last.

608
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,670
But people in Chunhui Town

609
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,160
will suffer.

610
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,950
We can’t help, then.

611
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,080
We can’t have our sect destroyed.

612
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,160
We must defend our place

613
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,510
before getting any supply.

614
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,560
We have no choice,

615
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,710
but to ignore the people
in Chunhui Town.

616
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,270
We can’t do that, Elder Zhao.

617
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,230
If people in Chunhui Town

618
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,800
hadn’t lived with us as families,

619
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,710
we wouldn’t have built our fortress

620
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,400
into such a wonderful land.

621
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,990
In case of danger,

622
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,840
how can we leave them alone?

623
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,990
So,

624
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
I will go

625
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,920
and save them.

626
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,190
Good point!

627
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,320
Fei.

628
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
I trust you.

629
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,230
You decide

630
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,670
when to save them.

631
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,030
I’ll call on our men

632
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,950
to teach those bad guys a lesson!

633
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,710
Wait.

634
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,800
Elder Zhang.

635
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,840
There’re many enemies down the mountain.

636
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,840
If we all go down now,

637
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,510
we’ll have a weak defense up here.

638
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,510
I’m afraid they’ll attack us then.

639
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,640
Fei.

640
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,880
Neither of the options works.

641
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
What do we do, then?

642
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,470
I’ll go.

643
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,230
We should catch the leader first.

644
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,990
I’ll go catch Yu Wenzhi

645
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,600
and threaten others with him.

646
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,470
Then I’ll protect the local people

647
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,320
and our fortress.

648
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,120
Demons Manor is guarding the town

649
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,270
with Yu Wenzhi’s soldiers.

650
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,950
I really wonder

651
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,190
how you can catch Yu Wenzhi.

652
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,030
There’re men with Mingfeng,
Demons Manor and soldiers.

653
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,710
They aren’t from the same place

654
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,510
and they’re pulled together.

655
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,710
I believe they’ll quarrel.

656
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,920
Fei, you want to...

657
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,670
I don’t know what’s exactly happening.

658
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,270
But I can take actions accordingly.

659
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,840
Fei, you can’t go.

660
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,990
That’s too dangerous.

661
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,120
If your mother knows,

662
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
she will not let you go.

663
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Mr. Ma, don’t use my mom as an excuse.

664
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,750
She’s away from here.

665
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,120
Who knows where she is?

666
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,270
I’m afraid it’s too late

667
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,270
if we wait until she comes back.

668
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,670
Mr. Ma.

669
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,750
Prepare ten elite disciples

670
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,470
who can go catch Yu Wenzhi with me.

671
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,990
Okay.

672
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,160
We’ll use the whistling arrow

673
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,030
for communication.

674
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,430
All right.

675
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,600
Let’s stick to our plan.

676
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,560
Everybody,

677
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,160
take care.

678
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,030
Fei.

679
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,880
I heard you were going
to catch Yu Wenzhi.

680
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,600
Who told you?

681
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,840
Who’s got a loose tongue?

682
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,270
Keep it.

683
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,160
Chuchu.

684
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,670
It’s your treasure.

685
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,920
I...

686
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,800
When I go,

687
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,400
I may not come back.

688
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,950
If I keep it, it may be more dangerous.

689
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,750
Fei.

690
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,950
This is precious.

691
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,880
But if you can’t come back,

692
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,840
we’ll lose the fortress, too.

693
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,360
It’ll be in bigger danger.

694
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,350
Fei.

695
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,660
You’re the only one I trust.

696
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,840
Don’t worry.

697
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,470
I won’t let you down.

698
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,990
Brother.

699
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,510
I hear Yu Wenzhi colludes
with Demons Manor,

700
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,080
and is trying to fight us.

701
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,120
Fei went down to catch him.

702
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,270
I want to defend our fortress

703
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,270
with you!

704
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,670
Stop it.

705
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,320
Are you trying to stop me again?

706
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,640
No.

707
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,880
This time,

708
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,920
I’ve got a more important secret task

709
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,190
for you.

710
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,750
Secret task?

711
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Do you remember the path

712
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,600
we usually went to

713
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,640
when going downhill for fun?

714
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,840
The one where Fei took us back.

715
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,190
Go that way

716
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,270
and send this letter
to the secret service

717
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,430
near Hanshui Town.

718
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,190
Ask them to deliver it to Uncle.

719
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,470
I’ve explained what happened

720
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,430
in the letter.

721
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,920
I believe he’ll send troops to help us

722
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,400
as soon as he receives it.

723
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,990
Why do you want me

724
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,360
to do such a small thing?

725
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,640
Let someone else do it.

726
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
I want to defend the fortress with you!

727
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,750
Yan, this is a very important letter.

728
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,400
I must entrust it to someone I trust.

729
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,920
Our fortress is at stake.

730
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,600
Whether we can survive

731
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,270
depends on you.

732
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:43,430
Everyone is fighting desperately
for our fortress.

733
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,710
Okay, Brother.

734
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,160
I will deliver the letter.

735
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,920
You must be very careful.

736
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,510
I believe you won’t let me down.

737
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,950
Go thirty meters south.

738
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,840
Here are all houses.

739
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,430
<i>Ancestral Hall of the Li Family</i>
Then go north.

740
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,840
Miss Zhou.

741
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,360
You can’t even distinguish directions.

742
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,750
When you arrive in Chunhui Town,

743
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,190
can you really find Yu Wenzhi?

744
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,510
Give me one night.

745
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:08,470
I will figure out the map.

746
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,950
Let me go with you.

747
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,990
I promise I won’t talk much.

748
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,190
You don’t need to thank me.

749
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,710
Just marry me, if you’re grateful.

750
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,943
