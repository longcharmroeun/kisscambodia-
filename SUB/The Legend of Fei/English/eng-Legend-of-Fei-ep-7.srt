<i>Episode 7</i>

17
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,340
I think she’s afraid

18
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,370
of me taking something more precious.

19
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,610
The liquor

20
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,250
is fresh and good.

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,430
But I prefer the one my dad made.

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,780
The beauty is still gorgeous.

23
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,910
Whenever I see her,

24
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,220
I fall for her.

25
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,150
Fei.

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,470
Fei?

27
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,460
Liquor is

28
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,320
to be tasted.

29
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,020
You drank too fast.

30
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you drunk?

31
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,080
Here, put on the blanket.

32
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,530
Go away.

33
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,790
Sir,

34
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,230
do you have a blade this long

35
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,000
with a narrow back

36
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,390
and a sharp edge?

37
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,480
May I ask

38
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,670
why do you need it?

39
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,640
As a gift to a girl.

40
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,200
Sir, if you excuse me.

41
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,640
This isn’t the way
of getting a girl’s heart.

42
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Girls prefer things like

43
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,510
make-up products.

44
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,580
But she,

45
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,390
she likes blade.

46
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,110
But the price is...

47
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,090
What’s your offer?

48
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Well...

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,790
Deal.

50
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,760
Okay, okay, okay.

51
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,670
Sir, please wait.

52
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,790
I’ll get it for you.

53
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,600
I’ll get it for you.

54
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,270
Please wait a second.

55
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,110
I’ll be back soon.

56
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,620
Sir, welcome.

57
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,830
Blade is nice.

58
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,060
I like girls carrying a blade.

59
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,180
What did I do last night?

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,910
I can’t remember anything.

61
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,950
Where should I hang it?

62
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,520
There’s no place to hang it.

63
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,850
Who is it?

64
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,250
Fei.

65
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,190
Fei.

66
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
Chuchu.

67
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,620
What... What’s the matter?

68
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,900
My...

69
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,810
My stomach hurts.

70
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,870
Well...

71
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,880
On our way here,

72
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,390
I saw a clinic on the street.

73
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,950
Let me take you to the doctor.

74
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,790
Sure.

75
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,740
Wait for me.

76
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,220
Let’s go.

77
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,030
Please don’t run into Mr. Xie.

78
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,900
He may ask about it again.

79
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,470
I saw him went out

80
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,350
already an hour ago.

81
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,440
He’s out again?

82
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,400
Where to?

83
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,670
I don’t know.

84
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,270
Fei.

85
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,110
Hurry.

86
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,910
Wait, wait.

87
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,980
Where are you going?

88
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,710
Just hanging out.

89
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,520
Hang out?

90
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,350
It’s a mess out there.

91
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,790
Plus, you’re bringing Chuchu with you.

92
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,910
Chenfei,

93
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,630
I wanted to go out.

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
You look bad.

95
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,880
Are you not feeling well?

96
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,080
I’m okay.

97
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,670
It’s fine.

98
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,640
Let’s find you a doctor.

99
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,790
Chenfei.

100
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,550
What’s wrong with

101
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,790
us wanting to go out?

102
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,400
Nothing wrong.

103
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,040
Or you want to join us?

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,690
Chuchu.

105
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,590
Leader asked me
to keep an eye on you.

106
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,000
If you want to go out,

107
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
let me join you.

108
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,110
Now I’m here.

109
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,790
I can protect her.

110
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,420
Wait.

111
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Fei.

112
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
You are a junior apprentice,

113
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,320
As a senior one, I should protect you.

114
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
No, I have to come, too.

115
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,960
Chenfei.

116
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,150
Wu Xiaodi is here, too.

117
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,840
You stay here and protect him.

118
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,200
I’ll go out with Chuchu.

119
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,150
We’ll be back soon.

120
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,080
Fine.

121
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
You can go then.

122
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,470
But come back before it gets dark.

123
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,000
Don’t go too far.

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,550
What’s wrong?

129
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,110
Third Lord has taken actions.

130
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,710

how many of them are here.

309
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,710

there’s a trap for us.

311
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,230
The safest way would

312
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,000
be to find a place to hide.

313
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,190
But they just

314
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,520
gave an order

315
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,640
to search the whole city.

316
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,590
It’d be in an uproar.

317
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,560
Where,

318
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,760
where should we hide?

319
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,390
I think of a place.

320
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,780
We can go hide
inside the county government.

321
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,750
Inside the county government?

322
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,430
Inside the county government

323
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,380
is where the county leader’s family
live.

324

327
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,110

where should we go?

330
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,760

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,920
I...

349
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,710
Go!

350
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,000
Mom.

351
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
Hurry and go.

352
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,680
Go.

353
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,400
Go.

354
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,350
You, come here.

355
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,680
Come.

356
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,070
Go.

357
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,560
Come.

358
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,350
Go.

359
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,280
Hurry.

360
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,630
Looks like they are looking for Chuchu.

361
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,890
There’s no way for us to pass.

362
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,830
Hide here now.

363
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,110
I’ll go and check.

364
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,500
Get in.

365
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,400
Come on.

366
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,520
Don’t be afraid.

367
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
Don’t panic.

368
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,950
No matter what happens later.

369
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,190
Just don’t come out.

370
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,360
I have to go and see what they’re doing.

371
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,880
Though it’s just me,

372
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,470
I’d definitely send you

373
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,950
back to the fortress safely.

374
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,490
Trust me.

375
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,640
Start from now,

376
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
count from one to one hundred.

377
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,920
Never mind.

378
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,840
Count to one thousand.

379
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,340
Wait for me.

380
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,590
I know it’s a hard thing to do.

381
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,520
But

382
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,920
you’re terrific.

383
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,920
Fei.

384
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,560
Don’t forget

385
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,350
about my little brother.

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,920
I’ve made my promise to send you back.

387
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,520
I’ll fulfill my promise.

388
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,760
Even if I die,

389
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
my soul will float back here.

390
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,130
Be careful.

391
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,960
Blessed Dog?

392
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,350
-Come here.
-Go.

393
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,070
-Search this family, too.
-Go.

394
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,040
You.

395
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,920
What are you doing? Stop there.

396
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,430
Any discovery?

397
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,430
No.

398
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,310
Shen Tianshu?

399
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,950
Lord.

400
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,350
Yeah?

401
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,230
They said there are escaped ones.

402
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,110
They probably haven’t found

403
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,310
what they’re looking for.

404
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,310
It’s just for some old and weak,

405
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,400
or some silly kids out there.

406
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,310
No need to make such a fuss.

407
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,920
Qiu Tianjin has been lagging behind

408
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,520
for all these years.

409
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,560
Blessed Dog thought that we want
to take credits from them.

410
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,680
Once we search the east,

411
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,190
they follow us.

412
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,520
It’s troublesome.

413
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,230
They look for the escaped ones.

414
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,800
We look for our important figures.

415
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,010
So Timber Wolf and Blessed Dog...

416
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,920
After they search it.

417
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,070
-Are not looking for the same person?
-Search again.

418
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,590
I got it.

419
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,280
Houyou.

420
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,710
Take a team to the east side.

421
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,190
You take one to the west.

422
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,520
The rest come with me.

423
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,680
Blessed Dog’s people are searching
both the south and north sides.

424
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,400
Try not to mess with them.

425
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
So there’s no trouble.

426
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,470
Yes.

427
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,920
Follow me.

428
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,640
Nine hundred.

429
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,780
Nine hundred and one.

430
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,740
Nine hundred and two.

431
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,970
Nine hundred and three.

432
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,100
It’s me.

433
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,330
Fei.

434
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,570
Fei.

435
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,860
You’re finally back.

436
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,000
Change it.

437
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,740
It’s from a dead person.

438
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,100
It’s not too bad.

439
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,140
Let’s find another place after changed.

440
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,210
I’ve checked

441
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,210
inside the country government.

442
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,240
There aren’t Demons guarding.

443
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,050
But,

444
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,270
I’m afraid my disguise
isn’t good enough.

445
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,260
It doesn’t matter.

446
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,760
It’s in darkness everywhere anyway.

447
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,030
But you can still find out
if gets close.

448
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,340
How can we get in?

449
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,400
We don’t get in.

450
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,210
We fight our way in.

451
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,760
<i>Tea House</i>

452
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,430
It’ll blow off.

453
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,380
Let’s go.

454
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,030
Lower your head.

455
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,500
Have you searched this side?

456
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,170
Stop there.

457
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,380
He’s dead?

458
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,240
Hide him.

459
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,360
Brother.

460
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,120
<i>Chen Zichen Third Prince</i>

461
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,530
Zichen.

462
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,660
Brother.

463
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,440
What are you doing here?

464
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,660
Long story.

465
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,920
Brother, are you okay?

466
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,530
Seeing Mr. Bai show off suddenly,

467
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,100
I thought something happened.

468
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,100
I’m relieved to see you’re fine.

469
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,740
By the way.

470
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,900
Lend me some good soldiers.

471
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,410
I need to deal with something.

472
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,780
I’ll come back to you later.

473
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,690
It’s a mess out there.

474
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,290
You can’t go out no matter what.

475
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,530
Just hold it for a while.

476
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,050
No, I have to.

477
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,500
Is it for your friends
who stayed in the hotel?

478
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,260
If you know it, don’t stop me then.

479
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,300
Leave it to Mr. Bai to find out.

480
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,870
I’ll update you once there’s news.

481
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,720
The hotel is seriously burned.

482
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,940
You’ve got no...

483
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,410
If Mr. Bai comes back with nothing.

484
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,420
You’d only alert the enemy if you go.

485
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,660
What’s the point?

486
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,330
Yeah.

487
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,210
My force is all gone.

488
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,830
What can I do?

489
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,620
Third Lord.

490
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,330
Many of our guys

491
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,740
were murdered.

492
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,410
Two of them lost their clothes

493
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,900
and tokens.

494
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,740
One of them

495
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,950
belongs to the Lord.

496
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,660
Somebody is protecting

497
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
those guys.

498
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,330
Third Lord.

499
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,290
When the Wu’s come into town,

500
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,660
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
protected them.

501
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,260
Their leader’s daughter Zhou Fei

502
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,320
was with them, too.

503
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,780
Zhou Fei?

504
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,860
Yes.

505
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,170
I heard that this girl

506
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,140
has learned the essence of Li Jinrong.

507
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,470
She’s terrific at it.

508
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,020
It’s not that easy for her

509
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,340
to sneak in and sneak out.

510
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,900
In fifteen minutes,

511
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,810
check on all the tokens.

512
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,500
Five as a team.

513
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,310
Anyone without a token.

514
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,810
Kill him.

515
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,540
Yes.

516
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,290
Third Lord.

517
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,610
As for the Timber Wolf...

518
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,410
Doesn’t he want to

519
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,050
block the city and check with me?

520
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,080
I’d like to see

521
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,950
what can he find out eventually.

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,830
How’s your father?

524
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,750
He’s great. Thanks.

525
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,860
But you always

526
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,520
disappear without notice.

527
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,830
We all care about you a lot.

528
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,120
Father always talks about you.

529
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,760
It’s my bad.

530
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,530
I’ll make time to visit him.

531
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,570
Brother.

532
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,420
How long are you planning

533
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,450
on wandering around?

534
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,390
There’s chaos everywhere.

535
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,460
There’s no one to take care of you.

536
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,120
I don’t care about any business
in the court.

537
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,770
My life with freedom now

538
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,690
suits me well.

539
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,810
It’s not a solution.

540
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,910
Is living in bad conditions a solution?

541
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,130
Your Highness.

542
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,620
Mr. Xiao.

543
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,250
Don’t call me that, Mr. Bai.

544
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,870
My name is Xie Yun, now.

545
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,030
How are things going on?

546
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,240
During the day,

547
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,660
Qiu Tianjin brought people to the hotel

548
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,860
to arrest someone for no reason.

549
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,770
There were plenty of good fighters,

550
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,560
but too many of them came.

551
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,380
The fighters could have
fought their way out.

552
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,100
But it’s said there were

553
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,180
women and kids.

554
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,280
They had to return to their rooms
to protect the weak.

555
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,460
Sending people to ask for help
was useless, too.

556
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,100
Qiu Tianjin has asked his fellows

557
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,900
to surround the hotel in advance.

558
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,570
They set a few blocks too

559
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,290
to seal the way out.

560
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,410
Then set a fire.

561
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:55,960
And then?

562
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,330
This is what the Demons missed

563
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,620
in the site.

564
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,010
You like blades, don’t you?

565
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,900
You can hang this on the hilt.

566
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,220
This is the jade pendant
Chenfei gave to Zhou Fei

567
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,060
when we just arrived at Huarong.

568
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,990
Don’t say that I don’t care about you.

569
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,390
Depends on what you do.

570
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,420
Over the wall it’s the
inside of county government.

571
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,180
I’ve been here at day, there’s no guard.

572
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,530
Only two people are living here.

573
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,880
But how can we get in there?

574
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,310
I’ll take you to climb over the wall.

575
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,500
Let’s take off the dirty clothes first.

576
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,920
<i>Huarong County Government</i>

577
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,960
<i>Impartiality and Integrity</i>

578
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,140
Fei.

579
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,730
We’d be temporarily safe staying here.

580
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,180
But people walk by inside.

581
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,380
What if they notice us?

582
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,440
What’s the next step?

583
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,780
Let’s hide for a few days.

584
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,800
Let’s see after that.

585
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,380
I’ll take you back
to the fortress after that.

586
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,000
My mother would come to our aid.

587
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,590
Sorry for getting the Fortress involved.

588
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,010
Time for lunch. Come and get the dishes.

589
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,660
I’ve asked but you wouldn’t come.

590
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,740
Don’t talk back with the master again.

591
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,560
What are you murmuring about?

592
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,940
The pastry you sent was stiff.

593
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,330
Listen carefully.

594
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,620
If you don’t do your work well.

595
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,100
I’ll report you.

596
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,730
Who’d believe you?

597
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,070
Our master rarely comes here
for once a year.

598
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,810
Let alone the county leader and madam.

599
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,490
Don’t see yourself as a real madam.

600
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,250
You stupid.

601
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,460
Don’t act like a snob.

602
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,420
What are you talking about?

603
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,180
How dare you!

604
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,570
It hurts, it hurts.

605
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,430
Ma... Madam.

606
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,700
You again?

607
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,020
You got beat up again?

608
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,180
Does it hurt?

609
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,100
-Let me check.
-I’m okay.

610
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,290
It doesn’t hurt, I...

611
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,810
I’m going, I’m going.

612
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,760
Madam, are you a cat?

613
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,380
You walk so softly without any sound.

614
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,480
Let’s go, time for lunch.

615
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,290
It’s a room piled up with rubbish.

616
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,450
Don’t care about it.

617
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,030
Let’s go.

618
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,970
<i>Huarong</i>
The Demons split up into two teams

619
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,660
<i>Huarong</i>
to search the city in rows.

620
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,620
<i>Huarong</i>
Their strongholds

621
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,970
are right here and there.

622
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,700
Searching?

623
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,490
Yes.

624
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,660
It’s said after they count the people,

625
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,050
it’s confirmed there are escaped ones.

626
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,880
Burning the hotel.

627
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,120
Blocking the city.

628
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,750
Escaped people.

629
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,230
Mr. Xie, what’s your point?

630
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,310
Please don’t worry.

631
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,180
The Demons have lost many fellows.

632
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,010
Until now,

633
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,000
they haven’t figured out who did it.

634
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,220
There’re fighters

635
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,940
who the Demons don’t even know?

636
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,570
I believe that you all remember

637
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,770
there were a group of gangsters here.

638
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,250
Now they’re all under control.

639
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,380
Even some of Wu Fei’s evil fellows

640
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,180
escaped and remained impenitent.

641
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,220
Why would you arrest me?

642
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,380
-Shut up.
-They joined the gangsters.

643
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,570
I believe that you all remember

644
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,970
there were a group of gangsters here.

645
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,660
Now they’re all under control.

646
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,220
Even some of Wu Fei’s evil fellows

647
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,970
escaped and remained impenitent.

648
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,180
They joined the gangsters.

649
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,140
I wonder

650
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,330
how’s my little brother now.

651
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,770
He’s so young.

652
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,860
If anything happens to him,

653
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,890
how can I explain to my parents?

654
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,860
There are civilians exiled to Huarong.

655
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,570
They don’t know the situation.

656
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,100
After hearing this made up speech,

657
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,700
they may think it was the people died

658
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,900
in the hotel who ruined their families.

659
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,660
The Demons recklessly burned it all.

660
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,970
Many innocent people died in the hotel.

661
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,340
Aren’t they afraid of raising wrath?

662
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,490
The Demons are just a bunch of losers.

663
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,140
They raised such a rumpus.

664
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,660
There must

665
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,270
be a power supporting them behind.

666
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,700
Now they’re inciting the people.

667
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,730
It’s because there’s a solid proof

668
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,240
of the people they wanted have escaped.

669
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,420
Searching doesn’t work

670
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,500
anymore at this moment.

671
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,090
But how did they

672
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,320
make sure of it?

673
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,530
They burned the hotel.

674
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,780
The bodies were scorched.

675
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,890
How can they say we are missing?

676
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,530
Qiu Tianjin set the fire,

677
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,120
intending to kill them all.

678
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,050
It means that

679
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,140
they are not looking for people

680
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,180
but some objects.

681
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,050
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

682
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,940
Is there’s something you have

683
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,590
that your parents asked you to preserve?

684
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,580
The missing guy not only has an object

685
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,850
but also a good fighter

686
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,380
with him who the Demons didn’t expect.

687
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,720
Judged from Chenfei’s personality,

688
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,700
if he did have a chance to save

689
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,390
