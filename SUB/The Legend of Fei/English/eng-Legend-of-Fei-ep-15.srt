<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 15</i>

17
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,630
He is the descendant of
the famous North Blade.

18
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,830
He vanished from sight many years ago.

19
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,630
Now he is still alive and kicking.

20
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,400
From what I know of him,

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
he can do whatever it takes to survive.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,160
Is that right, Master Ji?

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,290
I’ve met tons of perfidious people.

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
But after I met Mr. Yin,

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,870
I realized that not
all ingrates lack humanity.

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,750
I agree with what Mr. Xie just said.

27
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,680
That old demon stole my stuff.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,440
He is a thief!

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Whether it’s the Mountain Sword

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,960
or any other things,
they all belong to the Yin family.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,190
I just got my stuff back.

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,630
Isn’t that a rightful thing to do?

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,910
Since it’s a rightful thing to do,

34
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,240
why would I tell you strangers

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,670
about it?

36
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,520
To recruit another group of thieves?

37
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,720
All right.

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,630
Mr. Yin, you’d better know
what you are doing.

39
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,360
What are you looking at?

40
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,860
Get out!

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,880
You…!

42
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,480
Why are you out again?

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
I’m tired of being inside.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
I can’t stay here forever.

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,360
Do you want to carry the blade

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,470
and confront with
the Dragon Master again?

47
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,670
I’m self-aware.

48
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,750
That’s good.

49
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,390
All right.

50
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,160
I’ll go out to check the situation.

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,470
I’ll go with you.

52
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,110
My footwork is good, and I can run fast.

53
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,080
How about you?

54
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,470
You are skilled in martial arts?
Do you want to fight again?

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,720
All right, just go back.

56
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,750
Let... Let me go!

57
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,080
Chuchu.

58
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,170
Didn’t Mr. Xie come back with you?

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,270
He went to check things out.

60
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,960
We can’t just sit here and do nothing.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,270
His footwork is so well.

62
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,800
He should be fine.

63
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,910
That guy is good-for-nothing.

64
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,030
Strangely speaking,

65
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,240
if a person’s footwork

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,390
reaches to a certain level,

67
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,830
he might not be good at martial arts,

68
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,770
but he shouldn’t know nothing about it.

69
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,110
That’s true.

70
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,500
I never saw him use any moves.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
If a person

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,920
has no experience in fighting

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,880
and can’t predict the next move
of the opponent,

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,320
even he runs as fast as the wind,

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,070
he can’t be as flexible as Mr. Xie

76
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,990
just by running around

77
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,980
and dodging.

78
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,220
But I only saw him run.

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,710
Then why?

80
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,550
I don’t know.

81
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,320
I don’t think he will tell me
even I ask him.

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,200
Mr. Xie is a mysterious person.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,110
Yeah.

84
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,850
And he is full of lies.

85
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,470
What are you drawing?

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
Take a look.

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,880
This is…

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Duan Jiuniang’s Yellow and Green Palm?

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,350
You recognize it?

90
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,390
I’m afraid I didn’t draw it well.

91
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,200
Why do you draw that?

92
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,550
No.

93
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,640
How do you remember these moves?

94
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,070
I had a good memory when I was young.

95
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,670
I see a thing once
and I can remember it.

96
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,440
Back then,

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,040
I saw you and Duan Jiuniang
joust in the courtyard,

98
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,160
and I memorized it.

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
During these days,

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,140
I heard a lot of old stories.

101
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,770
Especially what Yin Pei said.

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,320
I think

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,720
it’s a pity if no one

104
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,020
keeps practicing this martial art.

105
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,930
So you want to record it?

106
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,550
I’m trying to recall

107
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,040
as much as I can.

108
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,640
Maybe there will be martial arts genius

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,550
who can get some inspiration

110
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,670
from these records

111
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,760
and carry on these martial arts.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,550
Recording it in a book
can make it last forever

113
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,910
and be learned by posterity.

114
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,040
Chuchu.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,270
Your idea is excellent.

116
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,690
Actually, I didn’t think that much.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,070
It’s a pity.

118
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,390
That’s all I can do

119
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,890
on my own.

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,880
I’m afraid

121
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,640
Duan Jiuniang’s Yellow and Green Palm
will be lost one day.

122
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,790
My understanding of
Yellow and Green Palm

123
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,330
is quite shallow.

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,950
But,

125
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,980
I have the Yellow and Green Spirit
in my body.

126
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,110
Now you recorded it,

127
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,160
which means Duan Jiuniang’s
Yellow and Green Palm

128
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,990
is not completely lost yet.

129
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,820
I’m just afraid

130
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,520
I can’t practice it well

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,790
and humiliate myself.

132
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,830
Fei.

133
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,230
You can’t think that way.

134
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,550
Duan Jiuniang passed the Yellow and
Green Palm to you in person,

135
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,720
which means she recognized you

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,230
and liked you.

137
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,070
Besides,

138
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,230
you have fought against those masters,

139
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,370
and you were doing great.

140
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,200
Where are they?

141
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,510
My lord.

142
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,550
We have searched the whole mountain.

143
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,960
There is no trace of them.

144
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,920
This is the foot of Mount Heng.

145
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,690
They must be hiding
in the secret tunnel.

146
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,740
Pass on my order.

147
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,760
Let’s head to the site of
Mount Heng Sect!

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,440
Yes!

149
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,440
Mr. Yin.

150
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,710
You should be hungry now.

151
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,120
Do you want some fruit?

152
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,700
Why are you being so nice to me?

153
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,670
You didn’t eat much all the way here.

154
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,940
I’m afraid you will be feeble.

155
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,910
Don’t worry.

156
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,440
It has no poison.

157
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,770
I won’t eat.

158
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,600
I’m dying anyway.

159
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
What does it matter
whether I eat it or not?

160
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,350
Wait.

161
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,320
What’s wrong?

162
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,110
You...

163
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,210
Do you know how to unlock the acupoint?

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can leave.

165
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,080
Did you hear anything?

166
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200
It should be the wind.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,280
No one can move that fast.

168
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,150
My lord.

169
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,590
We didn’t find them.

170
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,790
You’ve been searching all day
and got nothing?

171
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,280
Useless waste!

172
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,030
Fei.

173
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,710
How is your investigation going?

174
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,350
This secret tunnel extends
in all directions.

175
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,840
There are many traps

176
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,400
and many intersections.

177
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,230
We are underground now.

178
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,200
It’s already hard to tell the direction.

179
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
What’s worse,

180
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
we don’t have a map.

181
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,070
It’s easy to get stuck here.

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,710
What should we do?

183
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,880
I don’t want to stay
in this cave forever.

184
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,350
There is nothing we can do.

185
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,430
We can only hide in here now.

186
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,080
Hope they will leave soon.

187
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,120
Miss Zhou.

188
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,840
Miss Zhou.

189
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,150
I heard that those who practice
Snow-breaking Blade

190
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,500
are often late bloomers.

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,170
But,

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,200
I noticed that your broadsword play
is quite well now.

193
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,530
Did you start to practice it
when you were young?

194
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,640
How long have you been practicing it?

195
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,620
When I left home, my mother…

196
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,840
Mother told me not to
give out my information easily.

197
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,880
I didn’t learn it when I was young.

198
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,200
I have practiced it for about
two or three years.

199
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,710
Two or three years?

200
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,350
Is that too long?

201
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,520
One or two years.

202
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,500
Anyway, that’s it.

203
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,030
Unless you cut corners
and practice an evil Kungfu,

204
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,670
otherwise, it takes decades of efforts

205
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,110
to master a Kungfu.

206
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,260
You are making progress

207
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,290
at a really fast speed.

208
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,710
Come on.

209
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,960
I know myself.

210
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,150
With my ability,

211
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,840
I’m just humiliating my family.

212
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,830
Fei,

213
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,510
how long have you been practicing it?

214
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,500
More than half a year.

215
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,150
I have Yellow and Green Spirit
in my body.

216
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,520
I feel

217
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,400
it’s infiltrating every move
of Snow-breaking Blade.

218
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,110
Yeah.

219
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,850
We’ve been at death’s door
several times.

220
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
Our fearless Master Zhou

221
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,470
was also honed by masters
of different schools.

222
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,880
It’s also a rare opportunity.

223
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,740
You eavesdropped on me.

224
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,790
What are you doing?

225
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,590
The younger generation is awesome.

226
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,550
My lord, the entrance is over there.

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,320
You can’t escape this time.

228
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,590
Back then,

229
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,590
when the Mount Heng Sect escaped,

230
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,230
the entrance of the secret tunnel
was deliberately unsealed

231
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,320
to delay the pursuers.

232
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,470
Without someone who knows
the tunnel well leading for them,

233
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,960
they won’t be able to find us

234
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,590
in a while.

235
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,080
I think they are hitting the gong

236
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,200
to scare us.

237
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,400
Don’t panic.

238
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,230
Yeah.

239
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,520
It’s like that

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,780
when I was checking the surroundings.

241
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,670
If I hadn’t memorized the way back,

242
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,590
it would be difficult to
come back from outside.

243
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,960
It’s easy for that old guy to come in
but hard to leave.

244
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,280
We don’t know

245
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,460
who will die here today.

246
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,280
They can just sneak in

247
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,790
and attack us.

248
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,820
Why are they hitting the gong?

249
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,280
I’ve been treating you well!

250
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,030
Gold and jewelry, silk and satin.

251
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,710
Have I ever been stingy about it?

252
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,320
I don’t care whether you are
greedy for money or women,

253
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,670
I’ve given you whatever you want!

254
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,880
Why did you take an empty scabbard?

255
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,400
The Mountain Sword is
broken into pieces. It’s worthless.

256
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,910
Just bring it back to me.

257
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,790
I won’t punish you, all right?

258
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,710
It seems that Dragon Master
won’t give up

259
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,320
catching you.

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
Twenty years ago,

261
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,080
he hurt tons of people

262
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,000
to get my father’s treasure.

263
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,640
Now,

264
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,760
I have this treasure.

265
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,670
And it was stolen by his own dog.

266
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,640
Tell me,

267
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,470
how can he feel good about it?

268
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,150
You piece of crap,

269
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,420
do you have anything to do
with the Yin family?

270
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,780
There is no need to hide.

271
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,590
The Yin family

272
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,230
was wiped out by my brothers
a long time ago.

273
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,350
With your age,

274
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,840
you might just be
an insignificant bastard!

275
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,210
I hate people calling me
bastard the most.

276
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,470
Not good.

277
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,790
I seem to hear that

278
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,790
the Dragon Master
has a team of blind people

279
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,230
hit the gong.

280
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,350
They can know what’s ahead in the dark

281
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,710
based on the echo

282
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,970
of the gong.

283
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,350
If so,

284
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,450
they can get back

285
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,890
without the need to

286
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,870
explore the alleys
and traps by themselves.

287
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,880
I’m afraid this secret tunnel

288
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,640
won’t be able to trap them for too long.

289
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Master Ji,

290
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,960
if so,

291
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,670
how long will they find us?

292
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,030
It’s hard to say.

293
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,040
If it’s as you said,

294
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,600
I’m afraid they will be here soon.

295
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,640
Where are you going?

296
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,110
I’m going to check the outside.

297
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,710
If it’s safe outside,

298
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,130
we should get out first.

299
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,200
Don’t worry.

300
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,520
I can even explore
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

301
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,030
This tunnel of Mount Heng
is just a piece of cake.

302
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,520
Stay here and wait for me.

303
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Why are you always running outside?

304
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Miss Zhou.

305
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,840
Can you do me a favor?

306
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,760
Go ahead.

307
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,550
Dragon Master

308
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,840
should be killed.

309
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,020
Who are you?

310
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,400
What kind of hero

311
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,920
are you to just dodge?

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Keep moving.

313
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,560
If anyone else

314
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,430
teaches a girl like you,

315
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,760
they will make you learn

316
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,230
the labor-saving and light weapons

317
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,560
like dart and whip.

318
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,190
Otherwise,

319
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,350
they will let you master

320
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,590
a hidden weapon.

321
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,070
It’s enough to save your life

322
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,680
as long as your footwork is not bad.

323
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,350
I don’t know

324
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,000
why your elders

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,710
made you use a blade

326
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,900
and taught you the Snow-breaking Blade.

327
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,590
Yes.

328
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,350
More than one person

329
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,310
told me that my bones
are not strong enough.

330
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,920
It takes twice the effort
to practice the blade.

331
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,110
So?

332
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,170
Did anyone tell you that

333
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,880
with your figure and appearance,

334
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,590
even you are arrogant and incompetent,

335
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,110
you can still live a smooth life?

336
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,070
You don’t have to
lick the blood on the blade

337
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,660
and wander around.

338
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,590
Peerless talent

339
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,590
and alluring beauty

340
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,870
are rare in the world.

341
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,460
However,

342
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
if you grow into relying on it,

343
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,710
it can easily become a cursed barrier

344
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,590
that you can never get rid of.

345
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,560
I was too arrogant

346
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,190
and took myself too seriously,

347
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,280
and I made a huge mistake.

348
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
Drop all the nonsense.

349
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,520
What do you want to say?

350
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:25,930
Good.

351
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,900
Remember,

352
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,680
whoever says these things to you

353
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,110
is harming you.

354
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,800
Don’t believe a word.

355
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,920
You must listen carefully

356
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,160
about what I’m going to say.

357
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,520
Please go ahead.

358
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,400
Back then, the South and North Blades
were known to the world.

359
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
The South Blade is extremely fierce.

360
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
The North Blade is extremely dangerous.

361
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,070
It’s said that Water Cutting

362
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,350
is for killing.

363
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,710
But Snow-breaking Blade

364
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,400
is the blade of master.

365
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,680
Those who practice Snow-breaking Blade

366
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,450
are like walking alone on a snowy night.

367
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,010
They must be extremely
strong and persistent

368
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,520
to get a glimpse of it.

369
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,650
Especially the three moves of
Invisible, Unpredictable and Edgeless.

370
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,720
These moves seem to be unremarkable.

371
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,710
But many people spend their whole life

372
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,520
and still can’t master them.

373
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,190
If you can’t master these three moves,

374
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,880
no matter how great
your broadsword play is,

375
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,950
no matter how powerful
your inner force is,

376
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,530
the blade will still be soulless.

377
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,430
Miss Zhou.

378
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,560
I am worried

379
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,040
that you might achieve nothing

380
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,230
after you practiced it all these years.

381
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,930
You said all these things

382
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,300
just to curse me to achieve nothing?

383
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,920
I’ve checked it out.

384
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,680
Dragon Master left some people
to patrol the mountain.

385
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,710
But there are just
a few people out there.

386
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,190
Most of them went to the secret tunnel.

387
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,400
Therefore, it’s safer to leave

388
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,280
than to stay here.

389
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,860
If we will get out,
we should leave now.

390
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,590
Miss Zhou.

391
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,800
Do you want to escape with them

392
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,710
or stay here and take a risk

393
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,830
to kill the Dragon Master

394
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,590
with me?

395
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,640
If you are willing to stay

396
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,170
and kill the Dragon Master with me,

397
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,950
I can teach you
the Water Cutting technique.

398
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,110
You only need to stall
the Dragon Master for me.

399
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,070
I’ll take care the rest of it.

400
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,190
No way!

401
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,950
You ask a little girl to

402
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,000
resist one of the four lords
of Four-guardian Mountain?

403
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,660
Unless you give her
an elixir of the Supreme Lord!

404
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,640
Master Ji.

405
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,070
I don’t want to be rude.

406
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,160
It’s just everything is in the past.

407
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,240
Why can’t you just bear it?

408
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Twenty years ago,

409
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,520
you were stubborn.

410
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,470
Now you are still that stubborn. You...!

411
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,400
Fei.

412
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,640
I don’t care about

413
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,790
the life of that toy boy.

414
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
You only need to
take care of Chuchu for me.

415
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,860
You go first.

416
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,480
You...!

417
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,050
You said you knew how to deal with him.

418
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,040
I can stay here to help you.

419
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,680
But listen carefully to my words.

420
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,310
I stay here

421
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,400
to deal with that big mouse.

422
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,470
As for the other things,

423
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,800
you don’t need to teach me,

424
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,400
and I won’t learn it.

425
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,760
I won’t convert to other schools.

426
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,920
South and North Blades are together.

427
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,040
For the sake of my grandfather,

428
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,570
I shouldn’t be disrespectful to you.

429
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,710
But now I’ve met a senior like you,

430
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,710
I must say something.

431
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,520
Water Cutting is nothing.

432
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,830
Yeah.

433
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,430
Water Cutting

434
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,680
is nothing.

435
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,840
Anyway,

436
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
thanks.

437
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,360
Let’s go block the cave first.

438
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,190
Did you find them?

439
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,160
My lord.

440
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,920
There is no obstruction in this passage.

441
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,300
They should be at the deepest place.

442
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,110
Good, keep going!

443
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,210
Yes!

444
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,160
Soul-searching Needle?

445
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,040
What needle did you just say?

446
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,710
Miss Zhou.

447
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,430
To deal with Dragon Master,

448
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,710
only my North Blade moves
can hold him at bay.

449
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,650
Although I look like useless now,

450
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,430
my previous power

451
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,720
is enough to beat the Dragon Master.

452
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,520
I’ll use this Soul-searching Needle

453
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,310
to drive out my previous power.

454
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,280
However,

455
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,190
once I use the Soul-searching Needle,

456
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,280
I need to close my eyes and rest.

457
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,110
It takes quite a while to work.

458
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,310
I need you to

459
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,640
stall the Dragon Master for me

460
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,630
until I get my power back.

461
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,350
Okay.

462
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,190
You looked down on my North Blade.

463
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,350
Can I use Water Cutting

464
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,190
to play against you?

465
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,520
How?

466
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,040
Sorry that I can’t fight.

467
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,350
Miss Zhou, do you know
what verbal struggle is?

468
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,000
Fighting is physical fighting.

469
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,640
Verbal struggle is
exchanging techniques in meditation.

470
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,880
In a verbal struggle,

471
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,190
people only explain
the moves to each other,

472
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,560
or just gesticulate

473
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,800
without touching each other.

474
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,830
No one will get hurt.

475
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,070
It’s very peaceful.

476
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,280
Miss Zhou.

477
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,950
Please.

478
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,070
Miss Zhou.

479
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,760
Please make three moves of South Blade.

480
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,830
I’ll respond with North Blade.

481
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,900
Please.

482
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,950
Why does Fei’s status

483
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,800
change suddenly?

484
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,000
That’s because

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,710
Fei has been cut once

486
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,190
by Water Cutting.

487
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,400
The cover outside

488
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,310
can only fool them for a while.

489
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,040
In the end,

490
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,590
I’m afraid I still need your help.

491
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,270
It’s a narrow place here.

492
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,280
No matter how many people they have,

493
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,040
it’s hard for them to swarm up together.

494
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,680
This is our advantage.

495
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,590
The Dragon Master likes
bullying the weak the most.

496
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,880
If he sees that you are a little girl,

497
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,590
he will fight with you in person.

498
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,230
His inner strength is far above you.

499
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,280
What you can rely on

500
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,160
is your peerless broadsword play.

501
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,400
Next I will show you

502
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,890
the peerless broadsword play.

503
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,110
During tonight,

504
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,950
if you can

505
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,190
make twenty moves under my blade,

506
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,470
the Dragon Master won’t be able to

507
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,830
hurt you for a while.

508
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
Let’s continue.

509
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,880
My lord.

510
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,230
The left tunnel is empty.

511
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,070
My lord, the right tunnel is clear.

512
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,390
Nothing on our end, my lord.

513
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,160
Did they

514
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,100
disappear into thin air?

515
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,310
Get me All-listener.

516
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,160
Yes.

517
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
Why didn’t you strike?

518
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,230
Unless your opponent

519
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,000
is much weaker than you,

520
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,760
either you’d let your weapon fly

521
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,920
or get yourself hurt

522
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,230
by that move.

523
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,090
Is it that obvious even to you?

524
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,330
Master Ji,

525
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,330
I made a stupid remark.

526
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,240
Please forgive me.

527
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,260
Master Ji,

528
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,070
how long

529
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,090
will it take exactly?

530
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,950
A few minutes,

531
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,830
one hour,

532
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,910
or two hours?

533
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,760
If it’s two hours,

534
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,590
I’d better go get coffins for us now.

535
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,830
There might be good bargains.

536
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,930
Knock it off!

537
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
Go away.

538
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,880
Mr. Xie,

539
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,190
it’s hard to say.

540
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,560
It could take minutes

541
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,310
or hours.

542
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,480
Mr. Xie,

543
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,010
are you still trying to
change Fei’s mind?

544
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,330
That girl’s patience

545
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,500
is wearing thin.

546
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,230
If I go on and on,

547
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,400
she’ll be annoyed

548
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,470
and kick me out of this world.

549
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,000
Fei has a temper

550
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,560
but I trust her the most.

551
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,230
You’re being unfair to her.

552
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,950
If the carrot doesn’t work,

553
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,470
and I try the stick,

554
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,350
the risk will be too high.

555
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,310
Fei.

556
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,680
Fei! Fei!

557
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,280
I need to take Miss Wu away.

558
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,800
This place is too dangerous to stay.

559
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,160
She doesn’t listen to me.

560
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,030
Why don’t you talk to her?

561
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,470
Fei.

562
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
I won’t leave.

563
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,710
I’ll stay with you.

564
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,830
Miss Wu,

565
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,950
you’ve seen

566
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,470
what Mu Xiaoqiao is capable of.

567
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,880
I have.

568
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,190
Dragon Master is as bad

569
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,660
as him if not worse.

570
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,990
So?

571
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,430
As one of the Four Guardians,

572
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,350
he’s highly skilled in martial arts

573
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,680
and much crueler than you imagine.

574
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,710
Once he tracks us down,

575
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,880
all of us combined

576
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,110
won’t be his match.

577
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,070
What will happen

578
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,590
if we fall into his hands?

579
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,390
I’m not bluffing. Just think about it.

580
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,040
Chuchu,

581
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,760
leave with Xie Yun.

582
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,800
Master Ji and I will stay.

583
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,920
The rarest one owns

584
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,950
isn’t unparalleled talent

585
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,980
but a clear mind to know

586
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,230
when to battle,

587
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,200
when to take risks,

588
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,930
when to be cautious

589
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,590
and when to back off.

590
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,310
One must know all that.

591
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,990
Whose teaching is it

592
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,890
that is

593
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,680
to act against

594
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,990
the situation?

595
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,470
Hey,

596
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,280
are you pointing the finger at me?

597
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,920
I hope whoever I’m pointing at

598
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
can understand me.

599
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,520
Don’t you think I want to go home

600
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,350
to practice my skills?

601
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,680
But

602
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,000
dictators like Dragon Master

603
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,240
must be eliminated as soon as possible.

604
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,470
Mr. Xie’s eyes are sharp.

605
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,710
You must be well-versed
in all kinds of weapons.

606
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,840
Are you specialized in the blade?

607
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,880
You’re flattering me.

608
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,640
If I’m specialized in anything,

609
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,280
that’ll be escaping.

610
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,040
The blade is single-edged

611
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,710
while the sword is double-edged.

612
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,920
A blade gives you courage

613
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,190
because the edge

614
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,310
is always in front of you.

615
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,880
Correct.

616
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,450
Just don’t hold it against your neck.

617
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,210
Without such fighting spirit,

618
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,980
however sharp

619
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,360
the weapon is,

620
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,150
it’s nothing but a heavy tool.

621
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,860
Just learn from me.

622
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,280
Snow-breaking Blade is powerful enough

623
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,920
to break mountains and rivers.

624
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,040
The enemy is close

625
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,250
and she’s ready to kill him.

626
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,590
If you talk her out of it,

627
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,190
she’ll forever live in the shadow

628
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,680
of weakness and cowardice.

629
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,520
No matter how long she lives,

630
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,280
she’ll only achieve so much

631
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,460
as a blade user.

632
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,390
Say no more.

633
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,600
Relax.

634
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,640
I won’t let you die.

635
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,040
Were death is my concern,

636
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,910
I’d be nowhere near you.

637
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,390
Did...? Did I say anything wrong?

638
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,430
I take you as my best friend

639
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,840
yet you see me as some chicken.

640
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,980
Master Ji’s Soul-searching Needle
is deadly.

641
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,890
I’ll cover you.

642
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,190
Uh...

643
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,680
Thank you.

644
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,950
I’m counting on you.

645
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,120
Don’t let me down.

646
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,740
<i>Wood</i>

647
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,620
Gong Formation.

648
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,700
<i>Wood</i>

649
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,000
Miss Zhou, we’re running out of time.

650
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,120
Let’s try again.

651
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,470
Sure. One more time.

652
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,700
<i>Water</i>

653
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,870
Does Fei need help?

654
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,520
Were Master Ji

655
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
as skilled as before,

656
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,230
Fei

657
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,950
would stand a chance to fight back.

658
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,360
Why?

659
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,760
She practices various skills

660
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,120
and she can think outside the box

661
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,700
when fighting against others.

662
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,000
The Mayfly Formation

663
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,300
she learned from that Taoist priest

664
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,470
has added even more diversity

665
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,120
to her style.

666
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Even Dragon Master

667
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,190
can’t kill her at once.

668
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,760
But the thing is

669
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,950
she and Master Ji

670
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,080
aren’t engaging in actual combat.

671
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,120
How is that

672
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,630
a problem?

673
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,870
In the eyes of the outsiders,

674
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,760
meditation

675
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,000
is bland and boring.

676
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,520
But that’s because you don’t understand

677
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,280
what they’re doing

678
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,120
and how demanding

679
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,430
it is.

680
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,800
In a fight,

681
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,470
agility, strength,

682
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,670
skills

683
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,950
and even the mental state

684
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,360
may affect the result.

685
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,230
Are you saying

686
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,520
Fei is restricted

687
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,870
in meditation?

688
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes.

689
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,060
While Master Ji sits there,

690
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,560
Fei

691
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,710
can’t jump around him.

692
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,910
Forget about the Mayfly Formation

693
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,840
or other

694
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,520
gimmicks or tricks

695
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,030
to battle against Water Cutting,

696
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,040
her only choice is to strike

697
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,520
with the Snow-breaking Blade

698
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,690
one by one.

699
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,280
That’s

700
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,010
difficult for Fei.

701
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,280
Although Master Ji lost his skills,

702
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,080
he was the North Blade.

703
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,430
Every move

704
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,080
is destructive,

705
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,710
and can easily

706
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,190
trap others into his invisible attacks.

707
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,320
I wonder if Fei can succeed

708
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,280
within such a short time.

709
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,230
Has she ever failed us?

710
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,800
My lord.

711
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,360
I’ve located them.

712
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,040
Fei.

713
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,560
Do you need some rest?

714
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,230
Miss Zhou, you successfully

715
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,560
took five strikes.

716
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,320
Just now,

717
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,090
when the blades touched,

718
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,100
I got hold of the gist
of the Mountain Move.

719
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,300
That is to shake hardness with thinness,

720
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,630
to break heaviness with tininess.

721
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,280
I learned

722
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,190
that very first move

723
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,390
a long time ago,

724
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,670
but

725
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,190
I didn’t truly understand it

726
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,950
until being inspired by you.

727
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,320
Well done!

728
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,630
You’ve managed

729
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,470
to have such an epiphany so quickly.

730
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,630
No wonder you’re a heroine.

731
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,710
You’re one of a kind,

732
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,120
a real talent.

733
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
And

734
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,300
I was thinking

735
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,300
the nine moves are
often used separately.

736
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,950
Is it possible

737
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,910
to combine those two moves?

738
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,600
As far as I know,

739
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,630
with a single blade,

740
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,890
you can only strike left or right.

741
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,870
Combining the moves

742
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,180
is impractical.

743
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,230
Only

744
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,840
a thorough master

745
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,020
can improve the skills.

746
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,430
With that being said,

747
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,520
every time

748
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,890
I changed my moves,

749
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,430
I felt as if my Yellow and Green Spirit

750
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,200
had guided me

751
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,470
to better understand the blade.

752
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,100
Old Master Li’s blade

753
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,600
is edgeless

754
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,360
while Leader Li’s

755
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,800
is invisible.

756
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,000
Miss,

757
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,760
what about yours?

758
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,840
The blade doesn’t define us

759
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,360
but we define the blade.

760
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,150
The North Blade is like water.

761
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,470
Blade can’t cut off water for real,

762
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,120
so why bother

763
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,430
to invest in so much strength

764
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,360
but only to get weakened

765
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,640
and neutralized?

766
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,320
My blade should be unpredictable.

767
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,950
Your grandfather would be proud

768
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,000
to have such

769
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,800
an insightful and talented

770
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,840
heiress.

771
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,560
Dragon Master might be here any minute.

772
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,810
Let’s waste no time.

773
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,430
Sure.

774
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,470
I don’t know what others

775
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,840
practice martial arts for.

776
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,430
Maybe some

777
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,560
are eager to establish their own sects

778
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,840
while others

779
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,330
always fight to be number one.

780
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,400
But Fei is different.

781
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,800
She has a strong interest in the skills

782
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,560
but can’t care less

783
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,950
about the title.

784
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,320
I agree.

785
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,760
She’s competitive

786
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,280
but she isn’t obsessed

787
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,910
with winning.

788
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,190
Actually,

789
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,040
she reminds me of Mr. Wuliu

790
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,020
who always forgets to eat

791
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,950
whenever he discovers something new.

792
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,320
Mr. Xie,

793
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,670
you know Fei too well.

794
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,980
Oh, no!

795
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,630
Listen.

796
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,840
They’re getting closer to us.

797
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Calm down.

798
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,170
They might not find this place.

799
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,230
How long

800
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,630
will they still need?

801
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,040
Given her talent,

802
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,430
it won’t be too long,

803
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,470
but the loud noise

804
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,520
we hear

805
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,290
may distract her.

806
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,050
I wonder if she can still focus.

807
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:30,784
