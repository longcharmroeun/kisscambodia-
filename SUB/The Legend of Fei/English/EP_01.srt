Ximo River isn’t easy to break through.

Could it be a distraction?

110
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,690

It’s all over the forest.

129
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,820
Don’t make a fuss about it.

130
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Do you know what spinning wire is?

131
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,320
The spinning wire is exclusive

132
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,090
to Mingfeng Building.

133
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,260
It’s said the wire
is extremely thin, light,

134
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,460
but sharper than blade.

135
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,440
A disciple of our fortress

burst into the forest

137
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,360
by accident.

138
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,630
Once his arms and legs touched the wire,

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,800
crack!

140
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,400

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,240
He stepped on leaves

and stones in the formation

144
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,440
and crossed the river without activating

146
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,850

00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,590
It’s alright.

167
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,880
He escapes to Ximo River.

168
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,240
Guard the forest and he won’t get in.

Aunt, it’s my fault.

172
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,600
He escaped from my watch.

173
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,260
Actually, I caught up with him.

174
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,500
But he...

175
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,490
How dare you speak of it?

176
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,180
Ma’am, what did I do?

177
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,470

The master is your tutor.

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,200
You offend him now.

182
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,000

will you show no respect
to your parents?

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,860
Why would I apologize?

185
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,370
I didn’t tear down his stairs.

186
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,300
Don’t talk back.

187
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,490
We’ll deal with this later.

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,010
The forest is full of traps.

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,370
Even I dare not to step in.

190
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,740
How dare you burst in?

191
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,550
The intruder went in.

192
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,040
I can’t leave him alone.

193
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,240
-He passed the Spinning...
-Silence!

194
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,630
You don’t need to worry about him.

195
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,060
Go back to your study.

196
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,800
There’s an intruder in the fortress.

197
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
How could I concentrate?

198
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight

199
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,160
doesn’t need your protection.

200
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,070
Go back to your room

201
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,670
and review your behavior.

202
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,190
You’re grounded.

203
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,860
Aunt, the stairs were...

204
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,380
Sheng,

205
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,980
you do the same.

206
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,410
Go to your room.

207
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,300
Zhou Fei.

208
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,900
Zhou Fei, I’m speaking to you.

209
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,810
Are you deaf?

210
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,700
What?

211
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,480
Girls should be meek.

212
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,250
Why waving your blade each day?

213
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,090
You’re born in the fortress.

214
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,640
When you’re married one day, with me,

215
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,060
no one would dare to mistreat you.

216
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,210
Why don’t you say it to the leader?

217
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,540
Ask her to be a meek, sewing girl.

218
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,210
I agree with you on that.

219
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,480
The fortress was headed by my family.

220
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,790
Without a capable leader,
Aunt took over.

221
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,520
These things shouldn’t be your concern.

222
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,850
That’s very nice of you.

223
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,660
They shouldn’t be
your concern, either, loser.

224
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,800
Who is the loser?

225
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,670
Whoever follows me.

226
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,340
<i>Hall of Elders</i>

227
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,620
<i>Hall of Elders</i>
Parents’ concern for their children

228
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,300
is so unpredictable.

229
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,760
If Fei is half

230
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,260
as obedient as Sheng,

231
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,470
I won’t beat her again.

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,130
Fei seems

233
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,260
stubborn,

234
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,750
but she knows what to do.

235
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,170
Don’t worry.

236
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,020
I’m worried about Sheng.

237
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,840
After his dad passed away,

238
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,180
I place high hopes on him

239
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,270
and teach him myself,

240
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,590
hoping to hand the fortress over to him
as soon as possible.

241
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,140
Sheng isn’t gifted with martial art.

242
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,480
But it’s not a problem.

243
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,470
We can train him.

244
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,010
The boy is sentimental and distracted.

245
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,120
I’m afraid, one day on a whim,

246
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,110
he’ll go astray.

247
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,300
Sheng.

248
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,020
<i>Li Yan, Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

249
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,980
You’re leaving?

250
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,690
Exactly.

251
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,750
The fortress teems with talents.

252
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,280
I’m not indispensable.

253
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,940
The intruder is trapped in the forest.

254
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,560
There’s nothing to worry about.

255
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,910
Aunt won’t let you go.

256
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
I’ll take way of Ximo River.

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,190
Sheng, are you insane?

258
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,680
Did you forget a few light-footed

259
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,160
disciples tried to cross Ximo River

260
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,480
and were trussed up by the guardian

261
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,680
and hung along the cliff?

262
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,200
Sheng, you won’t make across.

263
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,820
I’ll have a try.

264
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,040
Aunt!

265
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,570
Let go.

266
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,040
Guard that area.

267
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,160
I’ll take care of here.

268
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,100
They reinforced the defense.

269
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,940
How can I get in?

270
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,700
See you around.

271
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,360
What are you doing?

272
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,220
My brother left.

273
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
Glad to know. Leave me alone.

274
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,390
Before he left, he said

275
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,260
he’d cross Ximo River.

276
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,090
What?

277
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,520
What are you doing?

278
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,740
Stay out of this.

279
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,470
The fortress is invaded.

280
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,500
You’re making it worse.

281
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,340
Alright.

282
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,660
Stay and make yourself a heroine.

283
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
I’m leaving.

284
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,720
Do you really want to go?

285
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,480
That’s odd.

286
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,370
I’m treated like an orphan,

287
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,880
yet I don’t want to run away.

288
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,260
Why are you, the future leader,

289
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,430
so eager to leave?

290
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,370
The scold and physical abuse

291
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,710
are out of love from your parents.

292
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,180
But I...

293
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,440
I don’t give a damn

294
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,610
about being the incompetent successor.

295
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,660
Beyond the river,

296
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,900
there’s a vast world

297
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,240
with countless martial artists.

298
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,620
I’ll do my best

299
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,530
to make my own achievements.

300
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,730
So long.

301
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,170
Li Sheng!

302
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,020
Li Sheng!

303
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,920
Is it an auspicious day?

304
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,530
Two more to seek their doom.

305
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,200
The flow is unusual.

306
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,470
Something is wrong.

307
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,350
Li Sheng!

308
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,350
Come back!

309
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,960
Li Sheng!

310
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,390
Beyond the river

311
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,900
is my world.

312
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,630
Why are the wires moving?

313
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,980
If I didn’t kick you,

314
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,180
your leg would have been severed

315
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,220
from your body.

316
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,320
Why did you come down?

317
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,110
Leave me alone. Get up there.

318
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,240
It’s too late.

319
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,300
We make across,

320
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,280
or we die.

321
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,880
If it’s head, I’ll save them.

322
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,420
If it’s the other, I’ll watch.

323
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,540
It’s Heaven’s will

324
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,860
that I stay out of it.

325
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,580
<i>Insightful and Open-minded</i>

326
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,030
Sir,

327
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,370
the enemy is in the dark

328
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,600
and you’re on the bank.

329
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,460
I’m afraid the Ximo River...

330
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,040
Sit.

331
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,260
Have a seat.

332
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,300
<i>Insightful and Open-minded</i>

333
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,320
Empty city stratagem.

334
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,490
If I stood guard at the pavilion,

335
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,710
would the boy come out?

336
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,540
The river is defenseless,

337
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,270
but the formation is fully on.

338
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,550
Sorry.

339
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,270
I used to boast as a man

340
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,560
and disdain to hang out with you girls.

341
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,980
But now,

342
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,240
you’ll die because of me.

343
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,360
Get over yourself.

344
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,940
I won’t die

345
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,690
because of you.

346
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,170
I came on my will.

347
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,410
So it’s suicide.

348
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,120
The intruder must be a top martial man

349
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,960
to pass the formation.

350
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,480
Leave me alone.

351
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,810
Go back and tell my mother.

352
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,920
If she meets him,

353
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,050
kill him.

354
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,160
It’s easy to kill me.

355
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,570
But you have to stay alive.

356
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,610
It’s you.

357
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,720
How is his footwork possible?

358
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,400
Are you human or ghost?

359
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,160
I weigh the options.

360
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,170
Human is a better choice than ghost.

361
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,540
He’s the intruder I met in the forest.

362
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,610
Pardon me.

363
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,620
Good to see you again.

364
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,250
This is a core of the formation.

365
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,200
Get out now!

366
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,420
Which way?

367
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,320
Go southwest.

368
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,610
Go southwest.

369
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,480
Hey!

370
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,850
Why did you listen to the intruder?

371
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,450
An intruder who passed the formation.

372
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,720
Weed Spirit.

373
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
The formation is moving again.

374
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,200
Go northwest.

375
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,480
What? Pardon?

376
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,200
Bastard, don’t touch my cousin.

377
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,780
I’ve never seen the formation fully on.

Sophisticated,

379
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,450
but it moves in pattern.

380
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,810
I guess the fish is in my net.

381
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,640
Alright. Time to draw it in.

382
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,270

Ten years ago after Jinfeng was killed,

385
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,310
I asked you this.

386
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,550
What is it that the Lis are protecting

387
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,420

-Yan, what’s going on?

391
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,340
It’s my brother, Li Sheng.

392
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,390
He’s gonna cross Ximo River.

393
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,470
Fei goes after him.

is a 1,000-year-old catfish.

If he catches them,

399
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,750
will he eat them up?

400
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,810
Mister,

401
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,440
who are you?

402

You don’t know me, do you?

403

I’m the old catfish.

404
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,670
Ah?

405
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,650
Shut your mouth.

406
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640

is such an eye opener.

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,200
I’m pretty old.

413

But I’ve never met a man
who seeks his own doom.

Are you tired of life?

You passed my Spinning Wire Formation?

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,300
Forgive my impertinence.

417
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,280
I’m new in town and find no entrance.

418
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,260
This is the only way,

419
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,820
so I have to try.

420
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,020
I never expected the guardian

421
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,980

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,850
Boy,

424
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,660
I can see

425
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,420
you have talents,

426
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,040
and keen eyes,

427
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,340
and a good look.

428
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,710
But it’s a pity

429
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,880
you’re not in luck.

430

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,770
If we didn’t have a visitor,

432
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,930
I’d throw you two in the river

433
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,470
to sober up.

434
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,180
Is this

435
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,360

436
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,930
What’s your name, sir?

437
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,750
My last name is Xie,

I’m just passing by.

441
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,780
I didn’t help much.

442
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,140
Thanks to this lady’s quick hand.

443
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,440
There is nothing but mountains here.

444
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,910
Not many views.

445
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,150
I presume you didn’t come

446
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,600
for the view at midnight, did you?

447

Mother,

448
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,590
he could have stayed hidden.

449
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,280
Seeing that we

450
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,740
triggered the formation off,

451
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,440
he risked his life saving ours.

452
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,420
Shut up!

453
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,790

454

you’re looking for

459
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,230
in the fortress at midnight?

460
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,800
To be honest,

461
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,010
I come to visit someone at request.

462
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,130
But your defense is so strong

463
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,010
that I have no options

464
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,800
but to do a thing so offensive.

465
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,260
Please forgive me.

466
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Who are you visiting?

467
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,090
May I ask

468
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,730
if Lord Gantang is in your fortress?

469
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,560
Who told you

470
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,930
this man is here?

471
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,990
The man who made the request.

472
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,090
What if he lied?

473
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,240
What he asked is of great significance.

474
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,360
If he intended to make fun of me,

475
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,680
it wouldn’t be on this.

476
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,820
What else did he say?

477
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,500
He said he had a little friction

478
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,400
with the leader of the fortress, Mr. Li,

479
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,340
years ago.

480
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,380
It’s not a big deal.

481
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,410
The leader must be busy.

482
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,740
We’d better not get him bothered

483
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,840
in this trivial matter.

484
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,560
-You’re a dead man.
-You’re a dead man.

485
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,800
Did Wang Lin ask you to come?

486
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,490
Exactly.

487
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,330
I didn’t know

488
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,090
you’re the famous Leader Li.

489
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,270
It’s a great honor

490
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,750
to meet you today.

491
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,320
What have you done

492
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,020
that got yourself this doomed job?

493
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,060
I would kill you

494
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,170
with my palm due to his name, Wang Lin.

495
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,220
I’m nobody

496
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,460
but an errand man.

497
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,690
How could I have anything to do
with General Wang Lin?

498
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,270
Please don’t joke.

499
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,200
But you saved my daughter and my nephew.

500
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,200
We’re even now.

501
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,770
Hand over the old bastard’s token.

502
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,560
I’ll have you escorted out safe.

503
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,570
I shouldn’t

504
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,330
disobey your order,

505
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,170
but

506
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
why do you want Anping Token?

507
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,880
You’re so candid.

508
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,420
Not even an excuse.

509
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,570
But General Wang Lin

510
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,340
gave this to me on his death bed.

511

512
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,770
that I’d guard it with my life.

513
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,650
