<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 14</i>

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,680
Let’s get some rest here.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,870
Once Dragon Master and the troops leave,

19
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,190
we can get out and escape.

20
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,210
Escape?

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Dragon Master is onto you.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Don’t even dream about escaping.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,310
Dragon Master will hunt you down

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,060
no matter where you are.

25
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,760
You think this crappy hideout

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,340
can keep him away? Don’t be ridiculous!

27
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,040
Aren’t you his follower?

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,120
Wouldn’t he save you?

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,550
If he arrives,

30
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,850
I’ll be his first target of murder.

31
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,900
Others take in disciples

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,730
while Dragon Master has adopted 18 kids.

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,880
I heard others call you “Young Master”.

34
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,320
Don’t flatter me. I’m ashamed of it.

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Don’t you know

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
even dogs

37
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,800
have names, too?

38
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,440
Each time we see him,

39
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,530
we can only speak in prostration.

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,270
He’s also

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,980
marked all of us.

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,080
Where’s your mark?

43
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,830
Didn’t you see that big mark?

44
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,680
You should be ashamed.

45
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,720
You can say that again.

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,050
Be that as it may,

47
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,510
I’m the smartest and most obedient

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,830
people pleaser.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,500
So he always takes me with him.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,800
Old Dragon was too dull

51
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,690
to be anywhere near Master,

52
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,030
so he could only swallow his pride

53
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,300
and suck up to me.

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,540
That’s why I took him

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,600
to take care of that old fart.

56
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,030
Supposedly,

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,680
it wouldn’t take him too long.

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,370
But we didn’t expect

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,740
the North Blade

60
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,710
had help.

61
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,710
You’re good!

62
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,760
You killed Old Dragon.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,360
Were it before that I bullied others

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,750
and made mistakes,

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,420
I’d be whipped and let go.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
But this time,

67
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,140
whipping alone wouldn’t be enough.

68
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,210
You’re going to get beaten up.

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,040
The South and North Blades
were the Top Two.

70
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,350
Li Zheng was in the south

71
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,820
while Guan Feng was in the north,
hence the titles.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Old Master Li was
well-connected.

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,920
He became

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,950
a household name

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,940
because of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

76
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
On the contrary,

77
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Mr. Guan, Guan Feng,

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,200
was less engaged

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,450
although he was ten years older.

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,280
There were stories
about him in the past,

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,950
but ever since that armed rebellion,

82
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,080
he never came to Central Plains again

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,130
and only existed in stories.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,070
My mother once told me about them.

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,520
The South Blade was cold

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,970
as the snowstorm

87
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,980
while the North Blade
could cut off water.

88
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,610
The North Blade was fierce.

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,830
Yes, he was,

90
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,870
fierce and shameless.

91
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,640
At that time,

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,660
I believed I was skilled enough

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,260
to leave for Central Plains.

94
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,800
My master didn’t want me to,

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,170
but I thought he was timid

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,960
and old.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,820
I didn’t listen to him.

98
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,680
Seeing that he couldn’t change my mind,

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,440
he told me over and over before I left

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,540
to always think twice.

101
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,820
He said,

102
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,800
“look,

103
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,880
your blade

104
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,330
is similar to a farmer’s hoe

105
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,830
and an accountant’s abacus.

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,120
Both are to get things done,

107
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,510
not to gain fame and wealth.

108
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,530
Do not mistake it”.

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,090
How is a blade equal to
a hoe or an abacus?

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,780
I didn’t get it either,

111
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
so I ignored it.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,490
I thought

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,390
a blade is a weapon.

114
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,990
It has a soul

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,390
that connects mine

116
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,220
as if it were part of my body.

117
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,750
How could it be compared
with a lifeless tool?

118
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,900
After I arrived in Central Plains,

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,260
soon,

120
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,350
I made a name of myself

121
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,600
by this blade.

122
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,940
I was proud

123
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,700
and I planned

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,970
to start my own sect

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,670
to revitalize the North Blade.

126
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,030
Within six months,

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,110
I challenged seven masters

128
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,790
and beat them all

129
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,190
until...

130
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,390
Soon after the North Blade,
Ji Yunchen, arrived,

131
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,920
he defeated seven masters in a row.

132
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
So far, he hasn’t lost once.

133
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,670
He’s really something!

134
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,830
He hasn’t challenged Mr. Yin.

135
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,920
You know what?

136
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,270
His master holed up

137
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,390
far away from Central Plains for so long

138
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,070
because

139
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,970
he had lost to the Mountain Sword,
Yin Wenlan.

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,510
Obviously,

141
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,550
water cutting is nothing.

142
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,320
It doesn’t deserve to be
one of the two Blades

143
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,010
as the Snow-breaking Blade does.

144
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,600
Those rumors can’t be trusted.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,910
I agree.

146
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,300
Where are you going next, Mr. Yan?

147
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,080
Not sure yet.

148
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,510
Please enjoy.

149
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,580
Please.

150
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:45,460
<i>Yin’s Mansion</i>

151
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,460
Sir,

152
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,600
you’d better leave.

153
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Yin Wenlan!

154
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,220
<i>Yin Wenlan, the Mountain Sword</i>

155
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,940
Are you not up for the challenge?

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,580
Fine.

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,480
I’ll wait here for three days.

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,110
If you don’t come out,

159
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,590
I’ll tell the world

160
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,150
the Mountain Sword is
inferior to the North Blade.

161
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,880
Yin Wenlan!

162
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,590
When my mother was about my age,

163
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,520
she broke into Demons Manor

164
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,200
and battled the top three Demons

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,700
together with Duan Jiuniang.

166
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,590
The latter was well-known for her Palm

167
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,140
in her early 20s.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,670
And Mr. Ji

169
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,940
quickly made a name of himself,

170
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,550
planning to set up his own sect.

171
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,100
But what about me?

172
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,060
What’s on your mind?

173
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
I think

174
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,880
my weapon is no different

175
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
from a blunt tool.

176
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,080
Mr. Ji,

177
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,910
then what happened?

178
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,300
<i>Yin’s Mansion</i>

179
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,820
What are you doing here?

180
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,080
Beat it, kid.

181
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,770
I’m not any kid.

182
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,520
The Mountain Sword,

183
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,120
Yin Wenlan, is my father.

184
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,660
You’re Yin Wenlan’s son?

185
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,350
Good. Go home

186
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,110
and tell your father to come out.

187
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,840
No.

188
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,760
Why?

189
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
I sneaked out

190
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,430
because I didn’t want to study.

191
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,670
What do you want to do?

192
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,360
Play games.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,450
Alright.

194
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,280
Let’s go

195
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,210
play games.

196
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,760
Once you have enough fun,

197
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,930
I’ll bring you back.

198
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,150
Alright?

199
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,350
This will be

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,630
our secret.

201
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,200
Let’s go.

202
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,960
That day,

203
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,640
Guan Feng charged at
Mr. Yin with his blade.

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
The two fought for 300 rounds.

205
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,870
Everyone,

206
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,060
can you imagine that?

207
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,590
They fought so hard

208
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,000
that the world seemed to
fall apart in darkness.

209
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,080
All that could be seen
were gleaming blades.

210
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,790
Still, Mr. Yin’s skills

211
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,560
were unparalleled, one of a kind.

212
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,720
The Mountain Sword

213
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,180
crushed the North Blade

214
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,080
who lost terribly

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,990
and made a fool of himself.

216
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,030
-Yes! Great!
-Good!

217
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,110
Sir,

218
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,640
who’s the North Blade

219
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,150
that lost terribly to my father?

220
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,280
I can’t wait to see that loser.

221
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,000
Everyone, that coward Guan Feng

222
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,400
was so scared of Mr. Yin...

223
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,180
What are you doing?

224
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,400
That he...

225
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,550
What are you doing?

226
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,320
-Wet his pants.
-I want to hear more!

227
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,910
And he shivered in his sleep.

228
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,400
Hadn’t I heard

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,830
the made-up story,

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
I wouldn’t have lost control of myself.

231
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,040
You lost control

232
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,020
so you held that boy hostage

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,970
to force his father to battle you.

234
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,140
<i>Shanchan Temple</i>

235
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,570
Father.

236
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,850
Are you that boy?

237
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,620
Master,

238
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,000
bad news!

239
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,340
<i>Your son Yin Pei is in my hands...</i>

240
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,020
<i>Ji Yunchen</i>

241
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,170
Bring me the sword.

242
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,550
Yes.

243
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,090
My father could destroy you

244
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,880
even if he was injured.

245
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,920
That’s right.

246
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,670
I wasn’t his match.

247
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,830
Mr. Ji,

248
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,590
I didn’t expect

249
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,960
you’d go so low

250
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,800
just to challenge me.

251
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,390
My master’s reputation can’t be ruined.

252
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,840
Today,

253
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,080
I’m here to defend the North Blade.

254
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,910
I didn’t know until later

255
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,580
that he just drove those Demons away

256
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,230
before I picked a fight.

257
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,720
He was already injured

258
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,110
but had to come

259
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,670
under my threat.

260
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,930
When we fought,

261
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,100
he could’ve killed me.

262
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,400
I’d accept

263
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,960
whatever the result was.

264
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,470
I could start over

265
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,960
in ten years.

266
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,760
But

267
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,280
by breaking your sword,

268
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,260
you’re insulting me!

269
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,850
Mr. Ji,

270
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,220
you’ll have to go through thick and thin

271
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,560
in the years to come.

272
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,500
I simply don’t want

273
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,410
young men like you

274
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,980
to die in my hands for nothing.

275
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,300
Master, Master!

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,520
Help!

277
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,840
We’re under attack!

278
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,590
What?

279
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,230
While you lured my father out,

280
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,460
those monsters broke in

281
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,640
and slaughtered my whole family!

282
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
A hundred of them

283
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
were killed!

284
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,690
Why are you still alive?

285
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,350
Why aren’t you dead?

286
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,260
Father!

287
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,690
Father!

288
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,480
Father! Father!

289
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,070
Father!

290
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,910
Father! Father! Father!

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:23,150
Father! Father! Father!

292
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,560
So when you brought Yin Pei back,

293
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,190
his entire family had been killed.

294
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
How could a little boy

295
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,710
handle the sudden loss of his family?

296
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,370
Not to mention seeing them
dead right in front of him.

297
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,470
Mr. Ji,

298
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,000
there are all kinds of words.

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,380
Some are inspiring,

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
while some are poisonous

301
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,520
and misleading.

302
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,590
People can say whatever they want.

303
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,570
It’s up to you to listen to them or not.

304
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,950
Once you do,

305
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,700
you’ll be manipulated by them.

306
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,350
You don’t know

307
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,770
how evil people can be.

308
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,230
Not everyone

309
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,380
is as honest as you.

310
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,710
Back then, you were young

311
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,940
and gullible.

312
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,390
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

313
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,320
What do you know?

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,230
Do you know how it feels

315
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,800
to lose your entire family overnight?

316
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,560
Mr. Yin,

317
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,540
justice must be done.

318
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,360
But you’re targeting the wrong person.

319
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,110
Others don’t blame you

320
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,070
out of pity.

321
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,420
Do you really think you’ve won?

322
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,820
If so, the real culprit
is still out there

323
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,180
gloating over your stupidity.

324
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Mr. Xie,

325
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,870
you don’t need to speak for me.

326
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,040
I made a mistake.

327
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,350
I owe him.

328
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,660
I won’t deny it.

329
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,830
The one who raised me

330
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,880
caused the death of my family.

331
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,470
You found out about that

332
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,110
by accident

333
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,960
and left in a rage

334
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,160
before running into Dragon Master

335
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,250
who took you in.

336
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,710
Everyone,

337
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,020
it’s almost time.

338
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,220
I’ll walk you out.

339
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,660
General.

340
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,920
Found anything?

341
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,190
Finding His Majesty

342
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,230
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

343
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,310
This time,

344
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,040
he’s with Miss Zhou and Miss Wu.

345
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,230
The three of them

346
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,880
make a bigger target than one.

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,900
Should I search again?

348
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,540
Don’t bother.

349
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,590
We can’t stop

350
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,690
His Majesty anyway.

351
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,950
Just go back

352
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,560
and report everything to Lord Gantang.

353
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

354
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:31,910
Yah!

355
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,830
Master,

356
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,680
General Wen seems to have left

357
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,470
and gone south.

358
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,830
Very well.

Mount Heng is in that direction.

365
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,330
Let’s go.

366
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,800
We’re out.

367
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,500
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

368
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,880
Don’t mention it.

369
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,800
Mr. Xie, where are you going next?

370
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,880
Any place is fine

371
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,110
for an idler like me.

372
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,310
After all that happened

373
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,430
between you two,

374
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,200
where are you heading to?

375
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
If you want,

376
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,170
you can all go to our Fortress.

377
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,510
Is that an invitation?

378
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,550
Yes. Are you going or not?

379
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,640
That boy toy could be a burden.

380
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,490
It’s not like we can kill him.

381
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,120
Should we leave him in the woods?

382
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,840
Excuse me?

383
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,750
That you’re the South Blade’s
granddaughter

384
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,220
doesn’t mean you can be disrespectful.

385
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,070
Without your grandfather,

386
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,640
you’re nothing.

387
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,520
Are the Two Blades together

388
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,920
the Mountain Sword’s match?

389
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,040
Enough.

390
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,830
Alright!

391
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,350
Show me your swordsmanship!

392
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,520
-Sure. Bring it on!
-Fei!

393
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,290
Come on!

394
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,980
Fei, ignore him.

395
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,280
Relax.

396
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,160
He doesn’t know

397
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
how to use

398
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,880
the Mountain Sword.

399
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,230
I’m not as good as
my mother or grandfather,

400
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,920
but at least, I didn’t
bring shame on them

401
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,560
to be someone else’s dog.

402
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,310
What did you say? Shut up,

403
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,000
or I’ll silence you!

404
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,310
Dragon Master has come!

405
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,430
Didn’t you say
we could depend on General Wen?

406
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,590
How come those clowns

407
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,640
caught up with us so soon?

408
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,920
He lost me in the middle of the fight.

409
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,040
Of course, he wouldn’t

410
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,220
waste more time on them

411
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,460
but left in a hurry.

412
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,000
What’s that about?

413
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,160
What did I do wrong?

414
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,000
You’re a pain in the neck.

415
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,020
We should go.

416
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,640
This place is isolated.

417
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,920
They wouldn’t have come this far.

What’s that supposed to mean?

423
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,740
The pills we take every day

424
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,530
give us certain scent

425
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,800
that can only be detected

426
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,350
by that sniffer mouse

427
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,460
in his hand.

428
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,090
Wherever I am,

429
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,400
he can track me down.

430
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Why didn’t you

431
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,070
tell us earlier?

432
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,880
Now is too late.

433
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,110
You might as well shut up.

434
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,680
Give me

435
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,710
my dog back,

436
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,040
and you can die with dignity.

437
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,100
Really?

438
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,800
This is the first time

439
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,830
that I’ve been told

440
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,820
to die with dignity.

441
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,110
I wasn’t too sure at first,

442
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,980
but seeing that you’re
going to such great lengths,

443
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,900
that thing

444
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,800
must be true.

448
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,560
can be abandoned or killed anytime.

Why is Dragon Master after you?

450
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,110
Is that his style?

451
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,700
Young man,

452
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,640
those lies you told

453
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,870
don’t make sense at all.

454
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,430
Try harder and use your brain

455
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,740
next time.

456
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,750
So

457
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,430
he’s after you

458
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,020
because you stole something from him

459
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,590
and tricked that old fool

460
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,860
into covering you.

461
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,230
Hadn’t it been

462
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,900
for that sword,

463
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,590
I wouldn’t have

464
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,800
lifted a finger to save you.

465
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,580
Am I that stupid?

466
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,350
No wonder

467
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,760
General Wen showed up out of nowhere.

468
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
May I know

469
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,160
who you are?

470
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,190
A little help here!

471
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,440
His Majesty is a member
of the imperial family.

472
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,560
Correct.

473
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,680
I’m of noble birth.

474
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,520
Wen Yu’s responsible for my safety.

475
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,670
I don’t like being followed around,

476
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,350
so he gave me a whistling arrow

477
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,530
in case of emergency.

478
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,090
Once it’s released,

479
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,680
wherever I am,

480
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,590
they’ll come to protect me.

481
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,160
Dragon Master,

482
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,920
you know whether that sword

483
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,130
belongs to you or not.

484
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,520
Only the original owner

485
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,160
can claim it back.

486
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,550
Others don’t deserve it.

487
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,680
Unfortunately,

488
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,470
that person is long gone.

489
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,940
We’re only two thieves

490
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,510
trying to steal that sword.

491
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,310
I don’t think

492
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,430
a renowned figure like you

493
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,760
would stoop this low, would you?

494
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,310
Let’s go.

495
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,950
Mr. Xie saved us again.

496
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,230
Look how smug he is!

497
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,160
Will this really work?

498
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,780
We can only try our luck.

499
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,860
Did you see his leg?

500
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,630
Was he injured?

501
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,400
General Wen must’ve

502
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,100
injured him.

503
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,120
Otherwise,

504
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,460
I wouldn’t take such a risk.

505
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Wen Yu alone

506
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,730
might not be that devil’s match,

507
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,000
but his troops are many

508
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,470
and they’re well-disciplined.

509
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,060
Together, they taught him a lesson.

510
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,040
Had he been unharmed,

511
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,680
my trick

512
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,760
wouldn’t have worked.

513
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,000
Even if we had backups,

514
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,460
he wouldn’t

515
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,690
be afraid.

516
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,350
This place only seems to be peaceful.

517
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,630
The more fearless I look,

518
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,590
the more cautious Dragon Master is.

519
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,980
My lord, are we letting them go?

520
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,590
The important figure
General Wen mentioned

521
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,980
must be that young man.

522
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,760
We already

523
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,040
lost once to Wen Yu

524
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,200
and suffered a huge loss
outside Sanchun Inn.

525
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,430
Can’t you tell

526
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,560
why Wen Yu left all of a sudden?

527
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,880
If that man is related
to the imperial family,

528
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,070
things will become tricky.

529
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,000
Yes, my lord.

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,110
We’d better not challenge the court.

531
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,190
Will Dragon Master come again?

532
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,470
Take a guess.

533
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,830
Stop joking around. I’m serious.

534
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,400
He’ll soon see through my lie.

535
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,860
Let’s hide ourselves first.

536
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,920
Come.

537
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,700
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

538
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,000
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>
Sniffer mice are sensitive.

539
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,590
They’ll hide

540
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,920
from the crowd.

541
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,280
Look.

542
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,830
That mouse

543
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,950
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>
is going uphill freely.

544
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,800
That only means one thing.

545
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,190
No one else

546
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,000
is here.

547
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,230
Oh, no!

548
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,310
We’re exposed.

549
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,110
Let’s go!

550
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,760
Let’s go.

551
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,230
That stinky mouse!

552
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,000
Go ahead. I’ll cover you.

553
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Let’s go.

554
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,740
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

555
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,640
Go get her!

556
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,470
-Yes.
-Let’s go.

557
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,470
Where’s Fei?

558
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,800
She stayed to buy us time.

559
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,230
Buy us time?

560
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,070
She’s killing me!

561
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,350
Look, Mr. Ji,

562
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,520
leave with Miss Wu.

563
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,430
I’ll go find Fei.

564
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:26,920
Sure.

565
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,190
We’ll catch up with you later.

566
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,400
If you don’t see us

567
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,310
in one hour…

568
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,470
I’ll take them into the secret tunnel
in Mount Heng,

569
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,870
and then escort Miss Wu to the Fortress.

570
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,110
Alright. Thanks.

571
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,710
Crap!

572
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,470
My energy is drained

573
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,640
after the attack earlier.

574
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,710
One more strike

575
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,340
can probably end me now.

576
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,560
Heck!

577
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,710
I can only bluff like Xie Yun.

578
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,000
You’re a Guardian, huh?

579
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,880
I bet

580
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
even Mu Xiaoqiao is better than you.

581
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,770
Who are you?

582
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,760
Take a guess.

583
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,340
I guess you’re about to meet your doom!

584
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,830
Watch it!

585
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,800
I can cut off the heavenly river.

586
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,640
Don’t blink.

587
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,470
Seize her!

588
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,800
A one-on-one with Dragon Master?

589
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,000
What were you thinking?

590
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,840
Didn’t you pull me up?

591
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,150
Hadn’t it been for his palm,

592
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,100
you wouldn’t have

593
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
had such strength.

594
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,910
Should I thank him for that?

595
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,180
My skills have improved a lot.

596
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,520
Stop laughing!

597
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,050
As odd as he seems,

598
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,830
I still trust him for no reason.

599
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,120
Is it because of his look?

600
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,950
Are you messing with me?

601
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,040
Wait after we get out of here.

602
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,390
What are you looking for?

603
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,330
The secret tunnel should be nearby.

604
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,370
It’s concealed though.

605
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,630
Fei! Fei!

606
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,760
Come here!

607
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,390
Should I call you bold or stupid?

608
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,950
Where’s your blade?

609
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
None of your own business.

610
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,950
You fought against Dragon Master
barehanded.

611
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,600
That’s...

612
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,000
I’ve got nothing

613
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,520
other than this.

614
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,470
Make do with it.

615
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,560
Where did you get this?

616
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
Is it to brace yourself up?

617
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,870
I found it just now.

618
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,950
You can think up

619
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,800
all kinds of ways

620
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,600
to mock your own people.

621
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,390
But when it comes to

622
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,950
life and death,

623
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,190
you can only talk with your fists.

624
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,190
Can you think first next time?

625
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,040
-You... You...
-Fei.

626
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,320
Stop arguing.

627
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,000
Don’t act rashly again.

628
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,280
But...

629
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,150
We’re worried about you.

630
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,910
I...

631
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,430
Isn’t he safe and sound?

632
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,870
So am I.

633
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,760
Yes, you returned intact,

634
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,630
but not your blade.

635
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,390
Once I’m back,

636
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,840
I’ll make you a bag

637
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,230
with multiple pouches around

638
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,360
for blades.

639
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,080
You can carry it

640
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,800
like a peacock spreading its tail.

641
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,450
How nice and convenient that is!

642
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,630
You won’t be short of weapons again.

643
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,630
Where are you going?

644
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,500
I’m going to...

645
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,870
to... The Fortress
of the Forty-Eight with you.

646
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,150
Let’s go.

647
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Come on, Fei.

648
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,120
There are signs of struggle.

649
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,520
Dragon Master must be badly injured.

650
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,920
We can rest inside for now

651
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,840
until he leaves.

652
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,800
Is this the Forbidden Hall
of the Qi School?

653
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,890
Go get some clean water.

654
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,090
What for?

655
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,020
You don’t need to know.

And Xiao...

665
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,320
I lied to them.

666

Call me Xie Yun.

667
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,870
Mr. Xie,

668
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,000
what is it about the Mountain Sword

669
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,780
that you told Dragon Master?

670
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,990
He probably made that up.

671
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,470
Sorry.

672
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,670
I lied to him.

673
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,080
But I did hear things

674
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,930
that might or might not be true.

675
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,370
What do you know?

676
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,520
It’s said that

677
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
when the South Blade
was hunted by Demons,

678
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,870
he fought and ran

679
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,650
but was almost caught more than once.

680
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,690
Then unexpectedly,

681
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,170
he destroyed his weapon.

682
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,760
Is that true?

683
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,980
Why did I hear nothing from my father?

684
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,150
I don’t

685
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,790
get that, either.

686
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,560
Think about it.

687
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,190
When someone is

688
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,330
after you,

689
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,360
will you destroy your weapon

690
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,190
instead of trying to escape?

691
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,240
Of course not.

692
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,070
Then those blabbermouths

693
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,110
spread rumors

694
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,360
about some evil magic

695
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,190
that as long as

696
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,630
one obtained a master’s weapon,

697
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,150
he could gain that person’s skills.

698
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,040
That’s bullcrap.

699
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,440
Utter nonsense.

700
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,910
Mr. Ji is unsuspecting.

701
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,060
He seems to be convinced.

702
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,520
Don’t look at me, Mr. Ji.

703
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,000
That’s just what I heard.

704
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,800
But I did learn to cast swords

705
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,300
to dig deep into it.

706
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,490
How could that be possible?

707
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,790
It’s baseless.

708
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,710
Are you saying

709
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,130
Dragon Master plotted
against Mr. Yin Wenlan

710
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,110
because of such hogwash?

711
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,040
About that,

712
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,660
you need to ask Mr. Yin.

713
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Mr. Yin.

714
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,950
Now, can you tell us

715
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,700
why Dragon Master insists on
having you back?

716
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,100
It makes sense

717
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,050
that you fell out
with your foster father

718
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,630
after knowing the truth

719
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,540
about your family’s murder.

720
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,840
What doesn’t make sense is

721
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,280
you’d come all the way

722
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,070
to kill a feeble man

723
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,760
at the cost of exposing yourself

724
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,100
after enduring years of humiliation.

725
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,710
He seemed to come to stir up trouble

726
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,560
with Old Dragon,

727
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,470
but actually, he wanted Old Dragon dead.

728
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,120
When he pretended to kill others

729
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,190
but got stopped

730
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,720
by your chopstick,

731
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,340
he didn’t leave

732
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,110
but went straight into the Sanchun Inn

733
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,720
and came at you.

734
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,760
He was picking a fight on purpose.

735
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,160
Exactly.

736
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,950
Then, of course,

737
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,710
you caught him.

738
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,950
Other than that,

739
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,350
he kept fanning the flames

740
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,350
to incite you to kill Old Dragon.

741
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,080
No wonder

742
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,590
he’s been clinging on to us

743
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,000
without any attempt to escape.

744
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,420
Later, when Dragon Master arrived

745
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,980
and encountered Wen Yu,

746
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,000
he managed to get out

747
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,960
and planned to kidnap Miss Wu.

748
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,020
That way,

749
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,020
he could take advantage
of Wen Yu’s power.

750
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,990
Although he failed,

751
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,630
he still got out

752
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,680
with us.

753
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,430
Miss Zhou.

754
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,670
You’re smart enough
to figure out everything.

755
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,360
Why are you asking me?

756
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,360
I’m not half

757
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,950
as smart and calculative as you are.

758
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,840
He can’t fight anymore.

759
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,950
What if

760
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,040
no one in the Inn could stop Old Dragon?

761
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,870
Did that ever occur to you?

762
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,720
Not everyone

763
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,810
is as lucky as you, lass!

764
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,260
You have family support and fine skills.

765
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
You’re so spoiled

766
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,040
and ignorant.

767
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Is that

768
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,320
a complaint or a compliment?

769
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,000
Without Ji Yunchen,

770
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,080
I would’ve become the heir

771
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,330
to the Mountain Sword.

772
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,470
You wouldn’t even get to lick my boots!

773
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,190
What did you say?

774
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,320
You heard me!

775
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,130
You...

776
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,450
Don’t mind it.

777
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,120
Yes, what could’ve happened?

778
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,080
The worst case would be Ji Yunchen

779
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,710
and some unlucky man

780
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,870
died in Old Dragon’s hands.

781
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,180
What was that to do with us?

782
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,370
So you could easily tell him

783
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,140
that Ji Yunchen was your enemy.

784
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,120
That wouldn’t raise any suspicion

785
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,560
as the good and the evil

786
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,910
were born to be foes.

787
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,800
Old Dragon wouldn’t suspect a thing.

788
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,670
If he killed Ji Yunchen,

789
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,580
that’d only boost his ego.

790
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,410
Because never did he know

791
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,480
that you’re a Yin,

792
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,850
nor would he ever expect

793
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,320
that you wouldn’t

794
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,310
go back after this.
