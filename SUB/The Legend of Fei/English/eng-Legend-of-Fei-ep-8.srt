Wish to wear clothes made of them.

19
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,360
My mother told me,

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
the people live in the muddy water

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,310
and can’t escape from the sufferings.

22
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,260
There is no such days.

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,440
They have to resort to

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
a few tunes.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,720
Anyone who endangers the people,

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,140
I’ll kill them.

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,230
Fei.

28
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,480
If you kill them all,

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,760
you will become

over time.

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,000
That way, you’ll do what they want,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,960
and you’ll be one of them.

34
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,250
Don’t worry.

35
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,940

I think we should forget it.

39
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,800
The city’s crawling with demons.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,270
It’s too dangerous for you to go there.

Mr. Bai, what’s going on out there?

51
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
I’ve checked.

52
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,910
No one’s watching us.

Okay, you go out with me.

Okay.

Although there were escapees,

70
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,230
it was still worthwhile.

72
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,230

making chaos for a long time.

off the hook.

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,920

83
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,220
Fortunately, they have been caught,

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,070
but there are still escapees.

So much food.

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,670
Oh, really.

91
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,760
I’ve been hungry for several days.

92
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,830
That’s all precious food.

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,880
The rumors you’ve heard are true.

96
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,920
What do you mean?

97
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,790
You see.

98
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,760
Shen Tianshu and Qiu Tianjin didn’t

99
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,940
communicate on the stage.

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,640
Something must have happened

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,340
between them.

102
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,910
Guys.

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,300
After committing such a serious crime,

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,980
shouldn’t he go through a thousand cuts?

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,710
One of the gang

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,950
survived the fire

107
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,600
yesterday.

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,360
You say.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,580
What should we do with him?

110
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,440
-Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
-Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

111
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,920
Fei.

112
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,510
How can you stand it if you’re here?

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,650
The Demons are drawing you out.

114
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,070
It’s impressive that

115
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,070
an evil man didn’t burn to death

116
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,950
in such a big fire in this guesthouse.

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Yeah.

118
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,250
I heard it from the cellmate.

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,230
The evil man

120
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,560
is about to be executed in public.

121
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,790
A public execution?

122
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,350
Yeah.

123
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,160
Oh, my God.

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,200
Then he’ll die.

125
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,900
Yeah.

126
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
You’re here all the time,

127
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
so you don’t know.

128
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,390
Your cake is so cold and hard.

129
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:45,920
No one wants to eat it.

130
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,550
Maybe someone’s still alive.

131
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,270
I’d like to go out to see.

132
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,000
Fei.

133
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Let me go with you.

134
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,790
No.

135
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,760
Chuchu, you can’t go.

136
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,310
If anything happens to you,

137
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,120
who will take care
of your little brother?

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,390
Stay here

139
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,440
and wait for me.

140
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,600
But

141
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,040
if anything happens to you,

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,120
I’ll die.

143
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,130
I’ll be back after saving them.

144
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,870
Then we’ll go back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

145
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,530
Okay.

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,310
Thanks.

147
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,360
Don’t go anywhere,

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,520
or the big black wolf will bite you.

149
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,710
Thank you for taking me in.

150
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,960
Thank you.

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,500
I’ll repay you if I live.

152
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,780
Ma’am.

153
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,330
I’m sorry.

154
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,230
Let me ask you something.

155
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,100
You can play Snow-breaking Blade?

156
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,470
Little girl.

157
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,720
Who taught you that?

158
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,220
Family heirloom.

159
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,090
Family heirloom?

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
What’s your relationship with Li Zheng?

161
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,160
He’s my grandfather.

162
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,670
Ma’am,

163
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,950
Ma’am,

164
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,110
we mean no harm.

165
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,310
Please don’t hurt Fei.

166
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,880
Who exactly are you?

167
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,910
If Li Zheng is your grandfather,

168
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,200
that... That makes me

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,730
your grandmother.

170
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,790
Watch your mouth,

171
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,030
or I’ll battle you

172
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,480
regardless of the result.

173
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
Why don’t you believe me?

174
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,720
You tell me.

175
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,910
My grandmother passed away

176
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,900
when giving birth to her second son.

177
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,440
Obviously, you’re lying!

178
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,640
You could say
whatever you want about me,

179
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,280
but not my family!

180
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,150
You’re loud.

181
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,200
Step-grandmother

182
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,520
also counts.

183
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,090
She must’ve lost her mind.

184
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,020
Sweetie,

185
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,570
I like you.

186
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,230
I didn’t do anything!

187
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,350
Fei! Fei!

188
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,200
She...

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,030
I didn’t do anything.

190
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,880
Can you hear me, Fei?

191
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,400
I didn’t do anything.

192
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,960
Miss, Miss.

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,440
Get her in the room.

194
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,750
Come.

195
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,080
Kill him!

196
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,640
Kill him! Kill him!

197
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,110
Chenfei is still alive!

198
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,230
Calm down.

199
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,220
Don’t act rashly.

200
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,470
-He must die!
-Kill him!

201
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,840
It’s him!

202
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,770
You traitor!

203
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,670
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

204
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,790
will make you pay!

205
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,390
Mr. Zhang,

206
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,580
hang in there.

207
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,800
Don’t let the lords down.

208
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,150
Kill me now!

209
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,530
Do it, bastard!

210
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,400
His accomplices are still out there.

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,520
Those who capture them

212
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,960
will be rewarded handsomely.

213
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,760
His accomplices are still out there.

214
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,520
Those who capture them

215
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,960
will be rewarded handsomely.

216
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,230
Mr. Xie.

217
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,520
Mr. Bai,

218
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,440
an innocent man’s life is on the line.

219
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,920
Are you going to do nothing?

220
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,710
He’s dying

221
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,480
whether we save him or not.

222
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,230
-Is he dead?
-Yes.

223
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,230
-How did he die?
-What happened?

224
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,440
Is he dead?

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,240
Mr. Xie,

226
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,400
I did

227
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,140
what I had to.

228
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,190
Demons are vicious and merciless.

229
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,840
They were holding a dying man hostage

230
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,200
-only to...
-Mr. Bai,

231
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,350
Huo’s Manor started as one of the sects.

232
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,590
Members they took in
from other small sects

233
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,880
are only a bunch of bandits.

234
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,100
Why have the Huos started

235
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,200
to build up their own force, buy horses

236
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,330
and rake up money all of a sudden?

237
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,400
Mr. Xie.

238
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,040
Whose boat does
Huo Liantao think he’s on?

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
Although His Highness

240
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,230
is new to this place,

241
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,840
he’s contacted Master Huo

242
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,790
only to

243
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,280
side with martial artists

244
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,080
to battle

245
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,840
Yu Wenzhi together.

246
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,360
Besides,

247
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,030
that sect houses all kinds of people.

248
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,030
His Highness

249
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,470
has no idea about

250
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,400
who they are

251
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,590
or what they’ve done.

252
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,120
You can stop there.

253
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,090
Everyone has a few bad friends.

254
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,370
But you should know

255
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,390
who that man

256
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,370
died for.

257
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,550
Does some promise weigh
more than your life?

258
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,030
Yes!

259
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,670
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,320
If I didn’t kick you,

261
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,440
your leg would have been severed

262
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,710
from your body.

263
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,280
As long as

264
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,400
she could breathe,

265
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,150
she’d save others no matter what.

266
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Leave me alone.

267
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,710
Get up there.

268
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,840
Too late.

269
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,840
Seriously,

270
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,640
do you know what’s happening?

271
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,110
Demons and Phoenix are all here.

272
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,520
Do you want to die?

273
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,910
I can’t abandon Li Sheng

274
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,280
and Chenfei.

275
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,590
If I leave

276
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,470
without them...

277
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,000
But she didn’t show up.

278
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,730
Did she...?

279
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,880
Mr. Xie,

280
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,900
where are you going?

281
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,270
Nothing.

282
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,560
Let’s go.

283
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,490
Once everything blows over,

284
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,090
and the coast is clear,

285
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,770
I’ll have men

286
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,360
bury your friends properly.

287
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,280
I hope

288
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,430
their bodies will still be intact

289
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,140
by then.

290
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,760
In this chaotic world, lives

291
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,640
are cheaper than grains,

292
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,830
fabrics, carriages and horses,

293
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,420
but not friendships.

294
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,310
What a tragedy!

295
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,400
Mr. Xie. Mr. Xie.

296
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Are you alright?

297
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,160
Mr. Xie,

298
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,420
we should go back.

299
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,850
Her skills

300
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,200
aren’t too bad

301
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,360
and her look is slightly better.

302
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,760
But she doesn’t look like Li Zheng

303
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,120
or me.

304
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,880
Does she

305
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,000
look more like her other grandmother?

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,280
Ma’am, Ma’am.

307
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,850
Ma’am,

308
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,530
she probably resembles her father.

309
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,870
That makes sense.

310
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,080
I’ve never seen him.

311
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160
Perhaps you can

312
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,740
introduce him to me some other day.

313
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,480
Ma’am,

314
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,600
may I know your name?

315
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,230
Call me Duan Jiuniang.

316
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,760
Who are you?

317
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,550
Where are your parents?

318
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,740
My name is Wu Chuchu.

319
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,200
My parents...

320
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,510
They died?

321
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,190
Well, that happens.

322
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,230
Look at me.

323
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,780
I have no family.

324
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,590
And my lover

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,480
always acts against me.

326
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,230
You must’ve got your temper

327
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,780
from your grandfather.

328
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,650
Am I right?

329
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,420
Answer me.

330
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,090
Why are you so quiet?

331
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,360
Say something!

332
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,000
Say it!

333
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,400
What happened?

334
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,400
Are you having a relapse?

335
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,110
Let Mr. Bai check you

336
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,140
in case you...

337
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,020
Mr. Bai.

338
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,940
Mr. Bai, what are you doing?

339
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
Zichen, help him up.

340
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,520
Get up, Mr. Bai.

341
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,670
I made a mistake.

342
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,350
Please punish me.

343
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,260
What do you mean?

344
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,830
Demons dragged Mr. Xie’s friend out

345
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,110
from the fire,

346
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,680
tortured him in cold blood

347
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,470
in public

348
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,670
and twisted the facts.

349
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,070
They disguised as civilians

350
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,220
and had no mercy on him.

351
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,470
I couldn’t see him

352
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,740
being tortured to death,

353
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,980
so I...

354
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
I ended his life.

355
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,200
Mr. Bai, you...

356
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,770
You killed his friend?

357
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,260
I...

358
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,890
Xie Yun...

359
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,740
Zichen,

360
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,290
calm down.

361
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,660
Mr. Bai,

362
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,470
please get up.

363
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,680
Come to think of it,

364
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,440
were there the one I was looking for,

365
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,160
Mr. Bai was sending a message,

366
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
telling her not to walk into the trap.

367
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,540
On top of that,

368
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,780
Chenfei was in excruciating pain.

369
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,780
He was hoping for a quick death.

370
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,450
I didn’t have the heart to do it,

371
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,380
and Mr. Bai actually did him a favor.

372
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,200
I owe you

373
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,940
and your friend my life.

374
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,680
Whatever you need me
to do in the future,

375
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
I’ll do it at all costs.

376
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,020
Never mind.

377
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,280
Zichen,

378
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,270
is there any liquor?

379
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,610
Liquor?

380
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,040
Chenfei,

381
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,780
I swear I’ll find Fei.

382
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
I’m Xie,

383
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
named Meimei,

384
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,160
also known as the Optimistic Man.

385
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,060
You are...

386
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,390
Xie Meimei?

387
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,390
Weed Spirit?

388
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,410
You’re awake,

389
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,920
Fei!

390
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,810
I think I heard Xie Yun calling me.

391
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,430
I know you’re worried about him.

392
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,590
Just relax.

393
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,310
I saw him leaving first that day.

394
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,100
That’s a relief.

395
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,100
-Xie Yun.
-Mr. Xie.

396
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,330
There you are!

397
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,090
You were out all night.
Haven’t you found anything?

398
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,620
Fei,

399
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,120
are you still alive?

400
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,360
Head means you’re safe

401
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,620
and tail...

402
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,200
-Open up!
-Open it!

403
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,190
Lord,

404
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,230
Blessed Dog’s men have withdrawn.

405
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,290
Found anything?

406
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,050
No.

407
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,570
<i>Stable as Mount Tai</i>

408
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,290
Qiu Tianjin bit more than he could chew.

409
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,260
And look what happened.

410
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,930
No one is left.

411
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,410
The gate is closed

412
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,170
and under close watch

413
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,380
by the local government.

414
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,330
Given that they managed to escape

415
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,780
and lie low for so long,

416
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,330
they must be something.

417
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,180
<i>Stable as Mount Tai</i>
Ignore others.

418
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,310
<i>Stable as Mount Tai</i>

419
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,300
<i>Stable as Mount Tai</i>
Just focus on our own search.

420
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,980
Don’t forget

421
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,780
what we’re here for.

422
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,450
Yes.

423
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,450
-Negative.
-Let’s go.

424
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,620
Search the next one.

425
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,140
What’s happening?

426
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,260
Lord has ordered us

427
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,500
to focus on our own search.

428
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,500
Jiachen, what’s the status?

429
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,930
Timber Wolf’s men
are doing their search.

430
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,100
Tell us the details.

431
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,290
Timber Wolf and Blessed Dog

432
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,410
are checking all places

433
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,570
separately

434
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,740
whether they’ve been searched

435
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,170
by the other group or not.

436
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,500
They aren’t exactly friends.

437
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,590
But their focus is different.

438
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,090
What do you mean?

439
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,900
Blessed Dog focuses more
on women and children,

440
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,740
especially boys, not girls.

441
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,020
That means they’re looking for

442
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,210
Miss Wu

443
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,430
or Mr. Wu.

444
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,170
What about Timber Wolf’s men?

445
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,100
They match people with sketches

446
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,800
and check the names on the registration.

447
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,950
They pay more attention to men.

448
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,050
I knew it.

449
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,160
What?

450
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,210
You know what I mean.

451
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,170
Shen Tianshu isn’t
looking for Wu Chuchu,

452
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,910
but you.

453
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,210
How long will they be here?

454
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,380
About ten minutes.

455
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,850
They’re only a block away.

456
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,300
Well,

457
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,960
we’ve settled down here for a while

458
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,740
and have registered our aliases.

459
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Don’t worry.

460
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,020
We’ll make sure of your safety.

461
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,150
Who should we play?

462
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,930
Father and two sons.

463
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,500
Zichen,

464
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,210
hide yourself. I’ll be here.

465
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
Xie Yun...

466
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,170
If your father finds out about this,

467
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,150
he’ll be furious.

468
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,420
It won’t be a problem for me.

469
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,690
But...

470
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,410
Your Highness, Mr. Xie is right.

471
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,320
You shouldn’t be here.

472
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,570
You’re well-prepared!

473
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,050
Xie Yun, I can explain.

474
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,290
Enough.

475
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,250
That can wait after the search.

476
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,320
Your Highness, please.

477
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,550
Have some food, girls.

478
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,580
I’ve reheated

479
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,170
the porridge on the stove.

480
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,170
It’s warm enough to eat.

481
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,350
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

482
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,210
Miss Li.

483
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,190
I’m not a Li.

484
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,930
I know. My bad.

485
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,360
You know,

486
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,840
Ms. Duan

487
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,780
has been muddleheaded for over a decade.

488
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,570
She doesn’t know

489
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,750
what she says or does.

490
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,020
Please

491
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,720
don’t mind her.

492
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,620
With all due respect,

493
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,570
she seems fine to me.

494
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,860
Well, she isn’t totally insane.

495
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,810
Some days are better than others.

496
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,750
Sometimes, she seems fine

497
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,620
but things she suddenly recalls

498
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,860
may set her off.

499
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,520
Has Jiuniang always been like this?

500
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,570
Jiuniang?

501
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,530
She said she’s Duan Jiuniang.

502
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,830
Duan Jiuniang?

503
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,690
Over the past two decades,

504
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,020
the top masters are

505
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,330
the South and North Blades,
the Swordsman,

506
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,410
Guanxi Yellow and Green Palm
and Penglai Immortal.

507
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,570
Speaking of which,

508
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,980
I’ve met with Yellow and Green Palm,
Duan Jiuniang

509
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,780
a few times.

510
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,840
Sadly,

511
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,020
she’s been missing for over a decade.

512
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,120
No way.

513
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,570
Would the legendary Duan Jiuniang

514
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,170
degrade herself

515
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,180
to a local official’s concubine,

516
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,860
not to mention
a crazy and unfavorable one?

517
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,620
Calling her

518
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,570
Empress Dowager
would be more convincing.

519
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,380
How do you know

520
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,970
I’m not?

521
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,800
Nice blade.

522
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,040
Too bad, it’s broken.

523
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,740
Is she really the one?

524
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,550
Finish your meal before going out.

525
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,800
It’s dangerous outside.

526
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,650
Watch out for the big bad wolf!

527
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,690
Let’s go.

528
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,570
Sorry for the trouble.

529
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,330
I apologize.

530
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,490
Good day. Take care.

531
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,290
Search it.

532
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,360
-Officer.
-Come here.

533
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,090
Who are you?

534
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,210
Officer,

535
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,170
I’m Liu San, 50 years old,

536
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,780
a widower.

537
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,450
I have two sons.

538
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,140
We’re all farmers.

539
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,860
The eldest one is Liu Shi,

540
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,380
and the younger one is Liu Shan.

541
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,620
Would you like some water?

542
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,660
Let me get you some.

543
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,740
Go away.

544
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,210
Save it.

545
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,560
Or I’ll get suspicious.

546
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,720
Those three are clean.

547
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,420
Let’s go to the next one.

548
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,160
Take care, Officer. Have a nice day.

549
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,570
Who is it?

550
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,330
Shi, Shi!

551
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,550
I’m so sorry. I...

552
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,430
I’m fine, Father.

553
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,810
Why do farmers like you

554
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,420
need a desk?

555
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,860
Who

556
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,250
is it for?

557
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,770
Officer,

558
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,770
I used to be a teacher

559
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,290
and moved here to make a living.

560
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:14,264

Shi!

562
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,530
-Shi! Shi!
-Shi!

563
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,730
-Are you alright?
-Shi!

564
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,460
How do you feel, Shi?

565
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,290
Officer, my son has the white plague.

566
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,660
It’s almost incurable.

567
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,770
The white plague?

568
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,770
How did he get it?

569
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,620
Refugees flooded into Huarong

570
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,970
a while ago and broke the peace here.

571
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,730
Many of them suffered from that disease

572
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,850
and they must’ve infected my son.

573
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,010
I... I...

574
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,490
Please let him get treated first.

575
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,100
Gross!

576
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,620
Officer.

577
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,460
Let’s go!

578
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,900
Officer.

579
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,860
We’re losing him!

580
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,220
Shan,

581
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,380
go get the physician!

582
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,530
I’m on it!

583
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,490
Mr. Xie.

584
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,530
-Water.
-Yes.

585
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,130
Water.

586
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,280
Your Highness, sorry about it.

587
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,810
Mr. Xie, I’m sorry for what happened.

588
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,860
No need.

589
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,900
Water.

590
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,180
Yes.

591
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,120
I’m sorry, Xie Yun.

592
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,100
Don’t be.

593
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,070
It’s over.

594
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,200
Your Highness.

595
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,770
I didn’t expect things would
turn out like this.

596
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,460
Zichen,

597
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,380
Shen Tianshu raided the dungeon

598
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,700
to break the Huos’ wing

599
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
and capture Huo Liantao

600
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,700
but got stopped by Mu Xiaoqiao

601
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,360
who refused to surrender.

602
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,530
It’s not a secret

603
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,220
that someone is behind Huo Liantao.

604
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,330
Timber Wolf

605
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,250
is looking for a man

606
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,970
while Blessed Dog

607
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,140
is after Miss and Mr. Wu

608
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,260
who escaped from the Inn.

609
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,530
Obviously, Shen Tianshu is here

610
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,010
for you.

611
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,840
Zichen,

612
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,730
didn’t you see

613
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,900
refugees in Huarong

614
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,180
outnumbered those elsewhere?

615
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,400
They know this place is safe.

616
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,120
Why?

617
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,730
Xie Yun, I...

618
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,050
Because you’re here.

619
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,490
Huo Liantao must’ve ordered his men

620
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,800
to not cause trouble in town.

621
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,810
Yet here you are

622
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,620
making yourself a target

623
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
and thinking no one would find you.

624
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,420
Xie Yun,

625
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,520
I understand what you said.

626
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,380
I came to Huarong

627
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,140
simply to

628
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,970
contact Huo Liantao in the first place.

629
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,570
I didn’t know

630
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,140
refugees would follow me here.

631
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,220
Seeing them homeless

632
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,810
and starving,

633
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,440
I couldn’t sit and do nothing.

634
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,160
So it was also you

635
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,750
who gave them

636
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,210
free food.

637
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,100
I knew that’d

638
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,480
get me into trouble,

639
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,700
but I couldn’t turn a blind eye

640
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,940
to those innocent people.

641
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,670
I’m sorry that I dragged you into this.

642
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,940
Zichen,

643
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,330
I’m proud

644
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,640
that you’d risk your life for others.

645
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,180
But the problem is,

646
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,220
although Shen Tianshu hasn’t found you,

647
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,570
the fact is you’re caged.

648
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,940
His men are searching door to door.

649
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,500
Two checkpoints are set up at the gate.

650
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,280
Even if there were ways to get out,

651
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,470
Mr. Bai wouldn’t allow you
to take such a risk.

652
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,010
What’s the use

653
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,850
of caging me?

654
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,730
What can he do about me?

655
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,050
If he’s trying to use me

656
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,490
to get Huo Liantao,

657
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,540
that’s not going to happen.

658
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,220
We aren’t

659
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,530
that close.

660
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,810
Right now, your troops

661
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,570
are stationed at the border.

662
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,460
They can get here

663
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,250
in seven or eight days.

664
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,800
Hearing that you’re in trouble,

665
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,800
even if your father knows
it could be a trap,

666
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,040
he’ll definitely take action.

667
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,900
But Shen Tianshu has no reason to do so.

668
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,660
Demons Manor aside,

669
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,530
what about Yu Wenzhi?

670
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,330
If something happens to a prince

671
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,850
in the enemy’s jurisdiction,

672
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,540
won’t Yu Wenzhi make a fuss?

673
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,030
Zichen,

674
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,500
you’re too naive.

675
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,820
Your Highness,

676
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,250
I’ve told you to leave

677
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,010
as soon as possible.

678
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,300
Mr. Xie also thinks the same.

679
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,020
Now it isn’t a good time.

680
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,700
Zichen, write a letter

681
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,220
to Huo Liantao.

682
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,600
Make sure Demons see it
delivered to Huo’s Manor.

683
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,990
If my guess is right,

684
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,530
our chance will soon come.

685
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,630
I’ve told you

686
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,600
the big black wolf outside

687
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,670
will eat you alive.

688
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,140
Ms. Duan,

689
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,940
are there ways

690
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,030
to take care of that wolf?

691
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,450
Simple.

692
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,700
Take ten moves from me first.

693
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,950
But you can’t.

694
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,680
My skills

695
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,460
are to

696
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,580
break the Snow-breaking Blade.

697
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,180
Li Zheng,

698
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,140
one more round?

699
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,660
Don’t be scared.

700
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,570
She won’t harm you.

701
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,280
What’s her relationship
with my grandfather?

702
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,100
I’ve never heard of her.

703
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,410
Can you fill me in?

704
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,370
That’s

705
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,310
a long story.

706
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,620
This way, please.

707
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,260
Back then, it was chaotic.

708
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,160
Turmoil ran amok everywhere.

709
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,420
I was serving a prestigious family.

710
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,180
Their eldest son

711
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,220
offended someone

712
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,810
who hired Demons
to slaughter his family.

713
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,530
I managed to get out

714
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:06,810
with a baby.

715
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,860
When we were attacked again on the way,

716
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,250
Ms. Duan saw it and helped us.

717

But she was outnumbered.

719
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,010
Then a man showed up out of nowhere.

720
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,780
Miss, leave with the baby.

721
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,370
How dare you

722
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,400
harm women and kids!

723
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,180
Are you still men?

724
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,140
So that’s how they met.

725
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,290
Who are you?

726
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,120
Tell us your name

727
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,450
so that we know who we killed.
