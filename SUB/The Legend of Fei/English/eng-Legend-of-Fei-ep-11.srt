I can’t move.

The Spirit is running wild.

21
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,870
What happened?

22
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,750
Her hands are cold as ice!

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,880
She ended up like this

24
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
because she was irritated

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,550
after being injured

26
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,880

We must leave now.

come to the West Gate.

be extra careful.

without Fei.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Miss Wu, the fewer the people,

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
the lighter the burden.

86
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,550
I promise that I’ll protect her

87
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,160

90
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,830
Take off your longevity lock.

91
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,390
It’ll expose you.

92
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,760
Are you that crazy old woman
at the county government?

93
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,070
Who are you calling crazy?

94

You know what?

95
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,230
You do look familiar.

96
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,070
Who are you?

97
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,070
Yellow and Green Palm.

98
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,230
The one who broke into

99
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,200
the Demons Manor with Li Jinrong,

100
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,550
Yellow and Green Palm, Duan Jiuniang?

101
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,200
Demons Manor?

102
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,110
No wonder I find you familiar.

103
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,070
Back in that manor,

104
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,200
you fell

105
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,480
under my feet
and begged me to spare you,

106
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,880
right?

107
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,320
All these years,

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,230
I thought the Blades, Sword and Palm

109
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,390
had disappeared.

110
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,350
Yet here you are.

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,880
I can finally take my revenge.

112
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,230
Great!

113
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,440
Let’s see what you got.

114
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,230
Bring it on, loser!

115
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,350
I’m freezing!

116
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,880
Fei, are you alright?

117
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,910
So cold!

118
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,110
Fei, how do you feel?

119
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,710
So hot!

120
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,590
Cold and hot!

121
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,230
What’s happening?

122
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,960
Your body is cold

123
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,710
while your veins are burning.

124
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,590
Cold and hot energy is integrating.

125
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,000
You can’t use the blade.

126
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,520
What do you need it for?

127
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,640
To scare others away?

128
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,710
I said I’d give you a new one.

129
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,230
How do you feel?

130
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,350
I’m fine now.

131
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,670
The two streams of energy

132
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,400
haven’t merged,

133
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,280
but the practice of Tao Teh King

134
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,550
managed to

135
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,520
pacify the Yellow and Green Spirit.

136
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,640
Tao Teh King?

137
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,440
The one from Sir Chongxiaozi.

138
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,110
Fei!

139
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,590
Fei, didn’t the Tao Teh King work?

140
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,880
Why did you spit blood again?

141
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,280
After letting it out,

142
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,150
I feel I’ve never been

143
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,710
so full of energy before.

Giving free food at the East Gate

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,400
is to help you escape from the west.

183
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,880
Creating a distraction

184
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
is a clever move.

185
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,680

to die in my hands.

197

Excuse me?

199
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,880
I shouldn’t target a crazy woman.

Why are you all calling me crazy?

Am I?

203
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,350
Answer me. Am I crazy?

You’re the crazy ones!

Leave with Mr. Xie now.

Don’t fool me.

You... you’re in your senses again!

Are you out of your mind?

253
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,230
Why did you freeze me?

254
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,920
I need to tie up a few loose ends.

255
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,350
Take her away!

256
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,280
Ms. Duan.

Duan Jiuniang, you have three days!

my family will never take you in!

262
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,190
You shouldn’t
sacrifice your marriage

263
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,560
for your sister’s child

264
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,040
and suffer all this.

265
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,310
Once I marry him,

266
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,040
that kid

267
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,230
will become part of his family

268
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,470
and have a decent background.

269
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,070
My father said

270
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
you had finally found your love

271
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,760
and you deserve a grand ceremony.

272
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,310
He asked me to give you this

273
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,880
before he passed away.

274
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,000
Poison went deep into his veins

275
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,560
and killed him eventually.

276
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,230
He died in order to save me.

277
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,160
I killed him!

278
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,280
It was my fault!

Trust me.

309
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,040
General Wen Yu’s encampment is nearby.

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,710
We’ll get there.

Why?

313

My parents are dead

314
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,680
and my brother is missing
because of the Demons.

315
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,290
I must take revenge.

316
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,490
Fei and the others
are risking their lives for me.

317
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,190
I can’t abandon them.

318
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,710
I heard

319
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,710
they had rescued a boy from the Inn

320
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,830
who is safe now.

321
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,160
That must be your brother.

322
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,540
If so,

323
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,340

Hyah!

326

Hyah!

327
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
My horse has driven them away.

328
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,110
But I guess

329
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,450
they’ll soon realize they’re tricked.

330
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,110
I’ll carry you.

331
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,870
You’re heavier

332
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,360
than you look.

333
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,520
Shut up or I’ll kill you!

334
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,800
Go ahead.

335
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
Wait until I can move again.

336
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,950
Just stop.

337
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,870
Put me down.

338
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,560
You can’t go too far carrying me.

339
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,150
They’ll soon catch up with us.

340
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,560
Whatever.

341
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,000
We can only try our luck.

342
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,360
Xie Meimei,

343
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
give me ten minutes

344
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,000
to unfreeze myself.

345
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,520
Then they won’t be a problem.

346
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,710
Are you sure?

347
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,710
Positive.

00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,360
make it quick.

350
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Damn! We got tricked!

351
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,150
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

352
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,920
I’m sorry, Miss Wu.

353
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,800
Have some water.

354
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,190
Mr. Bai, how are Fei and Mr. Xie?

355
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,760
Duan Jiuniang fought hard
and bought them time.

356
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,910
They’ve got

357
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,470
out of the city, too.

358
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,670
But...

359
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,250
But I don’t know how they are now.

360
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,670
Duan Jiuniang...

361
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,150
When are we going to

362
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,670
join them?

363
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,870
Don’t worry about that.

364
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,390
Get some rest for now.

365
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,280
Once my men reach General Wen,

366
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,550
his troops will escort you.

367
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,570
I’m leaving.

368
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,760
Weed Spirit, are you good as new?

369
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,070
I’m not as weak as you.

370
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,000
Fine, fine, fine. You’re so much better.

371
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,430
Is that a wound?

372
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,150
Nothing but a scratch.

373
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,600
Hey,

374
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,350
do me a favor and bind it up.

375
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,910
Will Duan Jiuniang

376
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,470
come to us?

377
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,120
Of course she will.

378
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,430
Fei, are you alright?

379
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,550
I might’ve used up my energy

380
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,430
when unfreezing myself.

381
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,810
I’m fine.

382
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,490
Fei! Fei!

383
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,870
Sir,

384
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,190
are you feeling better?

385
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,000
Have you found anything to eat?

386
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,440
Only a few hard fruits.

387
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,370
I should go back to report to my aunt.

388
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Are you abandoning me again?

389
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,360
You...

390
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,360
I thought you were too weak to walk,

391
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,150
but you’re strong.

392
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,360
Too weak to walk?

393
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,430
Even if I can’t walk,

394
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,150
I can still fly.

395
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,360
You should know

396
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,700
there are such skills.

397
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,630
Please, sir,

398
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,800
I really need to go back.

399
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,280
Mr. Li,

400
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,910
you...

401
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,520
I need you.

402
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,910
What if

403
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,150
I run into an enemy

404
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,560
who can fly

405
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,910
but I... I can’t?

406
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,760
I’ll sure get injured.

407
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,520
If that happens,

408
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,100
won’t you feel guilty?

409
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,520
Jiuniang,

410
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,670
why are you still here?

411
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,470
The Demons are right behind.

412
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,360
I’ve practiced the Palm my whole life

413
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,920
but in the end,

414
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,670
I’ve only mastered

415
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,810
half of it.

416
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,630
Let’s go.

417
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,540
The other half can wait.

418
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,470
I didn’t realize

419
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,500
until we met

420
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,040
that so many years had passed.

421
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,710
While I’ve been holding on to the past,

422
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,440
the new generation has grown up.

423
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,260
Just like this flower,

424
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,680
it’ll bloom

425
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,710
and wither.

436
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,430
we just got the news.

437
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:32,000
There’s still nothing about Ms. Wang.

438
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,430
Said by those in Huarong?

439
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:34,980
Yes.

440
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,280
Have Ms. Wang and the others

441
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,040
never contacted our people there?

442
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,600
The letter

443
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,490
says no.

444
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:44,960
I see.

445
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Send my letter out

446
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,040
with the pigeon immediately.

447
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,040
Ask our men there

448
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,120
to have more people search again.

449
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,080
Yes.

450
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,190
Are you sure

451
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,430
Mr. Xie is still in Huarong?

452
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,430
Yes.

453
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,560
We’ve lost contact

454
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,000
with spies in the city

455
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,080
since the lockdown.

456
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,120
Speed up tomorrow.

457
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,280
We must get him out

458
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,800
no matter what.

459
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,080
Yes.

460
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,120
Report!

461
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,600
General,

462
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,390
a Mr. Bai

463
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,150
and a girl

464
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,360
asked to see you.

465
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,600
That Mr. Bai

466
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,320
who serves The Third Prince?

467
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,800
Yes.

468
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,080
General Wen.

469
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,630
Mr. Bai.

470
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,000
How have you been?

471
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,150
Long story.

472
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,710
Let me introduce her to you.

473
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,430
This is

474
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,870
General Wu Fei’s daughter,

475
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,950
Wu Chuchu.

476
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,120
Greetings, General Wen.

477
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,080
Your father was a pillar of the state.

478
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,630
Lord Gantang has asked us

479
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,430
to find General Wu’s family.

480
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,710
Seeing you here,

481
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,600
I can

482
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,890
finally be relieved.

483
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,320
If so,

484
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,630
that’s wonderful.

485
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,840
Mr. Xie entrusted Miss Wu to me

486
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,280
to escort her to leave the city.

487
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,630
And here she is, safe and sound.

488
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,560
Mr. Bai,

489
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,670
I’m going to Huarong

490
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,600
to look for Mr. Xie.

491
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,520
It’ll be too tough a journey

492
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,520
for Miss Wu.

493
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,000
I’m sorry about the trouble.

494
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,530
I can take care of myself.

495
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,470
I think

496
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,670
he’s no longer

497
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,550
in the city.

498
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,630
Mr. Bai,

499
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,780
do you know where he is?

500
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,910
He was seen

501
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,070
heading north.

502
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,870
Mount Heng is in that direction.

503
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,150
The only inn in that area

504
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,920
is called Sanchun.

505
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,560
You can have a look there.

506
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,630
His Highness and Mr. Xie

507
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,020
have been best friends since little.

508
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
General Wen,

509
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,760
don’t worry too much.

510
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,430
Your trip won’t be in vain.

511
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,320
Thank you for your information.

512
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,680
See you.

513
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:38,450
See you.

514
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,040
Miss Wu,

515
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,440
take care.

516
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,780
<i>Sanchun Inn</i>

517
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,230

Have a look!

518
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,910

519

521
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,950
Sir.

522
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,760
Let me see what you got.

523
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,600
Do you like it?

524
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,560
I’d like some.

525
