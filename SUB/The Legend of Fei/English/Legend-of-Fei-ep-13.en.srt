17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,500
Yeah.

18
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,730
Just now,

19
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,260
I blew off the Dragon Incense,

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,100
and broke the Dragon Flag.

21
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,860
It may not end well.

22
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,970
General Wen comes just in time.

23
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,310
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,260
Give my order,

25
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,540
to evacuate people!

28
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,190
Sir, what happened to you?

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,150
My old wounds haven’t recovered.

30
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,100
Just now, I was punched by Feng Wuyan.

31
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,820
But I’m fine.

32
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,910
Before getting what he wants,

33
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,460
Feng Wuyan will not

34
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,010
let it go.

35
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,340
If he follows us in,

36
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,320
you must fight with him.

37
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,290
Me?

38
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,650
I’m going to teach you

39
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,060
some little Eight-trigram Formation.

40
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,700
Before he realizes,

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,260
we’ll break into
the Eight-trigram Formation

42
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,140
and run out.

43
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,130
This?

44
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,140
I... I saw this before.

45
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,060
Is this

46
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,980
the Eight-trigram Formation
of Daoist magic?

47
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,870
You know it?

48
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,820
I did some light readings at home.

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,930
I had a memory of it.

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,930
Great!

51
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,030
Senior brother.

52
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,610
You rushed in so hurriedly.

53
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,720
Are you hurt?

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,290
Let’s go.

55
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,920
Go!

56
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,040
Where... Where are we going?

57
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,550
Qian, three Yang.

58
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,340
Kun, six Yin.

59
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,560
-Answer me, or I’ll break in.
-Go.

60
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,460
Sir, sir, are you alright?

61
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,730
Zhen, six Yin on the top.

62
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,410
Senior brother.

63
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,470
Gen, six Yin on the bottom.

64
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,020
Come out and let’s talk.

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,060
Li, Yin in the middle.

66
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,320
Senior brother.

67
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,530
Kan, Yang in the middle.

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,420
Senior brother.

69
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,470
Dui, three Yin on the top.

70
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,170
Xun, three Yin on the bottom.

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,980
-Wrong.
-We can’t go this way.

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,700
Take three steps right forwards.

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,020
How stupid you are!

74
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,210
Go.

75
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,260
I haven’t heard of this before.

76
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,380
Give me some time to digest it.

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,260
In this Eight-trigram Formation,

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,540
even switchable screens
represent divinations.

79
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Qian, three Yang. Kun, six Yin.

80
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,840
Didn’t you read books
about Daoist magic?

81
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,450
According to it,

82
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,420
Only Kai, Xiu and Sheng Doors

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,540
are available doors.

84
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,490
Unavailable doors are full of traps

85
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,750
which are not passable.

86
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,930
I think I understand.

87
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,620
According to books about Daoist magic,

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,450
there are eight doors.

89
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,610
When we find Sheng Door
in the northeast,

90
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,890
we can go out, huh?

91
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,330
Senior brother.

92
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,050
If you hear me, say something.

93
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,590
I didn’t expect you to be so clever.

94
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,100
Let’s go west

95
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,050
for Jing Door.

96
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,580
Weird. Isn’t it an unavailable door,

97
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,930
with traps?

98
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,260
You can’t give the chief’s whisk
to an outsider,

99
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,030
right?

100
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,020
How about this?

101
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,050
Give it to me.

102
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,100
And I’ll let you go, all right?

103
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,170
Feng Wuyan.

104
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,300
Because you wanted it,

105
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
you brought disaster to us.

106
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,890
Now, our sect is in such trouble!

107
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,120
Do you still not regret?

108
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,020
Regret?

109
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,650
My father was partial to you.

110
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,710
You’re now partial to a young man.

111
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,120
You’re going too far!

112
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,420
I’m taking back what belongs to me!

113
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,300
Don’t walk to Jing Door.

114
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,710
Get away in time. Hurry.

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,450

Feng Wuyan!

118
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,100
Former Chief gave the whisk to me.

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,650
I can’t let him down!

120
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,490
Don’t use my dead father as the excuse!

121
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,210
I didn’t mean to kill you.

122
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,820
Don’t force me!

123

I just taught you?

132
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,300
Almost.

133
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,580
I almost remember it.

in the Big Dipper Array,

139
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,210
among eight famous arrays
of Mystery Forest.

140
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,140
Think about how to get out of it.

141
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,200
Big Dipper Array?

He’s too honest.

145
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,890
He thinks

146
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,100
he owed you!

147
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,210
But I don’t owe you!

148
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,420
Honest?

149
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,640
How dare he say that!

150
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,330
He said

151
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,370
he gave his life to me,

152
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,800
so that I could kill him as I wished.

153
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,530
But in fact,

154
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,540
you’ve been hiding
and I couldn’t even find you!

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,300
In my opinion,

156
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,980
you’re as hypocritical

157
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,710
as before!

158
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,900
Pei.

159
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,360
Don’t worry.

160
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,940
I don’t have martial arts now.

161
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,840
You can kill me,

162
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,790
sooner or later.

163
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,320
But if the North Blade vanishes

164
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,550
in my hand,

165
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,520
I’ll feel bad.

166
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,490
The North Blade?

167
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,350
What about the Mountain Sword
of my family?

168
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,260
You’ll feel bad?

169
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,130
My father didn’t even have a chance
to feel bad!

170
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,260
But don’t worry.

171
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,710
I will get back

172
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,970
what you owe me.

173
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,360
You can’t get away today.

174
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,540
So,

175
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,050
you led Dragon Master to this place

176
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,020
so that he would kill me?

177
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,160
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

178
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,520
Ms. Kou.

179
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,050
A message from the secret service.

180
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,890
Leave me.

181
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,300
Aye.

182
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,270
Madam.

183
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,450
A disciple sent a message,

184
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,360
saying there’s no news
about Ms. Wang and others.

185
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,770
I see.

186
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,980
Ms. Kou.

187
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,660
I feel something fishy.

188
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,330
Please send some capable disciples

189
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,570
to keep looking for them.

190
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,860
If there’s still no news,

191
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,980
I’ll go personally.

192
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,110
Aye.

193
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,370
Hua, I’m afraid we’d better leave.

194
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,980
<i>Oil</i>
You saved

195
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,690
my life.

196
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,430
I’ve already enjoyed it.

197
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,250
I’m not afraid of death.

198
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,250
But I don’t want to leave the inn.

199
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,940
Your Majesty.

200
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,380
Guests have been evacuated.

201
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,690
Please go back with me.

202
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,610
I’m afraid
Dragon Master is arriving soon.

203
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,700
I messed up with Dragon Master.

204
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,650
As long as there’s one last guest,

205
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,450
I can’t leave.

206
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,180
But...

207
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,660
Oh,

208
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,610
where is Zichen?

209
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,250
He’s on his way back to Jiankang.

210
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,450
Luckily,

211
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,500
you used a wise strategy

212
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,570
in Huarong.

213
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,390
Or his problem wouldn’t
have been solved.

214
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,920
I just met him

215
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,160
and helped him out.

216
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,300
Your Majesty, you must go back with me.

217
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,260
General Wen.

218
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,310
Pretend you didn’t see me, will you?

219
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,030
I can’t.

220
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:01,960
Your Majesty.

221
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,580
So many people saw you.

222
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,060
Please don’t embarrass me.

223
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,380
You’re having me surrounded

224
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,810
with so many men.

225
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,950
Even if I want to embarrass you,

226
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,150
can I?

227
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,140
When General Wang Lin

228
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,180
commanded the armies,

229
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,720
we were so proud.

230
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,980
Now, he has gone.

231
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,940
Our soldiers

232
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,380
have been expecting you

233
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,670
to come back and take charge.

234
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,450
Why don’t I remember anything

235
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,200
about this?

236
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,390
I’m sorry.

237
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,450
It’s okay.

238
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,660
Oh,

239
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,570
ask the cook downstairs

240
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,650
for two jars of beef paste.

241
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,500
If I don’t have any now,

242
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,970
I’m afraid I can’t have it anymore.

243
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,230
I can finally give this back to you.

244
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,340
Fei.

245
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,830
You’re still angry with Xie?

246
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,780
Him?

247
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,120
Besides legs,

248
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,610
he has only a rich stock of lies.

249
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,060
If he wants to talk,

250
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,480
he can keep talking for the whole day,

251
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,180
even when the pigs fly.

252
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,200
But...

253
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,970
He’s an emperor.

254
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,370
Why is he wandering about?

255
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,430
Well,

256
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,130
he’s a poor man, too.

257
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,300
His name was Xiao Chuan,

258
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,800
a prince of the former dynasty.

259
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,570
When he was little,
he suffered a rebellion.

260
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,300
-The palace was besieged.
-This way.

261
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,690
Later, there was a fire.

262
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
No one was expected to run out.

263
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,210
Unexpectedly, an old eunuch
risked his own life

264
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,240
to send him out of the palace.

265
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,980
General Wang Lin of the former dynasty

266
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,100
got Mr. Xie back to the palace.

267
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,810
Good days didn’t last long, though.

268
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,900
He was sent to the neighboring country
as a hostage.

269
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,890
During this period,

270
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,640
another general rebelled
and built a new dynasty.

271
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,520
The former one was then overthrown.

272
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,690
General Wang Lin supported Mr. Xie
as the Emperor,

273
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,360
trying to recover the former dynasty.

274
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,210
Is this why

275
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,250
he concealed his identity

276
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,870
and became Xie Meimei?

277
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,100
But why didn’t he tell me?

278
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,940
His kingdom was gone.

279
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,890
Here is the new dynasty.

280
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,140
Instead of living a rich life,

281
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Mr. Xie wanders around alone.

282
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,010
There must be some reason.

283
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,940
It’s understandable

284
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,840
when he didn’t tell you who he was.

285
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,690
I nearly stabbed the Emperor
of the former dynasty.

286
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,210
Whatever!

287
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,590
I don’t care if he’s an emperor.

288
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,400
In my eyes,

289
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,810
he’s just the unlucky Xie Meimei

290
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,630
who always lies.

291
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,620
Oh,

292
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,180
you told me

293
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,250
when you came,

294
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,060
you received a letter of my mother’s

295
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,130
from our secret service.

296
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,530
Yes. I have it.

297
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,160
<i>To General Feiqing</i>

298
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,280
<i>To General Feiqing</i>

299
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,240
<i>From Li Jinrong</i>

300
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,540
My mother asked the secret service

301
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,510
to send you back to the Fortress.

302
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,750
She has a point.

303
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,810
A rich girl like you

304
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,230
should live in big house

305
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,380
and a lot of people should serve you

306
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,940
when you leave home.

307
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,940
You shouldn’t have been wandering around

308
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,210
with us.

309
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,540
Life in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

310
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,060
can’t be as good as before.

311
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,210
But at least,

312
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,130
you’ll be taken care of

313
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,990
and well provided for.

314
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,380
Fei.

315
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,110
I’m no longer a rich girl.

316
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,040
<i>Letter</i>

317
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,620
Weird.

318
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,740
Why did my mother only mention you,

319
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,950
but not your younger brother?

320
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,010
Theoretically,

321
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,830
she shouldn’t have been so calm

322
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,600
after she knew
what had happened in Huarong.

323
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,980
Unless...

324
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,390
This letter is fake?

325
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,330
There’s something wrong

326
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,270
with the secret service?

327
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,820
I must go home and check.

328
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,540
No way.

329
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,440
About the problem of Dragon Master,

330
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420
Xie Yun and I are also involved.

331
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,450
If we leave like this,

332
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,460
I’m afraid

333
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,460
everyone in the inn will be doomed.

334
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,130
Chuchu.

335
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,500
I’ll have General Wen

336
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,130
send you to my father’s place.

337
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,660
He’ll take good care of you.

338
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,460
I’m not going anywhere.

339
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,090
I just want to follow you.

340
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,280
No way.

341
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,860
If General Wen fights

342
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,180
with Dragon Master,

343
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,260
I don’t think I can take care of you.

344
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,360
It’s because I’m not strong enough.

345
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,510
If only I could be as powerful
as my grandpa!

346
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Fei. Fei.

347
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,140
I believe no one,

348
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,080
but you.

349
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,050
Besides,

350
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,740
I’m not a thing.

351
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,400
Don’t always deliver me.

352
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,050
Fine.

353
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,170
Stay in the room, then.

354
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,020
Don’t go downstairs

355
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,830
before I tell you to.

356
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>Help</i>

357
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,520
<i>Help</i>

358
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,380
Sorry, but I can’t help.

359
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,170
Your Majesty,
what the hell are you doing?

360
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,050
Heroine.

361
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,740
Take me with you, too.

362
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,170
You’ll take her, anyway.

363
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,410
Take me as well.

364
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,780
Besides, if there’s danger,

365
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,100
I can run away.

366
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,530
I won’t get you in trouble.

367
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,260
You heard it?

368
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,030
I did hear it.

369
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,690
You’re not angry with me anymore, huh?

370
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,780
From now on,

371
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,020
we’ll go our own ways.

372
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,290
Why should I be angry with you?

373
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,210
Heroine. Heroine.

374
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,170
I beg you.

375
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,980
Get me out of the inn!

376
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,620
I beg you.

377
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,410
I’ll do anything I can in my next life

378
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,620
to repay you.

379
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,780
Fei. Fei.

380
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,170
I wondered

381
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,140
if you really wandered about

382
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,960
to help the weak!

383
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,860
Turns out

384
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,290
you’re just the same as Li Sheng.

385
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,620
You both fool around

386
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,730
and even run away from home.

387
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,980
After handling the problem here,

388
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,410
I’m going home.

389
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,260
Listen.

390
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,640
You’d better go home early, too.

391
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,840
You have poor martial arts.

392
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,030
Don’t get your families
to worry about you.

393
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,400
I also want to go home.

394
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,350
I wish to have a family

395
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,420
to expect me back.

396
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,220
You... You don’t have a family?

397
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,770
Family?

398
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,490
Speaking of relatives,

399
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,290
I think there are many.

400
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,760
But...

401
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
They’re not a family at all.

402
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,350
You...

403
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
You have a younger sworn brother,

404
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,290
don’t you?

405
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,820
Zichen?

406
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,340
Yeah.

407
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,870
I watched him grow up.

408
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,210
He’s also close to me.

409
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,340
He’s the Third Prince of this dynasty.

410
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,860
We’re of different status.

411
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:30,920
But...

412
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,540
Luckily, I have him.

413
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,980
-Run!
-Go!

414
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,410
Get in.

415
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Why are they beating the gong
in the day?

416
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,240
You don’t know, huh?

417
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,000
I won’t tell you.

418
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,050
<i>Oil</i>
Ji.

419
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,020
<i>Oil</i>
There’s sound of gong out there.

420
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,920
Seems like Dragon Master has arrived.

421
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,120
<i>Zheng Luosheng, Dragon Master
of Four-guardian Mountain</i>

422
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,100
<i>Wen</i>

423
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,980
<i>Wen</i>
Our general asked me

424
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,690
to take his regards to you.

425
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,660
I wonder

426
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,480
what you come for.

427
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,680
I see.

428
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,570
General Wen asked his man

429
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,740
to send a message.

430
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,530
So, Dragon Master is using

431
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,380
his way.

432
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,860
He also sent a subordinate.

433
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,310
He is putting on airs!

434
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,860
Good.

435
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,210
You guessed it right.

436
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,410
You’re getting smart.

437
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,900
My master said

438
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,330
this place didn’t belong
to north or south.

439
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,260
But when he knew you were here,

440
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,850
he wouldn’t make trouble.

441
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
But,

442
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,810
he has lost a dog.

443
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,500
He heard

444
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,260
his dog was locked up in this inn

445
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,020
and someone burned the Dragon Flag

446
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,330
and put out the Dragon Incense.

447
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,380
We come for an explanation.

448
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,810
General Wen is reasonable.

449
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,790
I don’t think

450
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,450
he’ll blame us.

451
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,990
Who do you think

452
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,900
is more powerful,

453
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,610
Dragon Master, Shen Tianshu

454
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,040
or Duan Jiuniang?

455
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,940
As famous as Mu Xiaoqiao,

456
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,740
he must have something great.

457
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,050
In such a big world,

458
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,890
there are many powerful men.

459
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,330
It can be a difficult job

460
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,600
to compare them.

461
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,100
But I believe

462
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,220
you’ll be as powerful as them.

463
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,290
Under the premise

464
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,850
that we can get out of the inn.

465
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,620
I don’t mean to be unreasonable.

466
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,780
But an important man is living here.

467
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,400
I think you’d better leave.

468
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,330
We’re leaving early tomorrow morning.

469
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,640
Why don’t you wait for one more night?

470
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,810
Tomorrow,

471
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,140
you can fight

472
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,370
whomever you hate.

473
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,120
I won’t interfere.

474
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,450
People like us don’t want

475
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,690
to be your enemies.

476
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:26,970
Fine.

477
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,220
General Wen, take it easy, too.

478
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,580
We’ll wait outside the inn.

479
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,690
After you leave tomorrow,

480
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,860
we’ll come again.

481
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,640
Leave.

482
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,000
Dragon Master.

483
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,380
I destroyed your flag

484
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,880
and your incense.

485
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,630
I’m your enemy.

486
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,260
Let go of guests in the inn

487
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,840
and fight me!

488
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,630
You’re doing this on purpose?

489
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,100
I don’t have a choice
under this circumstance.

490
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,540
General Wen!

491
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,160
What is your mission of your trip?

492
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,460
To protect you.

493
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:20,850
Yeah.

494
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,210
You’re right.

495
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,950
We’ll have chances
to see such occasions.

496
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,430
Now, we should run away.

497
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,420
But the whole inn is besieged.

498
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:32,930
Do you remember

499
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,620
when the young man came this morning,

500
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,530
Mr. Hua asked him to search,

501
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,660
but he found nothing?

502
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,100
So,

503
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,540
you mean

504
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,510
there’s a secret tunnel in the inn?

505
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,830
What, General Wen?

506
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,980
Could this arrogant young man

507
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,370
be your master?

508
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,540
I came for several times,

509
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,160
but you avoided me.

510
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,540
When I tried to fight that girl,

511
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,400
you showed up in time!

512
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,450
I’m sure

513
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,530
you’ve got a hiding place here.

514
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,570
Run away from your doghole, then!

515
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,780
Since you’re awesome,

516
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,170
you’ll make great achievements!

517
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,380
Why are you staying here?

518
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,140
Just leave!

519
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,020
Don’t, Miss Zhou.

520
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,860
If you push him out,

521
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,130
you’ll get him killed.

522
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,140
He nearly got you killed!

523
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,450
He made so much trouble!

524
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,490
Why are you still defending him?

525
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,450
I’m sorry.

526
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,230
I don’t want to get involved.

527
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,860
Mr. Ji,

528
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,800
where is the doghole

529
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,060
you just

530
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,500
mentioned?

531
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,520
What?

532
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,090
You want to get in?

533
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,140
Not before you kill me.

534
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,500
If you promise not to hurt him,

535
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,530
I’ll take you there.

536
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,960
Chuchu is still upstairs.

537
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,500
I’ll go get prepared.

538
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
I’ll see you in the granary

539
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,380
in fifteen minutes.

540
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,300
-Okay.
-Okay.

541
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,980
If we really fight,

542
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,840
General Wen,

543
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,110
it’s hard to see who will win.

544
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,320
You’re right, Dragon Master.

545
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,500
If you can

546
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,190
let go of local people

547
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,980
for the sake of my young master,

548
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,220
I will visit you

549
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,690
and thank you

550
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,570
with generous gifts.

551
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,880
Fine.

552
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,150
I’ll let them go, for your sake.

553
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,690
I’ll forget about
the incense and flag thing.

554
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,690
And I won’t kill local people.

555
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,380
But...

556
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,950
My dog is clever.

557
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,040
If I can’t get it back,

558
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
I’m afraid...

559
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,900
I don’t want it to happen again.

560
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,240
So today,

561
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,190
I must get in and search.

562
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,670
This has nothing to do
with your young master.

563
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,520
General Wen,

564
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,520
you will help, won’t you?

565
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,440
Dragon Master.

566
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,450
Please.

567
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:17,900
Search it!

568
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,170
-Aye.
-Aye.

569
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,330
You...

570
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,350
You won’t fight?

571
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,500
Young Master, this is the end.

572
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,680
Don’t embarrass me anymore.

573
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,750
Wait!

574
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,860
These two girls are families

575
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,780
of our young master.

576
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,020
They two

577
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,540
look gorgeous.

578
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,960
You just promised to let people go
for my sake.

579
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,410
What?

580
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,150
You regret?

581
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,280
I thought about it again.

582
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,870
I think

583
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,290
we’d better fight.

584
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,360
<i>Cloud</i>

585
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
The secret tunnel is near the granary.

586
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,340
Go.

587
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,740
You’re brave.

588
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,500
When Mr. Zhou knows,

589
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,530
he’ll be relieved.

590
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,170
Fei.

591
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,930
Don’t show off your bravery.

592
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,860
Go find Mr. Ji.

593
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,620
I’ll go with my beautiful girl.

594
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,640
Is beating an emperor against the law?

595
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,010
You shouldn’t beat anyone.

596
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,840
Beating ordinary people is
also against the law.

597
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,880
Good, then.

598
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,170
Don’t go too far!

599
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,570
Are you really an emperor?

600
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,040
Do they get the wrong guy?

601
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:28,920
Wait.

602
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,900
General Wen looks reliable.

603
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,840
I don’t think he gets the wrong guy.

604
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,960
So,

605
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,320
you get the wrong identity, huh?

606
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:43,860
Exactly.

607
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,280
You know me best.

608
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,240
You’ve seen me through.

609
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,340
I get to like you more.

610
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,140
If today,

611
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,740
General Wen gets hurt for you,

612
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,050
you’ll lose a lot.

613
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,780
Don’t worry.

614
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,780
General Wen is the strongest subordinate
of your father.

615
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,410
Dragon Master can’t hurt him.

616
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,550
Go.

617
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,780
Let’s go to the granary for Mr. Ji.

618
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,750
Where’s Chuchu?

619
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,380
Stop looking. Here she is.

620
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,260
Fei.

621
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,980
I don’t have great martial arts,

622
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,380
compared to great people

623
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,810
like you.

624
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,900
But I think

625
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,930
it won’t be a problem

626
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,430
when I want to kill such a girl.

627
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,330
That’s all you can do?

628
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,880
Take your hands off her!

629
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,100
If she’s hurt even a little bit,

630
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,990
I won’t let you go!

631
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,530
Why does she look

632
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,050
much more beautiful than you?

633
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,660
Girls should be as gentle

634
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,710
as her.

635
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,460
But you keep fighting.

636
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,140
You’ll get wrinkles on your face.

637
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,250
Oh, I forgot.

638
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,770
When you keep fighting,

639
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,090
you won’t even be old enough
to have wrinkles.

640
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,930
Besides,

641
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,970
do I look like I’m afraid of death?

642
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,850
Pei!

643
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,420
I heard Mr. Ji called you like that.

644
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,320
I guess that’s your name, huh?

645
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,790
Are you Mr. Yin?

646
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,250
What do you know?

647
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,570
Miss Zhou.

648
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,560
Don’t kill him.

649
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,180
I didn’t expect him to learn

650
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,200
the acupoint-shifting way
from Dragon Master.

651
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,280
I’m sorry for my neglection.

652
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,900
Do you think

653
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,120
I only joined Four-guardian Mountain
for shelter?

654
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,060
No wonder you were so evasive.

655
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,540
Turns out you were just lying,

656
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,810
so that you could kill people
and run away!

657
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,330
Miss Zhou, let him go.

658
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:21,870
For the...

659
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,540
For the sake of Old Master Li.

660
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,350
Why do you mention my grandpa?

661
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,550
Fei.

662
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,600
If I guess correctly,

663
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,140
he’s the offspring of Yin Wenlan.

664
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,800
The Mountain Sword?

665
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,340
One of the most famous marital artists?

666
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,330
Sword stands for gentlemen.

667
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,700
The Mountain Sword Yin Wenlan

668
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,900
came from a decent sect.

669
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,400
He became a master after he grew up.

670
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,690
Sadly,
he and his family were all killed.

671
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,570
He? Offspring of the Mountain Sword?

672
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,530
What are you staring at?

673
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,570
If you were really proud,

674
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,760
why did you do dirty things before?

675
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,900
We’d better leave soon.

676
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,750
Let’s go.

677
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,240
<i>Wine</i>

678
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,330
<i>Welcome Guests</i>

679
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,330
Master.

680
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,250
We’ve searched two floors of the inn,

681
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,530
but didn’t find him.

682
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,250
Losers!

683
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,200
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>

684
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,880
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>
Go.

685
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,800
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>

686
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,860
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>
Go find him out.

687
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,680
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>

688
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,420
The North Blade stays

689
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,420
in such a small inn

690
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,290
as a cook.

691
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,810
He’s so scared

692
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,460
that he has even dug a secret tunnel.

693
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,220
I don’t understand.

694
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,940
Why are you a rat instead of human?

695
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,660
What about you?

696
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,420
You’d like to be a dog, too.

697
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,830
You know nothing!

698
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,810
I’m a human.

699
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,720
I don’t understand you, without doubt.

700
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,900
I’m kind enough to let you follow us.

701
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,250
What are you yelling for?

702
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,770
I’ll beat you!

703
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,970
Everybody, I dug

704
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,250
this secret tunnel

705
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,660
for my fiancée and me.

706
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,900
We wanted to live in seclusion

707
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,490
and hide here.

708
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,570
In case enemies come to fight us,

709
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,860
we dug this secret tunnel.

710
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,570
It has nothing to do with Ji.

711
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,050
Miss Zhou.

712
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,970
Mr. Xie.

713
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,530
Miss Wu.

714
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,770
Please go first. Hurry.

715
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,620
You go, first.

716
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,290
Okay.

717
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,010
Mr. Hua.

718
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,120
Is your hand okay?

719
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,510
Yes.

720
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,900
Thank you, then. We’ll go first.

721
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,490
Please.

722
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,480
Fei, go.

723
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,900
Pei, go with us.

724
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,060
Go.

725
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,960
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>

726
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,460
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>
Seems they went this way.

727
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,760
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>
After them!

728
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,480
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>

729
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,140
Pei. Pei.

730
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,290
Mr. Hua.

731
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,490
Ji, I trusted you

732
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,260
that he was just young and impulsive.

733
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,240
But you saw what he did today.

734
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,540
Why do you still defend him?

735
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,550
You saved me.

736
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,690
But I won’t let him go!

737
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,730
Hua.

738
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,970
You always say

739
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,810
he saved your life.

740
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,700
You just helped a woman
when you were young.

741
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,420
You were badly wounded and nearly died.

742
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,590
He saved you, huh?

743
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,840
Ji Yunchen.

744
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,730
The woman he saved

745
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,160
found you, huh?

746
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,330
Yes.

747
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,290
Why did you give her

748
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,860
the last Reviving Pill

749
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,060
to save him?

750
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,700
When I came inside the pass,

751
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,340
my master gave me a Reviving Pill.

752
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,110
It helps ordinary men

753
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,050
to get recovered from old wounds.

754
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,460
You had been sick since you were born.

755
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,050
I wanted to feed you with it

756
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,660
when you grew up.

757
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,870
It may help to refresh your body.

758
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,240
Unexpectedly,

759
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,730
the secret was exposed.

760
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,630
I knew what you had done.

761
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,840
How would I take your pill?

762
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,380
Yes.

763
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,700
I exposed that when I was drunk.

764
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,820
Ji Yunchen.

765
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,760
Why don’t you think about it?

766
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,010
Who got you drunk?

767
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,050
Who asked you for the secret?

768
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,940
Who got me there?

769
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,900
Shut up!

770
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,330
That woman seemed to be pure.

771
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,290
But she was scheming.

772
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,140
She did everything,

773
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,940
to set a trap.

774
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,570
She wanted me to hate you,

775
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,570
just to get the Reviving Pill

776
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,490
and save this man.

777
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,250
You’re alive,

778
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,530
partly because of me.

779
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,730
But you want to kill me?

780
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,010
Two ways?

781
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,750
Where are they?

782
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,460
They have their own grudges.

783
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,660
We’d better not interfere.

784
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,860
Hua, go!

785
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,570
Ji, you saved my life.

786
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,420
Since you want to defend him,

787
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,970
I’ll let you be.

788
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,960
Take care.

789
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,250
Hua!

790
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,330
When I dug the secret tunnel,

791
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,330
Hua!

792
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,220
-You!
-I set a trap.

793
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,970
I didn’t know I could use it today!

794
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,050
Why are you following up?

795
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,050
What? You built the tunnel?

796
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,810
Shame on you!

797
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:02,480
You!

798
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,180
Miss Zhou.

799
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,760
Where’s Mr. Hua?

800
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:28,204

Master.

802
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,140
General Wen’s men are still around.

After General Wen leaves,

806
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:54,970
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>
you must help me

807
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,620
<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>
to find my dog.

808

<i>Animal on screen is an example of CG</i>

809
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,700
He is familiar with this place.

810
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,250
I guess he has run away.

811
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,460
Where is this way leading?

812
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,420
This way leads

813
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,490
to the foot of Mount Heng.

814
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,490
A secret tunnel
at the foot of Mount Heng?

815
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,900
Does Mount Heng Sect agree?

816
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,460
Miss Zhou, you have no idea.

817
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,490
When two armies fought in this place,

818
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,530
local people were suffering greatly.

819
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,860
Mount Heng Sect was always respected.

820
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,050
Many disciples came from local families.

821
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,940
They would certainly try to help.

822
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,970
But once they helped,

823
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,250
they would be involved in the war.

824
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,520
What happened later?

825
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,870
In that battle,

826
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,810
the chief and some elders

827
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,680
all died.

828
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,100
The remaining young disciples

829
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,880
couldn’t afford to hold such a big sect.

830
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,860
Those who had families went back home.

831
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,210
Those who didn’t have families
left with their new chief.

832
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,430
Where have they gone?

833
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,050
I hear the new chief was

834
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,970
the last disciple of the old chief.

835
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,010
When he left,

836
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,570
he was just sixteen
or seventeen years old.

837
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,190
No one knows where they left for.

838
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,270
We’d better leave now.

839
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,530
Go.

840
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,100
Fei, why does he know everything?

841
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,700
I guess he only cares about gossips

842
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,320
when he wanders around.

843
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,020
Hit your nose?

844
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,010
Your tears are running?

845
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,940
-Let me have a look.
-Fei.

846
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,810
Are you having a nosebleed?

847
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:38,620
Are you alright?

848
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,660
I’m fine.

849
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,810
What are you doing?

850
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,620
Believe it or not? There’s a bug.

851
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,140
Make way. Make way.

852
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,920
Disgusting.

853
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,230
You stepped on my foot!

854
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,230
Sir.

855
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,700
How much time did I use?

856
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,250
Less than fifteen minutes.

857
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,490
Much faster than last time.

858
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,730
The formation of your school
is wonderful.

859
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,180
The more I think about it,
the more interesting I feel.

860
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,940
It took me a long time

861
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,280
to understand it.

862
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,710
You’re a clever man.

863
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,380
You’ve learnt all our formations

864
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,620
when you learn for the first time.

865
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,300
It proves I have a good taste.

866
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,630
You’re a young talent
from the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

867
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,420
I can’t take you as my disciple.

868
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,050
But I want our formations

869
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,800
and martial art books to be inherited

870
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,720
instead of vanishing with me.

871
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,220
What have I done

872
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,250
to deserve your gracious kindness?
