00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,630
Sir.

21
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,800
Do you have candies?

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,360
Yes, yes.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Here.

24
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:18,950
Thanks.

25
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,800
Sir, we here have

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
yummy crispy jujube
from Hengyang BESTORE.

27
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,830
Sure, I’ll have one pack.

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,080
We want a pack, too.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,760
-Okay. Thanks.
-A pack for you.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,190
Okay.

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,270
Here you are.

32
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,160
Why are you sitting on the floor?

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,160
Are you okay?

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,120
I’m fine.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,270
I dreamed about Duan Jiuniang.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,830
Any information of her?

37
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,440
No rush.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
We are at Mount Heng now.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,320
Tens of miles around,

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,600
there’s only one place to stay at.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,720
I believe

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,230
that we’ll hear from her soon.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
Okay.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,080
Let’s wait for three more days.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,030
If we still don’t know where she is,

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,140
I’ll take you back to Huarong.

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,270
Really?

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,720
Really.

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,110
Maybe we can

50
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,830
go down to eat.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,830
This inn stands out

52
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,820
for its chef’s cooking skills.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
And their beef paste, too.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Believe me.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,670
Dip the paste with a pastry.

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,030
You’ll know what heaven tastes like.

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,440
Before I leave,

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,390
I have to take a jar with me.

59
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,030
Or I can’t enjoy a single meal

60
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,000
in the future half a year.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,190
Fine.

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,910
You’re drooling all over.

63
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,960
Let’s go.

64
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,470
Here it comes.

65
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,630
Smells great.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,630
You lazy bones.

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,670
Go and do your work.

68
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,830
Hurry.

69
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,880
Sir,

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,080
one pastry, please.

71
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,160
And,

72
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,470
serve it with the

73
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,030
best beef paste for sure.

74
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,670
Okay, don’t worry.

75
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,420
<i>Liquor</i>

76
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,520
This lady looks worried.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
Allow me to say.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,510
You see,

79
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,320
when you turn my age.

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,670
You won’t worry about anything.

81
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,800
To you,

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,790
no matter how big a thing is,

83
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,800
after it passes,

84
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,220
it no longer troubles you.

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,390
I’ll ask the waiter

86
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,350
to prepare something warm for us.

87
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,950
We’ll feel a lot better

88
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,600
after eating something.

89
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,950
Come here.

90
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,760
Beef paste, pastry.

91
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,320
Hurry.

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
Okay.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Sir, check please.

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,000
I’m coming.

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay. Thank you.

96
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,830
Take care.

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,960
Xie Meimei.

98
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100
See, even

99
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,600
running business like they do

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,110
needs to socialize with people.

101
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,880
It’s not easy.

102
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,160
I used to think

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,810
once I step across the Ximo River,

104
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,160
I’ll be pure free

105
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,810
and nothing can stop me.

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,990
However I now find,

107
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,730
based on my insufficient talent,

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,230
let alone huge deals,

109
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,000
I can’t even handle the little favor

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,480
my mom asked me to do.

111
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,790
I only

112
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,970
have one wish now.

113
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,950
It’s to find Chuchu

114
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,350
and send her back to the Fortress.

115
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,720
Didn’t you hand her to

116
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Mr. Bai?

117
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,950
Don’t worry.

118
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,110
Mr. Bai comes from Xingjiao Gang.

119
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,190
He’s got various skills.

120
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,390
You can trust him

121
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,950
with escorting Miss Wu.

122
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,110
Sir.

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,980
Here are the pastry and paste.

124
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,630
Enjoy.

125
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,020
What’s Xingjiao Gang?

126
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,160
Carter, boatman, waiter,
porter and middleman.

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
These five occupations

128
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,370
are called by a joint name,
Xingjiao Gang.

129
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,670
The Gang supports each other

130
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,860
in this particular route.

131
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,440
Those who run business

132
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,940
can be legal or illegal.

133
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,480
What?

134
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,490
Let’s eat first.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,110
Don’t let it get cold.

136
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,920
You can listen

137
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
while eating.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,070
Carter, boatman,

139
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,510
waiter, porter and middleman.

140
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,230
These are the five

141
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,170
occupations they do.

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Driving a carriage.

143
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Poling a boat.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Running a shop.

145
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,670
Delivering goods.

146
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,650
Buying and selling.

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,440
These people

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,640
travel extensively.

149
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,450
They are not necessarily bad.

150
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,690
Only that

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
among them,

152
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,110
things can be complicated.

153
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,350
Rules matter the most.

154
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,040
If an innocent freshman meets them,

155
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,920
he may get unlucky.

156
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,110
That means

157
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,400
Chuchu is not safe now.

158
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,320
No.

159
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,080
That’s not true.

160
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,800
They are like the Beggar Gang,

161
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,070
a bunch of poor people trying
to make a living.

162
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,720
However,

163
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
they can be moral and friendly.

164
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,240
Rules matter the most.

165
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Mr. Bai works

166
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
for one of my friends.

167
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,950
He’s got

168
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,690
multiple routes which belong
to Xingjiao Gang.

169
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,320
As long as she’s with him

170
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,210
and doesn’t encounter the Demons,

171
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,070
Miss Wu is probably

172
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,780
a lot safer than you are now.

173
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,360
Can I ask them to send letters for me?

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,260
Let me tell you.

175
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,690
First,

176
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,230
I went downhill following Ms. Wang.

177
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,760
Ever since I was got in the dungeon,

178
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,390
I split up with them.

179
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,820
I don’t know where they are now.

180
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,230
As for my cousin,

181
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,350
he fled, too.

182
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,070
I don’t know where he is, either.

183
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,510
He disappeared.

184
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,270
How can Ms. Wang

185
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,110
explain to my mom when she’s back?

186
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,050
They must be very worried now.

187
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
Plus,

188
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,180
with secret service’s betrayal

189
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,490
and what happened to Chenfei,

190
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,860
I gotta send them a letter

191
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,350
to inform the elders in family.

192
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,320
There are too many people involved.

193
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,110
Your head looks small but

194
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,310
it can remember a lot.

195
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,520
Have you heard?

196
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,590
The crazy lady at Huarong died
so tragically.

197
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,790
The way she died was...

198
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,850
Yeah, I heard.

199
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,400
So scary.

200
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,550
What did you say?

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,230
Don’t you know?

202
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,470
Huarong county governor’s concubine
got caught by the Demons.

203
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,770
The head of them killed her ruthlessly.

204
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,640
Luckily someone took her body.

205
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,840
She’s probably buried now
after these days.

206
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,590
It scares me just talking about it.

207
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,470
It’s crazy.

208
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,440
I know.

209
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,910
Drink.

210
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,710
Fei.

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,350
The dead is gone.

212
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,790
Even if you go back,

213
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,780
what can you do?

214
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,980
I need alcohol.

215
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,070
Sir.

216
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,060
A bottle of liquor, please.

217
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,320
Coming.

218
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,320
Here.

219
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,460
<i>Liquor</i>

220
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,340
Drink slowly.

221
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,240
My grandpa has gone for long.

222
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,710
But

223
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,440
Ms. Duan has always borne him

224
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,970
in mind.

225
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,840
If grandpa has reincarnated,

226
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,730
he must be

227
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,780
a grown-up now.

228
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,050
If Ms. Duan

229
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,110
can meet him in the next life,

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,780
the years they missed

231
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,020
require several lifetimes to compensate.

232
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,780
More importantly,

233
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,200
there’s no successor
of the Yellow and Green Palm.

234
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,050
It’s probably gonna be a lost art.

235
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,340
<i>Liquor</i>

236
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,470
Stop there.

237
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,840
Who is it?

238
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,440
General Wen.

239
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,940
I’m a disciple of Mingfeng Building.

240
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,150
Is Miss Wu at your camp now?

241
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,440
Why? What’s the matter?

242
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
Under the order of Leader Li,

243
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,780
I’m here to escort Miss Wu
back to the Fortress.

244
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,240
Thank you for taking care
of her along the way.

245
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,410
Here’s Li’s personal letter.

246
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,340
Please take a look.

247
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,550
Okay.

248
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,840
Bringing Miss Wu

249
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
while marching can be inconvenient.

250
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,970
It’s considerate of Leader Li.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,860
General Wen.

252
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,550
If it’s for my cause
that has delayed your schedule,

253
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,110
I’ll ride the horse instead.

254
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,400
It’s not because of you, Miss Wu.

255
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,710
You see,

256
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,760
we’re all men in the troop.

257
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,350
I’m afraid we may bother you.

258
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,710
So it’s better for you

259
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,100
to go back to the Fortress sooner.

260
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,200
But you’ve promised me

261
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,540
to bring me to find Fei.

262
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,880
Miss Wu.

263
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,280
It’ll be a long and difficult journey.

264
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,230
Please follow us to the Fortress.

265
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,820
Lord.

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,840
<i>To inform Mr. Shen</i>

267
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,340
<i>Wu Chuchu insisted</i>
Miss Wu has become clever.

268
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,200
<i>on going with Wen Yu.</i>

269
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,010
<i>We failed to bring her back.</i>
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

270
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,860
of her is the easiest thing we can get.

271
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:09,920
Fei.

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,780
I’ve got something nice.

273
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,520
It must be something weird again.

274
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,600
No.

275
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,150
What I have

276
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,830
is called Easing Your Pain.

277
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,820
Try it.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,030
Candy?

279
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,750
One lump can choke children to death.

280
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,760
You had the time to buy candies.

281
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,420
Why didn’t you do proper business?

282
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,190
People have different standards.

283
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,760
Some see fighting for wealth
and fame as proper business.

284
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,860
To me,

285
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,640
making pretty girls happy
is the proper business.

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,730
What’s the difference?

287
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,070
I even think

288
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,290
that mine is nobler.

289
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,340
Xie Yun.

290
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,060
Your footwork still needs practice.

291
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,830
At least be as good as your flirting.

292
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,200
Otherwise,

293
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,550
you may encounter bloodshed.

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,650
Trust me and my Easing Your Pain.

295
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,820
Try it.

296
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,350
I promise you’ll be too

297
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,620
happy to do anything after it.

298
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,670
Do you believe it?

299
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,730
Let me see then.

300
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,640
Good, right?

301
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,520
Oh no.

302
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,520
The monster is coming again.

303
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,800
What should we do?

304
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,080
Please stay here, guys.

305
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,400
<i>Yin Pei</i>

306
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,110
<i>Dragon Master’s Subordinate</i>
Who’s meddling here?

307
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,140
What a crappy candy that Xie Yun bought.

308
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,460
It sticks on my tooth.

309
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,760
Many people no matter at what age

310
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
can’t control their mouth.

311
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,520
A young girl like you

312
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,170
actually can control your mouth.

313
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,760
It’s rare.

314
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,280
Who is it?

315
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,960
Stupid girl.

316
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,590
Gentleman,

317
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,350
you look like an extraordinary man.

318
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,980
Don’t lower yourself to argue
with a normal person.

319
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,880
Our young master has a bad temper.

320
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,950
We are hurrying on our journey.

321
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,980
Please forgive us.

322
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,830
My apology.

323
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,760
It’s fine, it’s fine.

324
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,520
Excuse me

325
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,680
for blocking your way.

326
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,760
Forgive me.

327
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,950
Hua Zhenglong.

328
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,830
I kept you alive.

329
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,580
How dare you to be disrespectful?

330
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,250
Who are they?

331
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,800
<i>Dragon</i>
I kept you alive

332
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,830
purely because

333
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,920
you hid the stupid useless

334
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,160
thing.

335
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,140
<i>Dragon</i>

336
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,850
The Dragon Master?

337
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,300
Can’t be.

338
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,070
If it was him,

339
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,190
how come I could flick his whip away

340
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,070
by using just a chopstick?

341
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,830
He’s probably just

342
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,710
a subordinate.

343
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,190
I find you cleverer now.

344
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,460
Silly girl.

345
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,760
I’m always generous with women.

346
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,620
You’ve got luck.

347
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
After I finish my business.

348
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,010
Kneel down and kowtow to me.

349
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,920
I’ll let it pass.

350
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,270
Don’t forget.

351
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,310
Go check the kitchen.

352
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,560
You’ve searched here

353
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,310
three times already.

354
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,690
We don’t have the person you want.

355
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,430
Shut up.

356
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,250
Did you hear him?

357
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,750
He sounds like he’ll punch me.

358
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,540
Can’t you stop eating?

359
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,890
I just said that you’re calmer now.

360
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,400
But you are not.

361
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,430
I’m trying to eat more.

362
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,160
So that when you fight him later,

363
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760
I can get up and

364
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,710
cheer for you.

365
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,760
What a ruffian

366
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,060
that dares to make a scene
at normal inns.

367
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,040
Innocent girls like you who grew

368
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,640
up in a carefree environment

369
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,230
have never seen ruffians

370
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,320
like Four-guardian Mountain before.

371
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,090
Look at you, standing out for justice.

372
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,670
The old man

373
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,730
didn’t look like he’s strong.

374
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Fei.

375
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,470
His moves are normal.

376
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,350
But,

377
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,190
he’s nearly top-notch.

378
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,110
Because he’s good at using dirty tricks.

379
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,060
Based on his practical experiences,

380
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,160
he can beat ten of you.

381
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,470
Even your mom is here,

382
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,520
she wouldn’t take him lightly.

383
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,100
He’s that good?

384
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,280
Little guy.

385
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,040
Hold on to it.

386
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,430
Your body isn’t strong enough.

387
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,880
We’ve been walking for long.

388
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,760
Where on earth is the Qi School?

389
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,920
Don’t tell me it’s the shabby temple.

390
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,430
No, it’s not.

391
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,800
Qi School’s strategic points

392
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,430
are covered by multiple formations
and traps.

393
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,680
It’s well defensed.

394
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,880
It can’t be found by just anybody.

395
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,640
This temple is merely

396
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,280
an Eight-diagram Formation

397
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,560
used for disciples’ daily training.

398
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,000
Before entering the forbidden area.

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,640
There’s a Mystery Forest.

400
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,470
You can only see it
after solving the formation.

401
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,520
Okay, put me down.

402
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,830
We’ve got Mystery Forest.

403
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,160
I think you’re tired.

404
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,070
Let’s get into the temple and rest.

405
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,880
I can teach you some basic

406
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,590
tactics of Qi School, too.

407
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,640
Let’s see if you got talents.

408
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,560
I’ve heard that Qi School’s tactics

409
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,000
are widely appreciated
and got many disciples.

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,230
It’s also said that they hide
themselves in the city,

411
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,280
and don’t mind
about the worldly matters.

412
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,350
Now I see, that’s how they retire
from the world.

413
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,880
Living in this world,

414
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,560
trouble eventually comes
to you though you try to avoid it.

415
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,640
No matter how subtle the tactics are,

416
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,190
Qi School still suffered from disasters,

417
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,430
and I’m the only one left.

418
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,280
Sir.

419
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,710
You, you...

420
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,310
Let’s go.

421
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,160
Sir.

422
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,310
I’ve never heard so many

423
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,310
rumors when living in the Fortress.

424
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,560
But don’t worry.

425
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,280
I’ll send you back

426
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,770
to your shelter safe and sound.

427
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay.

428
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,830
I trust you with it.

429
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,430
You’re finally here.

430
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,070
Following your traces,

431
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,350
<i>Learning Tao</i>
I knew you’d come here.

432
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,860
<i>Learning Tao</i>

433
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,710
I’ve been waiting for you.

434
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,280
<i>Still Waters Run Deep</i>

435
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,620
<i>Feng Wuyan, Black Judge</i>
Long time no see, Senior.

436
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,400
Feng Wuyan.

437
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,760
You’ve been evicted from the school.

438
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,170
Why did you come back?

439
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,010
I’m here to visit you, of course.

440
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,390
I saw him

441
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,030
carrying you on the back.

442
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,960
Senior,

443
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,730
are you wounded?

444
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,190
No one can hurt me

445
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,920
in this world,

446
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,290
right?

447
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,710
Right, right.

448
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,350
As long as you’re fine.

449
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,190
So they won’t say
that I take advantages from you.

450
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,110
I was supposed

451
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,920
to be the chief.

452
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,110
It’s time to give it back to me.

453
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,040
Nonsense.

454
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,950
The former chief has entrusted
me with it.

455
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
When has it become yours?

456
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,560
You don’t even know the basic

457
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,110
Qi School tactics.

458
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,830
You wouldn’t pass a single

459
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,110
Eight-diagram Formation.

460
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,590
Let alone being the mainstay
of Qi School.

461
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,540
Who knows why that old bone

462
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,720
passed you the chief whisk.

463
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,470
But, no matter what

464
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,120
magical tricks you know,

465
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
now, Qi School

466
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,710
has declined, hasn’t it?

467
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,700
Feng Wuyan.

468
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,510
How dare you talk
about the former master?

469
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,520
Old time stories.

470
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,110
I can’t argue with you ungrateful soul.

471
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,940
Go away.

472
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,760
I don’t want to hurt you

473
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,160
for the former chief’s sake.

474
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,110
You’re being silly.

475
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,310
Nowadays, you’re the

476
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,190
only one left in Qi School.

477
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,190
If you die,

478
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,350
wouldn’t the whisk

479
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,070
eventually belong to me?

480
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,830
Stop dreaming.

481
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,160
I’d rather pass it to this young man

482
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,650
than to you.

483
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,280
So you’ve already made up your mind.

484
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,880
I have nothing to do

485
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
with Qi School.

486
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,710
I have to go back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

487
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,250
Li Sheng.

488
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,980
I’m here.

489
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,640
Don’t be afraid of him.

490
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,160
I’d like to give it a try.

491
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,350
I’ve been out of Qi School for years.

492
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,560
I practiced my skills hard.

493
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,780
They call me Black Judge now.

494
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,960
After these years, you’re still

495
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
as good as before.

496
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,590
Feng Wuyan.

497
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,830
You’re no longer a disciple.

498
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,740
If you keep trying to get the whisk,

499
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,040
I won’t be nice anymore.

500
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,080
His name is Li Sheng, right?

501
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,830
I’ll get you off the picture eventually.

502
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,110
No, no, no. I’m really not a disciple.

503
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,600
Li Sheng.

504
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,970
Let’s go.

505
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,380
<i>Learning Tao</i>
<i>Deep Waters Run Deep</i>

506
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,820
<i>Sanchun Inn</i>

507
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,400
There’s nothing here.

508
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,430
See.

509
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,000
I told you.

510
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,710
What you want isn’t here.

511
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,950
No matter how many times you search.

512
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,000
Impossible.

513
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,800
I haven’t revenged yet.

514
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,120
I have to find him.

515
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,960
Beef paste.

516
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,160
Don’t use fingers.
We’ve got pastries here.

517
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,190
Come on. Have some more, sir.

518
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,960
It’s still warm.

519
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,500
This is the paste that only he can make.

520
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,890
Who?

521
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,830
He never leaves here.

522
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,230
You lied.

523
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,880
Arrest these two immediately.

524
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,430
If you don’t hand out Ji Yunchen,

525
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,640
I’ll kill this girl.

526
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,430
Fellows, we can settle
through discussion.

527
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,310
Let’s discuss about it.

528
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,430
Old Dragon.

529
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,760
Your tricks are undefeatable.

530
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,710
When do you start

531
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,950
to listen to a young boy?

532
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,800
I’m under orders, I can’t disobey.

533
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,110
Sir, Miss.

534
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,560
Excuse me.

535
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,000
Watch out for his hilt.

536
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,310
What an aggressive old man.

537
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,470
Beating up the onlooker.

538
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,680
Stop it.

539
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,880
Hero, take a rest.

540
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,660
Give them some time to talk.

541
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,030
Sorry

542
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,000
for causing you trouble again.

543
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,190
Pei.

544
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,870
A wrong has a source,
a loan has a lender.

545
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,900
Don’t get others involved.

546
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,790
Good.

547
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,040
You finally stand out.

548
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,560
Decided to repay your debt?

549
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,930
Tell me,

550
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,090
how do you want me to repay?

551
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,050
I don’t want your life.

552
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,430
I want you to break your vessels
in front of me.

553
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,830
Kneel down to kowtow
for eight hundred times.

554
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,800
Then let me stab you couple of times.

555
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,180
Our old time stories

556
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,760
can end then.

557
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,140
It’s not hard to do.

558
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,580
I’ll go with you.

559
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,370
You can do

560
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,220
whatever you want to me.

561
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,580
But,

562
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,140
don’t drag others down.

563
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,300
Wait.

564
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,260
Wait a second, take your time.

565
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,310
You see, we only have

566
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,800
one cook at this little place.

567
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,880
<i>Hua Zhenglong, Lotus Palm</i>
If you take him,

568
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,760
where should I find another one?

569
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,310
Step away from this.

570
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,040
Blocking my entrance early
in the morning.

571
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,920
How should I run business?

572
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,800
There are all kinds of people

573
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,250
at the foot of Mount Heng.

574
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,310
Do you think just a pretty mouth

575
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,290
can handle everything?

576
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,480
Fei.

577
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,940
Do you see the boss’s hands?

578
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,830
Help me.

579
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,790
Oh no.

580
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,110
With Dragon Flag stabbed
on the door,

581
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,950
people can come in but not out.

582
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,310
Only dead here,

583
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,800
no people alive.

584
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,190
This guy brings bad luck.

585
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,040
Whoever supports him gets unlucky.

586
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Plus, you’re still here.

587
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,280
I’m afraid we can’t get off easily.

588
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,520
What should we do now?

589
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,110
Well,

590
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,760
I’m not good at handling this anyway.

591
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,230
I just don’t want to die here.

592
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,640
Let’s go.

593
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,590
No one can leave.

594
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,040
Hold it.

595
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,920
Is it...?

596
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,190
The Snow-breaking Blade?

597
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,520
I didn’t know you are a successor
of the South Blade.

598
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,280
Sorry for offending you.

599
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Our problem doesn’t concern you.

600
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,350
Sorry for interrupting.

601
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,590
You can leave with your friend now.

602
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,570
I’ll see you next time

603
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,710
and apologize.

604
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,040
What?

605
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,070
You old bone

606
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,800
heard about Snow-breaking Blade

607
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,710
and changed your mind like this?

608
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,560
You couldn’t beat her

609
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,350
so could only say

610
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,230
something about South Blade successor.

611
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,190
And your laugh?

612
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,640
It’s even worse.

613
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,640
I’ve never heard

614
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,680
anyone speaking so much nonsense

615
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,040
within one single sentence.

616
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,810
It’s a miracle.

617
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Miss, since Old Dragon has said it,

618
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,590
just go while you can.

619
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,100
You were involved because of me.

620
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,310
I’m sorry.

621
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,880
These are my own legs.

622
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,190
I can either go or leave at my own will.

623
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,770
It’s not his place to tell.

624
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,310
My friend is indeed

625
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,350
a little bit rude.

626
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,010
She even bullies me sometimes.

627
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,260
But I just love the way she talks.

628
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,280
Fine.

629
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,430
I gave you a chance

630
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,160
but you wouldn’t cherish it.

631
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,670
Today, both the South
and North Blades are here.

632
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,670
The Dragon faction would like
to give it a try.

633
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,340
South and North Blades?

634
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Is this incense poisonous?

635
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,390
No.

636
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,190
It’s just like

637
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,630
the whistle arrows of your fortress.

638
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,840
I’m afraid

639
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,870
it’s their way to deliver messages.

640
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,230
Different from Mu Xiaoqiao
who doesn’t care about the subordinates,

641
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,470
Dragon Master
doesn’t fight personally.

642
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,670
He loves group fights.

643
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,280
He designed a massive formation

644
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
which requires many people
fighting together.

645
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,420
It may not win in a war.

646
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
But it’s effective
when fighting a single fighter.

647
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,170
When Dragon Master arrives here,

648
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,100
probably none of us can go.

649
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,550
I’m scared of them.

650
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
It’s just

651
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,580
he mentioned South and North Blades.

652
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,100
Who, who is the North Blade?

653
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,420
<i>Ji Yunchen, the North Blade</i>

654
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,000
May I ask, are you

655
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,680
really the successor of North Blade?

656
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,260
Ji Yunchen?

657
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,720
Mr. Ji?

658
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Well,

659
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,710
my surname is indeed Ji.

660
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,390
But I can no longer fight.

661
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,320
I don’t want to ruin
my teacher’s reputation.

662
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,870
I can’t bear the name of

663
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,520
the successor of North Blade.

664
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,910
Do you have shame?

665
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,360
Just ask him if

666
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,660
he dares to use the blade again.

667
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah.

668
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
I made a serious promise

669
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,340
to abolish my skills.

670
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,360
Never use the blade again.

671
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,620
Never fight with people for life.

672
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,560
Never fight with others for life?

673
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,110
What if others want to kill you?

674
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,430
I’ll just let them do it.

675
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,160
If all the people

676
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,470
here today died,

677
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,840
it’d be because of you.

678
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,810
Why don’t you just die?

679
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,920
Wait.

680
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,840
Even if you die now,

681
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,640
Old Dragon won’t go easy on us.

682
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,230
Plus,

683
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,700
Four-guardian Mountain
never fulfills their promises.

684
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,720
That’s true.

685
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,000
Talking about strength,

686
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,470
Old Dragon isn’t good enough.

687
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,250
But no one can be

688
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,150
more wicked and merciless than he is.

689
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,180
Let alone one man died in front of him.

690
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,610
Even if it’s a thousand or ten thousand,

691
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,870
it won’t stop him from

692
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,100
killing people at his will.

693
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,080
So do you want him to die

694
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,120
or to live?

695
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,240
What’s wrong with people
of Four-guardian Mountain?

696
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,180
Your ideas shift all the time,

697
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,150
always smacking yourself in the face.

698
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,710
Now the Dragon Incense is lit.

699
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,080
Dragon Flag is on.

700
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,000
Whether you die or not,
it’s not up to you.

701
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,670
What, what can we do?

702
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,510
What’s done is done.

703
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,280
We can only kill him

704
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
before their master arrives.

705
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,000
Then we run.

706
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,560
I know.

707
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,970
I’m asking how to kill him.

708
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,710
We rush forward together.

709
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,410
Win by numbers.

710
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,600
What a lame idea.

711
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,150
Look at them,

712
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,870
few of them can still move.

713
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,580
If you can, you do it.

714
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,040
Me?

715
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,600
No.

716
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,470
I don’t have a blade.

717
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,950
How, how can I fight him?

718
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,870
Mr. Xie.

719
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,190
You can either be tough
or weak, right?

720
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,230
Go!

721
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,520
Where’s your Bone-melting Powder?

722
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,080
Bone-melting Powder?

723
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,910
You’ve got a sharp blade.

724
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,360
I’ve got my mouth sharp like a blade.

725
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,320
We’re really

726
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,110
a good match.

727
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,840
True master of Lotus Palm,
Hua Zhenglong.

Snow-breaking Blade

730
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,520
on Mr. Li’s hands,

731
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,390
the essence was being edgeless.

732
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,190
While it’s on Leader Li’s hands,

733
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,080
the essence was being incomparable.

734
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,160
The moves are designed beforehand
while the user is not.

735
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,600
Don’t rigidly adhere to the moves.

736
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,760
Yeah.

737
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
When my grandpa passed away,

738
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,000
my mother was about my age.

739
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,470
Who knows if

740
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,840
her moves were good or not?

741
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,230
She said the Snow-breaking Blade
is all-conquering.

742
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,080
Who knows if it’s ancestral

743
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,790
or she made it up by herself?

744
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,990
Why would I see it as the standard?

745
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,180
I want to be myself.

746
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,460
Forgive me, please. Forgive me.

747
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,610
Forgive me. Forgive me, please.

748
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,880
Watch out.

749
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,630
It’s poisonous!

750
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,710
Mr. Hua!

751
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,080
It’s been twenty years.

752
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,350
Can’t believe someone still
remembers my old bone.

753
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,560
What a shame.

754
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,660
When my Lotus Palm

755
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,190
appears again,

756
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,060
the palm

757
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,110
is gone.

758
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,150
Guys,

759
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,610
though the incense only burned a half,

760
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,760
I’m afraid it still worked.

761
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,550
Dragon Master must be around.

762
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,170
We need to go as soon as possible.

763
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,980
The great successor of North Blade.

764
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,710
Though you’re already useless,

765
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,800
you still got a bunch of followers

766
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,650
helping you.

767
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
If you say that again,

768
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,320
I’ll kill you.

769
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,760
Come on, go ahead.

770
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,280
Shut up.

771
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,640
She meant it.

772
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,950
-Everyone.
-It’s fine.

773
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,710
You got involved because of me.

774
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,760
I can’t

775
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,910
compensate to you.

776
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,190
It’s useless to hold me.

777
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,800
I’m just a dog of

778
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,520
Dragon Master.

779
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,600
But you’ve ruined the Flag

780
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,360
and blew off the Incense.

781
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,710
It’s a snap in my master’s face
in public.

782
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,470
All of you

783
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,840
who are here today

784
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,800
can’t escape it.

785
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,870
You will all die.

786
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,600
Pei.

787
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,170
If your parents

788
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,360
see the way you are today,

789
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,940
how terrible they’d feel.

790
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,020
Stop ruining yourself.

791
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,750
You said all the good words.

792
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,750
How dare you to mention my parents?

793
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,760
You...

794
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,640
Is Dragon Master really here?

795
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,300
We can’t lose our dignity.

796
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,080
Let’s go out.

797
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,230
Miss, see you next time.

798
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,410
General Wen.

799
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Wait a second, please.

800
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,360
Greetings to Your Majesty.

801
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,390
Your, Your Majesty?

802
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,600
Fei.

803
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,790
Are you okay, Fei?

804
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,120
I was really worried.

805
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,000
Don’t worry about me.

806
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,960
As long as you’re okay.

807
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,700
General Wen.

808
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,900
Miss Wu.

809
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,230
He’s the Emperor?

810
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,390
I heard from General Wen

811
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,230
that he’s the Emperor
of previous dynasty.

812
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,900
This is...?

813
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,890
Miss Zhou, right?

814
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,480
General Wen.

815
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,410
Is my father alright?

816
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,000
Lord Gantang is good.

817
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,430
He misses you a lot.

818
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,230
I broke a blade

819
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,280
of you before.

820
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,130
Miss, you didn’t hold grudges, right?

821
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,620
I heard that

822
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,730
at Huarong,

823
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,910
His Majesty met with the Demons.

824
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,320
After I sent help,

825
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,660
Huarong was already in lockdown.

826
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,820
Luckily you’re safe.

827
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,670
I’m okay.

828
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,000
A wealthy and honorable man

829
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,890
shouldn’t go through dangers.

830
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,710
It’s too dangerous for you
to experience the world alone.

831
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,080
No, I’m fine.

832
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,150
Please tell Lord Gantang for me

833
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,520
that I’m not on my own.

834
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,910
I have...

835
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,230
I don’t know any emperor.

836
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,150
Miss Zhou.

837
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,630
Miss Wu has been worrying
about you along the way.

838
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,080
You two haven’t seen each other
for long.

839
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,120
Go and catch up.

840
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,800
I’ll prepare you a ride

841
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,840
to go back to the Fortress.

842
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,340
No.

843
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,670
We’ve messed with Dragon Master.

844
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,910
If we leave,

845
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,500
bad things would happen
to the whole inn.

846
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,760
The monster of Four-guardian Mountain
is here, too?

847
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,190
Yeah.

848
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,430
Just now,

849
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,950
I blew off the Dragon Incense,

850
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,800
broke the Dragon Flag.

851
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,030
It may not end well.

852
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,670
