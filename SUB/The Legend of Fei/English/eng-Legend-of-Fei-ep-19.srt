Put your weapon back!

18
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,720
Where are your manners?

19
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,720
You’ve made a name for yourself

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
as Miss South Blade

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,590
by killing Qiu Tianjin
and Dragon Master.

22
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,440
I, Yang Jin,

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,340
challenge you to a duel.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,190
Qiu Tianjin and Dragon Master?

25
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,910
What do they have to do with me?

26
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,630
What?

27
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,270
You don’t know who you’ve killed?

28
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,800
I killed them?

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,440
It’s known to all

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,000
that Miss South Blade

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
eliminated Dragon Master
of the Four-guardian Mountain

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
as well as Qiu Tianjin.

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,100
How could you not know?

34
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,870
Oh, them.

35
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,080
I know.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,790
I heard what happened in the tea house.

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,550
The storyteller knew nothing.

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,880
You really believe him?

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,110
Are you a fool?

40
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,960
I’m serious!

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,440
Everyone knows how they died.

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,390
Don’t try to fool me.

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,640
I swear I have nothing to do with it.

44
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,240
Did you mistake me for someone else?

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,030
Is there another heiress
to the South Blade?

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,300
Another heiress?

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,540
Does he mean Fei?

48
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,910
Why are you laughing?

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,190
I’m laughing at you.

50
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,830
You bonehead!

51
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,750
My grandfather’s offspring are many.

52
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,550
I’m confused.

53
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,390
How would I know who he taught?

54
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,830
Neither do I care.

55
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,830
It could be anyone in our Fortress.

56
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,000
We’ve got too many people there.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,110
Feel free to check with them one by one.

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,320
I’m off.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,550
Are you messing with me?

60
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,830
He’s surprisingly sharp.

61
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,240
Do you think I’m not qualified

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,030
to challenge you?

63
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,550
You know what?

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,440
I demand

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,960
that we battle it out!

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,670
What’s your problem?

67
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,080
Are you deaf?

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,030
I said I’m not
the South Blade’s heiress.

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,440
Why don’t you believe me?

70
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,000
Do I look like I can wield blades?

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
Hey,

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,270
you already knocked me out once.

73
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,270
What are you trying to do now?

74
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,550
Let me go,

75
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,360
or I’ll report you to the authority

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,520
for abduction.

77
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,960
Abduction?

78
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,910
We can work things out

79
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,720
ourselves.

80
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you need the authority for?

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
What things do you mean?

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,520
Never mind. Anyway,

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,110
let’s see if the South Blade is better

84
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,530
than the 13 Goose-breaking Blades.

85
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,270
Mr. Yang.

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
Mr. Yang.

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,390
You made a mistake.

88
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,610
<i>Chief Xu, Route Gang</i>
She isn’t the South Blade.

89
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,720
Look,

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,880
you’ve paid us a fortune

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
and we’ll definitely

92
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,670
find the person you ask for.

93
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,720
When will that be?

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,450
We’ve already tracked her down.

95
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
She goes by the name

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,270
of Zhou Fei.

97
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,080
Fei? You’ve found her?

98
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
Fei?

99
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,550
Not anyone

100
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,360
get to call her that.

101
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,390
Sir,

102
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,950
Miss Zhou Fei has shown up.

103
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,640
Where is she? Take me to see her.

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,160
I miss her so much!

105
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,760
Let me spare you the trip.

106
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,920
I can bring her here,

107
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
but I need

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,660
something from you.

109
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
That girl

110
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,670
is South Blade,
Li Zheng’s granddaughter.

111
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,760
We must stop her

112
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,070
from acting up again.

113
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,760
But we can’t keep her forever.

114
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,640
If we let her go,

115
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
all our efforts will be in vain.

116
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,320
We can give her whatever she needs

117
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,350
but she can’t step out.

118
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,230
What do you think?

119
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,480
What choice do we have?

120
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,920
How come you can
make yourself at home everywhere?

121
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,950
Why do I sense disapproval?

122
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,300
That shows I’m capable, alright?

123
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,550
You’re just thick-skinned.

124
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,070
Having a thick skin is useful.

125
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,040
I gained that

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,950
by begging others for food.

127
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,290
You what?

128
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,000
I was a beggar.

129
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,110
When I was little,

130
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,600
my master thought I was too spoiled

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,180
to practice martial arts,

132
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,230
so he kicked me out,

133
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,520
leaving me penniless in the street.

134
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,560
He said

135
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,880
if I could survive the next three years,

136
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,390
he’d teach me skills to protect myself.

137
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,870
Your master is right. You’re spoiled.

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,790
Don’t interrupt me.

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,160
I’m reminiscing

140
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,350
about the past.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,400
Go on. Continue.

142
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,920
Back then,

143
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,340
I was a nobody

144
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,320
in the Beggars’ Gang.

145
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,350
Although their members

146
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,040
claimed to be righteous,

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,350
many of them

148
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,630
were bullies.

149
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,230
The high-level beggars
bullied the low-level ones.

150
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,890
It was common.

151
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,150
I couldn’t stand it,

152
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,830
so I left and sang in the streets

153
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,130
in exchange for food.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,540
That was easy

155
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,040
for a good-looking man like me.

156
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,340
You must be proud.

157
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,500
Did your master and his clan get killed?

158
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,710
You asked me the question.

159
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,380
I answered it but you don’t believe me.

160
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,720
Oh, women!

161
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,640
Women?

162
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,780
What’s wrong with them?

163
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,720
You’re awake, Madam.

164
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,670
I assume you’ve recovered.

165
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,570
That’s good.

166
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,720
Thank you for saving my life.

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,980
Put your hands down.

168
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,310
Qian Suiyou,

169
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,000
do you have

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,390
a better thank-you gift for me?

171
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,350
You’re wise, Madam.

172
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,200
I’ve prepared

173
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
a little something for you.

174
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,720
Very well.

175
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,040
Come with me.

176
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,760
Let me see

177
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,610
what you’ve got for me.

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,690
I didn’t realize

179
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,830
until now

180
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,510
that she seems to be different

181
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,780
from the person I knew.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,500
I feel as if she’s walking on clouds.

183
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,760
How charming!

184
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,180
Look at me.

185
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,350
I’m a man of great charm, too.

186
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I’m done.

187
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,900
<i>Qiaoyun House</i>

188
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,540
<i>The Caw</i>

189
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,250
Why are you staring at her like that?

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,640
Fei?

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
I’m glad to see

192
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,000
she’s healthy again.

193
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,500
That’s only what she seems to be.

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
Her steps

195
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,200
looked firm,

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,150
but they were

197
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,370
slightly weak and unsteady.

198
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,470
Although

199
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,670
she turns to be all radiant so quickly,

200
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,580
she’s lost

201
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,840
most of her energy

202
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,260
and can’t be hurt again.

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,580
Madam,

204
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,900
are you alright?

205
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,300
Are you sure you want me to have it?

206
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,810
Why do I feel

207
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,880
you’re paying me back

208
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,380
with someone else’s treasure?

209
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,650
That’s nothing

210
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,640
compared with the risk you took

211
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,030
to save us.

212
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,640
And the so-called treasure

213
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,550
shouldn’t fall

214
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,640
into the wrong hands.

215
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,640
You deserve it

216
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,470
better than anyone else.

217
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,080
Aren’t you sweet?

218
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,230
Alright, I’ll take it.

219
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,470
You are such

220
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,810
a delicate girl.

221
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,840
And

222
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,230
a skinny one, too.

223
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,790
I thought Mr. Li

224
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,710
would pick

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,140
a healthy boy to be his heir.

226
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,100
Were it decided by the given physique,

227
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,000
most people

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,520
could never practice martial arts.

229
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,590
I’m not an heiress

230
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,640
and I still need to practice hard.

231
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,790
My skills are far from perfect

232
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,710
as I still have a lot to learn.

233
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,440
The...

234
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,710
The way you speak

235
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,290
is the same as his.

236
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,230
You’ve

237
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,350
reminded me

238
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,420
of the first time I met him.

239
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,550
Back then, many of us

240
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,000
traveled together.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,470
I asked him

242
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,790
who his master was.

243
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,150
He didn’t say

244
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,960
and just told me

245
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,790
he didn’t have one.

246
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,470
What he practiced was
skills created by his ancestors

247
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,260
and he was unversed.

248
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,110
Hearing that,

249
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,150
I assumed he was some bumpkin

250
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,030
who came out to explore

251
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,550
before mastering his skills.

252
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,230
You know what happened later?

253
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,320
We were stunned

254
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,280
the first time he struck.

255
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,030
Doesn’t modesty run in your family?

256
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,590
My grandfather

257
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,110
was gentle and modest.

258
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,670
He said that to be humble,

259
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,080
but I’m not.

260
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,640
I’m only a beginner.

261
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,460
It’s true.

262
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,910
The two streams of energy you have

263
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,880
are incompatible

264
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,450
but they coexist with each other in you.

265
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,350
That rarely happens.

266
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,400
Master.

267
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,200
What’s up?

268
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,400
Our place is surrounded by many people.

269
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,840
The front and back doors are blocked.

270
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,030
What should we do?

271
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,150
Are you the target

272
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,640
or I am?

273
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,780
How would I know?

274
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,360
Could it be...

275
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,230
Shen Tianshu?

276
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,280
No way.

277
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,910
He isn’t that stupid.

278
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,110
At this stage,

279
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,350
coming at the Yuyi Troupe

280
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,480
is of no use.

281
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Am I the stupid one then?

282
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,550
How dare they!

283
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,880
Miss Lingyu,

284
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,110
what do they look like?

285
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,550
Nothing special.

286
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,320
Just like men in the streets.

287
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,000
Whoever they are,

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
we can beat them back.

289
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,780
<i>Qiaoyun House</i>

290
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,230
Look at you!

291
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,470
The Route Gang is as bold as they say.

292
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,760
You are able to find me.

293
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,200
It’s the Route Gang.

294
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,840
Why are they here?

295
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,900
Is Mr. Bai looking for you?

296
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,910
I don’t think so.

297
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,850
Why would he go to such great lengths?

298
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,510
Madam Nichang,

299
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,350
sorry for disturbing you.

300
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,080
Oh, save it!

301
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
I don’t get it.

302
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,030
I’m simply making a living

303
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,030
by entertaining guests.

304
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,440
Have I offended you somehow

305
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,150
that you flock outside my place?

306
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,320
My girls

307
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,550
are delicate

308
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,200
and timid.

309
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,470
This scene you’re making

310
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,150
can easily scare them.

311
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,930
Can you take responsibility?

312
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,600
I apologize for my abrupt visit.

313
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,510
I’m here to look for a girl

314
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,590
who killed Qiu Tianjin

315
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,750
and Dragon Master in a row.

316
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,550
Did they both die

317
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,830
in your hands?

318
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,440
No. I didn’t...

319
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,550
Well done!

320
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
Don’t worry. I got this.

321
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
She’s my guest.

322
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,840
Who are you

323
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,880
to ask for my girl?

324
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,110
I’m not

325
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,440
afraid of you.

326
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,350
Go back

327
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,840
to where you belong!

328
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,550
Calm down.

329
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,750
Do you recognize this?

330
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,460
That’s Li Yan’s bracelet.

331
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,310
Why did she leave the Fortress?

332
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,840
Who employed you?

333
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,720
How did you get that bracelet?

334
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,020
Do you want to die?

335
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
I’m not told

336
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,240
to keep the employer’s name secret.

337
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,080
Are you aware of

338
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,320
the Cloud Ravine?

339
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,330
What’s that? Never heard of it.

340
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,920
That bracelet belongs to my cousin.

341
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,080
Does your ignorant employer know

342
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,600
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

343
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,520
How did my cousin offend you?

344
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,800
Whatever you need,

345
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,260
you can go to the Fortress

346
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,870
and ask Leader Li for it.

347
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,040
So

348
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,120
is the Cloud Ravine some unknown hovel?

349
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,320
Are you South Blade?

350
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,710
Did you call the Cloud Ravine

351
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,150
an unknown hovel?

352
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,840
Are you the employer?

353
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,200
The head of the Cloud Ravine, Yang Jin.

354
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,640
The South Blade is said
to be the number one blade.

355
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,080
The blade I’m holding

356
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,150
is called Goose-breaking.

357
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,470
After 20 years of practice,

358
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,790
I’m here to challenge you.

359
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,350
If you agree,

360
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,790
the hostage will be safe

361
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,600
regardless of the result.

362
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,430
You’ve seen my weapon.

363
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,770
Where’s yours?

364
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,540
I don’t have one.

365
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,830
She doesn’t have it!

366
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,670
20 years ago,

367
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,790
Ji Yunchen held Yin Pei hostage

368
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,280
to challenge his father.

369
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,150
Now, history is repeating itself.

370
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,960
You’re in the same situation.

371
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,320
Yin Pei’s father was a legend

372
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,640
but I’m a phony.

373
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,740
Stop lying!

374
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,670
Show me your blade!

375
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,710
Enough!

376
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,320
Yuyi Troupe won’t take such an insult!

377
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,000
Neither will

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,550
the Cloud Ravine!

379
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,330
Jin.

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,230
He’s young and hot-tempered.

381
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,100
Don’t mind him.

382
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,110
We dare not insult you.

383
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,440
I’m sure

384
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,280
the successor to the South Blade

385
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,710
must be something.

386
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,350
Not everyone can keep
his or her promise,

387
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,280
but I believe

388
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,030
you’re a girl of her word.

389
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,200
I suggest

390
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,050
we take a rain check.

391
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,750
How about we meet here again

392
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,930
in three days?

393
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,320
You’re

394
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,000
playing with words

395
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
as if

396
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,790
she’s agreed to take up the challenge.

397
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,960
The highly skilled
head of the Cloud Ravine

398
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,040
colluded with

399
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
the well-connected Route Gang

400
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,160
and kidnapped an innocent girl

401
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,350
only to pick a fight

402
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,500
for an empty title.

403
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,590
Well,

404
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,430
shame on you!

405
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,640
I’ve kept that in mind.

406
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,590
I...

407
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,070
That’s right.

408
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,350
Were it just me and the Yuyi Troupe,

409
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,060
we’d only entertain the guests with it.

410
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,120
But now that she’s involved,

411
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,800
I bet

412
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,820
the whole world will know tomorrow.

413
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,420
Madam,

414
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,430
are your girls bold enough to sing

415
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,590
at the cost of being silenced

416
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,670
by the widely respected Route Gang?

417
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,880
Men who understood my songs

418
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,830
all died 20 years ago.

419
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,710
The rest

420
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,380
aren’t worth mentioning.

421
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,710
I’ve lived long enough anyway.

422
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,230
You can take my head

423
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,970
to Shen Tianshu

424
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,230
in case he needs a ball

425
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,190
to kick.

426
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,590
May I ask your name?

427
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,710
I’m

428
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,760
surnamed Xu.

429
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,370
Alright.

430
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,110
Since you’ve given us three days,

431
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,680
then make sure we see Miss Li here

432
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,560
by then

433
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,930
safe and sound.

434
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,640
Otherwise...

435
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,830
You’re a wise man, Chief Xu.

436
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,350
You should know what to do.

437
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,240
What now?

438
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,050
Are you scared?

439
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,590
After what you’ve done,

440
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,320
you still call yourself chivalrous?

441
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,470
You don’t

442
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,560
deserve my time.

443
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,000
You...

444
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,280
Well said!

445
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,390
Goodbye.

446
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,710
Come back!

447
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,950
Listen,

448
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,070
if you change your mind,

449
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,590
come to the Route Gang on Shili Street.

450
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
Let’s go.

451
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,510
I know you’re being modest.

452
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,880
No, I’m not.

453
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,280
I understand.

454
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,000
You can stay here

455
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,470
for a while

456
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,000
in case those rats harass you again.

457
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Got it?

458
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,470
You’ve earned a reputation

459
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,480
by battling others

460
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,260
and troubles would follow.

461
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,540
Like I ask for them.

462
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,190
I must say you acted well

463
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,340
in front of them.

464
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
I might not be a skilled martial artist,

465
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,600
but I’m a good actress.

466
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,520
Let’s go.

467
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,680
Lingyu,

468
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,400
check Yang Jin out

469
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,500
and see if he’s plotting anything.

470
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,230
Yes. Master.

471
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,070
Master!

472
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,280
Master!

473
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,860
I’m fine.

474
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,230
Recovery takes time.

475
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,070
Don’t worry.

476
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,560
Didn’t I tell you to behave yourself

477
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,560
and not to offend Madam Nichang?

478
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,040
You did.

479
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,190
That woman and her girls

480
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,310
seem weak

481
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,400
but they’re highly skilled.

482
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,830
We can’t afford to piss them off.

483
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,280
The South Blade’s successor ignored me.

484
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,430
Did she refuse to battle me?

485
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,070
No.

486
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,110
I must talk to her again.

487
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,830
Mr. Yang,

488
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,830
don’t stir up more trouble

489
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,230
than we already have.

490
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,430
Let’s go back.

491
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,560
Don’t forget

492
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,000
we still have a troublemaker

493
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
at home.

494
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,110
I don’t believe she’s a Li,

495
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,710
especially after meeting that girl.

496
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,280
Mr. Yang,

497
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,230
let me take care of the rest, alright?

498
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,040
Can we please go back now?

499
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,040
Let’s go.

500
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,110
Ow! Ow! Ow!

501
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,280
It’s me.

502
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,710
Why are you sneaking up on me?

503
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,560
Let... let go.

504
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,120
You’re the sneaky one.

505
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
Why did you come out without me?

506
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,950
Didn’t I take you to the tea house

507
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,000
for food and entertainment last night?

508
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,400
Li Yan is kidnapped

509
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,310
and probably suffering a lot.

510
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,230
I have to get her out

511
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,190
and spare me

512
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,830
from that ridiculous challenge.

513
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,160
I can be of help!

514
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,830
Let’s go. Don’t lose them.

515
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,160
Baked buns! Wontons!

516
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,470
Have a look.

517
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,000
Mister, please go.

518
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,830
Baked buns! Wontons!

519
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,110
Freshly baked buns!

520
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,710
-Let’s search the place
-Take a look.

521
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,640
and find where she’s kept.

522
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,680
Anyone?

523
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,630
Let me out!

524
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,520
If my family finds out

525
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,950
what you’ve done to me,

526
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,760
you’ll be doomed!

527
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,300
Anyone here?

528
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,310
Bonehead,

529
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,520
why didn’t you knock?

530
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,190
What if I got startled?

531
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,560
Can you take responsibility?

532
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,470
And

533
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,190
I don’t feel well being kept here.

534
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,160
Get me some peaches.

535
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,590
You... You...

536
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,970
Unbelievable!

537
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,190
Don’t give me that look.

538
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,710
Do you know

539
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,590
who my aunt and uncle are?

540
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,470
How dare you

541
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,040
kidnap...

542
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,470
Are you really the South Blade,
Li Zheng’s granddaughter?

543
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,950
Yes, I am.

544
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,520
Are you scared?

545
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,800
I can’t believe you’re related to him!

546
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,110
Why?

547
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,350
Or would you rather be his grandson?

548
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,470
No way!

549
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,400
He wouldn’t want you.

550
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,680
You’re too cheap

551
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,710
to be in my family!

552
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,160
I...

553
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,400
Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang,

554
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,560
don’t be mad.

555
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,000
She... She...

556
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,920
She insulted me!

557
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,830
I must teach her a lesson

558
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,310
to make a point!

559
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,470
You know she can’t fight.

560
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,070
Could you take the consequences

561
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,800
if you injured her?

562
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
You liar!

563
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,190
You said Fei would be here.

564
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,190
Where is she? I’ve waited forever!

565
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,630
Be patient, Miss.

566
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,640
There’s something

567
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,830
between her and Mr. Yang

568
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,430
that’s left to be settled.

569
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,190
Hey,

570
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,760
are you trying to challenge her?

571
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,920
So what if I am?

572
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,640
-I can enjoy my time here.
-I...

573
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,590
Bonehead,

574
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,230
better watch out,

575
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,920
or you’ll lose miserably!

576
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,640
You...

577
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,520
Do we

578
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,280
need to rescue her?

579
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,280
I’m afraid so.

580
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,800
Go distract those two.

581
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,310
I’ll get her out.

582
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,860
Sure.

583
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,310
I’ll go to the front door

584
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,380
to call them out.

585
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,830
Chief Xu,

586
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,310
nice meeting you again.

587
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,310
I have a message

588
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,830
for the head of the Cloud Ravine.

589
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,810
Can you ask him to come out?

590
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,680
Sure. Please wait a minute.

591
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,990
It’s you!

592
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,790
Where’s she?

593
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Sorry, she didn’t come.

594
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
What do you want?

595
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,830
Let me out!

596
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,520
Let me out now!

597
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
Are you done?

598
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,560
Fei! Is it really you?

599
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,350
I miss you dearly!

600
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,190
You don’t know

601
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,830
how miserable I am.

602
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,950
You call this miserable?

603
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,230
Your face is round.

604
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,780
Let’s get out of here.

605
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,620
I can’t.

606
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,640
I’ve promised

607
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,280
that you’ll battle him in three days.

608
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,800
I must make good on it.

609
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,920
Since when did you
get to make decisions for me?

610
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
Are you going with me or not?

611
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,040
I’m not going anywhere.

612
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,560
Here I’m well-fed

613
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
and I can tease that bonehead.

614
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,460
Where else could I have so much fun?

615
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,000
Aren’t you afraid they’ll kill you?

616
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,400
No way.

617
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,230
At least not before the challenge.

618
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,950
Fei,

619
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,830
you must

620
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,560
teach that bonehead a lesson for me.

621
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
The dignity of our Fortress

622
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,350
depends on you.

623
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,800
Do it yourself.

624
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,920
Let’s go, or I’ll be rough!

625
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,760
You’re bullying me again.

626
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,880
I’ll tell Aunt about it.

627
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Bonehead.

628
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,560
You are...?

629
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,310
Don’t be scared.

630
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,640
I’m confused.

631
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,680
Who’s the kidnapper

632
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,400
and who’s the victim?

633
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,520
Why do I feel like

634
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,480
I’m the bad guy here?

635
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,350
I remember it.

636
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,400
You kidnapped my uncle.

637
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,110
You really are a bad guy!

638
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,950
Chill out.

639
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,950
Listen to me.

640
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,310
Miss,

641
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,640
he’s holding you hostage

642
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,560
to challenge Fei to a duel.

643
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,400
I know.

644
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
He’s not her match.

645
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,800
Neither is she willing to battle him.

646
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,560
Mr. Yang,

647
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,470
Fei won’t

648
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,920
accept the challenge.

649
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,000
Let’s not

650
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,140
waste our time.

651
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,550
Miss,

652
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,760
let’s go and see Fei,

653
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,470
alright?

654
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,680
You’re lying!

655
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,950
Fei hates you.

656
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,640
How could she be with you?

657
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,680
Why would I lie?

658
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,800
Whatever.

659
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,640
It’s safer to stay here

660
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,230
than leave with you.

661
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,660
Let’s go, Bonehead.

662
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,280
Hey...

663
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,130
Sorry,

664
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,950
it’s not that I refuse to let her go.

665
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,830
See you in three days.

666
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,470
She and I will both be there.

667
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,920
I promise.

668
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,700
<i>Miaoan Pharmacy</i>

669
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,420
<i>Miaoan Pharmacy</i>

670
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,500
Miss Chuchu, have a seat.

671
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,000
Excuse me, are you the owner?

672
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,450
Yes, I am.

673
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,090
What do you need, sir?

674
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,770
Fill this prescription.

675
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,080
Sure.

676
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,060
Sir,

677
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,800
I don’t have any money with me.

678
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,830
Is this

679
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,160
enough to pay for the herbs?

680
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,580
You’re one of us.

681
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,400
It’s been a while

682
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,790
since I met members of Xiaoxiang.

683
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,430
Sorry,

684
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,650
I’m not their member.

685
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,090
Why do you have their token?

686
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,950
We left together

687
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,800
to practice.

688
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,530
I’m Li Sheng.

689
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,760
You’re lead...

690
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,830
I have an urgent message for Leader.

691
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,520
What is it?

692
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,920
Someone may attack

693
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,160
the Fortress.

694
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,040
Tell her to take precautions soon.

695
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,190
Who is it?

696
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,400
Timber Wolf?

697
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,830
20 years ago,

698
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,590
Old Master clobbered him.

699
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,070
Now,

700
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,610
he’s coming for revenge.

701
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,880
Give me a minute.

702
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,460
I’ll go get a carrier pigeon.

703
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,110
Thank you.

704
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,240
Please.

705
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,370
Don’t worry too much.

706
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,430
Once the message is sent out,

707
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,880
he’ll arrange a place for us

708
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,760
to rest.

709
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,300
What’s wrong?

710
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,470
I thought

711
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,070
you came to buy herbs,

712
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,870
but that man is actually
your secret contact.

713
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,220
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you.

714
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,730
But relax.

715
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,290
This place is safe.

716
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,610
Something happened earlier.

717
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,880
What was it?

718
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,400
Back in Huarong,

719
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,830
many were killed

720
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,400
when Demons set our inn on fire.

721
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,000
Luckily, Fei and I were out

722
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,920
and we survived.

723
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,960
But they located us

724
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
because some secret contact

725
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
sold us out.

726
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,230
Really?

727
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,470
How come?

728
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,350
Fei and I witnessed everything.

729
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,040
They were in cahoots with those Demons.

730
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,960
What?

731
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,230
Think about it.

732
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,040
Before you said anything,

733
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,280
that owner brought up

734
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,430
Timber Wolf. Why?

735
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,520
Is your cousin

736
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,140
brain-damaged or what?

737
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,420
<i>Yuejing House</i>
Forget about her.

738
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,230
Let the kidnapper and the hostage

739
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,800
work things out themselves.

740
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
Cheer up.

741
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,040
Don’t worry too much.

742
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
We can stay

743
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,500
at Madam Nichang’s place

744
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,160
and wait for Yang Jin

745
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,730
and your cousin to come.

746
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,880
When he doesn’t see you,

747
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,470
he’ll get the message.

748
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,040
What do you know about the Cloud Ravine?

749
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,410
It’s located

750
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,110
in the south of Xinjiang

751
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,350
where there’s much greenery in miasma.

752
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,460
It’s not home to martial artists

753
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,810
but skilled physicians,

754
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,740
hence the nickname,
Small Medicine Valley.

755
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,560
He practices medicine!

756
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,110
There are always oddballs

757
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,400
in the family.

758
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,680
But Yang Jin

759
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,850
is the biggest among them all.

760
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,400
I guess

761
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,110
he can only tell radish from ginseng.

762
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,310
He’s obsessed with the blade skills

763
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,440
and he’s quite talented.

764
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,910
He must’ve

765
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,950
beaten all his peers up

766
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,400
to make himself

767
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,460
head of the Ravine.

768
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,450
He has

769
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,290
quite a background.

770
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,580
I know.

771
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,740
He’s started to
challenge others since long ago.

772
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,900
And he’s sort of a rising star

773
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,620
in the gloom.

774
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,640
I bet

775
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,920
he was also going after the title

776
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,290
of the number one blade.

777
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,830
Yet you popped out and snatched it away.

778
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,560
Of course he’s mad.

779
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,680
But

780
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,970
he isn’t too bad

781
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,330
and he’s done nothing evil.

782
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,290
I wasn’t after any title.

783
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,920
You don’t need to tell me that.

784
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,550
But what now?

785
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,000
How about

786
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,350
you surrender yourself to him?

787
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,710
I’ll accept his challenge.

788
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,980
<i>Miaoan Pharmacy</i>

789
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,400
Crap!

790
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,470
They’re gone!

791
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,040
Go after them!

792
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,160
-Yes.
-Yes.

793
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,350
It’s done. Taste it.

794
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,760
No, thanks. I’m good. You first.

795
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,110
Try it.

796
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,920
My roasted chicken wing

797
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,110
is tasty.

798
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,120
Why are you staring at me?

799
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,630
Is there something on my face?

800
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,710
No.

801
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,390
I’m surprised

802
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,000
that a well-cared-for girl like you

803
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,890
could show calm in times of danger.

804
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,310
That’s admirable.

805
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,990
As fragile as you look,

806
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,840
you’re

807
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,560
much tougher than I thought.

808
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,910
Not exactly.

809
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,520
Back in Huarong,

810
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,500
I couldn’t even run.

811
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,080
It was Fei
who protected me along the way.

812
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,910
She said

813
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,320
even if she died,

814
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,840
she’d be there for me as a ghost.

815
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,870
Then I thought to myself

816
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,190
how she could die.

817
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,280
She’d only die because of me.

818
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,720
I couldn’t let that happen.

819
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,000
Fei shouldn’t have

820
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,250
frightened you like that.

821
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
I wonder how she is now.

822
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,260
She will be fine.

823
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,710
She’s always been strong.

824
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,390
Although she grew up being whipped,

825
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,490
she turned out just fine.

826
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,160
You can stop worrying

827
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,070
as your cousin seems alright.

828
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,710
Anyway, you don’t want to battle him.

829
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,520
Since he’s after fame,

830
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,310
you can give in and let him have it.

831
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,460
Are you seriously
considering joining the battle?

832
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,520
Shouldn’t I?

833
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,800
I’ll be honest with you

834
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
if you won’t hit me.

835
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,430
You disapprove?

836
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,430
I see.

837
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,390
You’re aggressive and pugnacious

838
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,700
as your reputation suggests.

839
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,120
Xie Meimei,

840
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,450
why are you mad all of a sudden?

841
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,280
Yang Jin

842
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,230
isn’t invincible

843
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,210
but he’s one of the best.

844
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,150
I heard leaders of the major sects

845
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,080
all lost to him a few years ago.

846
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,000
You’ve just recovered

847
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,190
and you’re still weak.

848
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,320
How could you win him?

849
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,870
I’ll never know

850
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,390
if I don’t have a try.

851
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,230
In Mount Heng, you took the risk

852
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,190
to fight against Dragon Master
for justice.

853
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,320
I understand that.

854
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,560
But what’s this for?

855
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,120
I don’t care

856
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,340
about my own reputation.

857
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,230
If there’s a chance

858
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,190
to prove those rumors wrong

859
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,950
that I’m actually a nobody,
that’ll be good.

860
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,430
Why can’t you let that go?

861
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,670
Haven’t you noticed

862
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,280
that Chief Xu, Yang Jin,

863
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,670
Madam Nichang and the others

864
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,000
all refer to me

865
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,560
as South Blade

866
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,470
even though I’m a Zhou,

867
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,430
not a Li?

868
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,150
So?

869
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,380
So I don’t represent myself

870
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,870
but the respected

871
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,360
South Blade.

872
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,230
That’s merely

873
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,040
an empty title.

874
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,470
What’s the point of fighting for it?

875
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,680
Fine.

876
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,210
Let’s say you win.

877
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,950
Will that bring

878
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,200
your deceased grandfather back to life?

879
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,530
Alright.

880
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,430
Don’t mind what I said.

881
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,520
You can do whatever you want.

882
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,440
It’s none of my business.

883
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,550
Will Fei do it?

884
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,260
How can I talk her out of it?

885
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,390
Hey, do you know

886
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,710
when people die,

887
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,760
they’ll become stars in the sky

888
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,540
to protect the living ones.

889
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,560
My father and mother must be

890
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,740
looking at me and my brother right now.

891
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,190
My aunt said the same thing

892
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,500
when I was little.

893
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,670
She said my parents

894
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,670
would bless me and my sister in heaven.

895
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,400
But when I grew up,

896
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,640
I realized

897
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
people have

898
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,180
their own paths.

899
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,080
So you...

900
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,670
I lost my parents

901
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,030
when I was little.

902
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,680
I’m sorry.

903
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,890
You’re right.

904
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,510
We should take our own paths.

905
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,660
I’m lucky enough

906
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,950
to have met you all

907
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,540
who’re kind and helpful.

908
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,600
I don’t know how I can ever repay you.

909
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,730
Is Fei kind?

910
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,730
Aunt asked us to
take care of your family.

911
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,420
Although you’re alone,

912
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,060
trust me,

913
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,040
your safety is guaranteed.

914
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,840
When I saw Chenfei,

915
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,320
I was wondering

916
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,920
how my father made such friends.

917
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,360
After meeting you,

918
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,150
I can’t wait to go to your Fortress

919
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,730
and practice martial arts with you.

920
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,830
The night sky is beautiful.

921
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,840
Look!

922
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,230
It is.

<i>Plum Liquor</i>
Eat up, Xie Yun.

925
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,170
Do you know how terrible your smile is?

926
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,470
For an average-looking girl like me,

927
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,960
it’s natural that my smile isn’t pretty.

928
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,230
So what’s this about?

929
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,760
Xie Yun,

930
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,630
I apologize

931
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,360
for upsetting you yesterday.

932
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,670
Are those words

933
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,600
at your fingertips right now?

934
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,450
I can easily tell you aren’t sincere.

935
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,000
I’m sorry

936
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,470
that I was impulsive.

937
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,080
Just because you’re
from a prominent family

938
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,870
doesn’t mean

939
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,080
you can walk all over
an honest man like me.

940
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,800
You’re right.

941
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,360
My bad.

942
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,000
I’ll punish myself.

943
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,820
That’s more like it.

944
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,760
So will you battle him or not?

945
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,800
I will.

946
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,840
No, I won’t. I won’t.

947
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,760
This Plum Liquor is rich in aroma.

948
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,130
No wonder it’s famous.

949
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,040
Yesterday,

950
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,190
you told me about
the Small Medicine Valley.

951
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,300
Is there a big one?

952
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,050
There was.

953
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,630
The Big Medicine Valley

954
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,470
was known for medicine and poison.

955
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,840
The small one copied

956
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,090
most of their stuff.

957
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,000
Is that so?

958
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,940
Yes.

959
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,050
Sadly,

960
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,190
Demons slaughtered the big one.

961
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,560
Tons of their poisons and antidotes

962
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,260
got lost.

963
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,210
Why ask?

964
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,080
I’m wondering

965
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,120
what skills Yang Jin practices.

966
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,470
I knew it!

967
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,240
There is no such thing as a free meal.

968
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,800
I’m off.

969
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,290
Keep the liquor to yourself.

970
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,080
Master, it’s been confirmed

971
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,280
that Yang Jin is clean.

972
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,080
He’s an enthusiastic martial artist

973
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,470
but he’s never injured the innocent

974
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,560
or made any enemies.

975
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,290
He has no connections with anyone.

976
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,800
In that case,

977
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,530
he is challenging Zhou Fei for fame.

978
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,910
I suppose.

979
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,000
How ironic that it’s happening again!

980
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,120
How could I sit and watch

981
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,670
the youngsters

982
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,670
risking their lives for useless titles

983
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,800
after the North Blade

984
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,760
challenged Mr. Yin years back?

985
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,430
Master,

986
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,520
even if Mr. Yang releases the hostage,

987
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,760
it’s still up to Miss Zhou

988
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,040
to accept his challenge or not.

989
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,520
That’s a familiar smell.

990
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,150
Is it Fei again?

991
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,390
Smells so good.

992
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,330
What an evil trick!

993
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,520
Fei, you’re a bad girl.

994
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,060
<i>Plum Liquor</i>

995
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,370

996
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,560
You’re still up this late.

997
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,630
Would you like to drink with me?

998

a man’s room

1000
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,230
with fine liquor.

1001
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,720
Do you know what message you’re sending?

1002
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,390
I’ve decided to battle Yang Jin

1003

and I need your help.

1004

That’s it?

1005
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,040
What’s that?

1006
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,230
