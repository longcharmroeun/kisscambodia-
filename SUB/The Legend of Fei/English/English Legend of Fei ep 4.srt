Reborn Pill is strong.

19
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,120
After taking it,

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,100
someone with great force is needed

21
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,380
to help people to digest it.

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,470
Mr. Li.

23
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,940
For me, did you...?

24
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,310
Regardless of his own safety,

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,310
his gain and loss

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,700
and old grudges,

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,100
he saved us.

28
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,260
If you want to retire from your jobs,

29
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,430
why don’t you just stay?

30
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,240
We’re nothing,

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,730
but paid spies.

32
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,710
We’ve offended many people.

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,260
If we join you,

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,600
we may bring disgrace

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,870
to the reputation of you
and the Fortress.

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,640
Don’t bother.

37
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,870
If people like to gossip,

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,390
let them be.

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,860
I don’t care at all.

40
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,620
A man like him

41
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,820
is exactly a hero to me.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,000
So,

43
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,350
we’d like to protect

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,260
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight for him

45
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,440
until we die.

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,630
With our lives,

47
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,630
we’d like to protect Ximo River

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,180
and the Spinning Wire Formation.

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,200
I, Li Zheng, the South Blade,

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
officially invite you

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,890
to join us.

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,000
Recently,

53
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,370
I find your granddaughter

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,760
very fierce.

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,740
In the future,

56
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,490
she may be more powerful

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,260
than you.

58
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,790
She isn’t an ordinary girl.

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,270
She’s lucky.

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,580
Brother! Fei!

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,580
Fei.

62
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,720
I don’t want to leave you.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Could you take me with you?

64
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,610
We’re going on a mission.

65
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,180
Take me with you.

66
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,670
You...

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
Go bother my mother.

68
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,700
We gotta go.

69
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,980
Sir, here’s your tea.

70
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,340
Mr. Zhang.

71
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,170
Huo’s Manor is right ahead.

72
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,360
-Let’s have a rest here.
-Why did they suddenly change the route

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,900
and stay here for such a long time?

74
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,510
Fine, then. Thank you.

75
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,720
You!

76
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,440
What exactly is Huo’s Manor

77
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,440
up to?

78
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,670
Ms. Wang.

79
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,560
This pawnshop is

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,040
one of our secret services.

81
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,990
We usually shuttlecock letters

82
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,280
through this place.

83
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,440
Get in the carriage first.

84
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,660
I’ll go get it ready.

85
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,490
Okay.

86
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,730
Don’t you want

87
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,730
to go for a walk?

88
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,540
Someone told me

89
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,680
people at the foot of the mountain
have little food to eat.

90
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,140
Seems like I’m cheated again.

91
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,120
Because we’re in Chunhui Town.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,510
So what?

93
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,740
Chunhui Town is within the jurisdiction

94
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,080
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

95
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,000
Many of their families still live here.

96
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,210
When you go farther,

97
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,220
you’ll know

98
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
you aren’t cheated.

99
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,130
Isn’t it your first time to come down?

100
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,550
Why do you always

101
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,640
keep your eyes closed?

102
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,570
I’m practicing Eye-shutting Skill.

103
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,450
I only heard of Mouth-shutting Skill.

104
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,960
I guess Fisherman copied it,

105
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,560
without a sense of shame.

106
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,990
He called this odd practice method

107
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,560
Eye-shutting Skill.

108
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,310
Why didn’t Aunt tell me about it?

109
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,870
Because Fisherman thinks

110
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,780
I’m stupid

111
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,540
with poor martial arts.

112
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,080
I am bad at flying skills

113
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,450
and I’m so careless.

114
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,030
Besides being good at risking my neck,

115
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,580
I only have a good-looking face.

116
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,580
I must protect my face well,

117
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,630
instead of having any scar.

118
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,960
Whenever I’m stuck
in the center of the river,

119
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,340
he asks me to sit and meditate
with my eyes shut.

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,020
I keep depicting all skills in my mind.

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,020
As time passes,

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,900
I’m not sure if I’m really practicing it

123
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,790
or just imagining it in my mind.

124
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,310
But skills practiced with my eyes shut

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,270
are as good as those I truly practiced.

126
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,880
When Aunt kept you that day,

127
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,800
did she teach you Snow-breaking Blade?

128
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,590
She showed me once.

129
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,670
Would you like to see it?

130
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,100
I can show you.

131
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,340
I don’t want to see it.

132
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,090
Fei. Sheng.

133
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,420
There’s no news about Chenfei
in several secret services.

134
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,190
I’m afraid he’s still held up
in the enemy base.

135
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,490
Let’s go.

136
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,770
I’ve heard

137
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,460
Phoenix Mu Xiaoqiao

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
came to the Dongting Lake

139
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,380
after she left Four-guardian Mountain.

140
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,330
Why does Huo Liantao lock up
these martial artists?

141
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,080
Why is a decent sect like you

142
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,420
related to such a woman

143
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,580
like Mu Xiaoqiao?

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,870
And why are you locking us up

145
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,200
in this place without a reason?

146
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,720
Don’t you fear

147
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,180
you’ll arouse the anger of the masses?

148
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,510
<i>Huo Liantao, Huo’s Manor</i>
In turbulent days,

149
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,810
there’s no good or evil,
only friends and enemies.

150
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,180
Take him away!

151
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,690
-Aye.
-Aye.

152
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,660
Where is Old Master Huo?

153
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,780
Lord.

154
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,390
I hear

155
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,850
Huo’s Manor has built a dungeon

156
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,930
in the mountains

157
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,860
and has imprisoned many martial artists.

158
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,180
No one knows what they’re up to.

159
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,340
Do you remember Wu Fei’s letters?

160
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,910
Yes.

161
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,530
Those letters were delivered

162
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,310
through Huo’s Manor.

163
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,310
It’s wise of you, Lord.

164
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,070
Go.

165
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,870
Go to the dungeon of Huo’s Manor.

166
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,260
<i>Daran Restaurant</i>

167
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,070
Boy.

168
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,170
Here’s something to eat.

169
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,990
Take it.

170
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,490
What are you doing?

171
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,460
Go away!

172
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,160
Sheng.

173
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,050
What happened?

174
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,170
I don’t think

175
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,810
we’re welcome here.

176
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,950
Well, don’t bother them, then.

177
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,280
Let’s spend the night
somewhere isolated.

178
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,200
After we set out early tomorrow morning,

179
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,710
we’ll arrive at Huo’s Manor.

180
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,760
Okay.

181
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,720
Bandits! Come out!

182
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,720
Someone is calling us bandits!

183
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,140
Go and take a look.

184
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,250
Bandits! Come out!

185
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,090
Explain to us.

186
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,110
What are you shouting about?

187
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,430
Come out! Bandits!

188
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,490
Come out! Come out!

189
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,620
Everybody, we’re just passing by.

190
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,050
Have we broken any rule of yours?

191
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,850
You robbed us of food.

192
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,480
But why did you kill my son?

193
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
Killed your son?

194
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,940
Dudes, we didn’t kill anyone.

195
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,090
There must be some misunderstanding.

196
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,360
Don’t bother to argue with them!

197
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,320
Today, we will fight desperately

198
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,450
with you!

199
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,410
-Fight desperately with you!
-Fight desperately with you!

200
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,060
Everybody!

201
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,140
-Fight desperately with you!
-Pay with your life!

202
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,040
-Fight desperately with you!
-Fight desperately with you!

203
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,110
You!

204
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,890
Fight desperately with you!

205
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,760
Everybody, listen to me.

206
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,690
Fight desperately with you! Bandits!

207
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,690
Everybody.

208
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
Do I look like a bandit

209
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,990
who kills people?

210
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,850
I’m also on my way

211
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,470
to visit my grandson.

212
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,830
Buy some good clothes for this boy

213
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,220
and bury him.

214
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,960
You mistake us as bandits.

215
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,680
I think the real murderers

216
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,680
must be dressed up like us.

217
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,110
However,

218
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,590
your village is only one day’s walk
away from Jingzhou.

219
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,480
Huo’s Manor is nearby.

220
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,240
How do they allow martial artists

221
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,030
to rob people?

222
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,080
Since Old Master Huo was sick,

223
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,690
we’ve never seen anyone
from Huo’s Manor.

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,540
What martial artists?

225
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,540
They’re bandits!

226
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,340
Head!

227
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,230
Bandits. Real bandits.

228
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,220
They’ve come!

229
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,480
Right at the village entrance!

230
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,030
Sheng.

231
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,390
Go protect the villagers.

232
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,620
The rest of you,

233
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,870
go figure out

234
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,530
how many bandits there are.

235
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,050
-Aye.
-Aye.

236
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,600
Fei.

237
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,340
Go with me to see their chief.

238
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,610
Okay.

239
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,290
But...

240
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,590
If you fight them,

241
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,590
you’ll bring death

242
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,470
to the whole village.

243
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,870
I see.

244
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,550
Everybody, hide yourselves.

245
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,780
Put away your blades.

246
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,700
Hurry. Hurry.

247
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,270
You two, go check it.

248
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,100
Hurry. Get in, everybody.

249
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,130
At last,

250
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,130
he is getting mature.

251
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,320
When we see the bandits,

252
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,320
show them this hairpin.

253
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,700
This is the logo of your sect.

254
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,920
You’re going to tell them

255
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,720
who you are?

256
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,920
I suspect they’re related
to Huo’s Manor.

257
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,640
If they manage

258
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,920
to recognize us,

259
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,820
they won’t hurt us without restraint.

260
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,890
By then,

261
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,970
we’ll go to Huo’s Manor
and check what happened.

262
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,920
Come on.

263
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,220
Here comes a beautiful girl.

264
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,210
What?

265
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,290
You know...

266
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,030
You know martial arts?

267
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,940
Sir.

268
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,510
I’m going back to my hometown

269
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,910
with my young girl.

270
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,280
We’re not from a rich family.

271
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,880
How about this?

272
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,190
I have a gold hairpin.

273
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,890
Take it

274
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,610
as a little tip.

275
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,120
I beg you, sir.

276
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,540
Please let us go.

277
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,970
Girl, go.

278
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,510
Give it to them.

279
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,980
Madam, it’s considerate of you!

280
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,230
Why don’t you

281
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,630
give us

282
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,080
your carriage, too?

283
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,130
I’ve been travelling all the way,

284
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,390
to see my grandson.

285
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,880
The carriage...

286
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,280
Fine.

287
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,570
I’ll walk back, then.

288
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,940
Fei.

289
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,710
Go.

290
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,790
Go get the carriage.

291
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,920
Go.

292
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,460
Don’t force yourself.

293
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,520
Madam.

294
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,750
Why don’t you give us

295
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,300
this beautiful girl, too?

296
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,570
In a couple of days,

297
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,610
we’ll drive a carriage

298
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,220
and get you back home proudly.

299
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,060
What do you think?

300
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,830
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

301
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,980
Girl.

302
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,710
I always tell you

303
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,250
to be calm and reasonable

304
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,510
when travelling around.

305
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,340
And you should obey others’ rules.

306
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,740
But if you meet

307
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,880
-such unreasonable guys...
-Cut the crap!

308
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,480
Fight them!

309
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,980
They’re the first victims

310
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,780
that you killed

311
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,260
with the Snow-breaking Blade.

312
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,600
You haven’t used it for a long time.

313
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,640
They kind of

314
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,430
deserve it.

315
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,170
Xiaoxiang Arrow hasn’t been used

316
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,860
for twenty years.

317
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,240
Today,

318
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,990
it tastes blood again.

319
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,170
Ms. Wang.

320
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,290
Sheng.

321
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,100
Hong Yun.

322
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,600
Here.

323
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,070
Take your men to check

324
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,090
if there’re bandits escaping.

325
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,960
Aye.

326
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,080
Come with me.

327
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,350
Such bad bandits

328
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,110
deserve to be killed!

329
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,410
Sheng.

330
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,700
Roll up their trousers

331
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,300
and check their legs.

332
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,760
Ms. Wang.

333
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,640
They all wear protective gear.

334
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,710
Seems like they fight with legs.

335
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,550
Across the world,

336
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,140
only people from Huo’s Manor
fight with legs.

337
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,250
Why have they

338
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,660
become bandits?

339
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,370
Ms. Wang.

340
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,610
We’re supposed to pass Huo’s Manor.

341
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,780
Shall we

342
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,220
tell Old Master Huo about it

343
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,970
so that he’ll restrain his disciples?

344
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,650
No.

345
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,880
We’ll go to Huarong instead.

346
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,130
Why?

347
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,320
Sheng.

348
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
You’re one of the best disciples

349
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,360
among your generation
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

350
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,870
Think about it.

351
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,950
Do you think

352
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,080
Mr. Li won’t restrain you?

353
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,340
No way.

354
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,340
You mean

355
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,570
Old Master Huo knows about it?

356
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,590
Maybe...

357
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,810
-he connived with them...?
-Don’t imagine things.

358
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,220
We come to Jingzhou,

359
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,180
trying to ask Huo’s Manor
to help us look for Chenfei.

360
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,760
But seems like

361
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,810
they’re also in trouble.

362
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,650
Besides,

363
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,320
Chenfei is travelling around,

364
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,200
with General Wu’s families.

365
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,020
Even if they keep a low profile,

366
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,550
there’ll be news.

367
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,590
In this way,

368
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,360
secret services in Huarong
will find out them.

369
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,250
What about the villagers here?

370
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,170
If these bandits are really

371
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,120
from Huo’s Manor,

372
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I’m afraid they can’t stay here.

373
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,780
Everybody,

374
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,360
you’d better go to your families
for shelter.

375
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,840
Who can we go to?

376
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,840
It’s the same wherever we live.

377
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,420
Who cares about us?

378
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,130
Yeah. Who cares?

379
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,340
Go to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

380
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,290
and my mother will take care of you.

381
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,220
Zhou Fei!

382
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,310
Shut up.

383
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,480
But I’m right.

384
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,480
Within our territory,

385
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,780
my mother will take care of them.

386
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,780
Sheng.

387
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,840
Bandits are rampant.

388
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,100
But within the territory

389
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,450
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

390
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,040
people still enjoy a good life.

391
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,830
Everybody,

392
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,140
if you want to go there,

393
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,770
take it

394
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,100
as the travelling expense.

395
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,790
When you get there,

396
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,790
show them this token

397
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,340
and tell them

398
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,780
I asked you to go.

399
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,370
You’ll be taken care of.

400
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,280
-Thank you, Madam.
-Thank you.

401
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,690
Thank you, Madam. Thank you.

402
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,370
Go. Go.

403
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,220
Ms. Wang.

404
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,480
Fei.

405
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,920
You did it right today.

406
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,660
We can use our weapons to kill people,

407
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,490
but also to save people.

408
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,120
You used your Snow-breaking Blade
to save people.

409
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,350
You were right.

410
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,580
Ms. Wang.

411
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,010
Such bandits showed up suddenly.

412
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,470
I wonder if Chenfei and his men

413
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,580
are in danger.

414
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,300
I want to go and check it

415
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,350
so that we’ll get prepared.

416
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,720
Don’t be anxious.

417
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,970
It’s dangerous for you to go alone.

418
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,570
Let’s discuss it tomorrow.

419
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,380
After I left home,

420
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,450
I somehow felt lonely.

421
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,240
When I was home,

422
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,100
I could be nervous

423
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,340
even when my mother stopped me
for a talk.

424
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,090
Since my father left,

425
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,640
I’ve been expecting

426
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,140
to look for him down the mountain.

427
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,070
It’s been only a few days

428
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,190
since we came down,

429
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,910
I’m already missing my mother.

430
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,330
Li Sheng!

431
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,960
Where are you going?

432
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,080
Hyah!

433
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,100
Hyah!

434
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,490
Ms. Wang.

435
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,310
Wait for my good news.

436
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,720
Hyah!

437
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,930
Zhou Fei, when I do something great,

438
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,930
I’ll impress you!

439
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,580
Madam Li.

440
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,140
Why are you making things worse?

441
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:13,960
Ms. Wang.

442
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,240
We still haven’t found them.

443
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,690
Ms. Wang.

444
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,790
We haven’t found Li Sheng or Zhou Fei.

445
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,820
But there’s no trace of fighting around.

446
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,400
I guess they have left on their own.

447
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,190
We haven’t found Chenfei yet.

448
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,020
But they two are missing, too.

449
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,780
I shouldn’t have taken them out!

450
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,850
It’s their first time to come out.

451
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,770
They haven’t seen
anything like that before.

452
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,690
I’m afraid they’ve gone to Huo’s Manor

453
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,640
to stand out for justice.

454
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,540
I don’t think so.

455
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,130
Sheng is quick-witted.

456
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,580
Fei is calm.

457
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,940
I don’t think

458
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,870
they would be so reckless.

459
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,780
Uh...

460
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,470
Why is here such a good horse?

461
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,740
Could it be a horse from those guys

462
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,520
who were caught?

463
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,420
How lucky I am!

464
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,090
Our horse?

465
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,610
Dudes, I’m back!

466
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,380
And a good horse.

467
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,230
Looks good.

468
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,360
How did you get it?

469
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,820
Yeah.

470
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,900
You worked hard, dudes.

471
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,530
Keep guarding the prison.
I’m getting in.

472
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,890
What is this place?

473
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,890
Why are there so many guards?

474
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
I should get myself in.

475
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,820
I can’t hesitate.

476
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,220
Who? After her!

477
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,570
That way! After her!

478
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,120
Did you see her clearly?

479
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,390
Looks like a young girl.

480
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,650
Go figure out who she is.

481
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,230
Get her to me,
no matter what it takes!

482
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,690
Get up for the meal!

483
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,810
Don’t you know

484
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,720
our Old Master Li is a sworn brother

485
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,990
with your Old Master Huo?

486
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,630
How dare you treat us like this!

487
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,630
Let us out! Let us out!

488
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,390
Shut up!

489
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,710
Stop yelling!

490
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,720
Let us out!

491
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,500
Let us out!

492
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,420
Somebody! Let us out! Open the door!

493
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,190
Why are you locking us up? Let us out!

494
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,920
Somebody! Let us out!

495
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,690
Shut up!

496
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,920
Let us out! Let us out!

497
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,150
Stop yelling!
You can’t run away by yelling.

498
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,180
If you keep yelling,

499
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,030
I’ll lash you!

500
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,050
I really didn’t expect this.

501
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,910
Huo’s Manor used

502
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,910
to be a decent sect.

503
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,910
But it turns out

504
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,610
to be so shameless!

505
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,430
Sister.

506
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,750
Didn’t Dad say

507
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,260
all martial artists

508
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,570
are loyal heroes?

509
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,010
Whenever I’m clever,

510
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,130
I’ll suffer

511
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,690
soon after that.

512
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,830
What wrong

513
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,950
have I done?

514
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,470
I’m so lucky today.

515
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,950
Something good will certainly happen.

516
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,880
Beautiful girl.

517
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,220
Hello.

518
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,360
Who are you?

519
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,840
Are you locked up?

520
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,730
I am.

521
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,730
In this place,

522
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,220
many guys are locked up.

523
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,460
Didn’t you see them when you came in?

524
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,220
Along the mountain walls

525
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,470
are separate cells.

526
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,470
Different heroes yell with curses

527
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,330
every day.

528
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,460
Sounds interesting.

529
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,770
What a pity!

530
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,790
I come too late.

531
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,890
I don’t even have a decent cell.

532
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,940
It is a quiet corner.

533
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,030
But I can hardly join them in yelling.

534
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,080
What about you?

535
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,790
How did you come in?

536
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,700
I came because the damn mountain

537
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,620
was hollow.

538
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,030
I fell in.

539
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,990
You’re not staying in a cell?

540
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,700
Who is the owner of this place?

541
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,570
Why did he catch you?

542
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,180
Look up.

543
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,080
Some light trickles in on your left.

544
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,610
Move over there, okay?

545
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,030
Finally, there comes a beautiful girl.

546
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,430
Let me enjoy your beautiful face.

547
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,160
Why does he sound

548
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,160
so familiar?

549
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,710
Do you have any food?

550
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,540
I take it with me to feed dogs.

551
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,980
Is this

552
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,970
for dogs?

553
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,980
He’s really that dog.

554
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,970
You are...

555
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,460
Xie Meimei?

556
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,490
Weed Spirit?

557
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,630
I shouldn’t have saved you.

558
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,750
Xie Meimei.

559
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,850
I was just joking.

560
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,600
Call me Xie Yun.

561
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,910
Why are you here?

562
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,970
We come down the mountains for business.

563
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,910
But I think my cousin has been caught.

564
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,300
Why are you and your cousin

565
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,890
always in trouble

566
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,190
whenever I meet you?

567
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,920
Because Li Sheng always

568
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,060
asks for trouble.

569
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,060
It doesn’t matter.

570
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,520
There’s food and drink.

571
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,060
I don’t think

572
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,820
your cousin is in danger now.

573
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,710
Time for meal!

574
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,360
Time for dinner.

575
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,430
Hurry. Hurry!

576
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,730
It’s yours.

577
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,780
Here.

578
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,940
Hurry!

579
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,250
Pancakes again?

580
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,930
Did you see a female burglar
running past?

581
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,630
It’s such a dark dungeon.

582
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,470
I can see no one,

583
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,790
but a female ghost.

584
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,950
You’re right.

585
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,400
Eat it quickly.

586
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,370
It’s okay.

587
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,760
The guard brought me food.

588
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,620
I think they’re still looking for you.

589
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,100
Oh,

590
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,100
are you hungry?

591
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,020
Not really.

592
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,140
If you’re not hungry,

593
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,120
I’ll have it first.

594
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,300
If you’re hungry,

595
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,710
I’ll cover it when eating.

596
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,810
Don’t bother.

597
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,530
Enjoy yourself.

598
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,290
I’d better cover it.

599
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,220
Where there’s a chance,

600
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,950
I’ll invite you
to the best restaurant in Jiankang.

601
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,300
Among all the great restaurants,

602
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,140
half are in Jiankang.

603
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,970
Girl.

604
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,050
When they stop looking for you,

605
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,200
I’ll show you a way out.

606
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,370
Leave quickly.

607
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,920
Let’s meet if it’s fated.

608
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,240
Remember.

609
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,460
I owe you a meal.

610
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,100
I can’t treat you

611
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,010
with this one.

612
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,370
There’s something

613
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,680
in this meal.

614
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,930
What?

615
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,370
You...

616
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,250
You’re not leaving?

617
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,400
I can’t leave.

618
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,280
Weakness powder.

619
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,290
Have you heard of it?

620
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,950
I don’t think so.

621
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,920
It’s something dirty

622
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,150
evil sects usually use.

623
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,470
It’s a kind of sleeping drug.

624
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,310
When you have some,

625
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,490
you’ll be too weak to get up for days.

626
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,640
You cannot

627
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,820
use your martial arts, either.

628
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,630
Then why did you still eat it?

629
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,030
Because I’m not a camel

630
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,230
or tortoise.

631
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,370
When I eat some,
I’ll be too weak to get up.

632
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,330
But if I don’t eat any,

633
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,440
I won’t get up ever again.

634
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,060
We met by chance.

635
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,340
But every time we meet, we’re in danger.

636
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,340
We’re kind of sworn friends
for life or death.

637
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,880
How about this?

638
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,360
Call me Brother.

639
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,210
What do you think?

640
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,320
I’ve been kind for not killing you.

641
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,780
How dare you try
to get in good with me!

642
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,190
Well, what a pity!

643
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,010
If you kill me,

644
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,540
no one can tell you

645
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,280
what great things your father has done.

646
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,460
What do you think?

647
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,460
Would you like to listen?

648
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,810
You mean

649
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,420
you have news about my father?

650
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,380
Six months ago,

651
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,770
your father came out

652
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,360
and took over Anping Army.

653
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,320
He made a peaceful land

654
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,960
for homeless people.

655
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,760
Wherever his army went,

656
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,990
people enjoyed a good life.

657
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,390
Where is my father now?

658
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,860
I don’t know.

659
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,150
There’s no fixed marching route.

660
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,260
I thought I could see my father

661
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,620
when I came out.

662
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,960
Go away!

663
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,320
I always have compassion for girls.

664
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,990
Unexpectedly,

665
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,990
I still hurt you.

666
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,110
Girl.

667
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,880
If you’re angry,

668
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,980
chop me to vent your anger,

669
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,190
okay?

670
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,710
I used

671
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,010
to be sad.

672
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,910
I thought my father wouldn’t have left

673
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,060
if you hadn’t gone to my home.

674
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,560
But when I’m here

675
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,530
and see what happens,

676
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,890
I’m no longer that angry.

677
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,360
I’m relieved, then.

678
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,130
I won’t fear that you beat me

679
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,460
when I see you again.

680
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,230
A weak and honest scholar like me

681
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,620
will not be strong enough

682
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,350
if you bully me.

683
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,270
Even if I want to vent on you,

684
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,480
I should at least get out of this place.

685

What happened here?

688
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,720
Do you know Huo’s Manor?

689
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,950
This year, Old Master Huo
had his seventieth birthday,

690
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,560
and invited his families and friends.

Don’t be wordy.

692
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:25,900
Just get to the point.

693
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,400
Anyway,

694
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,890
when he sends the invitation,

695
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,890
people would come to congratulate him.

696
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,700
But I don’t think

697
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,500
they dare to send it
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

698
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,080
If Ms. Li really came,

699
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,360
they could hardly wind this matter up.

700
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,200
Why?

701
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,950
Because of Huo Liantao.

702
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,090
He is Junior Master Huo,

703
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,400
the younger brother of Old Master Huo.

704
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,510
In the name of his brother’s birthday,

705
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,640
he forced all guests

706
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,550
to join his sect

707
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,720
and treat him as the leader.

708
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,230
He planned to found

709
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,570
the second Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

710
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,840
If he wanted that,

711
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,240
didn’t Old Master Huo restrain him?

712
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,080
Old Master Huo is now mentally disabled.

713
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,310
I hear he was so sick

714
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,090
that he barely knew anybody.

715
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,930
He didn’t even remember who he was.

716
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,670
Did Huo Liantao make decision for him?

717
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,770
He caught people like you

718
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,080
who didn’t support him?

719
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,040
No wonder

720
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,310
I saw people with Huo’s Manor

721
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,570
plunder everywhere,

722
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,980
disguised as bandits.

723
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,580
They even robbed horses.

724
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,860
They’re from a famous sect.

725
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,650
Why did they do such a shameless thing?

726
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,260
You’re wrong.

727
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,260
Since Huo Liantao wants to be a leader,

728
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,920
he won’t disgrace himself.

729
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,190
He walked out those guests

730
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,260
who went to the birthday party.

731
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,200
But soon,

732
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,090
he asked his disgraceful friends

733
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,110
to catch them

734
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,260
and lock them up in this dungeon.

735
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,030
Isn’t he deceiving himself?

736
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,110
So,

737
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,790
that’s how you were caught?

738
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,130
No.

739
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,310
I was lucky.

740
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,840
I didn’t go to the birthday party.

741
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,230
But sadly,

742
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,230
I met guys from Huo’s Manor

743
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,450
with your people.

744
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,890
Who do you mean?

745
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,350
The man who used martial arts
from Xiaoxiang Sect

746
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,680
when your father tried to catch me.

747
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,680
Chenfei?

748
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,080
How did you meet him?

749
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,120
I was on my way for business

750
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,550
when I met them.

751
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,860
Later, we were all caught

752
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,920
and locked up in this place.

753
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,550
So,

754
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,820
you brought Chenfei and the Wu family

755
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,410
to this place?

756
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,090
You really are Lord Gantang’s daughter.

757
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,100
It’s smart of you.

758
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,610
You’re smart.

759
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,480
You’re so smart

760
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,920
that you brought Chenfei
to this dangerous place.

761
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,730
And you get yourself stuck in here, too.

762
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,260
You’ll even sprout with some water.

763
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,370
It’s not my fault.

764
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,450
Everyone knows people in Huo’s Manor

765
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,830
are close to your sect.

766
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:03,210
Besides,

767
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,890
your senior brothers are very vigilant

768
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,890
against me.

769
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,950
I’m going to save them.

770
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,950
Wait.

771
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,350
So many martial artists are locked here.

772
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,300
How can you save them?
