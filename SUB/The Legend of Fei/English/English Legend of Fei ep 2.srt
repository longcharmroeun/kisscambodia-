Brother-in-law,

25
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,100
please tell my sister

26
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,000
to keep this bracelet well.

27
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,570
Please…

28
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,510
Don’t let it

29
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,710
show up again.

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,970
Uncle!

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,250
Dad!

32
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,680
Jinfeng’s death

33
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,990
saved you and
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

34
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,510
Now you don’t even

35
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,690
know who the guy is

36
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,310
and you just let him go,

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,790
putting the whole
Fortress of the Forty-Eight in danger!

38
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,340
Do you want us to experience

39
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,620
what happened ten years ago again?

40
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,030
I should just kill you now!

41
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,260
-Auntie!
-Auntie!

42
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,220
-Please don’t!
-None of your business! Stay aside!

43
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,990
Aren’t you having a recuperation
in Repenting Hall?

44
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,500
Which brat disturbed you?

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,620
Jinrong,

46
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,610
you have already

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,040
scolded and punished her.

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,680
Could you please listen to my opinion?

49
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,040
Dad.

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,040
Fei,

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,670
don’t speak.

52
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,880
Guys,

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,580
actually what she said

54
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,290
was not unreasonable.

55
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,030
We have always believed in

56
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,960
the sense of morality.

57
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,170
Of course we can’t return evil for good,

58
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,500
right?

59
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,040
Yeah.

60
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,030
Right.

61
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,170
That’s right.

62
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,410
What’s more, Fei and Sheng

63
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,800
grew up together with our protection.

64
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,550
They have never walked out of here.

65
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,840
Of course we know

66
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,260
that it’s impossible for them

67
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,180
to collude with outsiders.

68
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
-Yeah.
-Right.

69
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,050
Ms. Wang is totally right.

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,250
But even so,

71
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,740
Fei thought the trespasser was not evil.

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,960
It’s just her one-sided view.

73
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,750
We still have to catch that trespasser.

74
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,460
Jinrong,

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
here is my advice.

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,390
You can interrogate him yourself

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,530
after we catch him.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,680
-Yeah. Right.
-That’s right.

79
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,440
Yeah. Right.

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,180
Leader,

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,810
now the key point is

82
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,000
to discuss how to catch the intruder.

83
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,310
That’s right, Auntie.

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,560
Yeah. Right.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Let’s go back to the room first.

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,660
OK.

87
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,100
Fei.

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,380
<i>To be self-effacing</i>

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,060
On my shoulder is

90
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,010
the whole Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

91
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,420
Fei

92
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,160
and Sheng

93
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,360
are coming of age.

94
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,110
There are many

95
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,020
capable masters here.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,730
You don’t have to put all the

97
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,240
pressures on yourself to protect here.

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,890
You’re just trapped in the shell
made by yourself.

99
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,820
My Lord,

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,270
our people failed to sneak into
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

101
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,820
It’s fine.

102
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,750
This trip is just to explore
the condition of Ximo River.

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,160
It’s OK that the boy got into there.

104
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Zhou Yitang must be about to come
out of seclusion.

105
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,040
Tell Tong Tianyang

106
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,180
to take action now.

107
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,090
Yes.

108
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,320
Does it still hurt?

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,080
I won’t die.

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,100
What a bad temper.

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,160
Just like your mother.

112
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,930
I’m not like her.

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,420
It’s her hobby to beat me.

114
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,490
That’s rude.

115
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,010
She is your mother.

116
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,980
<i>True self</i>

117
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,540
Dad,

118
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,950
do you know how dangerous it was
in the Spinning Wire Formation?

119
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,680
That guy saved our lives!

120
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,360
Shouldn’t I save him?

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,580
Why am I wrong to help him?

122
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,520
Li Sheng broke into

123
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,510
the Spinning Wire Formation
without permission.

124
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,200
He didn’t get punished.

125
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,910
She only punished me.

126
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,760
He is the eldest grandson of the Li’s.

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,910
Was I found at a wild grave?

128
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,170
Who taught you to speak like that?

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,540
Everything I did was wrong
since childhood.

130
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,260
He lost his parents when he was little.

131
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,200
You shouldn’t have said that about him.

132
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,120
The three of us cause troubles together.

133
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,970
Li Sheng is always the chief plotter.

134
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,300
But I’m the one who always
took the blame.

135
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,270
We practiced martial arts together.

136
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,380
He could only beat me once in a while.

137
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,740
But Mom just kept praising him.

138
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,720
I have never got even

139
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,220
a recognition from her.

140
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,410
Fei,

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,940
in the future,

142
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,460
you can tell me your thoughts.

143
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,860
You will feel better after that.

144
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,130
I…

145
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,060
I’m clumsy of speech.

146
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,660
I don’t want to explain.

147
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,380
It’s all passed anyway.

148
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,470
Every time I feel wronged,

149
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,750
as long as I think of my uncle,

150
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,130
nothing will be a big deal.

151
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,060
Dad, he saved me and Li Sheng.

152
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,410
Why can’t I

153
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,380
help him?

154
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,930
Why am I wrong?

155
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,810
Of course you’re not wrong.

156
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,600
But…

157
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,750
-But what?
-I…

158
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,460
Luckily, the injury is not so serious.

159
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,600
Let her have a good rest.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Let’s get out.

161
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,840
It’s scary to think about it.

162
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,300
Fei and I

163
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,510
almost died at Ximo River.

164
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,450
Can you just stop trying to leave here?

165
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,680
If you do that again,

166
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,220
I will jump down from here.

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,140
Let me help you.

168
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,510
Sheng! Sheng! Sheng!

169
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,700
-Go ahead.
-Sheng. Sheng.

170
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,220
My bad. I was wrong.

171
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,520
Don’t worry.

172
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,530
I’m still trying to leave.

173
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,600
But I won’t go through Ximo River.

174
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,830
I’ll take the school exam of

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,530
Xiushan Hall and leave here
through the gate aboveboard.

176
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,340
<i>Repenting Hall</i>

177
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,030
This is the last game of chess

178
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,550
I played before I came here.

179
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,790
It happened to become

180
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,640
an ingenious one.

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,210
There are many traps in it

182
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,670
and it’s totally complicated.

183
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,380
Once the piece is put,

184
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,420
it’s hard

185
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,990
to tell

186
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,810
if it’s alive or dead.

187
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,360
I have been stuck in a rut

188
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,860
and don’t know what to do.

189
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,700
I think you’re just trapping yourself.

190
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,340
Over the years,

191
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,180
I have been limiting myself.

192
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,820
If you figure out how to play the next,

193
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,380
will you go on or will you stop?

194
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,840
How could

195
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,760
Leader Li be so cruel?

196
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,870
Is it because

197
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,980
she let me go?

198
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,510
Come out.

199
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,040
Weed Spirit!

200
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,700
I knew you would come.

201
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,980
What are you doing here?

202
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,720
What’s this?

203
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,600
I always take this with me.

204
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,440
It’s for your injury.

205
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,860
You saw all of it?

206
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,810
No.

207
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,810
I guessed it.

208
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,510
By the way, I asked you last time…

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,420
Hush!

210
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,160
It’s not a good place to talk.

211
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,710
Let me take you to another place.

212
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,260
Come here. This way.

213
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,320
Get in there.

214
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,860
What’s your goal to be in our place?

215
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,170
Don’t try to come out if you don’t
make it clear.

216
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,750
This is such a good place.

217
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,700
I don’t really

218
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,920
want to go out for now.

219
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,410
Do you have any food?

220
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:48,870
Thank you.

221
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,020
I take it with me to feed dogs.

222
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,800
Even the dogs here

223
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,500
can have such good food?

224
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,690
Say it!

225
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,440
What are you here for?

226
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,530
I have told you everything I know.

227
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,790
Do you have any grudges with my mom?

228
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,910
How could it be?

229
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,050
I was still a kid

230
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,070
when your mom was making her living.

231
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,180
But maybe your mom

232
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,230
has some grudges with the man

233
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,530
called Wang Lin who sent me here.

234
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,940
Who is Wang Lin?

235
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,460
And who is Lord Gantang?

236
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,410
I didn’t expect Lord Gantang’s daughter

237
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,600
to be

238
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,680
so simple and naive.

239
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,520
I won’t feed the dog anymore.

240
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,790
Lord Gantang is my father.

241
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,790
What’s your relationship with Wang Lin?

242
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,300
General Wang,

243
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,590
is it worth this?

244
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,880
Do we have to do this?

245
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,240
<i>Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave</i>
It would be a dangerous trip.

246
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,520
I made myself a grave with no regrets.

247
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,830
<i>Wang Lin Anping Army</i>
You will go back to normal

248
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,800
after one hour.

249
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,340
At that time, the war should start.

250
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,170
Please don’t forget

251
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,530
what I entrusted you.

252
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,350
Hope you can deliver this token

253
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,720
to Zhou Yitang

254
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,140
and invite him to lead Anping Army.

255
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,730
No relationship.

256
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,840
I just think he is a poor

257
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,610
old man.

258
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,180
So I promised to do him this favor.

259
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,570
You just feel sorry for an old man?

260
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,700
And…

261
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,300
You risked your life to break into

262
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,620
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

263
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,340
Not because of him.

264
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,630
It’s because of the poor Wang Lin.

265
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,580
He had contributed all his life.

266
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,640
He is kind of

267
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,340
a hero.

268
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,060
The hero comes to a dead end.

269
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,620
Isn’t it a pity?

270
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,630
Since I can do nothing but

271
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,780
run fast,

272
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,270
it’s OK for me to do him this favor.

273
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,730
A hero like Wang Lin

274
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,880
has such a regrettable end.

275
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,700
If a pretty girl like you

276
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,640
who loses her youth

277
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,800
and gets grey-haired,

278
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,600
it’ll also be a pity.

279
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Since I saw this,

280
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,150
I ought to help.

281
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,540
But you still haven’t told me

282
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,210
why my mom doesn’t allow you
to meet my dad.

283
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:42,690
<i>To be self-effacing</i>

284
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,020
<i>To be self-effacing</i>
Repenting Hall is far.

285
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,670
<i>To be self-effacing</i>
But you like to come here.

286
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,780
Uncle, what are you repenting for?

287
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,450
I will tell you if you

288
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,280
can promise me one thing.

289
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,580
Go ahead.

290
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,850
Don’t get angry in the future

291
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,860
no matter what I do.

292
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,490
Why should I be angry?

293
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,540
Alright.

294
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,990
Since you said that,

295
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,080
I can rest assured.

296
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,500
Are you insane?

297
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,240
Xie Yun!

298
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,400
Don’t let me catch you again!

299
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,750
Why are there always assassins

300
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,800
who keep venturing to assassinate you?

301
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,990
And why is there someone

302
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,880
risking his life to deliver
the message to you?

303
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,400
Why does Auntie ask most of the guards

304
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,260
to protect you?

305
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,530
You overheard what your auntie said?

306
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,900
Fei got punished

307
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,400
because of me.

308
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,980
I don’t want this at all.

309
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,640
Sheng,

310
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,010
everyone

311
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,270
has his strong points,

312
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,400
and also

313
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,350
weak points.

314
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,940
You just haven’t found

315
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,740
the right place for yourself.

316
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,120
Just like

317
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,700
you?

318
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,290
I heard Lord Gantang is living
a secluded life

319
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,550
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

320
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,440
He is rarely out of the place.

321
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,480
You want him to come out?

322
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,400
Don’t you worry about this.

323
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,470
But this time you go there,

324
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,380
don’t alert

325
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,840
the leader, Li Jinrong.

326
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,840
Having the ability but not being in
the right position.

327
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,200
That’s what the mistake is.

328
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,380
I have been away from the position
I should be

329
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,620
for so long.

330
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,750
Dad.

331
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,550
Fei.

332
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,380
It’s OK. I’m here to stay with you.

333
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,970
Leader.

334
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,650
This song has disappeared

335
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,520
for so many years.

336
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,770
What should come will always come.

337
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,790
You can never avoid it.

338
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,090
Uncle,

339
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,180
have you heard of this song?

340
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,600
This song is called “Anping Song”.

341
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,480
I’m so familiar with it.

342
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,890
This song to me

343
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,460
is like an old friend.

344
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,910
It’s written when I was

345
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,480
following the uprising under Wang Lin.

346
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,550
Leader Li,

347
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,560
sorry to have kept you waiting.

348
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,000
I’m not as fast as your flute.

349
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,650
This is Anping Token.

350
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,960
Prosperous and flourishing country?

351
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,340
What a lie.

352
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,720
It didn’t help me relax here
a while longer.

353
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,220
<i>Prosperous and flourishing country</i>

354
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,660
Didn’t you say

355
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,230
you wouldn’t allow it to leave you?

356
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,150
I came a long way here

357
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,750
just to deliver the message.

358
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,800
This is just a small token.

359
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,560
Now the message has arrived.

360
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,580
It’s just a waste iron now.

361
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,060
Isn’t it to put the cart
before the horse

362
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,760
if I risk my life for it?

363
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,590
The message has arrived?

364
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,130
You really think you can

365
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:54,980
survive by only playing that song?

366
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,580
What should come will always come.

367
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,500
I think, Leader Li,

368
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,200
you must know the truth in mind.

369
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,800
Or, how could you even not dare

370
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,290
to let Lord Gantang come?

371
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,110
You think I don’t dare to kill you?

372
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,700
Jinrong.

373
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,630
You brat!

374
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,520
How dare you follow me?

375
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,220
So rude.

376
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,620
Come back here.

377
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,000
Greetings, Lord Gantang.

378
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,180
Spare it.

379
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,100
<i>Prosperous and flourishing country</i>

380
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,480
I have already paid a debt

381
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,790
of gratitude.

382
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,300
I’m just an errand boy.

383
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,030
I know nothing of your old grudges.

384
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,350
But,

385
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,620
if Lord Gantang doesn’t want to see me,

386
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,130
you don’t need to show up,

387
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,110
do you?

388
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,320
If I didn’t

389
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,310
hear your song at all,

390
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,950
what would you do?

391
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,910
That doesn’t matter.

392
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,710
The one who can’t hear my flute

393
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,090
is not the one I want to see.

394
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,730
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight got
really a beautiful view.

395
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,140
Even if I failed to meet you,

396
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,260
it’s still worth a trip here.

397
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,980
Now I’m just a loser out of touch
with reality.

398
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,160
Why bother coming to me?

399
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,230
It’s like a whale that beached

400
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,950
and a phoenix that lost its wings.

401
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,210
A small potato like me can’t understand.

402
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,760
Lord Gantang, please don’t ask me
about what I don’t know.

403
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,560
Young man,

404
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,600
you’re really good at talking.

405
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,230
I feel flattered.

406
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,930
A man like me

407
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,630
only has two strengths.

408
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,020
Running fast, and talking well.

409
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,420
Or, why should General Wang
send me here?

410
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,840
Don’t need to waste time with him.

411
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,000
<i>Repenting Hall</i>
Guards!

412
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,300
<i>Repenting Hall</i>
Take down this jerk!

413
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,180
Wait.

414
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,700
Jinrong.

415
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,560
Fei,

416
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:17,810
go ahead

417
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,210
and help me get the Anping Token.

418
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,580
<i>Prosperous and flourishing country</i>

419
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,250
Just go.

420
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,860
<i>Prosperous and flourishing country</i>

421
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,740
<i>Repenting Hall</i>

422
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,920
You have already decided, right?

423
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,990
I should have known it.

424
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,640
How could people like you

425
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,380
be willing to live in seclusion for
all this life

426
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,890
far away from the outside world?

427
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,270
Give it to your dad.

428
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,580
<i>Prosperous and flourishing country</i>

429
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,960
Jinrong! Jin…

430
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,130
Mr. Xie…

431
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,610
I think this is not your original name.

432
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,510
Where are you from?

433
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
I was born in troubled times with no
fixed residence.

434
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,260
Just an ordinary person.

435
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,080
What’s the point that whether it’s
my original name or not?

436
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,290
Hometown is also a foreign land.

437
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:31,930
Sheng,

438
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,270
Mr. Xie

439
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,330
is my guest.

440
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,700
Please take good care of him for me.

441
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,290
Thank you, Lord Gantang.

442
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,150
Have you arranged all the receptions
along the way?

443
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,960
Yes, General.

444
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,320
But Chunhui town is under the
Fortress’s management.

445
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,540
It’s hard for us to complete.

446
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,180
<i>Wen Yu Anping Army</i>

447
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,060
<i>Wen Yu Anping Army</i>
Tomorrow, we will go to the Fortress

448
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,390
to greet Lord Gantang.

449
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,440
Yes.

450
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,460
What did he tell you?

451
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,750
He said he would pass the Fortress
onto me.

452
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,790
I’m not asking you that.

453
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,930
What do you want to know?

454
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,260
Is he really leaving?

455
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,800
Didn’t you give him the token yourself?

456
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,290
So what?

457
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,170
It must be the token

458
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,660
which means he agrees to go out.

459
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,160
Since he has taken it,

460
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,850
he has to leave.

461
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,350
That’s because he is shy and

462
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,000
felt embarrassed to refuse in person.

463
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,130
So he accepted it temporarily

464
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,340
and said he would consider it.

465
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,950
He won’t leave.

466
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,040
Don’t tell my mom about this.

467
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,260
Why is the wine so sour?

468
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,970
It’s not like what I imagined.

469
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,660
Why do I think

470
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,140
the wine is sweet?

471
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,160
And that…

472
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,290
That man surnamed Xie.

473
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,290
He said here in our place,

474
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,950
even the dog could have good food.

475
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,120
The Mr. Xie you said

476
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,430
saved your life at Ximo River.

477
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,740
You even disobeyed your mom’s order

478
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,020
to save his life.

479
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,140
You can gratefully
tell right from wrong.

480
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,830
I really like that.

481
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,410
Dad,

482
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,760
are you really leaving?

483
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,720
Can you take me with you?

484
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,240
Every time when Mom beat me harshly,

485
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,580
I hope you can come to save me.

486
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,150
Your mom never beat you too harshly.

487
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,070
She already has shown mercy.

488
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,620
What a brat.

489
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,880
I just want to be a carefree person

490
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,340
with no worries.

491
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,680
I didn’t expect that

492
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,880
once in a while I was kind enough to

493
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,230
help General Wang Lin to send a message,

494
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,970
I still broke someone’s heart.

495
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,250
Little girls always have to grow up.

496
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,890
It’s weird.

497
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,850
I, as a passerby,

498
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,600
don’t want to leave now.

499
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,540
But, Lord Gantang,

500
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,630
you’re leaving with no cares.

501
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,930
People always part.

502
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,780
Rises and falls have no regulations.

503
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,100
Looks like you still haven’t
seen it through.

504
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,820
Childe, you are knowledgable,

505
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,190
good at martial skills,

506
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,230
and also keep your promise.

507
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,840
I wonder who your master is.

508
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,990
I still got other things to do.

509
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,050
Let’s just part here.

510
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,040
It’s a long way to the south.

511
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,400
Please take care.

512
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,820
I have been waiting for you
for more than ten years.

513
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,880
Finally, you are here.

514
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,340
Do you remember the money

515
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,010
you owed me for wine?

516
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,180
You haven’t paid back the money

517
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,010
I lent you for the songs as well.

518
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,160
I still remember it.

519
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:21,960
Dad,

520
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,860
please don’t leave here, OK?

521
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,450
What I have to do

522
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,970
is really important.

523
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,660
Is it more important than my mom?

524
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,000
Is it more important than me?

525
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:41,540
Stop her.

526
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:41,900
Yes.

527
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,440
Stop her.

528
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,900
Ms. Zhou,

529
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,500
I’m not a careful person.

530
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,140
I may hurt you.

531
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,860
Don’t make it hard for me.

532
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,300
Step aside.

533
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,520
Dad!

534
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,650
Take me with you!

535
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,710
I can protect you!

536
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,930
Fei,

537
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,120
stop fighting.

538
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,840
I have told you before that

539
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,840
you couldn’t have it both ways.

540
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,080
But today I just want to tell you

541
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
what is taking

542
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,220
and what is giving up.

543
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,460
To take or to give up doesn’t depend

544
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,290
on whether you admit

545
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,810
or not.

546
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,980
Because it’s the truth of the strong.

547
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,030
You should succeed in the civil

548
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,950
or the military.

549
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,920
Or you will just be a nobody

550
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,180
who has to live a life with no choices.

551
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,770
You won’t have the right to decide
whether to take or to give up.

552
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,600
It will be a shame.

553
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,950
You said you could protect me.

554
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,500
But you haven’t even tried

555
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,640
to step out of this gate.

556
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,190
Is it your turn to

557
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,450
decide whether to

558
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,570
go with me or stay?

559
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,000
Grow up.

560
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,740
We will meet someday.

561
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,560
The world is always there.

562
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,120
It depends on when you can come
and go freely.

563
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,590
Fei,

564
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,920
I’m leaving.

565
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,450
Dad…

566
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,290
Take care.

567
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,260
Dad…

568
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,750
Dad!

569
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,200
My mom was right.

570
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,660
I shouldn’t have saved you.

571
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,280
Get lost!

572
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,710
I didn’t expect that

573
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,910
you’d come in person.

574
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,280
It’s still in the boundary
of the Fortress.

575
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,330
Do you dare?

576
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,290
It’s been more than ten years.

577
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,950
My feud with the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight is so deep.

578
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,770
Now Lord Gantang comes out
of the seclusion.

579
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Of course I should come to greet him.

580
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,100
Then you should ask whether my sword

581
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,060
can allow you or not.

582
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,320
Li Jinrong,

583
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,640
we’ll see each other soon.

584
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,340
Meet you on the battlefield!

585
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:40,824
