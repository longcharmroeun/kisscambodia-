00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 17</i>

17
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,800
Why are you so nervous?

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,170
Aren’t you a hunter?

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,420
It hurts!

20
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,440
Your hands are really strong.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,180
-Your hands are really strong.
-Lord.

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
There are seven to eight obvious traps

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,870
within a hundred paces ahead.

24
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,400
As for the hidden ones…

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,680
See?

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
I didn’t lie.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,180
Change to another path.

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,220
Don’t delay our important matter.

29
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,510
How dare you say it’s a short cut
to Hengyang?

30
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,080
Bastard.

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,390
Let’s go.

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,540
Thanks.

33
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,910
See you.

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,560
Miss Wu, come out now.

35
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,880
Thanks for your help.

36
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,530
Is your injury all right?

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,620
Yes, it’s OK.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,950
Miss Wu!

39
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,120
General.

40
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,550
Who are you?

41
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,670
General, he helped me to hide

42
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,910
from the Demons.

43
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,000
Demons?

44
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,830
Thanks for your help.

45
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,270
May I have your name?

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,820
Not at all.

47
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,660
Miss Wu, where is your family?

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,830
Why is there only one man escorting you?

49
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,630
You know it?

50
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,340
General, don’t worry.

51
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,320
Since he knows me,

52
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
he must know the ropes.

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,860
He should be on our side.

54
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,390
I have to thank him for saving me.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
Sir,

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
let me give your sword back.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,910
Don’t say that.

58
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,670
It’s my duty.

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,000
I’m from the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

60
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,000
Our elders ordered us

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
to reinforce your family.

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,720
So I saw your portrait
before I came here

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
and recognized you.

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,550
I see.

65
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,980
Do you know Fei?

66
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,280
Of course!

67
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,060
You have met her?

68
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,120
Where are she and other people?

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,910
It’s a long story.

70
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,110
Fei is now in Hengyang city.

71
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,670
She asked this general

72
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,230
to send me back to Lord Gantang.

73
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,620
Lord Gantang?

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,600
You’re going to my uncle,

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,760
Zhou Yitang?

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,700
So, you’re Fei’s cousin?

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,730
Yeah.

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
Then, that’s to say,

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,600
you are

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,790
the nephew of Leader Li of the Fortress,

81
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,300
and the grandson of
the South Blade Li Zheng?

82
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,630
Yes.

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,480
That’s great! Mr. Li.

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,670
I’m Wen Yu,

85
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,130
vice-general of Lord Gantang.

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,040
Wen Yu, General Feiqing?

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
General Wen, just now

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,350
Gu Tianxian from the Demons Manor
appeared here.

89
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,510
We need to leave here now

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,230
or we may be in trouble.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,550
The one who came was Gu Tianxian?

92
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,880
Yes, I saw the token.

93
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,050
They came with unknown purposes.

94
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,040
Mr. Li, please come back with me

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,970
and tell this to Lord Gantang.

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
No, General Wen,

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,830
I heard that they were going to Hengyang.

98
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,110
I’m afraid
they will cause trouble there.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,880
I think you have to tell this

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,320
to my uncle first

101
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,710
and ask them to get prepared.

102
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,880
What about you?

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,720
It’s not far from the Fortress.

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,830
I can take Ms. Wu to hide while walking.

105
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,230
We can be back there soon.

106
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,110
It’s not proper.

107
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,670
One of you is General Wu’s daughter,

108
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,270
the other is Lord Gantang’s nephew.

109
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,790
I can’t put you in danger.

110
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,720
General Wen.

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,070
Our safety or the safety of people
in Hengyang,

112
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,870
which is more important?

113
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,550
General Wen,

114
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,410
Mr. Li is right.

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,830
We can’t let them have the chance.

116
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,350
If they want something in Hengyang,

117
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,990
the people there will be
in great danger.

118
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,460
What’s more,

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,790
Fei is also in Hengyang.

120
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,670
In this case,

121
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,480
you have to go back as soon as possible.

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,790
Be careful on the way back.

123
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,930
Miss Wu,

124
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,290
here you are.

125
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,230
Thank you, General.

126
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,830
See you. Take care.

127
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,680
Miss Wu, please.

128
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,020
<i>Hengyang</i>

129
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,470
Xie,

130
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,160
where are we?

131
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Fei, we are in Hengyang now.

132
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Hang in there.

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Sir, if you don’t need anything else,

134
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,670
I’m leaving.

135
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,640
Wait. Sir.

136
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,000
Have you ever heard

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,830
that there is a troupe in Hengyang?

138
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,350
Troupe?

139
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,620
I haven’t heard about it.

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,160
Why don’t you think carefully

141
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,330
if anyone once talked about it?

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,760
Come to think of it,

143
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,980
it really reminds me of something.

144
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,600
Days ago,

145
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,790
I heard some customers talking about it.

146
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,950
They said

147
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,350
there is an opera troupe,

148
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,070
which is originally

149
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,040
a native one here in Hengyang.

150
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,200
But they always perform out of the city.

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
Even though, they are still

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,510
so famous.

153
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,160
If you are not from a noble family,

154
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,510
you can’t even see their backs.

155
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,040
Do you know where they are now?

156
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,950
Look,

157
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,390
I’m just a waiter.

158
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,040
How could I know that?

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,650
Alright.

160
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,600
Help me find it out.

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,750
If you get any information,

162
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,480
I will give you a double.

163
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,530
OK! Thank you, sir.

164
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,670
Fei, are you alright?

165
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,510
Do you want to eat something?

166
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,670
Or you want some more sleep?

167
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,950
Why are you looking for that troupe?

168
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,880
Only the leader of the troupe,
Madam Nichang,

169
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,830
can help you with your injury.

170
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,600
You took the trouble to bring me here

171
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,040
just because only she can help me?

172
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,200
Alright. Don’t worry.

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,740
I’m not worrying.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,730
I’m not the one looking for her.

175
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,470
I guess Yun must be thinking

176
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,000
why such a mysterious person

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,390
should save you.

178
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,550
That’s a terrible name.

179
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,670
Stop calling me that.

180
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,440
You can still get angry?

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,150
That means you’re not really worrying.

182
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,470
Don’t forget that

183
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,510
I’m the famous Qian Suiyou.

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,320
Later

185
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,710
I will go meet them.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
What’s your relationship with

187
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,410
that leader?

188
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,830
Why are you so sure that

189
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,440
she can help you to save me,

190
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,030
a person she doesn’t even know?

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,230
Of course it will cost me a lot,

192
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,670
but they are just a bunch of opera girls

193
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,440
and they can’t do anything to me.

194
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,390
That’s right.

195
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,350
Yun is worrying that

196
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,510
to save you,

197
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,080
I would be forced

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,330
to marry those girls?

199
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,710
Go now.

200
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,520
Hurry up and return the name of Yun

201
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,350
to its rightful owner.

202
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,450
You’re still so fierce.

203
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,810
Alright, I will go find them right now.

204
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,710
Fei?

205
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,320
Fei.

206
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,400
Are you alright?

207
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,790
I’m OK.

208
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,700
Just go.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,570
OK.

210
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,820
Wait for me. I’ll be back soon.

211
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,770
Wait.

212
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,330
I can’t get in there like this.

213
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,340
<i>Chunsheng Rouge Shop</i>

214
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,840
This is the Qian Suiyou they know.

215
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,420
<i>Chunsheng Rouge Shop</i>

216
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,690
Mr. Wang.

217
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,280
Qian Suiyou?

218
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,180
Did you write any new script?

219
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,190
The price I can give you

220
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,010
is still the same.

221
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,590
I haven’t written any new scripts.

222
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,110
Please wait for a few more days.

223
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,110
I will come to you then.

224
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,840
I won’t break the rules.

225
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,790
Then, why are you here today?

226
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,880
I heard Yuyi Troupe has come back.

227
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
Where are they?

228
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
They are not in Hengyang.

229
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,670
You… You should go now.

230
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,670
Leave. Just leave.

231
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,840
Leave now! Go!

232
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,710
Mr. Wang…

233
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,110
-Don’t ask about them again.
-Mr. Wang…

234
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,230
<i>Chunsheng Rouge Shop</i>
Go now!

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,030
Mr. Wang!

236
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,550
Lord.

237
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Did you hear anything from Second Lord?

238
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,110
They are on the way.

239
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,150
We’ve been kept in touch.

240
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,840
Please don’t worry.

241
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,820
OK.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Waiter,

243
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,670
have you cleaned up the room upstairs?

244
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,880
They are still cleaning.
It will be ready soon.

245
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,550
By the way, is there

246
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,080
any troupe performing in Hengyang?

247
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,030
Troupe?

248
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,020
Why are people all asking about it?

249
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,640
Recently, there is a troupe

250
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,150
which was always out of the city

251
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,080
came back to Hengyang.

252
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,100
But no one knows where they are.

253
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,430
Wait.

254
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,150
Sir, what can I do for you?

255
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,030
You just said

256
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,550
that people all asked you that?

257
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,000
Who else

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,470
asked you about the troupe?

259
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,110
No. No one.

260
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,110
OK. I will tell you.

261
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,280
Lingyu.

262
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,710
There is no blood on Li’s body.

263
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,230
He died when someone broke his neck.

264
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Who is that bold?

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,550
Daring to hurt our people?

266
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,790
The Demons came to the city.

267
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,670
We have lost two secret services.

268
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,960
That’s why Master asked us

269
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,080
<i>Lingyu Yuyi Troupe</i>
to keep an eye on the other two.

270
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,590
Didn’t I tell you not to

271
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,550
slack off for a moment?

272
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,200
Li went into the room

273
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,470
to get some water.

274
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,440
We didn’t care about it at first.

275
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
Later we found something wrong

276
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,790
and came to the back alley,

277
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,640
but he had already…

278
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,150
Where is the Yuling Token?

279
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,020
It’s lost.

280
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,350
Go to report this to our master.

281
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,990
You can do this, can’t you?

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,280
Come back to me after
you deal with the body.

283
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

284
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,780
<i>Chunsheng Rouge Shop</i>

285
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
Mr. Wang?

286
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,220
<i>Chunsheng Rouge Shop</i>

287
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,810
Mr. Wang?

288
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,250
Mr. Wang!

289
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,550
Mr. Wang!

290
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,820

Lingbo!

291
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,700
<i>Lingbo Yuyi Troupe</i>

292
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,150
Lingyu…

293
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,400
Didn’t I tell you to keep an eye
on the Rouge Shop?

294
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,670
Something bad must have happened.

295
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,760
Come on.

296
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,290
Weird. Why is the door open?

297
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,640
Lingyu.

298
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,440
It’s all my fault. I got him killed.

299
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,400
It’s not the right time to say that.

300
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
Same cause of death with Li.

301
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,600
And all their tokens are missing.

302
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,190
Why are you here?

303
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,040
I came to give Mr. Wang

304
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,190
my new scripts.

305
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,400
Qian Suiyou?

306
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,560
But I got knocked out

307
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,230
right after I came in.

308
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,920
And then I found I was tied up
after I woke up.

309
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,220
Who is it? Did you see it?

310
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,100
No.

311
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,040
Please untie me first.

312
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,040
Wait.

313
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,110
Keep his hands tied. Untie his feet.

314
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,950
Why…

315
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Why is that?

316
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
Come back to Qiaoyun House with me

317
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,050
to see Madam Nichang.

318
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,200
Let’s go.

319
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,430
Move.

320
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,230
Miss, how long will we have to walk?

321
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,680
Why in such a hurry?

322
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,120
It’s only a few blocks away.

323
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,880
But I don’t have enough strength.

324
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,390
Qian Suiyou,

325
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,400
what’s your new script about?

326
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,950
A story happened on a battlefield.

327
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,110
Did you take it with you? Show me.

328
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,800
It’s with me.

329
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,040
Please take it yourself.

330
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,520
Nothing.

331
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,110
Nothing?

332
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
How could it be?

333
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,830
It’s impossible!

334
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,520
I haven’t even made

335
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,800
a copy of it yet.

336
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,680
Did I

337
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,520
drop it in the rouge shop?

338
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
How about

339
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,680
I go to find it with you?

340
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,760
Well…

341
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,590
It will be

342
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,350
a waste of time.

343
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,800
How about this?

344
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,110
Let me tell Madam Nichang

345
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,800
about the story first

346
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,760
to see if she likes it.

347
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,520
Now you

348
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,490
don’t worry about your new script?

349
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,320
Qian Suiyou, you can go now.

350
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,990
You’re not an old man at all.

351
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,640
Stop pretending.

352
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,950
Ouch! It hurts!

353
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,110
I…

354
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,760
I just make a living by this.

355
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,310
If it’s really like what you said,

356
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,880
the murderer couldn’t keep you alive.

357
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,040
So, when you got in there,

358
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,710
Mr. Wang had already died.

359
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,350
You hid in the corner

360
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,280
just to let the two of us find you

361
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,800
so you can go with us.

362
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,570
Say it! What’s your intention?

363
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,790
You don’t suspect me of killing him?

364
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,760
First,

365
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,640
you’re Madam’s old acquaintance.

366
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
I don’t think you have any motive
to kill him.

367
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Second,

368
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,110
I checked your pulse.

369
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,040
You have no inner force at all.

370
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,830
Mr. Wang is

371
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,040
stronger than you.

372
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Say it.

373
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,180
What do you want to do?

374
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,210
Since you’re from the Yuyi Troupe,

375
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,160
I will tell you the truth.

376
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,540
One friend of mine got seriously ill.

377
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,110
What does it have to do with us?

378
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,640
Only the Floating Palm of Madam Nichang

379
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,920
can save my friend.

380
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,470
Why should we save your friend?

381
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,060
I have the thing Madam Nichang wants.

382
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,950
Then, give me that.

383
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,800
I can give it to Madam for you.

384
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,180
You can’t go to our troupe.

385
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,280
Forget it.

386
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,400
Since you have nothing with you,

387
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,190
I will take the message for you.

388
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,480
Lingbo, let’s go.

389
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,120
Miss…

390
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,500
Lingbo!

391
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,590
Lingyu, it’s OK.

392
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,910
I just don’t want him to follow us.

393
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,400
In this case,

394
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,590
please forgive us for being rude.

395
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,040
Qian Suiyou, don’t pester us.

396
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,680
Figured cloth.

397
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,760
New cloth, have a look.

398
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,310
Figured cloth.

399
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,100
Please come and have a look.

400
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,180
<i>Qiaoyun House</i>

401
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,280
Qiaoyun House.

402
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,920
Thanks to you,

403
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,430
that knockout drop didn’t work on me.

404
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,760
But, please don’t cause trouble

405
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,380
at such a critical time.

406
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,710
Qian Suiyou?

407
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,840
That’s right.

408
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,060
There is no time for him now.

409
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,230
This time we found the track

410
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,310
of the Demons in advance.

411
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,630
But we still lost four secret services.

412
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,020
Looks like they

413
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,110
just came here for us.

414
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,280
These days we will check the guests

415
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,370
with Yuling Token strictly.

416
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,160
The Demons did that

417
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,780
only to show us

418
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,830
they have come.

419
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,400
Lord.

420
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,240
Any news of the troupe?

421
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,980
Lord,

422
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,880
we destroyed four secret services
of them

423
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,470
and got three Yuling Tokens.

424
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,560
And we caught three of their scouts.

425
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,360
But…

426
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,400
They all died?

427
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,470
They refused to say anything

428
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,070
and then committed suicide.

429
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,350
I’m incompetent.

430
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,720
I beg your pardon.

431
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,520
An opera actress

432
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,250
can even earn their loyalty like this.

433
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,910
Madam Nichang deserves her fame.

434
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,240
If I guessed it right,

435
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,460
only the leader of the Demons,
Shen Tianshu,

436
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,310
has the style to do things in this way.

437
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,710
Then, Master,

438
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,560
let’s cancel the performance today.

439
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,280
I’m afraid.

440
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,230
Don’t.

441
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,330
Just hold it as usual.

442
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,920
Yes, Master.

443
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,920
It’s all you can do.

444
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,820
Thank you, Lord.

445
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,580
But we lost the clue.

446
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,330
What should we do next?

447
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,730
Hengyang is such a big city.

448
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,810
If Nichang is on her guard,

449
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,180
it’ll be harder to find her.

450
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,230
Any flower?

451
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,520
No, thanks.

452
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,020
Have a look. Fresh flowers.

453
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,470
Fei.

454
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,760
Fei.

455
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Why did you get up?

456
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
I’m waiting for you.

457
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,190
Don’t worry.

458
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,160
I’m always lucky. I won’t die.

459
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,710
OK.

460
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,520
Let me take you to Madam Nichang now.

461
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,460

462
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,050
Lord, should we take actions now?

463
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
Keep an eye on them

464
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,590
to see where they are going.

465
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,210
Don’t alert them.

466
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,380
Yes.

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,170
But Fei can’t waste any time.

470
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,200

how long will she keep singing?

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,950

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,280

Please escape now.

-Hunted down by the Demons?
-The Demons are here?

535
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,710
-The Demons?
-Oh, no!

Welcome next time.

-Come on, let’s go.
-What a wet blanket.

543
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,050
Sir, you can come with me.

<i>Elegant and quiet courtyard</i>
Madam,

545
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,920
sorry for driving away your guests.

546
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,400
I had no other choices.

547
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,510
Please forgive me.

548
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,190
If not for the new scripts,

549
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,350
I will never let you go.

550
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,880
Am I right?

551
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,680
Qian Suiyou.

552
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,280
Madam, you do have sharp eyes.

553
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,190
I came today

554
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,640
for a life and death matter.

555
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,590
My sister got Yellow and Green Spirit
from Duan Jiuniang,

556
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,390
which can’t stay with her own power
in peace.

557
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,660
Only your Floating Palm can save her.

558
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,530
Qian Suiyou, I think you got confused.

559
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,320
Why should I save someone I don’t know?

560
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
As long as you can save her,

561
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,560
I can take any price.

562
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,560
Any price?

563
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,470
I’m afraid she is not your sister.

564
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,230
I didn’t expect you to be such
a spoony man.

565
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,000
Alright, I will just tell you directly

566
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,430
that no matter what you do,

567
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,620
I will never help her.

568
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,230
See them out.

569
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,030
Please.

570
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,880
Madam.

571
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,880
She is the heir of the South Blade.

572
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,380
Heir of South Blade?

573
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,010
Miss, let me ask you.

574
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,020
What’s your relationship with Li Zheng?

575
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,710
What’s your relationship with Li Zheng?

576
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,280
Fei.

577
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,660
He is my grandpa.

578
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,710
Master, if you want to save her,

579
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,680
if will cost most of your power.

580
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,280
It’s too dangerous!

581
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,470
Yeah, Master.

582
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,760
Now the Demons

583
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,000
are also after us.

584
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
You shouldn’t be in danger.

585
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,160
Enough.

586
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,920
Take them to the guest room.

587
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,950
Go now.

588
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,280
Please come with me.

589
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,000
Thank you, Madam.

590
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,880
Heir of South Blade.

591
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,520
The South Blade got an offspring!

592
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,120
Thank you.

593
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,640
I don’t want to be here.

594
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,040
Let’s leave.

595
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,710
It’s so cold.

596
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,780
No. Your inner forces are getting
messier and messier.

597
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,710
How do you feel?

598
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,760
So cold.

599
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,340
Do you feel better now?

600
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,040
Come in, please.

601
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,910
My master can’t save her.

602
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,020
Is this what your master said?

603
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Miss, what are you doing?

604
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,810
Please spare Yuyi Troupe.

605
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
If my master

606
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,670
lost most of the power to help her,

607
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,710
what should we do if the Demons

608
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,230
come to us?

609
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,280
Miss.

610
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,880
Please get up.

611
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,950
Miss.

612
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,630
Sorry to disturb you today.

613
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,840
I apologize.

614
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,660
My illness

615
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,300
is not that serious.

616
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,110
I will recover after some rest.

617
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,740
Thank you.

618
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,600
Fei!

619
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,230
Thank you, Miss.

620
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,080
We should go now.

621
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,930
Fei!

622
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,190
Since Madam said she would consider,

623
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,610
maybe she is willing to help you!

624
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,530
Why don’t we wait for a little longer?

625
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,840
You have seen that

626
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,120
the girls from Yuyi Troupe

627
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,600
tried to stop it several times.

628
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,950
It must be a risk for Madam Nichang

629
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,060
to save me.

630
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,120
We shouldn’t disturb her.

631
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,520
I know how you feel now.

632
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,080
I will also blame myself

633
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,320
if Madam gets into any trouble.

634
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
But you have to know that

635
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,890
ordinary injuries can be healed.

636
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,910
But nothing can help

637
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,880
if you lose your life.

638
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,180
Then…

639
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,660
No matter what,

640
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,250
let’s make the decision
after we talk with Madam Nichang.

641
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,880
Before that,

642
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,280
you can think carefully.

643
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,810
I will respect your decision.

644
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,390
Miss, I have some great medicine,

645
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,470
which is always used by Master.

646
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,080
If you like it,

647
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,540
Mr. Qian Suiyou can come with me
to take it.

648
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,870
Thank you.

649
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,600
Have some rest first.

650
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,490
I will be back soon.

651
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,450
Please.

652
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,330
Please.

653
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,230
Lingyu asked me to take them

654
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,940
all here for you to choose.

655
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,280
This is all I can do.

656
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,910
As the heir of the South Blade,

657
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,280
Miss Zhou has a heart of righteousness.

658
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,640
I really admire it.

659
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,960
I hope Miss Zhou can be safe and sound.

660
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,150
Where is that injured girl?

661
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,790
Take her to me.

662
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,600
Master,

663
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,910
for yourself

664
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,800
and the safety of the whole troupe,

665
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,190
please think twice!

666
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,840
This time is different.

667
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,870
Do you know

668
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,230
who the South Blade is?

669
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,630
I know.

670
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,120
It’s the famous master, Li Zheng.

671
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,530
Do you know that

672
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,840
if he didn’t save my life that year,

673
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,090
I would have already died?

674
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,450
Then our troupe wouldn’t exist,

675
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,180
let alone you.

676
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,520
But, Master…

677
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,230
Enough.

678
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,970
It’s fated that he saved me

679
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,140
and it’s also fated that I could save
her granddaughter.

680
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,190
That’s great.

681
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,780
Great.

682
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,540
Lingyu,

683
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,230
you’re my first apprentice.

684
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,030
You never let me down.

685
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,230
You are always the most obedient

686
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,870
and reasonable one.

687
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,950
I know you feel sad

688
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,830
and worry about the troupe.

689
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,770
But, Lingyu,

690
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,270
when you’re at my age,

691
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,340
you won’t

692
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,790
live for the

693
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,120
unknown future which may end
at any time you don’t know,

694
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,180
but for the past

695
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,430
and the concern in your mind.

696
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,560
No matter how tall the tree is,

697
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,220
its leaves will be withered and yellow
in late autumn.

698
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,170
Instead of struggling,

699
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,660
I’d rather fall to the ground and
become the mud early.

700
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,330
The future of the world

701
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,260
is up to you youngsters.

702
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,950
Lingyu,

703
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,030
stand up.

704
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,860
I have something to ask you.

705
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,120
Lingyu.

706
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,130
If without my protection,

707
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,320
can you take care

708
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,080
of the troupe alone?

709
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,360
Master,

710
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,800
I don’t want you to do this.

711
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,930
Don’t worry.

712
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,820
This is the worst case.

713
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,590
Alright.

714
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,560
Go to the secret chamber

715
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,940
and get that elixir out.

716
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,470
Master, are you going to give it

717
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,010
to Miss Zhou Fei?

718
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,580
Her illness is about the
two inner forces.

719
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,840
The elixir won’t work.

720
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,270
Then… you’re going to use it?

721
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,080
Master!

722
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,150
That elixir can recover your power

723
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,760
in a limited time,

724
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,800
but it’s just a temporary relief

725
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
which will result in disaster!

726
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,700
My master gave it to me.

727
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,040
Of course I know it.

728
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,850
I know the difficulty of Madam Nichang.

729
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,470
But Fei is in danger now.

730
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,120
I have no choice.

731
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,800
Fei,

732
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,940
I bring back the medicine for you.

733
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,200
Fei?

734
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Sir, what happened?

735
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,390
Miss Zhou is gone.

736
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,120
Did you see her?

737
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,360
How could she be gone?

738
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,840
Isn’t she waiting in the room for you?

739
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
She is not.

740
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,910
No more waste of time.

741
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,760
Master!

742
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,180
What’s wrong? Why so anxious?

743
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,920
Miss Zhou is missing!

744
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,950
She is really unyielding.

745
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,930
She even left by herself.

746
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,910
She is exactly the same as Li Zheng

747
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,320
with her stubborn temper.

748
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,950
Master, since she left by herself,

749
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,430
it’s not our blame.

750
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,430
You two,

751
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,840
go to help Qian Suiyou in secret

752
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,160
to find Miss Zhou.

753
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,370
It’s up to us whether to save her.

754
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,860
But it’ll be different if she is
missing in our place.

755
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

756
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,350
She left by herself?

757
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Interesting.

758
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,360
Fei!

759
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,180
I’m here.

760
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,230
Why are you here?

761
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,000
Can’t you just stop risking

762
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,050
your life?

763
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,710
People die every day in this world.

764
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,560
Maybe your life means nothing.

765
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,520
But if anything bad happens to you,

766
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,910
what will your family do?

767
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,080
What will I do?

768
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,600
I… I just don’t

769
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,710
want to bother them.

770
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,100
Sorry.

771
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,400
I was too anxious.

772
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,330
I shouldn’t have yelled at you.

773
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,080
It’s OK since you are safe.

774
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,120
Let’s go.

775
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,680
I…

776
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,450
Fei!

777
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,760
Madam.

778
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,150
How is she?

779
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,650
Come in with me.

780
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,380
Madam Nichang.

781
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,640
I’m afraid the healing
has to be delayed.

782

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Sorry that

784
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,470
I came tonight without an invitation.

785
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,120
I have long yearned for watching

786
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,980
the performance of your troupe.

787
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,180
This is really not a good time.

788
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,910
Mr. Shen, you’re too late.

789
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,360
If you want to watch performance
in the future,

790
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,800
I will deliver the Yuling Token to you
in person.

791
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,230
No. No. No.

792
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,910
It’s just the right time,

793
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,490
I think.

794
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,750
I’d like to ask you.

795
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,320
Yuyi Troupe never had anything
to do with the Demons.

796
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,170
Why did you kill my people?

797
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,800
Speaking of that,

798
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,040
I really admire it.

799
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,430
You had a bunch of loyal dogs

800
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,710
which have tight mouths

801
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,710
that I can’t open.

802
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,680
If they had told me your whereabouts
earlier,

803
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,910
they wouldn’t have died.

804
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,920
Luckily,

805
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,880
I met two people to lead me the way.
