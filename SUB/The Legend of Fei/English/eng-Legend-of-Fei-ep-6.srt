<i>Legend of Fei</i>

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,940
<i>Episode 6</i>

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,900
So, I sang it

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
completely wrong

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,170
from the very beginning.

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,860
Winter comes again at home.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,020
Winter comes again

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,240
at home.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,670
I have performed Crying for so long

24
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,540
but it is completely wrong.

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,960
What’s up?

26
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,080
Is he possessed?

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
Winter comes again at home.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,780
Leave him alone. Let’s go right away.

29
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,460
Go, go, go.

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Winter comes again at home.

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,360
I injured Mu Xiaoqiao seriously.

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
It is enough for you

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,160
to go to Huo’s Manor.

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,190
Remember,

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,160
don’t alert them.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay.

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
If you get any message,

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
come to Huarong and report.

39
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,440
Huarong?

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,000
Look, safe and sound, right?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,750
Come on,

42
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,960
if you have any problem,

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,800
how can I excuse myself with our leader?

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Enough.

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,550
It is very faraway here.

46
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,670
It must be safe.

47
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,880
Chenfei,

48
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,630
we are all poisoned now.

49
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,270
I suggest we take a rest here

50
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,630
and set out tomorrow.

51
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,830
It is just one day’s walk

52
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,520
to the nearest Huarong.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Why not take a rest there

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,270
and contact with our family and friends?

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,410
Good idea.

56
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,600
Fei,

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,270
come with me.

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,430
Let’s talk about the affairs
between you and Li Sheng.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:57,960
Go.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,960
I didn’t mean to ask for your opinions.

61
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,630
It is none of my business, Chenfei.

62
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,240
It is Li Sheng’s fault.

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,800
He wanted to leave home half a year ago.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
He must have planned it for long.

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,750
After I get him back,

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,630
my mother won’t be able to
find an excuse for him.

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
Both of you

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,270
have been troublemakers since childhood.

69
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,390
I have told you everything.

70
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,480
You have to handle it all

71
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,830
from now on.

72
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,950
Are you going to dump it on me again?

73
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,110
Fei,

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
go check on Miss Wu.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,160
I don’t think

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,270
she feels good after all the troubles

77
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,480
along the way.

78
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,390
Why not go and have a talk with her?

79
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,120
Me?

80
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,320
What can I talk to her?

81
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,710
Well…

82
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,000
You are girls.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
As a man,

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
how can I know
what you should talk with her?

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,440
Find a topic. Hurry up.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
Hurry up, go!

87
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,550
Fei!

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
What is this?

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,230
Little wooden knife?

90
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,600
You are too old for this!

91
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,110
If you really like it,

92
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,040
I will find a real one for you

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,270
in Huarong tomorrow.

94
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,200
You don’t have to.

95
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,400
It is for you.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,170
Why did you give me this?

97
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,360
What is the use of it for me?

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,160
Hey…

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
Chenfei asked me to talk to you.

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,110
May I know

101
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,910
your name?

102
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,070
My name is Chuchu.

103
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,320
I am Zhou Fei.

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,720
Just call me Fei.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Fei.

106
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,130
Where is your younger brother?

107
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,790
He is having a rest now.

108
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,950
Mr. Xie found such a quiet place for us.

109
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,490
Please express my thanks to him for me.

110
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,040
You are welcome.

111
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,200
He loves quiet things

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,230
like these.

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,900
Fei,

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,900
are you an acquaintance of Mr. Xie?

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,270
I met him some time ago.

116
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,250
It is the second time for me to see him.

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,920
As the old saying goes,

118
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,830
some people remain strangers even if
they have known each other for long;

119
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,510
some people are old acquaintances
even if they have just met each other.

120
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,400
Do you mean

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
we share the same rotten tastes?

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,510
No.

123
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,320
My father put this lock
on me personally.

124
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,440
When I was young,

125
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,200
they said I was destined
to die young and

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,720
needed something
to counter the ill fate.

127
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,270
I shouldn’t take it off

128
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,720
before marriage.

129
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,260
What is this?

130
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,220
It is a gift from others.

131
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,640
It isn’t easy to carry,
nor can I throw it away.

132
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,670
It is easier to wear it this way.

133
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,880
Do you know

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
any pendant on a girl’s neck

135
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,210
is certainly…

136
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,030
What?

137
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,910
Don’t you wear it, too?

138
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,600
Mine is different.

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,960
It is a gift from my parents.

140
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,920
It doesn’t matter.

141
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,150
Just wear it

142
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,030
if you like it.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,670
Chenfei said

144
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,270
it wasn’t easy for you
all the way along.

145
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,000
It doesn’t matter.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,030
When you reach my home,

147
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,400
you won’t feel scared anymore.

148
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,080
Your home?

149
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,520
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

150
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,910
What is it like there?

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
There…

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
I believe it is the happiest

153
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
and the best place there.

154
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,200
It is beyond my words.

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,470
You will know it when you get there.

156
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,110
How is your family?

157
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,800
My family…

158
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,550
My family…

159
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,930
My father

160
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,920
is a sick person.

161
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,680
My mother is a tigress.

162
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,110
My elderly male cousin
is a troublemaker.

163
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,880
My younger female cousin
is a silly girl.

164
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,760
But they

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,690
all have their strong suits.

166
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,710
For instance, my younger female cousin

167
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,690
never stops crying easily.

168
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,670
Even my stringent mother

169
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,550
is incredibly amicable

170
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,890
to her.

171
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,280
It is enough to have just

172
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,410
a handful of people like her.

173
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,210
Wherever there is a fighting,

174
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,640
just dispatch them there

175
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,200
and the two opposite rivals

176
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,470
will become pacified right away.

177
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,270
May I learn martial arts

178
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,200
after arriving at your home?

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,780
I can protect myself
in the future if so.

180
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,530
It seems impossible.

181
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,220
I know you started
to learn it as a child.

182
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,770
I am afraid I am too old for it.

183
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,830
Not at all.

184
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,350
You may not be comparable

185
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,470
with those who start
to learn it as a child.

186
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,470
But

187
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,740
you will at least be stronger than now.

188
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,640
My mother is a topnotch martial artist
at the Fortress.

189
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
But she is too busy normally.

190
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,990
Moreover,

191
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,330
she is a tough lady.

192
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,600
I recommend Ms. Wang.

193
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,710
She is kind and good-tempered.

194
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,090
She must wish to teach you.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,550
She is maternal great grandmother

196
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,400
of Chenfei
who has escorted you all the way along.

197
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,470
Run slowly.

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,200
I am

199
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,590
an accurate stargazer.

200
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,960
Look, we have escaped smoothly.

201
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,910
Your definition of “smoothly”

202
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,840
must be different

203
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080
from what it means usually.

204
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,320
Don’t be too demanding.

205
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,760
Look,

206
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,320
isn’t it good

207
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,350
to live healthily,

208
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,230
have full limbs,

209
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,280
eat and drink well

210
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,910
and go wherever you like to go?

211
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,880
It has nothing to do with you.

212
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,230
If I had followed your advice,

213
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,200
I would have fled at the very beginning.

214
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,470
It is a wise decision to flee then.

215
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,880
As I told you,

216
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,670
there must be some incidents soon.

217
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,350
If you had left as I had told you,

218
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,550
you wouldn’t have met
Shen Tianshu and others.

219
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,350
Although I would

220
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,350
have died earlier in that case,

221
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,710
it would be

222
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,840
a great merit on my part

223
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,910
to see a flower in blossom there.

224
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,740
I am too short

225
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,800
to be the flower in the tree.

226
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,070
Are you so petty?

227
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,760
Although the flower

228
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,860
is gone now,

229
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,110
I still have an imprudent bosom friend.

230
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,200
As the old saying goes,

231
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,260
it is much easier to get money

232
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,640
than a bosom friend.

233
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,910
It is still a good bargain for me.

234
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,470
Fei!

235
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,910
Meal time now!

236
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,110
Come on, sit here.

237
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,230
Fei, have some fish.

238
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,280
Wait, wait, wait!

239
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,370
Sit here, Fei.

240
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,110
Come and sit here.

241
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,470
I will have a good talk with Xie.

242
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,320
Okay? Come here.

243
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,350
Xie!

244
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,840
Come on, eat something.

245
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,200
Thanks.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,800
Come on, Fei, have this.

247
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,170
I have a question.

248
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,200
It is great luck that

249
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,150
we survived this battle
between Demons Manor and Phoenix.

250
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,710
I wonder if there will be

251
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,820
another disaster in the future.

252
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,890
You have a point.

253
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,790
What disaster

254
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,110
do you think we will encounter?

255
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,880
Huo’s Manor.

256
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,620
Exactly!

257
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,080
Demons come ferociously

258
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,970
and kill everybody in the way.

259
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,960
They want to kill Phoenix

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,280
certainly not for justice.

261
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,320
Only Huo’s Manor

262
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,790
deserves the personal trip

263
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,030
of Timber Wolf.

264
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,470
Listen,

265
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,280
Xie.

266
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,030
Thank you for your help this time.

267
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,370
I owe you my life.

268
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
May I know

269
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,640
your master?

270
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Sure.

271
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,030
I am just a sword maker.

272
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,840
I came to Huo’s Manor with my employer

273
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,910
but suffered this disaster accidently.

274
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,790
Sword maker?

275
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,470
It is just a way to make a living.

276
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,760
I have just changed my trade.

277
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,320
What is your previous trade then?

278
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,910
I used to be

279
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,990
a song writer.

280
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,990
Frankly,

281
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,910
the song sung by Phoenix

282
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,280
was composed by me.

283
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,760
Its name is

284
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,350
Departure Sorrow Pavilion.

285
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,230
It includes

286
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,280
nine chapters.

287
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,110
The Crying performed by him

288
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,320
is one of the chapters.

289
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,110
As one of my best works,

290
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,280
it used to be highly popular.

291
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,840
People of all ranks, from famous singers

292
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,470
to street performers,

293
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,760
can sing my song

294
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
in order to gain customers’ favor.

295
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,590
That sounds really marvelous!

296
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,820
Of course!

297
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,590
Xie!

298
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,120
Departure Sorrow Pavilion

299
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,160
was composed by Qian Suiyou,

300
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,350
wasn’t it?

301
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,880
But it is said

302
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,790
Qian Suiyou is a pretty girl.

303
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,500
But you…

304
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,160
I am good-looking indeed.

305
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,150
But I am absolutely

306
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,860
not a girl.

307
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,710
Some people even said

308
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,670
Qian Suiyou was an old man.

309
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:56,520
♪Whereabouts is nowhere to find♪

Qian Suiyou,

317
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,160
I didn’t expect to meet you here.

318
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,190
-I like you so much.
-Great!

319
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,280
I like you.

320
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,050
Chenfei!

321
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,510
Where did you hear this song?

322
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,990
Fei!

323
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,830
It is yours.

324
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,770
Fei!

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,490
Fei!

326
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,010
What are you doing?

327
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,060
What were you thinking about?
You just forgot yourself.

328
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,610
I wonder

329
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,760
when I can be strong enough

330
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,120
to battle against

331
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,560
either Demons or Phoenix,

332
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
like my mother.

333
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,710
It will come true one day.

334
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,210
You are the successor to South Blade
anyway.

335
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,900
No kidding.

336
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,070
When my mother was at my age,

337
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,050
she was already the leader
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

338
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,020
Her nine moves of Snow-breaking Blade
was invincible indeed.

339
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,340
Just think about me.

340
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,310
What can I do now?

341
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,310
People have

342
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,880
different life experiences

343
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,430
and different opportunities.

344
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,430
You have just started your career.

345
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,680
It is just a matter of time and chance

346
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,190
to be a lady like your mother.

347
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,870
Do you feel embarrassed

348
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,400
about the battle today?

349
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,180
Yes.

350
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,160
We have just left home

351
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,190
and we can move freely
in and out of the entrance.

352
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,800
But I’ll leave the sect someday.

353
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,190
Witnessing the battle between
Shen Tianshu and Mu Xiaoqiao,

354
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,200
I finally got the meaning
of a real master.

355
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,050
I am a far cry from the master

356
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,540
that my father told me.

357
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,150
I think

358
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,010
a free strong will

359
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,480
originates from heart

360
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,040
instead of civil

361
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,870
or martial virtues.

362
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,310
Of course,

363
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,440
you must firstly have
self-defense ability

364
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,470
against all the chaos
in the world of martial arts

365
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,010
before you can protect others.

366
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,690
The greater martial arts you have,
the better.

367
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,390
I think you are…

368
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,170
so much like my father.

369
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,880
Lord Gantang?

370
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,370
With excellent literary talents

371
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,190
and profound knowledge?

372
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,380
Nagging!

373
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,110
Okay, it is late.

374
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,790
Have a rest.

375
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,590
Thanks to brothers of
Fortress of the Forty-Eight for rescue.

376
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,710
I owe you my life
and I will pay you back in the future.

377
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,560
Chief Qin, you are welcome.

378
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Dear brothers,

379
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,100
things won’t change despite time.

380
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,810
See you in the world
of martial arts again. Good-bye.

381
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,710
Good-bye.

382
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,420
Miss Zhou,

383
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,200
I have something to talk to you.

384
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,420
Sir, what are you doing?

385
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,560
I am from the Qi School

386
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,310
and my Taoist name is Chongxiaozi.

387
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,400
Sorry for what I did just now.

388
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,830
Mr. Chongxiao,

389
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,160
what are you going to…?

390
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,350
Have you received any education?

391
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,070
I used to receive some education.

392
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,950
I have almost forgotten what I learned

393
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,180
but I can still read.

394
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,590
I have nothing special on me.

395
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,830
But they haven’t taken one thing
from me.

396
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,870
I think you have great intelligence.

397
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,850
So please accept this gift
upon departure.

398
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,040
Departure?

399
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,350
Sir!

400
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,590
See you!

401
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,200
See you, sir!

402
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,700
Thank you for your book.

403
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,310
This old Taoist is really a strange guy.

404
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,350
He has excellent martial arts which are

405
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,520
comparable with my grandmother.

406
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,040
I just don’t understand

407
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,950
why he

408
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,880
was put in the dungeon with us.

409
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,700
I am afraid he was

410
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,970
intentionally caught
and put in the dungeon.

411
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,520
Intentionally?

412
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,190
Do you want to know the secrets

413
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,520
behind it?

414
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
He must be heading towards

415
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,470
Huo’s Manor now.

416
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,590
Why is he going there again
since he has just returned from there?

417
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,760
I think he has gone there

418
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,560
as he is afraid
Huo’s Manor may be in danger.

419
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,590
Many people here

420
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,040
have been detained by Mu Xiaoqiao
because of Huo’s Manor.

421
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,880
He is a great martial artist.

422
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,110
But Huo’s Manor

423
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,560
has numerous people.

424
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,670
Will he be in danger?

425
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,280
Mr. Chongxiao is a great master

426
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
and has everything under control.

427
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:35,980
Okay,

428
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,740
forget it.

429
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,230
Keep it carefully.

430
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,070
Am I too ignorant?

431
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,050
Mr. Chongxiao gave me a book
as a gift upon departure.

432
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,330
What is the use of Tao Teh King?

433
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,560
Being ignorant isn’t a big deal.

434
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,110
What really matters is self-awareness.

435
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,310
Nonsense!

436
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,230
Miss Chuchu,

437
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
well…

438
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,070
Huarong isn’t far away from here.

439
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,190
Why not rush over there and have a rest?

440
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,950
Let’s set out.

441
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,190
Okay.

442
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,590
How about you?

443
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,160
I am used to roaming

444
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,950
with no plan.

445
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,770
I have a good idea.

446
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,470
Xie,

447
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,230
I suggest

448
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,660
you go to Huarong with us. Alright?

449
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,880
Okay,

450
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,650
thank you for your invitation.

451
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,920
But I wonder

452
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,220
if Miss Zhou is fed up with my babbling.

453
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,880
It is okay with me. I am used to it.

454
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,430
I don’t mind having a chatterbox
with me.

455
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,980
How can you say that, Fei?

456
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,350
She is always like this.

457
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,310
On the way, we can talk about…

458
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,310
Qian Suiyou!

459
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,160
Exactly! Okay?

460
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,520
<i>Huarong</i>

461
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,470
Good!

462
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,690
Flower umbrella.

463
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,680
Good!

464
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,320
Flower umbrella.

465
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

466
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,760
Good!

467
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,520
-Please!
-Please!

468
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,350
Give me some food.

469
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,590
It is strange

470
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,520
why there are so many migrants

471
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,900
among the crowd.

472
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,910
Has anything happened unexpectedly

473
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,820
other than the misconducts
of Huo’s Manor?

474
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Boss!

475
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:26,800
What would you like?

476
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Give me some pancakes.

477
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,580
Okay.

478
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,960
Come on, here you are.

479
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,880
Mr. Xie.

480
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,950
Thanks.

481
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,250
Miss Chuchu.

482
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,180
Come on, here you are.

483
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,270
What’s up, Fei?

484
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,950
I wonder

485
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,070
if Li Sheng the scamp

486
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,310
has returned.

487
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,470
If I encounter him again,

488
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,400
I will tie him up and deliver him back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

489
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,540
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

490
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,230
<i>Insightful and Open-minded</i>

491
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,350
Ma’am, this is my report for you.

492
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,200
I shouldn’t have allowed

493
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,470
the two troublemakers
to leave the Fortress.

494
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
Ma’am,

495
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,620
just take it easy.

496
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,880
Fei and Sheng

497
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,190
have excellent martial arts

498
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,650
among their peers.

499
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,280
I think they
are still adapting themselves

500
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,680
to the new world around them

501
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
as it is their first trip outside.

502
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,710
Maybe Ms. Wang

503
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,830
has found them both.

504
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,940
Notify our secret agents near Jingzhou
to assist in the search.

505
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,450
I will punish them seriously

506
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,650
when they are back.

507
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,140
Yes.

508
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,360
Your generation

509
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,310
is actually

510
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,800
well protected

511
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,520
by the leader.

512
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,950
But

513
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,520
it is never so easy as you imagine

514
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,410
to make a career in the world
of martial arts.

515
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,070
Actually,

516
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,520
you are making competitions
with Fei inside.

517
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,700
I…

518
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,230
Tell me,

519
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,830
would you still run away

520
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,760
if you were chased

521
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,190
by other brothers that day?

522
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,560
Maybe I haven’t reached

523
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,620
the level you said.

524
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,140
I know.

525
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,620
My aunt thinks that she owes me

526
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,400
for my father’s death.

527
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,170
Frankly,

528
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,690
I blame Fei.

529
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,920
But after I grow up

530
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,020
and become more reasonable,

531
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,780
I don’t hate Fei anymore

532
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,900
actually.

533
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,000
You are cousins.

534
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,020
There shouldn’t be any hatred
between you.

535
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,130
But what I just can’t tolerate is that

536
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,030
Fei’s moderation

537
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,830
to me

538
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,950
for my father

539
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,640
is actually a contempt of me.

540
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,470
She always complains about
Aunt’s favor for me.

541
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,880
Is that really kind of favor for me?

542
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Has she taught me
the Snow-breaking Blade?

543
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Leader will teach you sooner or later.

544
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,460
Come on,

545
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,470
you are the elderly cousin.

546
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,820
You shouldn’t envy your cousin,
should you?

547
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,710
Moreover,

548
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,640
the Fortress

549
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,560
will be passed down to you
in the future.

550
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,000
Hey, check this one.

551
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Do you like it?

552
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,880
Chuchu.

553
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,920
Fei.

554
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,230
What are you checking now?

555
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,590
Nothing special.

556
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,000
Where is Chenfei?

557
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,230
He is over there.

558
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,350
Let’s go.

559
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
They are all so beautiful!

560
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,430
Which one do you want?

561
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,000
I want to have them all.

562
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,350
Chenfei!

563
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,350
What are you looking at?

564
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,560
You have come just in time.

565
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,520
Help me check

566
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,920
which one is more beautiful.

567
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Chenfei,

568
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,470
do you plan to give it

569
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,710
to a girl as a gift?

570
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,590
Actually, I plan to give it

571
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,470
to my fiancée.

572
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,520
Are you going to be married?

573
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,950
Congratulations!

574
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,800
Thanks, thanks!

575
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,190
Congratulations, Chenfei!

576
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,050
No more congratulations.
Just pick the right one for me.

577
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,190
Can you find the difference?

578
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,230
Yeah,

579
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,620
I know it is useless to ask you.

580
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,680
I suggest

581
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
you buy this one.

582
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,230
I think

583
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,520
all of us at the Fortress
are martial artists.

584
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,760
This one

585
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,790
looks modest

586
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,590
with delicate details.

587
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,520
I wonder if Chenfei’s fiancée

588
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,510
would like it.

589
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,390
Let me check it carefully.

590
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,520
It is a good one.

591
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,350
Chuchu really has a good eye.

592
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,170
Okay, this is the right one.

593
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Boss,

594
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,350
also this one.

595
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,040
Okay.

596
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,800
How much?

597
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,560
Ten bucks in total.

598
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Come on, here you are.

599
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,070
Okay, here you are.

600
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,680
Thanks.

601
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,470
Fei,

602
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,100
this is for you.

603
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,830
I know you like blades.

604
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,210
You can hang it on the handle.

605
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,640
Because I hope to be your good brother.

606
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,770
It depends on your performances.

607
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,700
Treat me better in the future.

608
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,620
<i>Huarong Inn</i>

609
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,260
<i>Huarong Inn</i>

610
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,350
<i>Huarong Inn</i>
Long time no see.

611
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,120
<i>Huarong Inn</i>
How are you?

612
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,620
<i>Huarong Inn</i>

613
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,950
Dear all,

614
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,720
this way, please.

615
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,670
Fei,

616
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,900
can you be my master?

617
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,760
I can teach you every day

618
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,890
after we return to the Fortress.

619
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,390
Boy,

620
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,920
this lady is a tough girl.

621
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,850
I hope you won’t…

622
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,010
Look,

623
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,720
she never hesitates to bully others.

624
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,040
Ouch!

625
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,880
I won’t cry

626
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,220
because I am a man.

627
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,170
Okay, okay.

628
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,320
You are already a man.

629
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,490
Dear all,

630
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,870
the guestrooms are ready
on the second floor.

631
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,310
Take the guests upstairs for a rest.

632
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,820
Yes.

633
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,880
This way, please.

634
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,940
Please.

635
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,980
<i>Liquor</i>

636
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,160
I will prepare

637
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,760
carriages for you.

638
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,370
Xie,

639
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,950
frankly,

640
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,190
this inn

641
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,520
is our secret station.

642
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,070
It has done a good job.

643
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,700
I see.

644
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
I don’t think Huarong is safe enough.

645
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,000
After the preparations,

646
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,700
let’s set out as soon as possible.

647
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,350
Let go of me.

648
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,800
Come here.

649
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,430
Let go.

650
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,470
How dare

651
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,520
you rascal do this

652
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,630
in public!

653
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Fei,

654
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,000
don’t make things worse.

655
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,470
Give him to me. I will drive him away.

656
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,830
Do you know who I am?

657
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,230
Give some convenience, bro.

658
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,830
Just calm down.

659
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,680
I suggest

660
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
both of you make a compromise.

661
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,600
It is no use talking
to such a rascal.

662
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,560
I will punish him.

663
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,120
Wait, stop.

664
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:03,840
Let go of him.

665
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,280
Wait, wait.

666
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
Are you of the same gang?

667
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,080
Dear all,

668
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,800
he is the son of Governor Zhu.

669
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,800
Can the son of the county governor
do anything he wants?

670
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,080
Isn’t there any rule of law?

671
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,950
I am the law.

672
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,630
You are really strong

673
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,360
and pretty.

674
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,800
Let go of me.

675
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,360
We can have a good chat.

676
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,600
She is really pretty.

677
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,150
You have a good eye indeed.

678
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,470
Calm down, calm down.

679
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,520
Please calm down first.

680
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,060
Calm down, calm down.

681
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,360
Are you okay?

682
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
Never mind.

683
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,710
I am not familiar with them.

684
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,670
Sir,

685
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,700
I don’t think you have seen
the real beauty.

686
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,670
I have

687
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,370
pretty girls from Wangchun Brothel.

688
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,960
Do you have any interest?

689
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,920
Go.

690
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,520
Let’s meet at

691
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,160
Long Time No See Winery.

692

Why did you come here, Lord?

your personal care.

report to you?

745
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,800
Sorry, Lord.

Since you are here,

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,230
I must provide my due services to you.

748

Just tell me what I can do for you.

749

you don’t want to let me know.

751
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,450
Impossible.

752

you can do whatever you like in Huarong.

and inquire about the whereabouts
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

Yes.

looking for the same people as we are…?

He is searching
for the dependants of Wu Fei.

What did you pay for it?

797

I paid it with some songs.

Honor a bosom friend with liquors.

What are you thinking about?

811
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,320
I was really too silly then.

812
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,160
I thought my father would take me out.

813
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,190
But he left alone

814
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,340
soon after that.

815
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,870
Considering your mother’s personality,

816
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,360
it must have taken you great efforts

817
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,440
to leave the Fortress.

818
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,600
It is much harder
than asking your father

819
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,410
to take you out directly.

820
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,280
But I didn’t expect

821
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,910
the world was so different outside.

822
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,960
Yesterday I was upset

823
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,920
for a long way to go
to be a true master.

824
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,490
But I was more deeply impressed by

825
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,480
so many homeless migrants
in the city today.

826
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,910
It is really a tragic world

827
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,150
that is beyond the control of my father,

828
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,560
General Wu Fei and other warriors.

829
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,880
You know it well.

830
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,570
So the world of martial arts

831
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,550
needs our new generations of people

832
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,190
and you are one of them.

833
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,290
I finally realize

834
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,180
the missions and burdens

835
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,380
imposed on a hero.

836
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,620
Who on earth are you?

837
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,150
What is

838
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,500
your relation with

839
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,640
General Wang Lin?

840
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,110
Why does he trust you so much?

841
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,630
Why did he invite you

842
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,710
into the Fortress

843
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,710
even if you knew nothing

844
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,940
except footwork?

845
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,060
How do you know I know nothing?

846
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,320
I can also

847
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,600
make swords.

848
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,670
I also know…

849
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,230
I know.

850
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,760
You can also compose songs

851
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,060
and help with the makeup
of a pretty girl.

852
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,200
Sure.

853
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,540
As the old saying goes,

854
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,230
jewelries at a time of prosperity

855
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,300
and songs at a time of chaos.

856
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,700
The harder it is to make a living,

857
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,950
the more money a song composer

858
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:37,910
can make.

859
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,910
When it comes to martial arts,

860
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,630
I don’t have a great ambition

861
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,660
because I don’t want to rule the world.

862
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,280
<i>Liquor</i>

863
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,630
<i>Liquor</i>
I didn’t expect

864
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,950
<i>Liquor</i>
your ambition was limited only to

865
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,950
<i>Liquor</i>
escaping skills.

866
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,550
It is of course an ambition.

867
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,320
Look.

868
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,000
I can escape
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

869
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,430
and the dungeon smoothly.

870
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,460
It is a big ambition already.

871
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,380
But Fei,

872
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,960
I wonder

873
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,630
if your mother will kick me out again

874
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,790
if I go to the Fortress

875
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,050
with you this time.

876
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,870
I don’t think so.

877
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,960
I don’t have another father
for you to take away.

878
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,160
I am just afraid

879
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,020
she may worry about
what is even more valuable to her.
