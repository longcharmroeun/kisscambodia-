<i>Episode 5</i>

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,050
I’m going to save them.

19
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,190
Wait.

20
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,720
So many martial artists are locked here.

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,710
How can you save them?

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,850
Simple. Get them all out.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,120
Young lady,

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,720
the situation is complicated
and dangerous.

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,690
There isn’t much you can do

26
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,980
on your own.

27
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,330
Well,

28
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,140
I can tell you about the layout

29
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,230
and the posts.

30
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,760
How did you know all that?

31
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,240
You think I’d wait to rot in here?

32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,920
This lock couldn’t stop me.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,300
I’ve gone out more than once.

34
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,320
If so,

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,510
why didn’t you help others?

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,690
Have you forgotten

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,210
I’m poisoned?

38
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,400
I mean,

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,580
how could I rescue others?

40
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,050
Look, we’re in a two-story

41
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,330
heavily guarded dungeon.

42
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,910
If you

43
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,470
can make it here,

44
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,260
you’ll be able to get out.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
Got it?

46
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,600
Weed Spirit! Weed Spirit!

47
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,630
Weed Spirit!

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,490
How did you get in?

49
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,930
Am I good?

50
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,010
Open it!

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,060
The routes you drew are too messy.

52
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,630
I can’t see them clearly.

53
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss,

54
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,000
can you read a map or not?

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,400
It’s about time.

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,260
Hurry up.

57
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,430
Be quiet!

58
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,450
This dungeon is filled

59
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,450
with prisoners from top to bottom.

60
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
Guards change shifts every two hours

61
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,920
when the clapper sounds.

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,450
I see.

63
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,120
By the way,

64
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,140
if you run into

65
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,000
someone in red,

66
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,140
just leave immediately.

67
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,910
Do not hesitate.

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,220
Those old fogies

69
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,100
have been to hell and back.

70
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,930
They’ll sure get themselves out.

71
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,530
Stay out of trouble.

72
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,960
Just go home

73
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,170
and tell your seniors

74
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,340
to ask the Huo’s for your people.

75
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,750
Don’t worry.

76
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,370
At this point,

77
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,820
Huo Liantao wouldn’t say no
to your leader.

78
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,960
He’ll certainly

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,500
release Chenfei.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,790
Then what?

81
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,370
What about you?

82
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,880
Last night, the stars showed

83
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,140
chaos would soon rise.

84
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,920
Just pretend you don’t know anything.

85
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,340
Find the ones you’re looking for

86
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,570
and leave.

87
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,100
Why are you staring at me?

88
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,040
I have principles.

89
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,780
I’d never ask a girl

90
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,970
to take any risks.

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,640
I enjoy staying here.

92
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,510
The three of us are having fun.

93
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,510
I can stay for two more months
without feeling lonely.

94
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,820
Why is there the three of you?

95
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,890
The blazing sun,

96
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,220
the clear sky,

97
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,450
and me.

98
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,030
Are you sure it’s not
stone, sand and you?

99
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,360
You’re too sick

100
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,340
to be cured

101
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,960
I guess.

102
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,730
Hey.

103
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,360
Once

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
I’m out

105
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,490
and you aren’t home yet,

106
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,790
I’ll join you.

107
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,330
There’s something important
that you should have.

108
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,880
Last time,

109
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,370
although I was ordered

110
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,120
to break into your place,

111
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,770
your parents were
separated because of me.

112
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,510
And your blade was broken, too.

113
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,160
I’m surprised you still remember that.

114
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,300
It’s always been on my mind

115
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,140
and I’m planning to make you a new one.

116
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,750
But

117
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,990
the materials are still lacking.

118
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,130
So

119
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,630
I can only give you
a wooden one for now.

120
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,830
The real one has to wait.

121
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,320
Are you...

122
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,930
Are you not leaving with me?

123
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,370
The two of us will make a bigger target.

124
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,020
The guards have already been alerted

125
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,020
when you came in.

126
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,120
They’re after you as we speak.

127
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,010
Relax.

128
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,100
I’m blessed.

129
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,940
You should

130
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,570
leave without me.

131
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
At least, you can be the messenger.

132
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,460
You can’t die

133
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,740
before paying off your debts.

134
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,550
I know.

135
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,260
I wasn’t taught to be a deserter.

136
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
How could I go back

137
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,800
without finding them?

138
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,890
Besides...

139
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,630
I didn’t expect to see her here.

140
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,230
That girl is

141
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,230
a real troublemaker.

142
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,260
Is she out yet?

143
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,420
Let’s go.

144
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,860
OK. Coming.

145
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,830
Guards change shifts every two hours

146
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,780
when the clapper sounds.

147
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,940
At that time,

148
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,350
guards of the first shift
will pass by the pavilion and leave.

149
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,540
Is there anything wrong?

150
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,170
No.

151
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,160
Their replacements

152
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,230
will patrol around briefly.

153
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,120
At that moment,

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,150
the post will be left empty.

155
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,840
You can go there.

156
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,550
If they see me,

157
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,210
I’ll fight my way out.

158
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,590
Let’s go.

159
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,010
Come on.

160
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,240
Coming.

161
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,380
There might be antidotes here.

162
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,410
Those bastards

163
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
are treating themselves so well

164
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,480
while feeding others poison.

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,960
Take that way to search.

166
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,300
Go.

167
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,810
Go over there.

168
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,000
Let’s go.

169
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,450
That’s a strong force.

170
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,850
He looks

171
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,740
weaker than Father.

172
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,740
Thank you.

173
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,580
Sir...

174
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:27,920
are you...

175
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,260
are you alright?

176
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,840
Who are you?

177
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,860
What are you doing here?

178
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,360
You’re the one

179
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,360
they’re looking for, aren’t you?

180
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,110
One of my cousins

181
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,990
were caught

182
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,250
on an outing.

183
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,220
I’m here to look for him.

184
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,220
Sorry for disturbing you.

185
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,750
Who taught you your skills?

186
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,620
They were created by my ancestors.

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,860
My parents and I

188
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,070
don’t take them too seriously.

189
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,130
I only practice them for health.

190
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,150
And our family is small

191
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,640
even with two more cousins,

192
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,410
unlike those prestigious sects.

193
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,380
Sir,

194
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,980
are you sick?

195
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,700
My...

196
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,510
My father is just like you.

197
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,650
He’s in poor condition.

198
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,300
A little cold

199
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,880
could make him cough all day.

200
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,330
I wonder

201
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,980
if he’s taken

202
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,420
good care of.

203
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,300
I’m fine.

204
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,890
I’ve had it for years.

205
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,650
Sir,

206
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,350
I took this from the post.

207
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,200
It’s for those guards

208
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,110
and isn’t poisoned.

209
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,180
They drug

210
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,710
your food

211
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,540
every day.

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,390
It’ll worsen your condition.

213
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,160
You are already in poor health.

214
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,840
Try to eat their food
as little as possible.

215
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,160
Do you know

216
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,970
where your cousin is kept?

217
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,530
No.

218
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,400
And you still came regardless?

219
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,870
Don’t you know who owns this place?

220
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,650
I don’t.

221
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,690
Have you heard of
the Four-guardian Mountain?

222
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,220
What do you think

223
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,620
an ignorant kid like you can do?

224
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,730
Your family must be desperate.

225
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,740
Who is he?

226
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,660
He’s old

227
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,150
and mean.

228
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,020
Four-guardian Mountain

229
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,930
was home to the evil

230
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,090
headed by four leaders,

231
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,650
claiming to be
the Four Guardians of the World.

232
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
Truth is,

233
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,250
they were a bunch of notorious villains,

234
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,700
who threw the world into turmoil.

235
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,860
Later, internal strife appeared

236
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,280
when they came at each other

237
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,540
and they disbanded.

238
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,700
In the end,

239
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,270
Phoenix and his followers

240
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,840
settled down in Jingzhou

241
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,390
and attached themselves to the Huo’s.

242
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,050
Phoenix,

243
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,680
Mu Xiaoqiao,

244
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,140
once defeated

245
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,140
three top masters of the Mount Tai Sect

246
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,070
within half an hour

247
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,960
and left safely under everyone’s watch.

248
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,900
He sounds like a real piece of work.

249
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,180
I must be careful.

250
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,490
Why don’t I go get the antidotes first?

251
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,890
You see what you got yourself into?

252
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,280
You won’t always be this lucky.

253
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,070
Get lost.

254
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,560
Thank you.

255
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,730
The kitchen.

256
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,130
The food must be poisoned

257
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,360
in the kitchen

258
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,190
where people come and go.

259
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,610
Their own people might

260
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,080
take the poisoned food by mistake.

261
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,890
So they must have the antidotes.

262
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,780
That chef

263
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,990
may lead me to them.

264
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,770
Lord,

265
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,180
just now...

266
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,810
That’s alright.

267
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,240
It won’t

268
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,380
affect anything.

269
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,170
Are you sure Phoenix is here?

270
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,430
Yes.

271
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,940
Good.

272
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,080
My time is worth it.

273
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,780
Stick to the plan.

274
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,450
Once Tong Tianyang arrives,

275
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,270
kill Mu Xiaoqiao first.

276
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,230
Huo Liantao is nothing.

277
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,090
Seize him

278
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,180
and make him talk.

279
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,160
Yes.

280
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,140
Hold on.

281
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,580
If you happen to

282
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,380
see that girl,

283
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,050
don’t kill her.

284
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,700
Look what I’ve found!

285
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,620
Didn’t I ask you to leave?

286
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,850
Why are you back again?

287
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,390
Open it.

288
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,060
Come in.

289
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,830
I don’t know what they are.

290
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,830
Have a look.

291
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,170
This is...

292
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,040
the Heat-proof Pill.

293
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,270
Kill-all Poison.

294
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,700
Styptic Powder.

295
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,360
What’s this?

296
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,420
Arsenic.

297
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,160
None of them is the antidote.

298
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,090
What’s this?

299
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,510
Aphrodi...

300
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,430
Where did you get all these?

301
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,600
Did you empty their stash?

302
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,380
What’s the last one?

303
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,550
Uh...

304
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,180
Well...

305
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,240
That’s...

306
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,730
a kind of sauce.

307
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,770
You don’t need to know.

308
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,210
Not this one.

309
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,110
It’s not any of them.

310
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,950
Where could the antidotes be?

311
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,340
Does Mu Xiaoqiao take them with him?

312
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,840
Who told you about him?

313
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,110
Bad news! Bad news!

314
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,340
Someone broke in.

315
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,850
Who else is here?

316
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,390
Go!

317
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,030
Bad news! Bad news!

318
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,740
What happened?

319
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,920
Is Fortress of the Forty-Eight here?

320
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,770
No, it’s worse.

321
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,570
It’s the Demons.

322
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,430
They’re right outside.

323
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,990
We’re asked to battle them.

324
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,050
Let’s go!

325
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,810
Go!

326
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,580
Oh, no!

327
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,160
The situation is worth than I thought.

328
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,090
Where should we go?

329
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,590
Go against the crowd.

330
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,540
Mu Xiaoqiao must be out battling them.

331
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,970
Let’s go to his room.

332
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,720
Let’s go.

333
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,510
This way.

334
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,200
Other than people of
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

335
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,610
those of the Demons Manor sneaked in

336
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,020
right under your nose, too.

337
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,190
What else could you do?

338
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,280
Who is it?

339
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,480
Report!

340
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,070
Phoenix asked me

341
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,740
to fetch that thing in his room.

342
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,710
Go ahead.

343
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,440
Yes.

344
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,460
Found it.

345
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,180
Is this the antidote?

346
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,110
How much should one take?

347
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,840
Smelling it is enough.

348
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,470
Too much of it is lethal.

349
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:49,860
Let’s go!

350
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,100
Hold on.

351
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,110
What’s that?

352
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,600
Oh, no!

353
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,600
They’re going to blow up this place.

354
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,540
Help! Somebody help!

355
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,090
Help! Let us out!

356
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,920
Help!

357
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,700
Help!

358
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,400
This is the antidote.

359
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,940
Thank you.

360
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,960
Smell it.

361
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,850
Come out.

362
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,540
Hurry up and leave

363
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,520
as soon as possible!

364
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,740
Let’s go!

365
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,260
Where are you going?

366
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,060
Li Sheng and Chenfei

367
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,880
aren’t here.

368
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,900
I need to find them.

369
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,980
Over there.

370
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,800
This way.

371
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,570
Go, go, go!

372
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,350
Hurry!

373
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,850
Let’s go!

374
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,620
-Come on.
-Let’s go.

375
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,510
This way.

376
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,930
Let’s go. Hurry up!

377
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:27,880
Go!

378
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,210
This way.

379
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,940
Don’t worry.

380
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,320
Judging by your cousin’s look,

381
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,290
he still has many years to live.

382
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,290
Even if he’s got the look,

383
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,290
if Phoenix captures him,

384
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,470
he’ll be...

385
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,360
Huo Liantao!

386
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,380
This way.

387
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,590
-It’s him!
-It’s him!

388
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,020
Huo Liantao, you bastard!

389
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,020
Come out now!

390
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,320
You know him?

391
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,200
We met before.

392
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,460
Demons may

393
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,460
kill everyone

394
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,410
in this place,

395
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,990
including us.

396
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,910
Just leave

397
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,690
when you still can.

398
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,560
This way.

399
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,070
Why are you following me?

400
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,640
If you won’t leave,

401
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,220
then take the antidote

402
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,570
to those deadbeats.

403
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,470
I’m off.

404
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,350
Sure.

405
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,110
Give it to me.

406
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,820
Seriously,

407
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,340
do you know what’s happening?

408
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
Demons and Phoenix are all here.

409
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,020
Do you want to die?

410
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,110
I can’t abandon Li Sheng

411
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,360
and Chenfei.

412
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,920
If I leave

413
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,810
without them,

414
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,930
my mother will kill me.

415
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,930
I’ve made a promise.

416
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,480
Hey,

417
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,480
is she really your mother?

418
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,790
Does some promise weigh more
than your life?

419
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,860
Yes!

420
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,950
You’re right.

421
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,780
A promise should be kept.

422
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,000
No one’s life

423
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,720
is more valuable than others’.

424
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,390
Let’s go

425
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,000
and get all those poor bastards

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,900
out of jail.

427
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,630
The rest is up to heaven.

428
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,970
And we won’t have any regrets.

429
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,250
You’ve finally manned up for once.

430
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,620
Who’d know a long-legged

431
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,890
heartthrob like me

432
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,590
would make friends with a dwarf?

433
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,550
What are the odds?

434
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,030
Why am I a dwarf?

435
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,540
You aren’t even as tall

436
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,060
as my legs, shorty.

437
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,610
Master.

438
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,890
Where’s Phoenix?

439
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,650
There’s no sign of him.

440
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,030
He’s here.

441
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,180
Phoenix?

442
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,310
No, Tong Tianyang of the Demons Manor.

443
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,900
Who is he here for?

444
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,010
For you.

445
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,780
Our plan is doomed to fail.

446
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,960
We need to find a shelter first.

447
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,690
Let’s go!

448
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,390
Come here.

449
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,010
This is the antidote.

450
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,690
Smell it.

451
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,220
Thanks.

452
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,270
The back door is at the end
on the left.

453
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,860
Go.

454
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,100
Let’s go!

455
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,890
The back door is at the end on the left.

456
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,510
Go.

457
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,280
Here is filled with kerosene. Get out.

458
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,450
Smell the antidote.

459
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,120
The back door is at the end
on the left. Go.

460
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,590
Yes.

461
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,060
Relax.

462
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,910
I’ll protect your people.

463
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,650
Thanks.

464
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,590
Please wait.

465
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,580
Thank you for saving my life.

466
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,610
May I know your names?

467
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,340
Two nobodies.

468
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,310
No need to thank us.

469
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,020
Fine.

470
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,190
I’m in debt to you

471
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,710
for saving me

472
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,090
and I’ll pay you back in the future.

473
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,840
Sir,

474
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,570
didn’t you hear what I said?

475
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,010
This place could explode anytime.

476
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,900
I’m off.

477
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,880
Huo Liantao,

478
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,750
where do you think you’re going?

479
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,520
Hand over the Seal of Cautiousness.

480
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,250
What are you talking about?

481
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,440
I have no idea.

482
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,190
Really?

483
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,300
Are you aware of the ripple pattern?

484
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,040
No.

485
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,020
-Here’s the antidote.
-Thanks.

486
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,110
Smell it.

487
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,630
Follow the others. Here you are.

488
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,960
-Here.
-Alright.

489
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,960
Watch out!

490
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,620
Are you sneaking up on me?

491
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,570
Shame on you!

492
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,800
We’re here

493
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,290
for members of the Huo’s Manor only.

494
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,430
Get out

495
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,180
if you are not!

496
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,110
Let’s go. Run!

497
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,780
Nice!

498
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,500
Fei,

499
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,080
kill him!

500
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,760
Zip it!

501
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
Smell the antidote.

502
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,780
I almost forgot.

503
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,190
Let me get you out.

504
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,490
Miss,

505
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,960
the key to mastering all martial arts

506
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,130
is the same,

507
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,130
that is, how well
you control the strength.

508
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,330
Precision leads to perfection.

509
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,610
Or however strong or skilled you are,

510
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,270
you can only achieve so much

511
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,890
on the wrong path.

512
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,390
That’s right!

513
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,860
She isn’t a master

514
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,120
but she has what it takes

515
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,610
to become one.

516
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,900
Young man,

517
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,260
you have a knack

518
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
for flattery.

519
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,980
Thank you for your teaching.

520
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,530
Thank you for your antidote.

521
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,360
Fei, is it you?

522
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,800
Fei! Fei!

523
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,310
What are you doing here?

524
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,100
Chenfei.

525
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,310
Did leader know?

526
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,310
Chenfei, have you seen Li Sheng?

527

Oh,

535
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,430

536

537

Miss Wu, smell the antidote.

538
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,430
Don’t be afraid.

539

Fei and I are of the same sect.

540

here’s dangerous. We should leave.

545
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,690
Thank you, Fei.

546
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,640

What’s there to be afraid?

551

was abandoned by love before youth.

566

580
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,030
only to make a living.

581

such great lengths?

and cut off your hand?

590

I don’t think

591
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,410
you need a third hand,

Chenfei is fine.

702
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,190
Sure.

703
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,070
It’s Mu Xiaoqiao.

704
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,860
Chenfei.

705
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,860
Please

706
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,340
escort the injured
and the others to leave

707
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,010
with your members.

708
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,710
I’ll cover you

709
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,680
and try to stall them.

710
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,590
I’ll join you.

711
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,190
You?

712
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,790
We make a great team.

713
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,900
Together

714
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,700
we can buy them more time.

715
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,280
No.

716
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,700
I’ll stay.

717
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,340
You need to protect the others.

718
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,840
We each have our own responsibility.

719
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,670
And my skills

720
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,220
have improved greatly.

721
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,190
You’ve grown up.

722
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,960
Listen,

723
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,380
be careful

724
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,790
and come back safe and sound.

725
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,780
Don’t worry, Chenfei.

726
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,520
I won’t allow

727
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,200
anything to happen to her.

728
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,500
Who’s the jinx between us?

729
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,960
Every time we met,

730
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,130
we’d be in danger.

731
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,330
But we survived every time, didn’t we?

732
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,990
I hope

733
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,790
we will survive again.

734
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,330
Hey,

735
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,330
it’s you.

736
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,050
You’re

737
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,830
in luck

738
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,920
that you’ve managed to get out.

739
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,800
I wouldn’t

740
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,960
call this luck

741
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,680
that we encountered you.

742
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,450
That girl isn’t too bad.

743
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,240
What a shame!

744
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,820
Those who got out of the dungeon

745
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,550
must...

746
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,170
die.

747
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,080
Wait!

748
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,330
This is a misunderstanding.

749
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,440
We’ve never meant to challenge you.

750
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,550
If we fight against each other,

751
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,790
neither of us will win

752
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,560
other than those Demons.

753
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,350
You two battling me?

754
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,010
You’re

755
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,420
so full of yourself!

756
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,420
Mu Xiaoqiao,

757
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,810
you sang

758
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,970
the song wrong.

759
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,330
Excuse me?

760
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,180
You know that song, too?

761
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,410
Back in the dungeon,

762
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,470
I once heard you sing

763
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,240
“winter comes at home”.

764
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,510
It should be

765
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,030
“winter comes again at home”.

766
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,560
By deleting that word,

767
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,880
the feelings have completely changed

768
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,250
from sorrowful to shallow.

769
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,630
“Winter comes at home”.

770
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,240
“Winter comes again at home”.

771
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,060
No wonder

772
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,370
I always find something

773
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,620
is missing.

774
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,810
Turns out...

775
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,060
