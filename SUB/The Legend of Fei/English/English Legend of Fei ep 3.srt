<i>Episode 3</i>

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,260
My late father established Fortress of
the Forty-Eight here

19
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,170
to provide those who come down

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,880
with a place to stay.

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,000
The Fortress is isolated.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,590
We have no friends and allies.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,050
The ancestral will shall not
be disobeyed.

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,800
You are of no exception.

25
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,440
When you step out of the gate tomorrow,

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,080
you’ll have nothing to do
with us anymore,

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,480
be it dead or not.

28
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,640
But you have everything to do with me.

29
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,540
<i>Six Months Later</i>

30
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,140
Father told me

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,830
that only the strong have a choice.

32
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,470
Fei.

33
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,080
I’ll have to break
Spinning Wire Formation today!

34
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,640
The mountains and waters will never
fade away.

35
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,110
Let’s see when you’ll cross them freely.

36
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,800
You’d have been a piece
of minced meat now

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,110
if I hadn’t turned it off.

38
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,190
But that intruder

39
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,200
passed the formation easily, didn’t he?

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,330
He was just being good
at the flying skill.

41
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,750
Had I been better at the flying skill…

42
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,970
It wouldn’t change anything.

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,920
You were like a monkey somersaulting.

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,760
You think you can just somersault

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,720
and break the formation?

46
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,790
Then…

47
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,670
Is there any trick to break it?

48
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,230
The formation is changing
from time to time,

49
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,530
following no law at all.

50
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Living in this world,

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,180
you won’t find tricks easily,

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,850
nor will you find shortcuts.

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,830
But everything follows a certain rule.

54
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,060
If you find the rule,

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,670
then you’ll be able to break it.

56
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,830
It’s about your brain.

57
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,720
Treat everything with heart.

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Calm down.

59
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,230
Empty the trivial thoughts in your mind.

60
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,800
Close your eyes.

61
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,340
Feel things with heart.

62
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,930
Then you’ll know where to go next,

63
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,870
what to do,

64
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,340
and where

65
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,380
you should put your sword.

66
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,780
You know what this method is called?

67
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,010
“Eye-shutting Skill”.

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,200
How’s everything going?

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
Scouts informed us

70
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,880
that General Wu Fei had been caught.

71
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,860
General Wu Fei used
to be a martial artist,

72
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,460
a fate-sharing friend
of my father-in-law’s.

73
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,230
If Demons didn’t intervene,

74
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,320
no one could stop him

75
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,620
given his skills and Kungfu.

76
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,720
He might not make it through this time.

77

78
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,880

<i>Shen Tianshu, Timber Wolf of Demons
Manor</i>

82
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,040
Leave it to me.

83
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,000
I don’t think so.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
True that you are the leader of Demons,

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,880
but I was the one who caught him.

86
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,200
You disagree with a
commander-in-chief?

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,230
I can’t believe Demons are now
the henchmen of Yu Wenzhi.

88
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,990
Let’s get to the point.

89
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,640
Hand out the ripple-shaped thing
you have.

90
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,960
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

91
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,020
<i>To General Wu Fei</i>

92
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,050
These are the letters between you
and Wang Lin.

93
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,750
It is mentioned in these letters

94
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,980
that there’s a ripple-shaped object

95
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,550
and you are the one who’s keeping it.

96
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,580
As long as you hand it out to me…

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Don’t you see me as a coward.

98
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,230
I heard that Zhou Yitang

99
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,110
has helped to transport your family

100
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,090
to the south.

101
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,250
But,

102
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,270
do you really think they can escape?

103
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,900
You…

104
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,450
Take them here.

105
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,810
Honey.

106
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,200
My lord.

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,880
Honey.

108
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,750
I’ll give you one more chance.

109
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,790
Where’s the ripple-shaped object?

110
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,350
The kids have all left successfully.

111
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,670
Don’t worry.

112
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,910
Don’t you ever tell him.

113
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,390
Honey.

114
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,630
Honey.

115
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,960
Honey.

116
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,480
Chuchu, I can’t go any further.

117
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,590
Hang in there.

118
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,480
Chenfei,

119
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,260
my little brother is running

Can we take a break?

122
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,550
Are you OK, boy?

123
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,150
I’m fine.

124
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,470
Miss Chuchu,

125
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,590
how about this?

126
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,910
There should be someone coming to
pick us up several feet ahead.

127
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,960
Can you carry on for just a while?

128
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
OK.

129
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,790
Chuchu.

130
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,520
Why aren’t Father and Mother not here
yet for us?

131
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,840
They will come

132
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,780
when we reach the Fortress of
the Forty-Eight.

133
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,180
Don’t worry, General Wu.

134
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,960
Your kids…

135
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,110
I’ll take good care of them.

136
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,590
Chuchu, how far are we
from the Fortress?

137
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,640
Not far, I think.

138
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,280
Just follow Chenfei.

139
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,670
Demons!

140
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,520
Search.

141
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,440
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,020
Qiu Tianjin?

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,300
Who is he looking for?

144
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,080
Continue.

145
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,200
Lord,

146
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,150
the two kids of Wu Fei

147
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,030
are fleeing towards Jingzhou.

148
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,590
All his letters

149
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,550
have been delivered
via Jingzhou as well.

150
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,740
This doesn’t seem to be a coincidence.

151
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,710
The object we want

152
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,080
is right with the kids.

153
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,030
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

154
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,350
They will encounter Demons, won’t they?

155
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,200
I owe them from last time.

156
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,950
I should give them some hints.

157
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,830
How fast can they flee when they are
with a little kid?

158
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,880
My apologies, Lord.

159
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,200
You idiot!

160
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,350
Seems like they are protected
by the Fortress.

161
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,080
We should just go along this path

162
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,060
and send more of our people
to intercept them.

163
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,540
Heaven forbids

164
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
if I can’t catch up with them.

165
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,430
Protect Miss Chuchu.

166
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,270
It’s you.

167
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,520
I saw you from afar.

168
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,390
And I guessed that my friends of the
Fortress were in trouble.

169
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,020
How can I help you?

170
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,600
Who’s there?

171
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,790
Sir,

172
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,320
all my family members have caught sores

173
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,960
We are heading to Jingzhou
for medication.

174
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,920
Look.

175
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,540
What the hell is this?

176
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,570
You see?

177
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,390
Stop.

178
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,840
Bloody sick bastards.

179
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,910
Get out.

180
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,470
Thank… Thank you, sir.

181
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,910
Thank you.

182
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,550
-Lord.
-Lord.

183
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,470
We will be reaching the boundary of
Huo’s Manor soon.

184
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
The Huos are friends with the Fortress.

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
If those people enter the Huo’s area

186
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,670
and the latter are determined to
cover them up,

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,580
then things will become complicated.

188
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,880
Don’t act rashly without my command.

189
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,020
Yes, sir.

190
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,550
You, ask your people to nose around.

191
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,110
See if the Timber Wolf has made
any move here.

192
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,880
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,670
Thank you for your rouge, Miss Wu.

194
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,670
Otherwise I could not have faked

195
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,900
the sores myself.

196
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,410
You’re welcome, sir.

197
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,150
We should be the ones to thank you

198
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,610
for helping us out.

199
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,550
But this little trick won’t hold them
for long.

200
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,150
You should reach the Fortress

201
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,140
without further ado.

202
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,340
Hey, what are you up to

203
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,940
by following us up all the way?

204
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,880
I have been a professional kidnaper
for years.

205
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,110
Lord Gantang alone is not enough for me.

206
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,270
That’s why I’m here for you.

207
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,390
Who are you?

208
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,640
Excuse me,

209
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,640
are you with the Huo’s Manor?

210
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,730
They are our friends.

211
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,320
Their old master

212
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,130
is a sworn brother of Old Master Li’s.

213
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,080
We are with the Fortress.

214
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,760
Passing by Jingzhou,

215
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,080
I wonder if we can stay in the Manor
for a day or two.

216
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,010
Could you please pass my message?

217
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,420
Friends with the Fortress!

218
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,400
Of course we should receive you
in a nice manner.

219
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,030
It happens that the old master just
celebrated his birthday.

220
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,040
Many martial artists are still staying
at the Manor.

221
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,670
We sincerely invite you to join us
at the party.

222
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,390
That will be great.

223
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,530
Mr. Xie,

224
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,000
your help along the way

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,980
is very much appreciated.

226
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,850
As you see,

227
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
we are in a safe hand.

228
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,520
Since you’re home now,

229
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,160
I should stop from further intervention.

230
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,020
Take care.

231
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,500
You’re here.

232
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,190
Girl,

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,230
today,

234
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,880
we’re gonna turn Spinning Wire
into full gear.

235
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,590
Be serious.

236
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,590
Did you hear me?

237
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,690
Be serious!

238
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,910
Put away the stick.

239
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,550
Get a nicer piece of weapon.

240
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,420
Fine.

241
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,840
OK. OK.

242
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,440
You know-it-all.

243
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Stop it.

244
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,110
The other day

245
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,110
the intruder crossed Ximo River
with Spinning Wire at full gear,

246
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,360
totally unarmed.

247
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,260
Ready.

248
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,680
Bai Neng,

249
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
these are from Chenfei

250
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,560
to Aunt, from outside.

251
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,920
Not many of them are left.

252
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,070
See,

253
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,260
I’ve managed to keep some for you.

254
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,920
Can I

255
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,590
spend some time by the side of
Ximo River?

256
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,350
Just for a second.

257
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,120
You can take a look by the cliff.

258
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,890
But if you want to go to Ximo River,

259
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,740
you’ll need Leader’s permission.

260
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,110
But Fei goes there every day.

261
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,140
Are you discriminating against me?

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,040
What’s your problem?
You scared me.

263
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,590
You want to try Ximo River out?

264
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,350
I can throw you in it now.

265
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,520
Don’t badger the poor man.

266
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,430
What are you doing?

267
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,190
Sheng.

268
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,000
Sheng, Sheng. Sorry. Sorry.

269
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Forgive me, please.

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I’m sorry.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,070
I’m sorry.

272
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,040
Stop yelling.

273
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
I’m not really going
to throw you into it.

274
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,040
What’s that?

275
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,230
Fei?

276
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,480
Sheng, come here.

277
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,680
Careful!

278
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,470
Sheng, go save Fei!

279
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,160
I… I can’t save her.

280
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,480
Not bad.

281
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,110
Aren’t those preserved peaches from
Leader?

282
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,940
She was here?

283
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,790
Two days ago.

284
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,000
Too sweet. I don’t like them.

285
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,180
What are you doing?

286
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,590
You…

287
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,110
What on earth are you doing?

288
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,310
Listen to me.

289
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
As a person,

290
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,640
you should care about others’ feeling

291
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,040
no matter what you’re doing.

292
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,230
For example,

293
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,430
you just ate a preserved peach.

294
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,350
You had a bite of it,

295
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,680
and then you put the rest back.

296
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,880
That’s not nice.

297
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,040
It tastes bad.

298
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,880
Then why did you have a bite of it?

299
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,000
How can I know it’s not good
if I don’t try it?

300
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,710
Fine. OK.

301
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,800
You have come here

302
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,470
not to learn martial arts,

303
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,230
but to torture me.

304
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,800
Very well.

305
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,520
Now that you’ve broken
the Spinning Wire Formation,

306
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,820
you can get out of here.

307
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,430
I don’t want to

308
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,660
see you again.

309
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,510
Get out.

310
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,190
Hey, old man.

311
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,560
Don’t be so mean.

312
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,830
Get out. Get out.

313
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,430
We’re not friends anymore.

314
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,140
Silly girl.

315
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,230
Oh, my.

316
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,910
You’ll need your mother to fix you
before you learn how to behave yourself.

317
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,950
Mr. Xie is to blame.

318
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,760
If he had not come,

319
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,950
then Uncle would not have left.

320
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,760
If so,

321
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,230
Fei wouldn’t have been so sad.

322
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,950
In the past six months,

323
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,040
she has been practicing sword skills
over Ximo River day after day.

324
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,460
We seldom manage to see her.

325
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,650
If he had not come,

326
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,400
we wouldn’t have known that

327
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,200
there are excellent people like him
in this big world.

328
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,610
Time to leave here for the bigger world.

329
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,830
This

330
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,090
is where

331
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,060
<i>Blessings</i>
we test the candidate disciples,

332
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,470
<i>Blessings</i>
the Flower-Picking Pavilion.

333
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,920
You need to get no less than
two paper-cut flowers

334
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,560
within the given time

335
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,400
in order to graduate

336
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,350
and leave the school.

337
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,400
One of the two flowers

338
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,310
must be

339
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,400
from that tall timber pile.

340
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,310
Meanwhile, you will have to challenge
one of the chiefs here,

341
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,060
who will guard the piles.

342
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,230
You can get

343
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,590
the other flowers

344
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,640
by challenging the elder disciples,

345
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,190
who will be guarding

346
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,260
the short piles.

347
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,950
Try to get more flowers.

348
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,140
The more, the better.

349
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,110
Disciples of the Fortress,

350
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,440
come up to the pavilion.

351
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,590
Sheng always uses double swords.

352
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,350
Why does he change to a spear?

353
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,040
They’ll use the weapon of the school

354
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,590
they wish to challenge.

355
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,400
They can only

356
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
use their own weapon

357
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,860
when trying to get the flower
on the piles.

358
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
Skillful.

359
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,350
Years ago,

360
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,230
Jinfeng got 12 flowers in one shot.

361
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,790
<i>Ms. Wang, An Elder of the Fortress</i>
Sheng’s spirit

362
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,310
resembles that of his father.

363
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,720
Just like that? Good job.

364
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,230
Judging from his performance,

365
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,690
I say he’ll get 20.

366
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,310
Given the current situation,

367
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,410
I say it’s possible.

368
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,800
Fei,

369
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,920
see Sheng?

370
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,960
How many flowers can you get?

371
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
Maybe one.

372
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
One?

373
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,640
My dear,

374
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
if so,

375
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,310
your mother will be more than happy

376
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,160
because you’ll spend the rest of
your life studying here.

377
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,600
Exactly, Fei.

378
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,910
Then two.

379
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
To get the flower on the pile,

380
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,220
I would like to challenge the chief
of Mingfeng Building.

381
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,460
<i>Kou Dan, An Elder of the Fortress</i>

382
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,430
It’s Spinning Wire.

383
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,110
Thank you for pulling your punches.

384
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,710
Mr. Ma, have a look.

385
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,420
See if it’s broken.

386
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,230
If you ask,

387
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,640
then it must be very much intact.

388
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,110
Li Sheng gets

389
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,830
15 paper-cut flowers.

390
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,880
I’ll go straightly to the flowers
on the piles.

391
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,800
I would like to challenge

392
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
Leader.

393
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,100
<i>Blessings</i>

394
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,100
<i>Zhao Qiusheng,
An Elder of the Fortress</i>

395
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,160
<i>Zhang Bolin, An Elder of the Fortress</i>
The girl is really something.

396
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,350
Exactly.

397
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,680
Fei has got something

398
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,590
similar to Mingfeng.

399
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,520
Does it have something to do with
Ximo River?

400
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,220
Fei was introduced to the school
by Leader.

401
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,920
How could she learn Mingfeng’s
martial arts?

402
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,640
What a girl, Fei!

403
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,310
She grasped the essence
of Mingfeng Trick

404
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,470
and combined it
with her own sword skills.

405
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,190
This is the optimal choice of move

406
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,840
to fight against Leader.

407
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,360
Fei,

408
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,230
your father has a letter for you.

409
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,710
It reads that he wants
to tell you something.

410
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,880
If you can pass Xiushan Hall,

411
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,190
I’ll give you the letter.

412
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,590
If you can’t,

413
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,680
then you’ll spend the rest of your life

414
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,740
studying here.

415
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,880
Snow-breaking Blade?

416
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,470
If it’s the real Snow-breaking Blade,

417
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,590
it won’t be broken

418
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,740
even when you have nothing but
a metal plate.

419
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,830
Because

420
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,970
it is not a fire that knows no moral.

421
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,110
She did it! Unbelievable.

422
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,300
<i>Blessings</i>

423
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,710
There you go.

424
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,110
Fei,

425
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,110
you’ve still got much time left.

426
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,160
Why do you just come back?

427
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,900
Two will be enough, right?

428
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,280
Well, that’s right.

429
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,680
But…

430
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,040
Every disciple of the Fortress only has

431
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,450
one chance to be
on the Pavilion in their life.

432
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,160
Your result will be recorded
onto Xiushan Hall.

433
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,350
When the future disciples see it,

434
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,000
they’ll think you’re bad at martial arts

435
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,920
and will laugh at you.

436
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,240
Two will be enough.

437
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,300
No big deal.

438
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
About the badge,

439
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,030
I’ll leave it to Mr. Ma.

440
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,590
Fei, Sheng,

441
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,240
follow me to the Hall of Elders.

442
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,160
Ms. Wang needs you there.

443
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,140
<i>Hall of Elders</i>

444
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,030
Mother,

445
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,190
what did Father say in the letter?

446
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,880
Listen.

447
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,760
Leader. Sorry for the trouble

448
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,070
caused by my miserable grandson.

449
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,180
Ms. Wang, no trouble at all.

450
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,350
Chenfei was running an errand

451
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,070
for the Fortress in the first place.

452
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,790
What

453
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,640
did you ask him to do?

454
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,040
A while ago, your father told us that
some distinguished guests were coming,

455
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,100
and that we should pick the guests up.

456
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,430
Chenfei wanted to see the world

457
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,980
so he volunteered to take the job.

458
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,540
Last month, he told us
that he had arrived

459
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,430
but that was the last time we heard
from him.

460
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,040
Chenfei is good at martial arts

461
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,280
but even he was put into danger.

462
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,950
Shouldn’t we

463
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,540
send more skillful experts to him?

464
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,230
I wonder how distinguished
the guests are

465
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,110
to make such a fuss

466
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,830
out of a simple action of picking-up.

467
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,360
Mind your words.

468
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,530
I will leave this place

469
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,860
to figure things out in person.

470
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,520
Fei, Sheng,

471
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,310
look carefully.

472
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,920
The distinguished guests mentioned

473
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,400
are the family members of General Wu.

474
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,840
General Wu was persecuted by
the invaders from the North.

475
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,460
His son and daughter
are now homeless.

476
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
Your father felt sympathetic

477
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,040
and turned to me for help.

478
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,310
We sent 13 people from the Fortress

479
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,370
to pick them up

480
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,850
but we’ve not heard
from them ever since.

481
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,400
With the bunches of bandits out there,

482
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,660
travels are already treacherous enough.

483
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,950
Let alone they have two kids with them.

484
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,040
Maybe they had to slow down.

485
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,620
They must be already close
to this place.

486
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,060
If you feel worried,

487
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,950
bring some people with you to
pick them up.

488
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,510
You two shouldn’t have come,

489
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,830
but I was so shameless

490
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,880
that I begged Ms. Wang

491
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,610
to bring you along to see the world.

492
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
When you are out there,

493
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,430
don’t try to be smart

494
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,520
and mess around.

495
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,920
Otherwise I’ll beat you up.

496
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,230
Just now,

497
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,760
you didn’t show fear

498
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,040
when you knew your sword would
be broken.

499
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,780
Because you knew I wouldn’t hurt you.

500
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,590
This is not Snow-breaking Blade.

501
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,630
It’s a trick.

502
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,750
But a trick requires wisdom.

503
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,710
It’s working

504
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,320
if it helps you reach the goal.

505
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,350
Did you just praise me?

506
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,600
When you are at a real fight,

507
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,780
you can’t help showing fear

508
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,080
if you know the sword will be broken.

509
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,940
Don’t deny that.

510
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,370
Death is fearful to all.

511
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,520
Fear, however subtle it is,

512
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,500
is fear anyway.

513
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,560
But no matter what I think about,

514
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,320
the sword will be broken anyway, right?

515
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
Are you saying

516
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,760
that Snow-breaking Blade is
a set of techniques

517
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,150
that tells people to be overconfident?

518
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,000
To be all-conquering.

519
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,340
Fei,

520
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,870
you know how many experts

521
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,120
are out there in this world?

522
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,660
Countless.

523
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,980
Right.

524
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,740
Countless.

525
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,570
There’s always someone better.

526
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
No one dares to claim to be No.1.

527
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,340
But everyone is given birth

528
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,120
by their parents.

529
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,940
They are made of flesh and blood.

530
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,600
They all started from babbling,

531
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,530
and tottering.

532
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,410
The current grit

533
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,640
is the future mountain.

534
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,350
Your present is our history.

535
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,600
Fei,

536
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,430
the immortals are beyond our discussion.

537
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,040
Every person in the world

538
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,870
is mortal.

539
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,670
Why can’t you believe

540
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,880
that the blade you have is invincible?

541
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,620
Look carefully.

542
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,570
I’ll only teach you once.

543
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,150
There are nine moves for
Snow-breaking Blade.

544
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,560
Your grandfather compiled it in person.

545
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,030
It is extremely aggressive.

546
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,140
Mr. Yutai.

547
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,190
Stop.

548
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,640
Get away from me.

549
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,560
You always call me “terrible old man”.

550
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,910
And just now you called me Mr. Yutai?

551
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,150
Are you after something?

552
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,800
How can that be?

553
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
I don’t call you Mr. Yutai every day.

554
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
You should’ve just enjoyed it.

555
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,000
Don’t tell me you prefer
“terrible old man”.

556
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,670
That sounds more like it.

557
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,390
I can rest assured now.

558
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,610
Have a seat. Come here.

559
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,470
Wait a minute.

560
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,080
Comfy, comfy.

561
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,950
What’s wrong?

562
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,630
I’m going out.

563
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,410
Good.

564
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,200
You?

565
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,270
You?

566
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,070
You’ve passed Xiushan Hall?

567
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,100
Good job.

568
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,730
Come.

569
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,320
Brag it to me.

570
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,150
Which chief

571
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,370
did you defeat today?

572
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,000
Leader.

573
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,980
Well done, you!

574
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,840
There you go. Have some tea.

575
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,200
Did she pull her punches?

576
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,980
I think so.

577
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,600
Mother passed Snow-breaking Blade

578
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,020
on to me.

579
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,190
What kind of heroine

580
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,150
would you like to become?

581
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,040
I don’t want to be a heroine.

582
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,670
To me,

583
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,710
being a heroine

584
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,150
is not about

585
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,150
how many people

586
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,950
she has defeated

587
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,720
or killed throughout her life.

588
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,430
It’s about

589
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,780
how many people

590
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,760
she’s helped

591
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,360
or saved in this world.

592
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,500
So that she won’t become those who

593
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,500
become bullies

594
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,620
after gaining a little bit
of skills and powers.

595
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,420
But don’t worry,

596
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,020
in this world,

597
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,600
people like them

598
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,320
will lose

599
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,060
the hell out of them someday.

600
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,940
Years ago, Mingfeng Building

601
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,430
sold information for living.

602
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,320
We’ve made ourselves enemy to
too many people.

603
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,190
At the end, Demons

604
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,000
drove us up to the wall.

605
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,420
<i>Hu Tianying, Pathetic Clam of
Demons Manor</i>

606
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,750
Bone-chilling is not an average poison.

607
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,120
If you are poisoned by it,

608
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,600
you’ll soon turn stiff and die.

609
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,840
Just wait for the call.

610
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,230
They are just a bundle
of merciless spies.

611
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,320
Cut the crap.

612
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,940
<i>Lu Tiankuang, Hearing Ox of Demons Manor</i>
Just kill him.

613
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,300
<i>Lu Tiankuang, Hearing Ox of Demons Manor</i>

614
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,810
At that moment,

615
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,170
someone showed up.
