<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 16</i>

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Remember,

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,230
Water Cutting of the North Blade

19
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,160
is complicated and changeable.

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
But it has its own rules.

21
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,520
It’s OK. I’ll stall them first.

22
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,550
You underestimate them.

23
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,390
People from Dragon Sect

24
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,550
all have good ears.

25
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,720
It’s no different from speaking

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,360
in front of them when you
talk so quietly.

27
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,720
I can hear everything you say.

28
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,440
You’re still alive?

29
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,450
We will give you to our master

30
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
to see how he will punish you.

31
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,270
Let’s deal with the two of them first.

32
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,630
Wait.

33
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,080
Have you considered it?

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
Are you really going to fight?

35
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,830
Why bother to consider?

36
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,550
Think carefully.

37
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,240
Don’t force me to use my dreadful move.

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,390
Dreadful move?

39
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,830
I’d like to know

40
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,720
what it is.

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Originally,

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,550
I was going to

43
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,910
block this cave

44
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,630
so you wouldn’t get yourselves killed.

45
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,960
But looks like

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,320
you are still looking for death.

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,030
I’ll just pull your tongue out

48
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,600
to see if you dare to say that again!

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,440
You just know a formation.

50
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,880
Actually this formation

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,440
is easy to be broken.

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
This formation contains

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,670
the method of the five elements.

54
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,910
One of you beats the gong

55
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,440
to trigger the attack from the enemy

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
and show his weakness,

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,520
then the other four will come forward.

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
The five of you guard each other

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,670
and exchange with other groups.

60
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,440
So the changes will be endless.

61
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,470
There are many people who know this.

62
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,080
It’s no big deal!

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,550
But few of them

64
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,750
know your weak point, right?

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,910
Weak point? How could you know?

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,240
It’s “Jin” on the position “Qian”.

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,630
If he is in danger,

68
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,320
the other four will also get influenced.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
You brat! You told him?

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
What a cheating jerk!

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,350
Why would I tell him that?

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,880
I’m not with them.

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,830
What’s more,

74
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,070
they even made me can’t move.

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,440
Mr. Yin,

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,550
it doesn’t matter if you are with us
or not.

77
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,000
But now you have to stand on our side.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
Think about it.

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,760
If we die,

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,230
you have been with Dragon Master
for long

81
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,920
and you know his temper.

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,550
Will he let you go?

83
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,480
You will also die with us!

84
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,600
Even if you know the way to break
Gong Formation,

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,920
will you be strong enough to do that?

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,510
Alright,

87
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,270
let’s give it a try then.

88
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,850
Back off!

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,740
Yes.

90
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,240
I have been waiting for you
the whole night.

91
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,510
You’re really bold.

92
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,200
Your swordsmanship looks like
from the South,

93
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,880
which is really silly.

94
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,350
It doesn’t fit
a beautiful girl like you.

95
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,070
I just thought about it.

96
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,480
It’s a pity if you die.

97
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,180
Look.

98
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,960
If you’re willing to follow me,

99
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,990
I can forgive

100
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,900
everything you have done.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,110
Really?

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,780
You will have a wealthy life

103
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
and servants around you

104
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,100
no matter where you are.

105
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,880
You can have anything you want.

106
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,990
All the jewelries will belong to you.

107
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,340
It’s much better than
how you are living now.

108
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,510
If I kill your people

109
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,390
and break your Gong Formation,

110
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,760
can you also let this go?

111
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,820
Compared with your pretty face,

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,540
these are nothing.

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,200
Tell me what your name is.

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,510
I like irritable girls.

115
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,510
Look at you guys.

116
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,270
You even sent a girl to deal with
Dragon Master.

117
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,790
Don’t you know how despicable he is?

118
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,320
So ignorant!

119
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,040
Water Cutting?

120
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,740
At this time,

121
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,510
that old guy who can’t protect himself

122
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,640
still taught you something.

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,270
But, unluckily,

124
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,200
it won’t work on me.

125
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,670
But it’s already enough to deal with

126
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,640
a loser like you.

127
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,030
Wicked girl.

128
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,600
You just tricked me with two moves.

129
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,370
I remember

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,160
the first time I fought with you,

131
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,760
you were just a green hand who

132
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,040
only escaped after playing tricks.

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,920
It hasn’t been a few hours

134
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,570
and you have already changed a lot.

135
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,760
Who do you think you are?

136
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,380
I changed my mind.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,950
Talents like you

138
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,000
must be killed.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
I can’t let you

140
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
practice for more years.

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
You have been talking so much.

142
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,420
Only this line sounded nice.

143
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
It won’t cost me

144
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,970
more years to kill you.

145
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,390
How arrogant!

146
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,440
Be careful.
He has a close-fitting armor!

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
No wonder I can’t hurt him.

148
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
I thought he was invulnerable.

149
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,400
If not for his armor,

150
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,030
I would have already

151
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,470
taken his arms off.

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,470
What are you doing?

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
Helping you.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
About what?

155
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,350
Block the blade!

156
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,350
Lad.

157
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,080
You have watched enough?

158
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,320
There was a craftsman

159
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,710
who was said to be able to
perform wonders

160
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,650
and make many great weapons.

161
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,760
Other than that,

162
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,190
there was a Muyun Gauze

163
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,030
which is said to be bright and clear

164
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,150
without flaw.

165
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,470
When it’s in the dark,

166
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,640
it will be like flowing moonlight.

167
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,910
And it’s light.

168
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,690
You can be invulnerable wearing it.

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,690
As far as I know,

170
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,670
the Muyun Gauze

171
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,030
was made by Yin Wenlan,
the Mountain Sword,

172
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,690
for his wife.

173
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,350
Don’t you feel a little bit tight

174
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,720
when wearing it?

175
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,670
What do you want to say?

176
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,860
I’m just curious that

177
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,320
since you got the Yin’s things,

178
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,000
why are you not the second
Mountain Sword?

179
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,960
What else do you know?

180
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,840
I know everything.

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

182
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Your silver tongue

183
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,110
should be used to buy time,

184
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,670
not to look for death.

185
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,990
Dragon Master,

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,930
we can talk. Don’t be angry.

187
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,910
Which one of
“The Color of Ocean and Heaven”

188
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,400
is your enemy?

189
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,760
You can tell me

190
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,530
and I’ll never say it again.

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,150
You brat.

192
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,440
I knew he is reluctant to kill me.

193
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,040
What are you doing?

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Miss Wu,

195
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,520
step aside.

196
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,230
Don’t get hurt.

197
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,150
OK.

198
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,550
Aren’t you already destroyed?

199
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,760
You thought the North Blade has been
wiped out

200
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
so you

201
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,300
have been at ease, right?

202
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,470
Zheng Luosheng,

203
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,350
you haven’t made any progress
on your martial arts.

204
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,280
I think I have known the reason.

205
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,360
That’s really the North Blade.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,410
You can still stand up again
after being destroyed.

207
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,760
Alright, that’s great.

208
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,550
I have been wanting

209
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,770
to see how great the two blades
and one sword are.

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,330
If I haven’t made

211
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,710
any progress,

212
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,170
I’d like to see how much progress

213
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,960
you have made.

214
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,920
I have to ask about one thing first.

215
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,520
The Yins are killed by you.

216
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,320
You’re not wronged about it, right?

217
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,640
What does it have to do with you?

218
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,860
So what if it is or not?

219
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,080
Yin Wenlan

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,580
was a great master.

221
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,030
But hundreds of people of his family

222
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,770
died overnight.

223
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
That has something to do with me.

224
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,220
Since I have got the answer,

225
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,710
it will be easy.

226
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,970
Ji Yunchen,

227
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,650
let alone that you’re disabled.

228
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,970
Even if you are not,

229
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,790
you may not defeat me.

230
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,320
It doesn’t matter

231
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
who is stronger

232
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,200
or who is the winner.

233
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,590
The point is that today

234
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,060
I’m gonna end your life.

235
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,180
I’d like to see

236
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,670
what trouble a disabled North Blade

237
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,550
can make!

238
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,840
Mr. Yin,

239
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,150
all you want to see now

240
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,880
must be the death of Dragon Master.

241
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,550
Mr. Xie, you’re really smart.

242
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,400
It’s hard to say

243
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,960
who will win now.

244
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,520
How about we join hands?

245
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,030
His needle…

246
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,950
Let’s talk about it later.

247
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,720
I won’t tell you.

248
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,960
Can you put it another way?

249
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,090
Unlock his acupoints first.

250
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,280
Don’t worry.

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Since I have agreed to ally,

252
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,320
I will keep my words.

253
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
I thought

254
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,110
being homicidal should be combative.

255
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,880
But now

256
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,550
I found that being really homicidal

257
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,840
is reserved.

258
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
Murderous look won’t be visible,

259
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,580
but it’s actually everywhere.

260
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,930
That’s the real killing blade.

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,590
The time left for Mr. Ji
is not too much.

262
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,790
After the Soul-searching Needle works,

263
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,980
it won’t last long.

264
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,150
I made such a big scene

265
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,230
only for you brat.

266
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,990
But now you came yourself.

267
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,670
Pei!

268
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,200
Muyun Gauze really doesn’t fit you.

269
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,320
Wicked girl!

270
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,790
Miss Zhou!

271
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,020
Mr. Ji.

272
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,190
“Possessed by wandering soul

273
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,470
and become a wild ghost”.

274
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,400
Soul-searching Needle

275
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,420
is also known as Reviving Needle.

276
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,670
It’s a mystique from far away.

277
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,160
It can make people find back

278
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,270
the vitality.

279
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,590
It can cover any illness

280
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,760
or injury you have

281
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,710
no matter how serious it is.

282
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,850
But...

283
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,270
The effect can only

284
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,710
last three quarters.

285
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,620
Miss Zhou,

286
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,710
before I die,

287
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,580
I could have a fight with you

288
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,850
and teach you the Water Cutting.

289
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,930
It already made me satisfied.

290
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,560
I don’t care about North or South Blade.

291
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,320
I remember

292
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,050
Mr. Yin once told me…

293
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,110
In the future,

294
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,900
you’ll have many difficulties to face.

295
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,310
I just don’t want

296
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,160
you younger generation

297
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,350
to be destroyed in my hand.

298
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,560
Mr. Ji.

299
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,950
Pei,

300
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,440
I’m sorry.

301
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,360
This is all

302
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,720
I can repay you.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,280
Just go.

304
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,700
Do we really have no way to help him?

305
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,730
“Heaven.”

306
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,760
“I have always been wanting”

307
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,950
“to know you and cherish you.”

308
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,680
“Only when the world comes to an end”

309
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
“can I throw away my love for you.”

310
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,680
These scholars

311
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,000
always like to show off literary skills.

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,590
Not like me,

313
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,000
who just want to start my own sect

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
after battling with all the masters.

315
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,530
The first place in the world,

316
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,070
or the good fame for half a life.

317
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,900
Let all these things

318
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,800
go with the wind...

319
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,120
Mr. Yin.

320
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,500
You killed Dragon Master,

321
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,470
and Mr. Ji is also dead.

322
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,250
You have got your revenge.

323
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,190
How about his graciousness to you

324
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,890
for more than ten years?

325
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,780
He has already died.

326
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,120
It’s just what he wanted.

327
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,080
Are you also looking for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

328
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,890
It’s none of your business

329
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,730
about what I’m going to do.

330
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,420
This belonged to my family.

331
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,810
But Dragon Master once owned it.

332
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,470
So I won’t need it.

333
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,680
It’ll be yours.

334
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,200
If you don’t like it,

335
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,190
you can just throw it.

336
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,710
Mr. Yin!

337
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,610
Chuchu,

338
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,550
just keep it.

339
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,830
It will be a dangerous journey.

340
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,190
And you don’t know any martial art.

341
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,640
It can save your life.

342
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,400
Keep it.

343
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,310
<i>Grave of Ji Yunchen</i>

344
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,040
<i>Grave of Ji Yunchen</i>
A great master like Mr. Ji

345
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,560
<i>Grave of Ji Yunchen</i>
could only hide his identity

346
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,470
<i>Grave of Ji Yunchen</i>
and be known by no other people.

347
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,230
<i>Grave of Ji Yunchen</i>
He shocked the world

348
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,880
when first showed up.

349
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,070
Today I’m lucky to see the Water Cutting
come back to the world.

350
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,190
I’ll always remember it.

351
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,830
Mr. Ji said

352
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,070
the Blade should be used to do things,

353
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,350
not to bring someone fame.

354
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,430
Here, I promise you that

355
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,590
the Water Cutting won’t be lost.

356
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,710
I’ll live up to the blade in my hand.

357
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,350
Back then, he was heroic and free.

358
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,520
<i>Grave of Ji Yunchen</i>
But now, he is buried in a small tomb.

359
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,520
Mr. Ji spent all his life

360
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,160
to make up for this mistake.

361
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,430
No matter how,

362
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,230
that’s all written off now.

363
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,110
I really admire

364
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,160
your broad mind.

365
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,880
Hope in the next life

366
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,310
you can achieve all your ambitions

367
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,880
and goals.

368
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,040
Mr. Ji,

369
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,110
we all know

370
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,090
the one you cared the most is Yin Pei.

371
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,830
Hope he can understand

372
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,880
your good intention as soon as possible

373
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,760
and come back to the right way,

374
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,000
living up to the Yins’
chivalrous quality.

375
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,070
Li Sheng,

376
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,040
I’m curious about something.

377
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,110
Why don’t you learn the
Snow-breaking Blade

378
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,980
from your grandpa and father,

379
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,470
but use Double Blades?

380
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,040
Many schools are mixed together

381
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,430
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

382
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,560
When I was little,

383
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,100
I liked to run around

384
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,230
and liked everything I saw.

385
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,230
Then I learned what I liked.

386
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,950
Back then, I thought Double Blades

387
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,560
might be stronger than a single blade
or sword.

388
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,640
So I learned

389
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,620
the Double Blades from Xiaoxiang Sect.

390
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,350
Later I wanted to learn the South Blade.

391
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,310
But I didn’t

392
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,370
know how to tell my aunt.

393
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,340
That’s why my swordsmanship

394
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,800
is not that great now.

395
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,140
It’s rare for you to be introspective.

396
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,550
Actually,

397
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,160
it doesn’t matter whether it’s from

398
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,350
your ancestors or other sects.

399
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,310
You’re Li Zheng’s grandson.

400
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,920
But you don’t have to learn
the South Blade.

401
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,710
If you’re the son of a fisherman,

402
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,830
you don’t have to learn fishing.

403
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,350
You should ask yourself

404
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,590
about the truth inside this.

405
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,000
I found that your swordsmanship

406
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,210
is kind of complicated and limited.

407
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,760
That’s because you have too many
distracting thoughts.

408
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
Especially while learning Double Blades,

409
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,320
you have to be more concentrated.

410
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,120
Hope you can

411
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,470
gradually learn the swordsmanship

412
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,760
I taught you these days.

413
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,400
You did teach me some formations.

414
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,430
When did you teach me swordsmanship?

415
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,800
Everything in the world
is of the same method.

416
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,190
Generally speaking, the formation
is the swordsmanship,

417
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,430
and the swordsmanship is the formation.

418
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,450
It depends on how you understand it.

419
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,380
I’m leaving now.

420
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,970
Take care.

421
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,470
Sir,

422
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,350
let me stay with you for some more days.

423
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,430
Don’t bother.

424
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,800
Then where are you going

425
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,070
next?

426
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,640
I’ll go travel around.

427
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,800
Since Qi School is gone,

428
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,490
I’ll be cosmopolitan.

429
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,640
We have been walking for hours.

430
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,520
It’s hard for Chuchu to come

431
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,680
such a long way with us.

432
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,000
Actually,

433
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
it’s even harder for you.

434
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,920
After fighting with Dragon Master,

435
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,430
you can still walk such a long way.

436
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,450
You are strong.

437
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,570
Are you praising me or insulting me?

438
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,710
Praising, of course.

439
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,640
Looks like I have to practice more

440
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,350
on how to praise others.

441
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,800
It depends on if Miss Zhou

442
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,680
will give me the chance.

443
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,950
Yeah.

444
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,640
I should give you an attack.

445
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
That’s too hard.

446
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,230
Fei…

447
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,880
There is a deserted house.

448
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,280
Let’s go have a rest there.

449
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,950
OK. I will go first

450
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,210
to clean up the deserted inn.

451
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,630
Fei,

452
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
sorry.

453
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,490
Why?

454
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,640
You and Xie are martial artists.

455
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,560
I walked so slow

456
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,230
and held you back.

457
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,160
That’s not like that.
Don’t think too much.

458
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,950
Fei, what’s wrong?

459
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,400
It’s OK. I have suppressed it.

460
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,360
The Yellow and Green Spirit
caused trouble again?

461
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,690
Let me tell Xie.

462
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
No. Don’t.

463
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,430
It’s OK now.

464
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,720
Don’t let him worry.

465
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,510
Ladies, welcome.

466
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
Good job.

467
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,800
Here, have a seat.

468
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,190
Master, have a seat.

469
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,560
Move it backward a little bit.

470
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,190
OK.

471
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,830
Fei,

472
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,470
if we meet a rival like Dragon Master
again,

473
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,160
don’t act rashly.

474
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,230
Then, should I be a coward like you?

475
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,630
Turns out that I’m always a coward
in your mind.

476
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,880
I…

477
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,230
Fei!

478
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,780
“The old stones along the bridge
were covered with frost.”

479
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,010
“A man who travels far from home
will never return.”

480
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,560
It’s your new work?

481
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,800
New poem.

482
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,040
“Coward’s Forlornness”.

483
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,860
It was a bad joke.

484
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,870
You’re not a coward.

485
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,280
Fei,

486
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,590
you knew you couldn’t beat
Dragon Master.

487
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,000
Why did you promise Mr. Ji to do that?

488
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,910
I just wonder

489
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,110
why they could be so confidently

490
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,620
and proudly evil.

491
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,640
How can these villains

492
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,590
be so proud of

493
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,520
the gross injustice they did

494
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,400
more than 20 years ago

495
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,110
while the good guys

496
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,970
were already buried in earth?

497
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
They are just spoiled

498
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,150
by the silence of many people.

499
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,600
My new poem

500
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,870
is a story about a deserter.

501
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,680
What’s interesting about a deserter?

502
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,190
What’s interesting about a hero?

503
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,310
For the leisure time,

504
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,190
why don’t we have some stories
about being a coward?

505
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,160
Alright, alright.

506
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,070
If there is a chance,

507
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,830
I will tell the whole world

508
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,400
with eagerness and zest

509
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,350
that you, Xie Yun, are not a coward.

510
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,420
Thank you then.

511
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,110
You can go on

512
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,520
with your story about the deserter.

513
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,680
I really want to listen to it.

514
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,230
Before he became a deserter,

515
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,690
he thought he was a great hero

516
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,230
who could return home in honor

517
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,500
and marry the girl he loved.

518
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,640
But later he found

519
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,430
that the government

520
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,800
didn’t need him at all

521
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,510
and even didn’t regard him as a human.

522
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,730
He was just a living bait
to lure the enemy.

523
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,560
His mission would be completed

524
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,860
the moment when he died.

525
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,180
So,

526
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,020
he fled away.

527
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,830
Anzhi,

528
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,350
with all my life’s work,

529
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,830
I temporarily shut

530
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,880
-the poison in your veins.
-Uncle!

531
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,800
After that, you can no longer
use martial arts,

532
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,680
but, live well on behalf of me.

533
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,590
And then? What are you thinking about?

534
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,190
What happened to that deserter?

535
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,770
Nothing.

536
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,920
But when the deserter returned home

537
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,830
after many difficulties,

538
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,360
he didn’t find his girl.

539
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,900
Why?

540
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Because that girl is a…

541
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,950
Weed Spirit.

542
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,480
She had left riding a carp.

543
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,590
I… I have had enough rest.

544
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,560
I’ll go find some food there.

545
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,920
Fei!

546
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,280
Fei!

547
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,680
Oh, no. Her pulse condition is bad.

548
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,230
It must be because of the two spirits.

549
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,760
What to do now?

550
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,430
Hengyang.

551
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,230
Someone in Hengyang can save her.

552
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,830
But…

553
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,760
But what? Go ahead.

554
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,920
She is on the move.

555
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,680
I’m not sure if she is in the city.

556
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,200
We have to give it a try.

557
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,610
Who is it?

558
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,230
Fei, if you can hear me,

559
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,630
do me a favor.

560
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,690
We should escape now to save you.

561
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,790
Your Majesty?

562
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,710
Greeting, Your Majesty.

563
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,900
General Feiqing?

564
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,280
You’ve really kept a close following.

565
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,410
Your Majesty,

566
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,120
I have asked the soldiers to go back.

567
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,910
I have been waiting for you here.

568
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,320
Hope you can be safe.

569
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,430
What happened to Miss Zhou?

570
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,630
It’s a long story.

571
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,950
The situation is bad now anyway.

572
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,750
Your Majesty, please go back with me.

573
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,910
Miss Zhou’s disease

574
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,430
can’t be healed by the surgeon.

575
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,390
A master in Hengyang city can help her.

576
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,950
General Wen, see you.

577
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,950
But…

578
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,190
But what?

579
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,560
If something happens to Miss Zhou,

580
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,760
can you bear the blame?

581
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,150
General Wen,

582
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,760
if you really want to help,

583
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,470
you can help Miss Zhou to send

584
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,690
Miss Wu back to Mr. Gantang.

585
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,280
Miss Wu, you…

586
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,460
I’m willing to go with him.

587
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,150
Then, Fei is up to you.

588
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,870
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

589
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,640
Your Majesty, take care!

590
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,560
Dad, it hurts!

591
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,730
Fei,

592
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,720
does it still hurt now?

593
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,230
Yes.

594
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,790
What’s wrong?

595
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,950
Dad, why is

596
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,870
your back so hard today?

597
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,710
Hang in there, Fei.

598
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,800
Dad,

599
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,660
why is your back so hard?

600
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Fei, what are you talking about?

601
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,190
Dad, when did you lose weight?

602
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,360
Your back feels harder than before.

603
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Then please bear with it for now,

604
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,600
Yun.

605
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,860
Oh, it’s you. I mistook you.

606
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,990
What did you call me?

607
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,490
I said

608
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,190
if I have a daughter,

609
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,620
her childhood name would be Yun.

610
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,090
Someone mistook me as her dad.

611
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,470
What a girl.

612
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,140
Why are you still so naughty
when you got hurt?

613
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,190
Where are we going?

614
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
Just stay still.

615
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,670
We’re about to arrive in Hengyang.

616
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,610
Can you hold on any longer?

617
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,610
Yes. Faster. Be faster.

618
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,820
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

619
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,910
Leader,

620
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,010
it’s the fifth letter.

621
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,370
If Lord Gantang still doesn’t reply,

622
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,770
I’m afraid…

623
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,170
Steward Ma,

624
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,320
I need you to do me a favor.

625
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,600
Leader, please go ahead.

626
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,190
I could not get away from

627
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,320
the complicated affairs here.

628
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,670
Miss Wang has gone out for months

629
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,320
but we haven’t heard anything from her.

630
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,560
I don’t know if she has met
the children of General Wu.

631
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,800
Other elders haven’t gone out for long.

632
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,230
The situation outside is complicated.

633
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,470
After I thought about it,

634
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,080
I could only ask you to go out
to have a check.

635
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
It’s my job.

636
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,390
And, our secret service…

637
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,510
Leader, what’s the order about it?

638
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,000
Never mind.

639
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,280
Let’s talk about it later.

640
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,120
The first thing to do is to find
the children back.

641
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,630
Aunt. Aunt.

642
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,430
Sheng and Fei have gone out.

643
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,040
Only I am left here.

644
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,830
I can’t stand it!

645
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,230
What are you doing?

646
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,140
Just say it.

647
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,910
Uncle Ma,

648
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,910
look how poor I am!

649
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,670
They all abandoned me.

650
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,080
Who dares to abandon you?

651
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,190
Everyone here can’t

652
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,390
love you more.

653
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,630
-Who dares to leave you alone?
-Ma Jili!

654
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,190
She is so spoiled

655
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,470
and starts to be so unreasonable.

656
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,710
Auntie,

657
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,520
just let me follow Uncle Ma

658
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,320
to go out to find them.

659
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,190
I miss them!

660
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,950
I miss them so much!

661
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Leader,

662
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,710
how about I take Yan’er
with me this time?

663
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,710
OK! Great!

664
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,600
Alright. Alright.

665
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,340
<i>Letter from Li Jinrong</i>

666
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,630
How many letters are there?

667
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,950
Lord,

668
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,270
it’s already the fifth letter.

669
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,540
The time between the letters became
shorter and shorter.

670
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,450
Looks like Li Jinrong starts to worry.

671
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,230
The fish is going to bite the hook.

672
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,120
Ask Gu Tianxian to get prepared.

673
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,320
Yes.

674
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,840
By the way,

675
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,930
I need to go to Hengyang

676
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,840
to meet an old friend of mine.

677
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,910
We will arrive at the Fortress

678
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,320
after days on this road.

679
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,910
I don’t know how my aunt
and other elders

680
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,870
will scold me.

681
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,670
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

682
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,080
Hyah! Hyah!

683
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,320
Hyah! Hyah!

684
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,630
Hyah!

685
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,760
Lord.

686
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,670
Lord.

687
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,280
We have been rushing for days.

688
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,500
<i>Gu Tianxian Demons Manor Giant Leopard</i>
How about we have a short rest here?

689
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,860
<i>Gu Tianxian Demons Manor Giant Leopard</i>

690
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>Gu Tianxian Demons Manor Giant Leopard</i>
No.

691
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,150
We don’t have much time.

692
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,560
Our people

693
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,470
in Hengyang are still waiting for us.

694
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,150
In such a crisis,

695
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,750
they can’t take actions

696
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,840
without me.

697
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,730
They are people from Demons Manor.

698
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
What are they doing here?

699
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,000
Lord, if our time is limited,

700
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,230
I have an idea to save time.

701
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,800
Go ahead.

702
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,630
In the forest, there is

703
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,710
a path leading to Hengyang City.

704
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,080
If we take that path,

705
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,470
it will take less time.

706
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,360
That’s alright.

707
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,490
Then we can have a rest here

708
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,320
and after that

709
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,840
we can take the path

710
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,560
to go to the mountains.

711
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,360
Yes.

712
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,600
Hengyang?

713
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,000
What are they planning to do?

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
Miss Wu, I’m sorry

715
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,800
to let you take such a rough road.

716
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,230
But it’s safe here.

717
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,800
It’s more hidden than the high road.

718
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,630
General, it’s OK.

719
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,390
We can go faster actually.

720
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,790
Don’t delay the whole journey.

721
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,560
I wonder how Fei is now.

722
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Miss, please don’t worry.

723
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,760
His Majesty is there.

724
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,150
Miss Zhou must be safe.

725
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,440
That’s good.

726
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,750
Miss, be careful.

727
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,940
General, what’s wrong?

728
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,460
It’s a trap made by the hunters.

729
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,420
Looks like

730
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,110
there are many traps in this forest.

731
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,230
Listen, Miss Wu.

732
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,120
Please wait for me here.

733
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,600
I’ll go explore the way.
I’ll be right back.

734
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,710
General, take care.

735
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,470
Are you General Wu’s daughter?

736
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,510
Who are you?

737
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,390
Fei and I saw your portrait once.

738
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:19,950
I…

739
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,040
No time to explain.

740
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,280
People from the Demons Manor are behind.

741
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,150
You have to hide first.

742
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,040
Hurry up.

743
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,950
There are all traps.

744
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,080
Traps?

745
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,040
There. Let’s go there.

746
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,910
Sir,

747
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,250
why do you help me?

748
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,000
Listen,

749
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,230
I can get away safely.

750
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,280
But they can definitely recognize you.

751
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,430
If you are found,

752
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,870
both of us will be caught.

753
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,020
I’ll think of a way.

754
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,970
Take my sword for me.

755
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,280
Be careful.

756
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,520
Lord,

757
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,190
there is something in the forest ahead.

758
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,120
Go check it out.

759
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,910
-Yes.
-Yes.

760
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,000
Lord,

761
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,520
it’s a trap made by the hunters.

762
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,800
Someone fell into it.

763
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,630
Who is it?

764
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,280
It’s a young man around 20 years old.

765
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,150
I guess he is a passerby.

766
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,430
-Get him out to ask.
-Yes.

767
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,760
The hunters here are really cruel.

768
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,370
Get on.

769
00:45:23,743 --> 00:45:33,743

Who are you?

771
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,520
Sir,

772
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,010
I’m a local hunter.

773
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,760
Ow!

774
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,660
Hunter?

775
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,120
-Can a hunter fall into his own trap?
-It hurts!

776
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,040
You’re lying.

777
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,390
Tell me the truth!

778
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,520
Guys,

779
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,080
you’re not locals, right?

780
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,870
You don’t know it.

781
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,430
There are hundreds of

782
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,630
hunters in this forest.

783
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,520
And also, there are more than

784
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,230
hundreds of traps they made here.

785
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,600
We also don’t know where the traps are

786
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,520
more than a mile away from home.

787
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,000
More than hundreds of traps?

788
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,560
You two,

789
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,430
go check it out.

790
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

791
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,970
Giant Leopard?

792
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,780
Turns out he is one of the Demons,

793
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,090
