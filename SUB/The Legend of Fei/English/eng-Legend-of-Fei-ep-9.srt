is far better than I am.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,310
You’re Li Zheng, the South Blade?

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,840
Exactly.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,950

26
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,190

I was on my way to Huarong

34
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,000
and ran into

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,390
Mrs. Song and an infant being hunted.

36
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,000
I couldn’t sit by, so I helped.

Unexpectedly, they’re from Demons Manor.

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,530

She was lost when we were little
in the chaos of wars.

68

I’ve made up my mind.

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,040
I’ll take them with me to Huarong.

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,350

87

Mr. Li, I...

97
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,850
To be honest,

98
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,750

70 or 80.

116
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,580
I was married.

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,310
Though my wife passed away years ago,

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,670
I never stopped loving her.

119
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,600
I’m sorry I can’t accept your love.

120

you’re young.

122
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040

123
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,670

Miss Duan,

127

I regard you

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,200
as a bosom friend.

129
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,130
That’s all.

130
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,080
I don’t know when we’ll meet again.

131

what would you do after being rejected?

136
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,840
How could I know?

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,710
She’s weird.

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,760
How is the baby now?

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,670
The baby’s been in poor health.

140
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,840
Luckily, Mr. Zhu raised her.

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,980

142
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,500

143
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,210
Would you like a fight with me?

Ms. Duan.

147

Who taught you that?

150
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,490
My mother.

151
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,350
What could you learn from your mother?

152
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,700
She won’t train you hard.

153
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,760
Follow me.

155
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,330
Ms. Duan,

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,200
I’m clumsy with half

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,760
of the nine moves
of Snow-breaking Blade.

158
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,590
If you find it plain,

159
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,670
the reason lies with my incompetence,

160
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,860
not the moves themselves.

161
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,670
You’re so nagging for a young girl.

162
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,750
As Li Zheng was.

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,390
Ms. Duan, forgive me.

164
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,280
Interesting.

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,110
This

166

is wind capturing.

167
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,320
Did you get it?

168
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,540
Got it.

169
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,460
Well, you’re poorer with

170
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,340
Snow-breaking Blade
than your grandfather.

171
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,240
What was that move of steps?

172
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,240
Mayfly Moves.

173
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,710
It seems Mayfly Moves are perfect

174
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,110
for Snow-breaking Blade.

175
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,520
You’re a little weak to practice

176
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Snow-breaking Blade.

177
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,910
Stronger than Li Sheng.

178
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,560
He doesn’t even get the blade.

179
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
It’s alright.

180
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,670
I’ll take my time.

181
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,400
That’s right.

182
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,200
From now on,

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,520
you need to practice harder.

184
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,960
When I built forces in my early days,

185
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,030
dozens of my peers practiced together.

186
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,110
In the first year,

187
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,260
half of them died.

188
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,260
In the second,

189
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,400
over half of the rest died, too.

190
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,200
Three years later,

191
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,910
only five survived.

192
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,930
You know why?

193
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,230
How could I know?

194
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,760
Each month, my master transferred

195
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,820
forces to our bodies.

196
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,230
You don’t know the feeling.

197
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,080
It’s like your body

198
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,830
is going to explode.

199
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,800
At this moment,

200
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,790
you need to bear the pain

201
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,030
and do everything you can

202
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,760
to control the forces.

203
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,150
It took three years to build our bodies.

204
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,470
Another two years later,

205
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,540
there were only a senior and me.

206
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,370
So?

207
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,600
From now on,

208
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,430
learn from me, your grandmother.

209
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Yellow and Green Palm?

210
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,520
Yeah.

211
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,480
Like you said,

212
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,550
I’m poorer than my grandfather

213
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,880
and too weak.

214
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,280
I’m not proficient in blade yet.

215
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,590
Is it a little early?

216
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,300
Your choice.

217
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,880
A world’s top martial artist

218
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
as a county governor’s concubine.

219
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,470
What a pity!

220
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,390
Ms. Duan,

221
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
why don’t you

222
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,670
leave this damn place?

223
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,740
Come to the Fortress with me.

224
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,850
Come to the Fortress with me.

225
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,020
Come to the Fortress with me.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,460
Li Zheng!

227
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,550
Li Zheng, get out!

228
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,030
Coward!

229
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,900
What a man are you to hide inside?

230
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,320
Be a man and meet my challenge.

231
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,780
If you don’t come out,

232
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,260
I’ll wait until you do.

233
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,370
Who are you?

234
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,620
How dare you make a fuss
at the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

235
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,960
and call Li Zheng’s name?

236
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,560
Judging by your appearance,

237
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,910
you must be Li Zheng’s daughter.

238
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,780
He brought you up once.

239
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,400
Young, but hot-tempered.

240
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,230
Who are you? Answer me.

241
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,570
Why are you here?

242
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,350
Don’t be rude.

243
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,550
We’re about the same age.

244
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,000
But perhaps,

245
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
you need

246
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,790
to call me,

247
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,500
Mother.

248
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,560
Crazy woman.

249
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,520
If you run your mouth again,

250
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,800
there’ll be consequences.

251
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,640
Good.

252
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,520
I wonder what consequences I’ll have.

253
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,880
Jinrong.

254
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,790
Stop.

255
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,060
Mr. Li.

256
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,370
Miss Duan,

257
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,650
why are you making a scene?

258
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,570
I’m not making a scene.

259
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,000
I’m challenging you.

260
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Are you taking the challenge?

261
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,500
Alright. Come at me.

262
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,760
Why didn’t you draw your blade?

263
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,150
Are you looking down on me?

264
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,380
Or are you afraid of losing your fame?

265
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:47,980
Alright.

266
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,470
As you wish.

267
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,170
I don’t need your hand.

268
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,750
Mr. Li.

269
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,070
What move is that?

270
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,460
Edgeless.

271
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,380
Edgeless?

272
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,580
Edgeless?

273
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,950
Alright.

274
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,640
I’ll break your Edgeless.

275
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,830
You’ll see.

276
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,180
Father,

277
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,830
this woman is so unreasonable.

278
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,470
If she comes again,

279
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,110
I’ll kick her away for you.

280
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,120
You’re no match for her.

281
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,630
She’s proficient
at Yellow and Green Palm.

282
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,110
You’d better have her watched

283
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,290
in case she does anything stupid.

284
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,620
Windless in the open field.

285
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,840
Then I’ll make it no longer windless.

286
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,430
Capture the wind.

287
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,450
I’ll break your Edgeless.

288
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,430
Did she remember anything?

289
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,560
Li Zheng, the South Blade

290
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,190
doesn’t deserve his fame.

291
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,230
You can defame anyone else,

292
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,040
but not Mr. Li.

293
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,220
Mr. Li?

294
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,130
Sounds intimate.

295
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,580
Are you his mistress?

296
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,530
Come again?

297
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,590
What can you do about it?

298
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,560
Watch out.

299
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,280
You’re poisoned. Try not to move.

300
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,350
Or you’ll die faster.

301
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,920
Twining Thread.

302
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,640
Are you Pathetic Clam?

303
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,110
It’s me.

304
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,040
You think I would

305
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,190
be afraid of a tiny needle?

306
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,840
No need to fight her.

307
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,350
Inform the Fortress of the Forty-Eight
with this chess piece.

308
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,760
Make sure Li Zheng gets the news

309
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,040
that Duan Jiuniang is poisoned.

310
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,830
Mr. Li.

311
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,830
Are you alright?

312
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,590
I’m fine.

313
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,960
Miss Duan,

314
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,230
why did you pick at those
from Demons Manor?

315
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,540
Mr. Li,

316
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,960
I thought

317
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,250
I wouldn’t make it

318
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,470
and wouldn’t have a chance

319
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,790
to take my pearl back from you.

320
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,430
I’m so happy

321
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,380
that you came

322
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,290
and saved me with your forces.

323
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,820
Don’t mention it.

324
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,400
Why can’t you admit

325
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,590
that you have feelings for me?

326
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
You do love me, Mr. Li.

327
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,110
You have grudges with them.

328
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,710
Why can’t you restrain yourself

329
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,340
and save the troubles?

330
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,470
If I were a little late,

331
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,540
you’d be dead by now.

332
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,700
For the last time,

333
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,200
we won’t be lovers

334
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,720
ever.

335
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,430
You know my capability.

336
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,740
How could I eat dirt?

337
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
Who are you to me

338
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,180
to give this reprimand?

339
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,520
I was too careless this time.

340
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,680
If, one day,

341
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,590
I’m to be killed on street,

342
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,340
I won’t ask for your help.

343
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,680
<i>Deny Yourself Return to Propriety</i>

344
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,100
Ms. Duan.

345
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,120
Why would I go to the Fortress?

346
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,620
To be a widow?

347
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,720
You finally got it.

348
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,110
Got what?

349
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,100
In the vast world,

350
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,380
why would I go to the Fortress?

351
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,810
Away from the outside,

352
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,930
you hole up here.

353
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,640
Why would I go with you?

354
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,860
Yeah.

355
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,830
Why?

356
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,040
I can’t win anyone with my blade.

357
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,620
It’s hard for me to get out.

358
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,020
Why would she go with me?

359
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,260
What are you doing?

360
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,450
Fei!

361
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,690
Fei!

362
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,290
Miss Zhou!

363
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,450
Ms. Duan.

364
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,810
What are you doing?

365
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,450
Giving her the Yellow and Green Spirit.

366
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,900
There are two types

367
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
of the spirit.

368
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,020
My stubborn master won’t give us both.

369
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,660
Mine

370
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,900
-is the yellow one,
-Fei!

371
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,100
like withered leaves in strong wind

372
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,260
and surging torrent in the estuary.

373
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,500
Let’s see if her power channels

374
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,260
can hold the vital forces.

375
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,050
Come on. Get up.

376
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,260
-What did you learn?
-Easy.

377
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
Which weapon do you use?

378
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,860
Which school are you from?

379
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,810
Hey!

380
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,050
You guys from the righteous sects

381
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,450
are so rigid.

382
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,860
You teach the disciples

383
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,120
we practice martial arts to keep fit.

384
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Isn’t the purpose

385
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,900
of martial arts to survive in crisis?

386
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,570
Without this spirit,

387
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,570
what’s its difference

388
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,960
with acrobat?

389
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,280
Answer me.

390
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,100
You keep silent again.

391
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,820
Ms. Duan,

392
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,780
after all, Fei

393
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,860
is Mr. Li’s granddaughter,

394
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,220
a junior to you.

395
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,740
Are you sure you want her to suffer?

396
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,840
Please save her.

397
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,350
You’re right.

398
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,860
But my hands are tied.

399
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,050
The Spirit is in her body

400
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,690
and cannot be withdrawn.

401
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,840
It’s up to her.

402
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,780
If she’s Mr. Li’s descendant,

403
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,820
she should be able to endure it.

404
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,330
If she’s a useless loser,

405
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,100
it’s better that she dies here

406
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,830
than being killed by others.

407
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,440
<i>Stable as Mount Tai</i>

408
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,000
Lord,

409
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,980
the news of Chen Zichen

410
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,500
being trapped in Huarong is out.

411
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,030
We got news from Lord Tong

412
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,930
that Huo Liantao

413
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,140
is preparing for a move.

414
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,900
Good.

415
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,930
As I expected,

416
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,570
he’s still here.

417
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,660
It’s a surprise

418
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,510
Huo Liantao is willing

419
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
to be at Chen Zichen’s beck and call.

420
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,790
Then I’ll give him a surprise.

421
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,330
Pass my order.

422
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,740
Leave a squad here

423
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,170
in Huarong.

424
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,930
The rest of you, come with me

425
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,490
to Huo’s Manor.

426
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,530
Aye, Lord.

427
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,780
-Your Highness,
-What’s the news?

428
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,290
Mr. Xie,

429
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,500
Timber Wolf is going out of town.

430
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Good. It’s our chance.

431
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Come with me.

432
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,780
Have you found

433
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,380
that they wear masks

434
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,260
and identify each other by tokens?

435
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,210
Take a break.

436
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,900
We’ll soon set out.

437
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,740
Hou You,

438
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,570
take a squad and stay behind.

439
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,810
I got other assignment for you.

440
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,030
Sure.

441
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,890
Come with me.

442
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,050
The rest go with me and Lord Shen

443
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,530
to Huo’s Manor after the break.

444
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,690
Jiachen,

445
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,930
when one’s alone,

446
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,530
kill him

447
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,620
and go out in his identity.

448
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,780
Aye, Lord.

449
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,960
<i>Huarong</i>

450
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,280
<i>Fresh Flowers</i>

451
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,660
When Timber Wolf leaves,

452
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,620
Mr. Bai will swoop in

453
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,660
and kill Qiu Tianjin’s hounds.

454
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,780
Mr. Bai, please improvise

455
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,330
in the disguise

456
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,810
of Shen Tianshu.

457
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,530
Look.

458
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,500
Come on.

459
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,570
Who is it?

460
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,230
-Lord.
-Lord.

461
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,180
Do you have any orders?

462
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,210
In that case,

463
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,050
Qiu Tianjin will find his men

464
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,880
disappear mysteriously.

465
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,840
He’ll investigate it in the city.

466
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,580
When he finds out it’s Shen Tianshu,

467
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,020
they will certainly fall out.

468
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,170
-Be honest with it,
-We really don’t know.

469
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,410
or I’ll kill you.

470
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,380
-Please.
-Don’t kill me. Mercy.

471
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,810
Lord,

472
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,100
our men’s bones are fractured.

473
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,980
And nothing strange

474
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,820
was found on their facial expressions.

475
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,660
That being said...

476
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,920
Shen Tianshu,

477
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,120
how dare you kill my men?

478
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,810
Your Highness.

479
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,330
As Mr. Xie expected,

480
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,100
Qiu Tianjin is uneasy

481
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,930
and suspicious of Timber Wolf.

482
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,930
But so far,

483
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,690
the deployment of the gate guards

484
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,470
is unchanged.

485
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,810
The gate guards

486
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,860
will focus on people trying to escape.

487
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,260
But they won’t check their peers.

488
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,990
In their mindset,

489
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,320
Blessed Dog has cleared the moles.

490
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,530
They believe no one would

491
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,970
use the same plot again.

492
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,780
As for the soldiers,

493
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,080
they won’t check thugs

494
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,860
from Demons Manor.

495
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,650
Because they’ve noted the governor,

496
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:26,860
who

497
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,140
would give anything for you to leave.

498
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,780
You offer free porridge to refugees.

499
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,380
It’s considered to be a favor to him.

500
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,100
So he would hope you to leave safe.

501
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,780
The governor

502
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,680
isn’t a bad man.

503
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,690
We can’t choose where we live

504
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,100
but we can choose what a life to live.

505
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,000
Zichen,

506
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,560
this is the best chance
when you can get out.

507
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,880
You don’t devise the strategy

508
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,900
just for my sake,

509
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
but also to take revenge

510
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,620
on Demons Manor

511
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,900
for your friends died in the inn,
do you?

512
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,900
General Wu Fei’s families

513
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,380
are loyal and heroic.

514
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,070
I can’t let them swallow the insult.

515
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,690
You and I are as close as brothers.

516
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,290
I’ll clear up the mess for you

517
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,860
even if it’s life-threatening.

518
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,900
One stone, two birds.

519
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,560
Why not?

520
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,020
You’re not a gorgeous lady.

521
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,620
Please

522
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,110
don’t ask such stupid question anymore.

523
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,620
Right. Thank you, Yun.

524
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:32,900
Zichen,

525
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,120
I took care of you when you were little.

526
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,070
I didn’t learn much in the last years.

527
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,780
Just something superficial.

528
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,560
So a piece of advice.

529
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,590
Don’t get involved
in the martial circle.

530
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,260
Go back to your father.

531
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,400
Focus on study and governance.

532
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,810
Yun,

533
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,760
you should know

534
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,620
the struggle in my family

535
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,980
is complicated.

536
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,040
Only you can help me.

537
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,780
If you promise to help,

538
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,140
the cause here

539
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,810
will be ours...

540
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,370
Zichen,

541
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,110
mind your tongue.

542
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,940
Alright.

543
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,140
You don’t want anything to do with it.

544
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,460
Doesn’t it hurt you

545
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,940
to see the people lose their homes

546
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,010
and become the spoil

547
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,940
of endless wars?

548
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,720
We’re different.

549
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,250
At present,

550
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,540
all parties barely maintain a balance.

551
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,900
My return

552
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,470
will surely spark unrest.

553
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,570
More lives will be lost

554
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,550
and more suffer will come.

555
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,180
If you said so,

556
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,380
I won’t keep persuading.

557
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,580
Yun,

558
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,350
you’ll be alone here.

559
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,750
Take care of yourself.

560
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,140
Thank you.

561
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,000
Mr. Bai.

562
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:48,770
Yes.

563
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,570
Stay behind

564
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,140
and help for a couple of days.

565
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,640
Yes.

566
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,660
Do not turn me down.

567
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,850
I’d like to thank you
for saving my life.

568
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,030
Alright.

569
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,250
Zichen, bless you.

570
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,690
Take care.

571
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,250
Stop!

572
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,380
Who are you?

573
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,050
Don’t you know

574
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,420
no one leaves without a permit?

575
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,790
I’m asking you.

576
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,620
Guys, he’s trying to escape.

577
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,010
Get them.

578
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,140
They went that way.

579
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,730
-Go now!
-Move! Move!

580
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,680
-Hurry!
-Get them!

581
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,000
<i>Huarong</i>

582
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,320
<i>Huarong</i>

583
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,530
Go, go, go. Get them!

584
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,900
They went that way.

585
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,100
Go! Get them.

586
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,660
Madam,

587
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,940
didn’t the other men agree

588
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,980
to meet up

589
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
at the rendezvous nearby?

590
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,730
We’ve been on the journey for two days,

591
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,840
yet there’s not a soul.

592
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,520
Perhaps,

593
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,580
they’re caught up.

594
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,250
Let’s get

595
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,140
to the closest safe house

596
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,400
and wait for them.

597
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,810
Men from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

598
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,620
Bloody Cricket’s token.

599
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,940
Father!

600
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,600
He must be Tong Tianyang,

601
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,220
the man who killed my father.

602
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,530
Sheng, calm down.

603
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,050
He has followers.

604
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,730
We’re outnumbered.

605
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,770
It’s not a good time to attack.

606
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,570
Wei Wu,

607
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,970
take the men

608
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,460
and keep searching around Huarong.

609
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,290
My...

610
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,380
My wound isn’t healed.

611
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,020
I can’t go fast.

612
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,700
I’ll head to Huo’s Manor

613
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,470
and wait for our lord.

614
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,260
Yes.

615
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,860
Everyone,

616
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,980
come with me.

617
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,810
Good opportunity.

618
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,660
I’ll kill you for my father.

619
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,330
My lord.

620
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,140
Who is he?

621
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,570
The governor.

622
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,250
Jiuniang,

623
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,980
it’s your sister’s death anniversary
tomorrow.

624
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,500
But men from Demons Manor
gather in the city.

625
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,110
I’m gonna be busy.

626
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,460
Can you please

627
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,730
go to her tomb for me?

628
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,100
Me?

629
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,250
On that day each year,

630
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,580
you go and visit her.

631
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,160
My sister

632
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,240
would be so grateful to you.

633
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,120
If I go this year,

634
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,660
my sister will be happy.

635
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,520
I’ll go.

636
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,260
You seem happy lately.

637
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,370
Of course.

638
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,950
I have visitors to have fun with me.

639
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,100
Fei.

640
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,430
Shh.

641
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,050
Hold on.

642
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,490
Blooms and swallows

643
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,730
are your friends.

644
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,810
How I envy

645
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,660
such a life!

646
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,100
My lord, visitors from Demons Manor.

647
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,940
Let’s go.

648
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,530
Jiuniang seems happy lately

649
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,620
and has a good appetite.

650
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,530
From now on,

651
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,490
send more food to her place.

652
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:36,960
Yes.

653
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,040
Sheng.

654
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,700
Sheng.

655
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,360
Where is he?

656
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,650
Sheng.

657
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,650
Where did he go?

658
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,490
Hong Yun,

659
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,530
Sheng is gone.

660
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,450
Find him.

661
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,810
Yes, Madam.

662
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,970
Murderer,

663
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,970
you plot your wound?

664
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,700
You’re just a callow loser.

665
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,010
Yes, I cheated you.

666
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,310
What can you do?

667
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,620
You will meet your end.

668
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,770
Brat,

669
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,900
you’ll meet your end.

670
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460
Old fool,

671
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,490
are you blind

672
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,010
stepping in my way?

673
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,050
Lord.

674
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,310
Shen Tianshu.

675
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,490
You must be the widow

676
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,330
of Xiaoxiang Sect’s leader.

677
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,140
Well,

678
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,940
it’s a pleasure

679
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,980
to meet you today.

680
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,360
I have no interest in your business.

681
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,900
Leave the disciple alone

682
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,000
and there’ll be no troubles.

683
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,530
I

684
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,070
will not be in your way.

685
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,530
But what I’m going to do

686
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,160
has to be kept absolutely confidential.

687
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,940
Madam, don’t blame me.

688
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,770
It’s not your lucky day.

689

00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,460
Go!

694
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,290
Run!

695
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,290
Is this the end?

696
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,380
Yes. Even if I have to die,

697
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,900
Sheng has to be safe.

698
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,060
Madam.

699
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,220
I can’t protect you anymore.

700
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,250
I let the Leader down.

701
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,730
Go! Run!

702
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,630
Madam.

703
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,660
