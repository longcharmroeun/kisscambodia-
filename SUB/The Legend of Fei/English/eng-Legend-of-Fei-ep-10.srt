<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,940
<i>Episode 10</i>

17
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,700
Take it easy.

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
Who are you?

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,100
Just a passerby.

20
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,990
Thank you.

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,270
Where are you going?

22
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,620
Go back to them.

23
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,950
I managed to get you out.

24
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,920
But you still want to go back there?

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,640
I… I can’t

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,810
leave them there.

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,300
Ms. Duan,

28
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,140
when will Fei wake up?

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,660
Weird.

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,410
It’s really weird.

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,100
People who meet
the Yellow and Greed Spirit

32
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,110
can’t hang in there for more than
six hours usually.

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,670
But it’s been a day.

34
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,180
She is still like this.

35
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,600
She was in normal condition.

36
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,600
If not for you,

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,040
she wouldn’t have become like this.

38
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,910
By the way, Ms. Duan,

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,110
why doesn’t your master

40
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,410
teach you the Yellow and Green Palm?

41
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,360
He doesn’t have good intentions.

42
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,030
He just wants to practice on us.

43
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,280
He won’t teach us anything.

44
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,040
Isn’t he afraid that you will
teach each other?

45
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,240
Of course we can’t.

46
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,270
The Yellow and Green Palm

47
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,080
is the most

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,110
bullying martial art in the world.

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,720
Once you start to practice it,

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,720
it can’t be compatible with
other martial arts,

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,680
including the Yellow and Greed Spirit.

52
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,910
But Fei also have been practicing other

53
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,870
martial arts for years.

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,130
I don’t think her skills are good.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,300
It’s useless.

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,160
If they really do repel each other,

57
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,890
just scrap her former martial arts.

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,100
The new should replace the old.

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,270
The key to be a free strong person

60
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,920
lies not in the success of civil,

61
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,680
nor in the force,

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,020
but in your heart.

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Fei.

64
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,200
If you are still alive,

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,590
please hang in there

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,040
until I find you.

67
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,830
Someone gave it to me.

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,410
I don’t know where to put it.

69
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,720
It will be easy to wear it.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,810
Mr. Xie,

71
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,880
my heelers found that

72
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,790
the people of Blessed Dog is still
searching the city.

73
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,920
They are still searching?

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,430
Yes.

75
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,600
That means

76
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,480
they haven’t found the survivor in

77
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,430
the Wu’s.

78
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,820
They also didn’t get what they want.

79
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,290
He must be helped by a master

80
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,400
to be able to hide for so long.

81
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,820
Could it be…?

82
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,940
Fei, you’re awake.

83
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,670
Why can’t I feel any of my force?

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,000
I’ve blocked two of your
internal forces for now.

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,580
How do you feel?

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,900
For now?

87
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,210
Yeah. Just for now.

88
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,380
After you have enough rest,

89
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,320
I will get rid of your force.

90
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,250
Then you can join my sect successfully.

91
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,440
I never said I’ll be your student.

92
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
Yellow and Green Palm is unparalleled
in the world.

93
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,420
Isn’t it good to be my student?

94
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,200
What’s more, with your condition now,

95
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,450
if you don’t get something new,

96
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,100
you will be dead.

97
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,170
Yellow and Green Palm is nothing!

98
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,350
You don’t even deserve to carry
the shoes of our South Blade!

99
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,590
I don’t want any of your things.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,200
Do you dare say it again?

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,640
What if I say it ten times?

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,320
Madam! Madam!

103
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,120
Young Master is waiting for you.

104
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,470
Please go now.

105
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,500
Fei, don’t worry.

106
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,550
She won’t come back

107
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,140
after she heard that.

108
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,350
Ms. Song,

109
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,000
who is the young master you mean?

110
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,560
It’s the son of Ms. Duan’s sister.

111
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,900
Also, the young master of this mansion.

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,440
After she went crazy,

113
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,620
these are the only things and people
she concerns about.

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,760
Sister! Sister!

115
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,600
Sister!

116
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,310
Baoshan, Baoshan…

117
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,540
Baoshan is OK.

118
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,400
Jiuniang,

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,740
I have two things to entrust to you.

120
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,950
I’m willing to

121
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
no matter how many they are.

122
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,330
These things

123
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,980
may hurt you.

124
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,700
But you are the only

125
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,910
family I have in this world.

126
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,250
First,

127
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,410
take good care of this kid

128
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,430
and watch him grow up.

129
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,650
Second,

130
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,660
never go to disturb Zhu.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,810
I have written a letter to him.

132
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,830
He will take care of you

133
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,440
and the kid.

134
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,230
Sister! Sister! Sister!

135
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,350
Ms. Zhou,

136
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,110
Madam gave you the spirit

137
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,180
is for your own good.

138
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,940
Why do you…

139
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,320
Where… Where was

140
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,550
Ms. Wang buried?

141
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,060
Just behind you.

142
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
The walking stick was broken.

143
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,250
I fixed it.

144
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,810
Ms. Wang, don’t stop me.

145
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
My father was killed by him.

146
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,880
The rebellion that year was because
of the Demons Manor.

147
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,960
The Reason why Jinrong

148
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,030
never mentioned the rebellion

149
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,590
before you

150
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,410
is that she doesn’t want you to grow up
with hatred.

151
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Don’t grow up with hatred.

152
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,630
Ms. Wang,

153
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,740
I got you killed.

154
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,960
It’s not for you to drink.

155
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,070
It’s for the memorial ceremony.

156
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,350
Only this little?

157
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,340
It’s far from enough.

158
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,590
Just to show your sincerity.

159
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,610
Boy,

160
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,520
where are you from?

161
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,960
I…

162
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Wait. Don’t say it now.

163
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,180
Let me guess.

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,930
Well, I can’t.

165
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,000
-I…
-Wait!

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,670
Give me another chance.

167
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,670
I think you are…

168
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,640
Forget it. Just tell me.

169
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,790
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

170
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,520
I’m… Li Sheng.

171
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,140
Fortress of the Forty-Eight again?

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
What do you mean by “again”?

173
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,910
Have you ever met any other people

174
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,350
from there?

175
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,030
Any?

176
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,400
I met a lot of you guys!

177
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,790
I even gave a girl

178
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,800
of your sect a “Tao Teh King”.

179
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,880
A girl?

180
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,350
Yeah, a girl,

181
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,470
who seems to be at the same age as you.

182
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,710
But her martial art
is better than yours.

183
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,080
Could it be Zhou Fei?

184
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,790
She is really called Zhou Fei!

185
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,700
Young boy,

186
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,310
you’re not as strong as her,

187
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,280
but you

188
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
are righteous

189
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,190
and from a famous sect.

190
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,280
I think you can come back with me
to Qi School.

191
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,320
We have a lot of treasures for you.

192
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,540
Thanks for saving me.

193
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,910
But I have been outside for long

194
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,130
and so many things happened.

195
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,150
I have to go back to the Fortress

196
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,610
to report to Auntie.

197
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,280
And wait for

198
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,450
her disposal.

199
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,150
Are you really not going with me?

200
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,960
I do have good things for you.

201
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,710
No.

202
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,670
I need to go back first.

203
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,640
I’ll come to you later.

204
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,910
You know where Qi School is?

205
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,320
No.

206
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,200
Then how will you come to me?

207
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,550
But,

208
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,590
I still have to go back first.

209
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,690
Sir, what’s wrong?

210
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,910
My leg got hurt

211
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,910
while I was helping you.

212
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,200
Let me have a check.

213
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,840
No.

214
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,150
Don’t bother.

215
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,740
I know what’s wrong with me.

216
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,880
I can tell that you value righteousness

217
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,200
and are grateful.

218
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,150
But my leg…

219
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Go. Just go.

220
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
You should go back now.

221
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,880
Well, let me send you back first.

222
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,200
How could I do that?

223
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,470
Thank you then.

224
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,590
Sir.

225
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,190
I will go to Huo’s Manor.

226
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,110
<i>Tao Teh King</i>

227
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,940
I didn’t expect that this is

228
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,660
still with me.

229
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,490
What’s this?

230
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,810
It’s given by Mr. Chongxiaozi.

231
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Tao Teh King.

232
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,200
The handwriting is so terrible.

233
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,530
It’s even worse than mine.

234
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,880
This is like a big goat.

235
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,480
This is like a leaf.

236
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,960
This… is like

237
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,520
a chicken standing on only one leg.

238
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,230
Why did he give me this?

239
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,350
Dot stroke, short vertical stroke.

240
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,400
Dot stroke to step forward.

241
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,840
Short vertical stroke to step backward.

242
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,560
Walk around the stone,
with more than one enemy.

243
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,720
Mayfly Formation?

244
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,110
The formation can be drawn.

245
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,960
But the movements

246
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,790
can’t be stated clearly with
only some strokes.

247
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,350
Could it be…?

248
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,400
What’s wrong?

249
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,300
This…

250
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,640
This seems to be…

251
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,400
Can you read it?

252
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,210
Of course I know the characters on it.

253
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,270
But, what’s the meaning
of these patterns?

254
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,780
These patterns…

255
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,830
It’s Mayfly Formation.

256
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,680
It’s internal force.

257
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,390
Be careful.

258
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
It will be dangerous
if anything goes wrong.

259
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,090
Don’t act rashly. Don’t!

260
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,190
What if I just give it a try?

261
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,680
Anyway, if things go on like this,

262
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,110
I will be either dead in Huarong

263
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
or lose my martial arts

264
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,110
only to survive.

265
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,780
It can’t go any worse.

266
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Fengfu,

267
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,310
through Lingtai

268
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,570
to Mingguan.

269
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,900
Fei,

270
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,430
what’s wrong?

271
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,800
Let me help you.

272
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,900
My force is sealed up.

273
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,610
But why do I feel that

274
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,300
it’s being pulled out little by little?

275
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,910
The two forces are like having a fight.

276
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,580
<i>Deny Yourself Return to Propriety</i>

277
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>

278
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,620
Have you found it?

279
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,410
Junior Master, we have
searched everywhere.

280
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,450
Nothing was found.

281
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,080
Good-for-nothing!

282
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,560
Get lost!

283
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,170
Yes.

284
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,100
Where is the Seal of Cautiousness?

285
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,290
<i>Huo Changfeng Huo’s Manor</i>
What on earth do you want?

286
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,570
Brother,

287
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,930
give me the Seal of Cautiousness

288
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,100
and I’ll take you away.

289
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,570
It’s not safe here.

290
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,330
Let me take you to hide.

291
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,290
This is my house.

292
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,660
I won’t go anywhere.

293
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,900
The time for me to be awake

294
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,050
throughout the day is
getting less and less.

295
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,220
Brother,

296
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,840
the poison of Pathetic Clam is hard
to be dealt with,

297
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,800
but if you come with me

298
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,800
and after I become the leader,

299
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,510
I will find every antidote
in the world for you.

300
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,950
A loser like you is dreaming

301
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,240
of becoming the leader?

302
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,550
How arrogant!

303
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,050
I’ve had enough, too.

304
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,170
In the last days of my life,

305
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,100
I just want to stay with Huo’s Manor

306
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,980
and my roses.

307
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,290
My roses…

308
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,740
I do have one thing to ask

309
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,450
this time I come here.

310
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,810
Days ago,

311
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,660
Zheng Luosheng showed off to me

312
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,860
a scabbard that he treasured.

313
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,330
It was said to be

314
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,050
related to a secret treasure

315
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,480
and something with ripple pattern.

316
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,500
It occurred to me that the

317
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,810
Seal of Cautiousness with you
has that pattern.

318
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,810
So I came here especially to tell…

319
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,400
Xiaoqiao,

320
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,660
it’s been years.

321
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,810
But you mentioned
the ripple pattern directly.

322
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,400
Are you here just for the seal?

323
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,480
Please don’t get me wrong.

324
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,580
I am here because

325
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,450
Zheng Luosheng once said that

326
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,530
there is a shocking secret

327
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,090
behind that thing with ripple pattern.

328
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,290
I’m worried that you will

329
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,950
be in trouble because of the seal.

330
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,000
So I came by to remind you.

331
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,970
-Brother!
-Just leave.

332
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,690
You’d rather stay with the stupid roses

333
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,660
than leave with me?

334
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,810
Seal of Cautiousness!

335
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,380
Seal of Cautiousness!

336
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,100
I have been finding it for years.

337
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
But it’s just right here!

338
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,330
No wonder you stay with the roses
all the time.

339
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,530
You’re afraid that you will forget

340
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,380
where the seal is
after a long time, right?

341
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,450
It’s useless for you to take it.

342
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,140
-Give it back to me!
-Well, Brother…

343
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,290
Give me that!

344
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,380
I wonder where the ripple pattern

345
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,500
is on the seal.

346
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,530
None of your business!

347
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,500
As long as I have the seal,

348
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I will find the pattern one day!

349
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,450
Liantao,

350
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,050
both of us can’t know that secret!

351
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,920
<i>Cautiousness</i>

352
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Many things are involved!

353
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,780
Go away!

354
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,570
The seal

355
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,020
can’t be touched by ordinary people.

356
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,450
Don’t make a huge mistake!

357
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,170
Seal of Cautiousness!

358
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,660
Come back!

359
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,210
Come back…

360
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,530
Seal of Cautiousness…

361
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,810
Changfeng!

362
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,450
Come here.

363
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,280
Changfeng, what happened?

364
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,300
You are too late.

365
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,170
The Seal of Cautiousness

366
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,740
was taken away by my

367
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,960
evil brother.

368
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,140
We can find it back later.

369
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,380
Right.

370
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,210
You have to find it back.

371
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,050
It’s really important.

372
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,020
OK.

373
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,570
It’s

374
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,620
up to you now.

375
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,620
Don’t worry,

376
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,810
I won’t let you down.

377
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,690
What are you finding?

378
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,260
Where are my roses?

379
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,980
Here.

380
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,230
Look.

381
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,530
Over here.

382
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,980
My roses.

383
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,620
-My roses.
-Here.

384
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,100
You saved my life.

385
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,760
No matter how you scold me
and drive me away,

386
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,810
I’ll never complain.

387
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,890
As long as you give me the words,

388
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,480
I, Mu Xiaoqiao,

389
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,160
will always

390
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,230
be at your disposal.

391
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
I don’t need that.

392
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,080
Leave now!

393
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,570
Changfeng!

394
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,480
Changfeng!

395
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:51,930
Sir…

396
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,970
He has been poisoned for long

397
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,920
and got too excited.

398
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,940
I’m afraid no one can save him.

399
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:00,960
Changfeng!

400
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,070
My buddy.

401
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,480
Changfeng!

402
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,300
Master!

403
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,360
Almost everyone in the Huo’s Manor
has left!

404
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,680
<i>Huarong Granny Cao’s Incense Shop</i>

405
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,140
The two forces stopped fighting…

406
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,410
-…and blended together!
-Fei,

407
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,860
how do you feel?

408
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,290
But…

409
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,450
The Yellow and Green Spirit
is too bullying.

410
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,170
I still need some time.

411
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,780
Mr. Bai,

412
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,020
we will start our next plan.

413
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,380
Spread out all hands in Demons Manor.

414
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,020
Mr. Xie,

415
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,740
you’re drawing…

416
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,860
General Wu Fei’s daughter.

417
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,690
We use Miss Wu’s face

418
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,900
to distract Qiu Tianjin,

419
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,780
take advantage of the chaos

420
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,860
to help the one they are finding escape

421
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,380
and annihilate them at one stroke.

422
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,260
Mr. Xie,

423
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,780
you really have many good ideas.

424
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,260
Thank you.

425
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,520
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>

426
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,570
Master,

427
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,530
it’s not in the room.

428
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,330
Lord,

429
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,780
we have searched everywhere here.

430
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,930
We found nothing.

431
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,780
Where are you from?
You look like a mess.

432
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,620
Sixth Lord, Head Lord,

433
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,410
the people we left in Huarong

434
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,200
are all dead.

435
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,530
All dead?

436
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,960
The big shot hidden in Huarong
took actions?

437
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,210
No.

438
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,170
It was Blessed Dog.

439
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,930
Qiu Tianjin?

440
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,380
Why?

441
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,290
When did you offend him?

442
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:44,930
I have told you…

443
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,740
No!

444
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,570
We obeyed your order

445
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,930
and only searched in secret in and
out of the city.

446
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,610
We’re never in the way of Third Lord.

447
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,350
Go back to Huarong.

448
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,330
I’d like to see what Qiu Tianjin

449
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,500
is going to do.

450
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,810
Brother, I…

451
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,860
Let me go back with you.

452
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,930
Don’t bother.

453
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,930
Qiu Tianjin can’t cause big trouble.

454
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,050
You go back to report first.

455
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,380
Lord,

456
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,050
what about Huo Liantao?

457
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,860
Since the thing is gone,

458
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,540
it must be taken away by Huo Liantao.

459
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,490
Catch him.

460
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,090
Yes.

461
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,040
Who is that?

462
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,210
She is just a bandit.

463
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,360
I will go.

464
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,510
It’s so cold.

465
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,040
Come here.

466
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,650
Do you feel better now?

467
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,980
No. It’s still cold.

468
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,290
So cold.

469
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,900
Let me get you some fire.

470
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,740
Wait for me.

471
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,640
There is no charcoal.

472
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,260
I have to go out so get some.

473
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,360
Fei,

474
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,210
if you are still alive,

475
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,120
where are you hiding?

476
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,010
The places haven’t been searched.

477
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,740
One

478
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,040
is the place where dead bodies are.

479
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,410
Homeless bodies are usually placed

480
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,960
in temples.

481
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,410
Puning Temple?

482
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,030
The other is

483
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,100
the place their own people will be.

484
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,960
<i>Puning Temple</i>

485
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,860
House of the county government.

486
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,140
Third Lord.

487
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,020
How is it going?

488
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,620
We searched the houses and shops,

489
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,020
but we didn’t find the people we want.

490
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,500
Bastards!

491
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,400
Third Lord!

492
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,480
Third Lord!

493
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,690
Everything goes bad.

494
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,170
He still comes to disturb.

495
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:03,870
Let him leave.

496
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,620
You must have had a tiring day.

497
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,780
I asked the cooks

498
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,210
to prepare you some snacks and drinks.

499
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,450
It will quench your thirst.

500
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,660
Mr. Zhu, Third Lord doesn’t need that.

501
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,930
But I prepared that especially for you.

502
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,530
Our cooks all have good cooking skills.

503
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,380
I said we don’t need it.

504
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,500
Please go.

505
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,000
Wait.

506
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,550
Third Lord.

507
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,570
Turns out

508
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,810
we missed one place.

509
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,620
Come here.

510
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,380
Why are you running?

511
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,750
Didn’t you hear me?

512
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,310
Young Master!

513
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,220
Mr. Zhu’s son

514
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,830
is also the kid of Ms. Duan’s sister.

515
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,380
We can’t stay here any longer.

516
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,090
What should we do?

517
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,380
Why is she running?

518
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,740
Young Master, we got a new
batch of maids.

519
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,900
They don’t know the rules.

520
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,260
Don’t get mad at them.

521
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,210
She has a pretty face

522
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,740
but is so impolite.

523
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,460
Young Master!

524
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,570
Young Master!

525
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,140
The Third Lord of Demons Manor

526
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,380
is at the gate,

527
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,980
saying he has something to do.

528
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,740
Third Lord?

529
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,620
I don’t want to meet him.

530
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Young Master,

531
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,050
we can’t offend him.

532
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,900
Even Master is adulatory to him.

533
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,330
I think you have to meet him.

534
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,410
My dad is also there?

535
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:32,240
<i>No reserve in majesty</i>

536
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,660
Third Lord.

537
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,330
All the people here
have been summoned.

538
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,450
They will be here soon.

539
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,260
Please wait a moment.

540
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,980
Would you care for some tea?

541
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,260
No need.

542
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,040
<i>No reserve in majesty</i>

543
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,380
Fei,

544
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,770
are you ready?

545
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,530
Let me take you out together.

546
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,250
Fei,

547
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,380
-Snow-breaking Blade has nine movements.
-Wufeng?

548
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,100
Everyone has his own understanding.

549
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,860
You are…

550
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,460
Mine is Wufeng.

551
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Your mother’s is Wupi.

552
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,530
Grandpa?

553
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,860
So is yours.

554
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,180
Don’t be limited to only one movement.

555
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,530
Follow the force in your body

556
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,380
then you can use the sword freely.

557
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,860
Fei, have a try.

558
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,400
Follow the force in my body.

559
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,720
Don’t be limited to only one movement.

560
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,830
Again!

561
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,040
Draw!

562
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:23,980
Close!

563
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,640
Combine!

564
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,490
Point!

565
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,870
In!

566
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,160
It’s been two hours.

567
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,600
They must have found Miss Chuchu
in disguise.

568
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,360
Then the information will be spread out.

569
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,540
Fei,

570
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,570
if you can hear me,

571
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,360
remember to reply.

572
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,080
Stop!

573
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,810

574
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,100
Get her!

575
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,100
-Stop there!
-Make a way!

576
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,770
Stop running!

Sir.

People from Demons Manor?
It’s not a safe place now.

586
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,380
I have to tell Fei.

587
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,140
Sir, we found something ahead.

588
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,490
Everyone, withdraw!

589
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,620
Why do they leave suddenly?

590
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,290
Oh, no, I have to tell Fei.

592
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:32,770
I don’t know.

593
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,660
Are they the people from Demons Manor?

594
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,810
Why are they in our mansion?

00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,050

You,

604
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,050
take this new maid

605
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,810
to bring back Madam’s

606
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,810
new clothes outside the mansion.

Go now.

611
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,770
Are you sure it’s Ms. Wu?

612
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,660
It can’t be wrong.

613
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,490

How about

we ask for some servants

to go with us?

622
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,460
Look at you!

623
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,730
Why bother to be afraid?

624
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,380
We’re from the county government.

No matter how messy it is,

626
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,010
it has nothing to do with us.

627
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,050
Just go.

628
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,810
What are you doing?

629
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,050
Come on.

630

Yes!

646
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,250
What’s the matter in such a hurry?

647
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,620
I thought carefully

648
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,490
and found something weird.

649
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,530
What is it?

650
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,380
A maid looked strange just now.

651
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,570
It occurred to me

652

that I have never seen her.

653
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,490

Yes.

691
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,460
Take some people to the cloth shop.

692
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,180
Yes.

693
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,680
This way.

694
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,530
Boss,

695
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,180
are the clothes ready?

696
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,810
Madam is still waiting.

697
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,970
There is still a little bit.

698
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,480
Stop urging me.

699
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,050
It’s still not ready?

700
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,290
Almost. Wait a moment.

701
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,010
Sir,

702
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,050
I need to use the toilet.

703
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,810
In the back yard.

704
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,860
I will put the things here.

705
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,460
Here is it.

706
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,460
No. I know her. She is Cui.

707
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,380
Where is the girl with you?

708
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,180
Inside the shop.

709
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,140
Where is she?

710
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,770
Who do you mean?

711
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,140
You…

712
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,570
The girl to get the clothes!

713
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,900
In the back yard.

714
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,250
In the back yard!

715
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,050
Get her!

716
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,250
Stop there!

717
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,570
Don’t run!

718
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,290
Stop there!

719
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,570
Step aside!

720
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,810
Stop running!

721
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,700
Someone pretended to be me
to distract them.

722
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,820
I see!

723
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,670
It must be Xie.

724
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,010
Lord ordered days ago

725
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,810
to make more food for Madam.

726
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,490
She is in a good state lately

727
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,770
and can eat a lot.

728
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,010
Please make more food for her meals.

729
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,330
More food?

730
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,860
-I wondered where the girl was hiding.
-Call me anytime if you need help.

731
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,570
Something must be wrong.

732
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,400
I should go have a check.

733
00:44:16,644 --> 00:44:26,644

Isn’t she the fierce girl

735
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,010
in the Inn?

736
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,330
She is the one they are looking for?

737
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,570
Why is a girl missing?

738
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,010
Get up! How dare you steal things.

739
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,970
Madam, what’s up?

740
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,900
I got a thief.

741
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,080
Madam, this is Baoshan.

742
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,440
Mr. Xie.

743
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,790
Where is Fei?

744
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,820
Let’s go first. I will tell you later.

745
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,420
Stop there!

746
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,700
Ms. Duan! Please wait!

747
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,860
This is Mr. Xie.

748
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,880
He is Fei’s friend.

749
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,860
Ms. Duan, sorry for being rude.

750
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,860
Chuchu, where is Fei?

751
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,840
Fei got hurt. She is in the room.

752
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,310
Is he… her lover?
