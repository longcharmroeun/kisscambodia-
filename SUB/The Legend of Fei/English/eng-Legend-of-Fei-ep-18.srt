<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 18</i>

17
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,040
Luckily,

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,080
I ran into two people
and they led the way for me.

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,760
How do you know

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,230
they would come to me?

21
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,640
We met by chance.

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,550
Just by looking at her,

23
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,060
I know she practiced her
internal strength in a wrong way.

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,310
In Hengyang,

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,910
only Madam Nichang’s

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,300
Floating Palm can cure her.

27
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,750
In that case,

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,090
you are just in time.

29
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,320
You choose the perfect timing

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,830
to take advantage of us.

31
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,640
Madam, you are indeed smart.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,450
This girl is badly hurt.

33
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,620
Even for the sake of Li Zheng,

34
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,760
you won’t just let her die.

35
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,420
You are impressive.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,880
You did nothing

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,040
and cost me most of my power.

38
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,110
You deserve the name of
the Head of Demons.

39
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,630
You are sinister, treacherous,

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,910
and extremely shameless.

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,160
But there is one thing
I don’t understand.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,600
Why did you

43
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,750
take all these efforts

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,160
just to see me, a little singer?

45
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,750
I’m here today

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,720
because I have something to ask you.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,670
Do you know

48
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,440
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

49
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,580
I have never heard of it.

50
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,170
What’s the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

51
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,600
Madam, let’s not do this the hard way.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Go.

53
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,270
With your current power,

54
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,520
I’m afraid you can’t protect everyone
in Qiaoyun House.

55
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,640
That’s enough!

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,930
Shen Tianshu.

57
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,340
Believe it or not,

58
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,750
I only know
that the Color of Ocean and Heaven

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,750
is a huge place of treasure.

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
That’s only because

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,520
I heard some elders talked about it.

62
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,080
But the Color of Ocean and Heaven
concerns the world.

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
I really don’t know

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
where it is

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,710
and what’s inside.

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,370
Is it?

67
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,870
Madam, you’d better tell me the truth.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,270
Or else, Yuyi Troupe will never

69
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,140
perform again.

70
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,670
No matter how you threaten me with them,

71
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,760
I have nothing else to tell you.

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Shen Tianshu, I need to warn you.

73
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,760
Don’t be too wild.

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,040
This is Hengyang,

75
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,110
not your Demons Manor.

76
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,270
The garrison of Lord Gantang

77
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,730
is not far from Hengyang.

78
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,040
If you have to

79
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,570
make a scene today,

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,990
my Yuyi Troupe will be there for you!

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,400
Good.

82
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,290
I will take your words this time.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,860
Sorry for bothering you.

84
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,010
I’ll come to enjoy the Yuyi Troupe’s
performance some other day.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Any time.

86
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,610
Master, take the medicine.

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
Master, Mr. Qian Suiyou
wants to see you.

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,230
You may leave.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What’s the matter?

90
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,160
Thank you for saving Fei.

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,820
My appreciation is beyond words.

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,340
I’ll be at your disposal

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,080
if the Yuyi Troupe needs me.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,570
You don’t need to thank me.

95
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,060
I didn’t do it for you.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,390
Back then,

97
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,090
Zhou Fei’s grandfather
was my good friend.

98
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,020
My friend’s granddaughter was injured.

99
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,460
How could I stand by?

100
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,040
No matter who you did it for,

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,120
you still did me a big favor.

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,780
You seem to have deep feelings
for Miss Zhou.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,790
All right.

104
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,620
Let’s drop the empty gesture.

105
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,950
There is something

106
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,800
that I want to know.

107
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,670
Madam, please go ahead.

108
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,550
Recently I heard

109
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,570
there is some turbulence

110
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,950
relevant to the descendants
of South Blade.

111
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,230
I think you should have gone through

112
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,720
those things.

113
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,730
That’s what you are talking about.

114
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,440
I would like to know

115
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,070
the details of the whole story

116
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,520
and the truth.

117
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,180
Some time ago,

118
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,330
Timber Wolf of Demons, Shen Tianshu
showed up in Four-guardian Mountain.

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,140
Then Huo’s Manor suffered an accident.

120
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,720
Huo Liantao fled away.

121
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,030
And Old Master Huo passed away.

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
Shen Tianshu?

123
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,430
Why did he show up
in Four-guardian Mountain?

124
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,790
I heard

125
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,160
that he covets Huo’s kicking techniques,

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,550
so he went to kill them.

127
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,620
But I don’t think

128
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,720
the rumors are true.

129
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,540
He is the Lord of Demons Manor.

130
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,230
There is no way he would lay his eyes on

131
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,300
Huo’s special kicking techniques.

132
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,380
By the way,

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,390
there is another thing.

134
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,920
After the death of General Wang Lin,

135
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,110
his family members
were robbed and killed.

136
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
Who sent the killer?

137
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
The Blessed Dog,

138
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,390
Qiu Tianjin.

139
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,940
This is confusing.

140
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,510
Yeah.

141
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,360
They are just orphans and widows.

142
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,020
Why would he send a big falcon
to hunt them down?

143
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,070
So?

144
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,390
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

145
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,790
I’m afraid the people of Demons Manor

146
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,350
have been looking for it
for a long time.

147
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,740
Shen Tianshu got nothing useful today.

148
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,520
I’m afraid there will be

149
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,760
a bloody storm.

150
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,750
That’s ridiculous.

151
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,030
It’s despicable to

152
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,840
harm the innocent

153
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,930
just for the hearsay.

154
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
There are people killing to get it.

155
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,350
But they don’t know

156
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,130
the Color of Ocean and Heaven
is useless to them.

157
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,350
If everyone thinks like you do,

158
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,530
the world can be at peace.

159
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,320
When Shen Tianshu mentioned
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

160
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,590
you didn’t seem to be surprised.

161
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,560
Who do you belong to?

162
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,780
Wang Lin?

163
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,010
No.

164
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
You are Zhou Yitang’s person.

165
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
My surname is Xie.

166
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,970
My name is Yun.

167
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,130
I’m Xie Yun.

168
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,340
Xie Yun?

169
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,320
It’s getting late.

170
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,530
I’ll leave you to rest.

171
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,070
Thanks again.

172

Fei, you are awake!

176
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,090
How are you feeling?

177
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,200
How’s Madam Nichang doing?

178
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,230
Madam Nichang

179
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,000
took the secret pill
made by Yuyi Troupe.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,670
She is resting

181
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,760
in seclusion these days.

182
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,840
She should be fine.

183
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,080
Rest assured.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,110
Just get better,

185
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,140
only in this way won’t you
waste Madam’s efforts.

186
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,500
Did Shen Tianshu come?

187
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,960
What Madam Nichang said is true.

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,790
Shen Tianshu has got
the information here.

189
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,980
He probably won’t come again.

190
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,820
Seriously, how are you feeling now?

191
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,850
Are you sure you are okay?

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,760
Does it still hurt?

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,910
Are you all right?

194
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,710
You are energetic now.

195
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,800
You should be fine.

196
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,420
I’m thirsty.

197
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,530
I’ll get some water for you.

198
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,370
I’m hungry.

199
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Let’s go. I’ll take you to the tea house
to grab a bite.

200
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,150
I’ll get your clothes for you.
Wait for me.

201
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,030

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,470
Welcome.

207
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,710
We are the only one inn

Two rooms.

That’s not enough for two rooms.

Where are my clothes?

224
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,660
Why do you want me to dress like this?

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,930
Where are my clothes?

226
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,030
Your clothes are dirty.

227
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,410
It’s inappropriate to wear them.

228
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,350
You look good

229
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,480
in this dress.

230
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,350
Stop watching me. Let’s go.

Come on, let me comb your hair.

You know,

238
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,580
I hate to see a beauty being wasted.

239
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,140
Tell me,

240
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,660
what kind of hairstyle do you want?

241
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,590
Cross Bun?

242
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,760
Feitian Bun?

243
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,440
Or

244
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,020
Lingyun Bun?

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,110
How about this?

246
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,020
The Falling Bun is also pretty.

247
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,790
You need to move less
after I get you this hairstyle.

248
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,760
Otherwise, it will get loose in a while.

249
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,280
Mr. Xie.

250
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Even you know how to dress up a beauty,

251
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,550
you don’t need to
practice your skill by me.

252
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,400
I have no ambitions.

253
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
I don’t want to be a scholar

254
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,150
nor a general.

255
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,790
I just want to be a hairdresser

256
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,620
to comb my future wife’s hair.

257
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,280
How is it?

258
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,830
It’s ugly.

259
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,800
I think it’s pretty.

260
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,710
I mean,

261
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,640
why do you have to wear this?

262
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,950
You finally dress up

263
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,160
and you have to cover yourself?

264
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,490
It’s like walking at night
in fancy clothes.

265
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,290
It’s too ugly.

266
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,370
Fine.

267
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,970
Don’t just eat.

268
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,400
The clothes I borrowed

269
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,110
would break if you keep eating.

270
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,280
That’s because

271
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,710
you borrowed such a dress.

272
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,940
I feel awkward.

273
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,000
I think it’s pretty.

274
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,880
I mean,

275
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,680
don’t just eat.

276
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,350
You escaped from death this time.

277
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,640
Have you reflected on it?

278
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,950
Will you still pretend
to be tough again?

279
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,510
Do you hear me?

280
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,310
Got it.

281
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,430
I won’t pretend to be tough,

282
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,710
but I won’t be timid.

283
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,430
If there is injustice,

284
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,570
I will still meddle in it.

285
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
It’s just

286
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,280
my current martial art is too weak.

287
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,770
I have to practice harder.

288
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,120
What are you doing?

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,890
If masters are

290
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,490
divided into nine ranks,

291
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,110
you blocked the Dragon Master
in a narrow passage

292
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,640
and killed his men,

293
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,690
and you survived.

294
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,610
Am I a master?

295
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,190
Yes.

296
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,430
Though

297
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,090
you took advantage of
the opponent’s underestimation of you,

298
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,230
you don’t have

299
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,640
a good weapon in your hand.

300
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,860
What you did

301
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
can prove that your current skill

302
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,760
is enough for you to be
a second-rank master.

303
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,030
Second-rank master?

304
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,800
But as a second-rank master,

305
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,980
your luck is not that good.

306
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,920
There were minions everywhere
and you didn’t run into any of them.

307
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,310
The people you met

308
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,520
are all scaring big shots.

309
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,640
And it makes you look embarrassed.

310
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,230
You are just a little song writer.

311
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,470
Just sing your song.

312
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,280
Why do you start to wiggle?

313
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,710
However,

314
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,300
don’t be complacent.

315
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,040
Learning martial arts is like
climbing a mountain.

316
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,020
There is always
another mountain after one.

317
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,710
There are still

318
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,470
many top masters in the world.

319
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,000
Such as the famous seniors.

320
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,880
Qi’s Taoist priest

321
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,520
and Huo’s master?

322
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,040
Yes.

323
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,590
Above the first rank

324
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,110
are top masters.

325
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,670
It’s a rarity of the rarities.

326
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,070
Regardless of their reputation,

327
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,300
only their names

328
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,000
can reverberate like thunder.

329
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,040
In that case,

330
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,060
it’s good to be second-rank master.

331
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,430
Are the people of Demons Manor

332
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,560
and Four-guardian Mountain top masters?

333
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,330
Mu Xiaoqiao is one.

334
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,060
Dragon Master is not.

335
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,340
Shen Tianshu is.

336
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,980
But I’m afraid people like Qiu Tianjin

337
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,740
are not good enough.

338
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,070
Dragon Master ranks first
among the Four Guardians

339
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,310
because he has a bunch of thugs

340
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,520
to fight and kill for him.

341
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,110
He is treacherous

342
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,000
and has a lot of gimmicks.

343
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,400
Such people are very dangerous.

344
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,240
One careless move can
make you get killed.

345
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,440
But if you call him a top master,

346
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,350
let alone others,

347
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,760
the other three of the Four Guardians

348
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,110
will sneer at him.

349
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,740
Above the top master

350
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,520
is the grand master.

351
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,770
Do you know the difference between them?

352
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,190
What’s it?

353
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,430
It hurts!

354
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,590
I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you.

355
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,590
The difference between them is

356
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,000
that there are top masters
in every generation,

357
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,140
but not the grand masters.

358
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,160
Those two apprentices
of Yellow and Green Palm

359
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,590
chose a different path. They have
the righteous side and the evil side.

360
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,520
The two of them share one martial art.

361
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,430
It’s a little bit inadequate.

362
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,710
North Blade Guan Feng
retired a long time ago.

363
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,230
He only left an unknown apprentice

364
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,150
who is dead now.

365
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,660
It also lacks something.

366
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,640
As for Yin Wenlan,

367
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,340
he is the uncrowned lord
among the martial artists.

368
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,940
The South Blade established a new school
and completed the martial art.

369
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,270
These two

370
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,280
can be called

371
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,510
grand masters.

372
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,420
Twenty years ago,

373
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,760
there were lots of martial artists.

374
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,060
It was the heyday.

375
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,300
Many rare martial arts

376
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,140
resurfaced.

377
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,000
People now are still talking about

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,820
those anecdotes.

379
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,650
It’s a pity that

380
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,010
the era of great talents was too short.

381
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,420
It passed

382
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,800
like a gust of wind.

383
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,450
Yeah.

384
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,160
Yin Wenlan and my grandfather
passed away.

385
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,310
Duan Jiuniang is missing.

386
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,250
The North Blade is no longer
being practiced.

387
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,900
Latecomers like my mother

388
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
are also burdened with the drudgery

389
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,930
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

390
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,460
No progress has been made so far.

391
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,520
I’m afraid it won’t be easy to

392
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,700
take one step forward in the future.

393
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,390
Shen Tianshu attacked
Huo’s Manor viciously.

394
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,980
Then he looked around for
Huo’s kicking techniques

395
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,730
because he wants to
reach the next level.

396
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,780
Unfortunately,

397
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,580
such people

398
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,720
use dirty tricks and have nasty mind.

399
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,320
I think

400
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,770
he should just give up early.

401
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,230
Young Master Li.

402
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,580
Miss Wu, why are you sweating?

403
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,760
I’m fine. I had a nightmare.

404
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,000
Why are you here

405
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,010
so late?

406
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,230
I noticed that you haven’t eaten today.

407
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,520
I got you some food.

408
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,220
You can grab a bite.

409
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,950
Thank you.

410
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,890
Please come in.

411
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,190
Listen, I can get out safely.

412
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,110
But he will recognize you.

413
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,190
If he finds you,

414
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,600
we will be all over.

415
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,460
Let me find a way.

416
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,240
It hurts!

417
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,740
Young Master Li.

418
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
Is your hand okay?

419
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,520
It’s nothing.

420
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,250
Just a little sprain.

421
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,380
That trap couldn’t hurt me.

422
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,480
Sorry, Young Master Li.

423
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,310
You got hurt

424
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,350
because of me.

425
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,680
If you don’t mind,

426
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,790
don’t call me Young Master Li.

427
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,640
Look at me.

428
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,600
Do I still look like a young master now?

429
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,880
You can call me Li Sheng.

430
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Or call me Sheng

431
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,690
like Fei does.

432
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Li Sheng.

433
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
You don’t need to call me Miss Wu.

434
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,900
Just call me Chuchu.

435
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,370
I am not a lady anymore.

436
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,130
Chuchu.

437
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,310
Get some rest.

438
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,590
Eat something. I’ll go back.

439
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,300
Okay.

440
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,550
By the way,

441
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,080
only knowing how to
use weapons is pointless.

442
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,890
After what I’ve gone through
these years,

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,190
I finally understand

444
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,390
that food and clothing

445
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,070
are top priorities

446
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,220
for the people.

447
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,060
Looks like that person
is going to close his stall.

448
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,930
Do him a favor for me.

449
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,240
You can give him as much as you want.

450
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,070
You are still a poor song writer.

451
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,110
Why are you so generous
in aiding needy people?

452
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,830
Money is mere worldly possession.
It’s a stopgap.

453
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,950
We can’t live without it.

454
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,090
But it’s not that important.

455
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,160
It’s not as precious as the fate
that makes us meet.

456
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,850
Take it.

457
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Who just said

458
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,590
food and clothing are top priorities?

459
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,920
How come it suddenly becomes

460
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,790
worldly possession and a stopgap?

461
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,930
Well,

462
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,190
are you worried that I’ll be poor?

463
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,680
After all these years being out there,

464
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,660
I’ve acquired quite a lot of skills
to make money.

465
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,840
Well,

466
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,310
take a walk with me?

467
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
You’ll know how to make money then.

468
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,260
I don’t want to hang around.

469
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,390
I want to go home.

470
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
I want to know how my mother
and others are.

471
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,290
Fortress of the Forty-Eight...

472
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,960
He...

473
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,950
You just barely escaped from death

474
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,190
under the three energies.

475
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,640
You’d better
take care of yourself first.

476
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,160
Your mother has been in charge
for so all these years.

477
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,830
Her reputation is not fake.

478
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,290
Just relax.

479
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,750
Madam.

480
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,490
-Madam.
-Madam.

481
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,520
Madam. It’s too late today.

482
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,210
Why don’t you leave tomorrow?

483
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,760
The Secret Service defected.

484
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,400
It’s not a trivial matter.

485
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,430
I’m afraid something serious happened
down the mountain.

486
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,710
I’d better go to see Lord Gantang

487
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,920
to discuss countermeasures.

488
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,950
After I leave,

489
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,840
you’ll be in charge of

490
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,850
<i>Token</i>
protecting our fortress.

491
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,780
<i>Token</i>

492
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,560
Madam.

493
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,110
I will protect our fortress
with my life.

494
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,890
Fine.

495
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,950
Thank you for your hard work.

496
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,710
Since you gave me the money,

497
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,110
just pick one story.

498
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,350
I don’t know much about it.

499
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,880
I haven’t heard any of it.

500
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,700
I won’t pick one.

501
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,800
She is too young to appreciate it.

502
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,430
Well,

503
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,110
why don’t you tell her
a lively story for fun?

504
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,460
Then she will go to sleep later.

505
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,450
I will tell a story about
current affairs.

506
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,110
It’s hearsay

507
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,520
and it’s not necessarily true.

508
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
Hope you can enjoy it.

509
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,040
Recently I heard that several
important events happened

510
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,190
at the border with our enemy.

511
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,710
And there is an incredible figure.

512
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,400
It’s said that this person is a heroine.

513
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,400
She lives in the mountain
and masters a great martial art.

514
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
The way she showed up is impressive.

515
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,560
-An incredible heroine?
-When she came out,

516
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,430
-Near the border?
-she met Shen Tianshu

517
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,880
-Would it be Duan Jiuniang?
-who was attacking Huo’s Manor

518
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,470
and besieging Huarong.

519
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,280
The people in the city

520
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,430
were sacred.

521
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,690
The heroine

522
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,040
defeated Shen Tianshu

523
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,830
and killed the Blessed Dog on her own.

524
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,760
She went all the way to Mount Heng

525
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,710
and rushed out of a bloody road

526
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,310
being unscathed.

527
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,680
When she arrived at Mount Heng,

528
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,680
she defended someone against
an injustice at the post.

529
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,950
And she set a trap

530
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,110
to drive out Dragon Master.

531
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,420
Then she intercepted and killed him
at the foot of Mount Heng.

532
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,310
Everyone is applauding for it.

533
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,720
Guess who is her ancestor?

534
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,040
It’s said that she is
the descendant of South Blade.

535
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,280
It has been twenty years.

536
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,520
Snow-breaking Blade resurfaced again!

537
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,230
Have you also heard of

538
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,430
the descendant of South Blade?

539
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,000
Of course.

540
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,350
It’s said that the descendant
of South Blade

541
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,680
is a young heroine.

542
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,040
It’s really impressive.

543
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,920
She is indeed a heroine.

544
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,210
But she can’t be young.

545
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,830
Otherwise, how could she
punch Timber Wolf

546
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,520
and kick the Dragon Master?

547
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,430
As far as I know,

548
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,560
the descendant of South Blade

549
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,760
is a strong woman

550
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,000
carrying a big blade.

551
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,310
All you heard is nonsense.

552
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,040
Let me tell you.

553
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,560
In fact, the descendant of South Blade

554
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,590
is not human at all.

555
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,860
What?

556
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,800
Think about it.

557
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,190
How unreliable the rumors are?

558
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,950
In the cordon formed by
thousands of people

559
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,160
from Demons Manor
and Four-guardian Mountain.

560
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,640
Be careful to not
laugh yourself to death.

561
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,190
To Kill the Dragon Master.

562
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,520
I have a friend who saw it in person.

563
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,470
Fei!

564
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,920
That’s a blue-faced monster with fangs

565
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,070
that can slap a bear to death.

566
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,830
Really?

567
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,580
<i>Hengyang</i>

568
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,380
The flower is so beautiful.

569
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,430
I’ll take one of these.

570
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,560
Okay.

571
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,160
How much is it?

572
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,350
Three coins.

573
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,230
Here.

574
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,450
Thank you.

575
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,400
Waiter!

576
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,470
Bring me a pot of good tea!

577
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,140
All right!

578
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,040
Miss.

579
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,350
Why don’t you try
our Jiulong Jinyu Tea?

580
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,880
The tea is made by rocking four times
and roasting three times.

581
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
The tea is fragrant,
and it has a sweet aftertaste.

582
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,190
I’m sure you will like it.

583
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,520
Okay, I’ll take a pot.

584
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,070
All right!

585
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,490
Here.

586
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,590
Please enjoy it.

587
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,710
The coins were spent too fast.

588
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,640
The heroine

589
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,430
defeated Shen Tianshu

590
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,680
and killed the Blessed Dog on her own.

591
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,310
She rushed out of a bloody road

592
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,400
being unscathed. And she left.

593
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,800
Later, she went to Mount Heng alone.

594
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,470
She defended someone against
an injustice at the post.

595
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,760
And she set a trap

596
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,070
to drive out Dragon Master.

597
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,520
Then she intercepted and killed him
at the foot of Mount Heng.

598
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,600
Everyone is applauding for it.

599
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,670
Guess who is her ancestor?

600
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,760
Exactly.

601
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,520
She is the descendant of South Blade.

602
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,870
South Blade?

603
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaking of the South Blade master,
Li Zheng.

604
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
-Is it my brother? Or Fei?
-Years ago,

605
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,840
he was a romantic and suave man

606
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,320
with chivalrous tenderness.

607
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,040
Heroines and girls

608
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,430
fell for him.

609
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,870
Grandfather.

610
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,630
In order to avoid these romantic debts,

611
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,040
he hid in the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

612
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,470
Unexpectedly, he established

613
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,670
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

614
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,690
That’s nonsense!

615
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,540
My grandfather is not like that!

616
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
I mean...

617
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,520
I also want to hear your story.

618
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,280
Miss, be quiet if you want to hear it.

619
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,390
If you enjoy it, you can give me a tip.

620
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,950
This little girl.

621
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,340
How dare he say that
about my grandfather!

622
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,980
She is Li Zheng’s granddaughter?

623
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,680
Isn’t she the descendant of South Blade?

624
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,120
<i>Yang Jin, Know-medicine-all</i>

625
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,860
That’s great.

626
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,710
Come on, come on!

627
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,950
Take a look!

628
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,280
Take a look!

629
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,080
Come to hear my story!

630
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,040
Let me tell you an interesting story.

631
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,000
It’s said that there is an Old Master Li
at the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

632
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,870
Although Old Master Li
is skilled in using blade,

633
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,480
he is also very attentive.

634
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,400
His needlework is excellent.

635
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
He has a son and a daughter

636
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,630
who lost their mother
when they were young.

637
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,520
So Old Master Li plays the role
as both their mother and father.

638
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,000
He is

639
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,400
the South Blade.

640
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,230
<i>Fuze Tea House</i>
Good!

641
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,760
<i>Fuze Tea House</i>
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,120
<i>Fuze Tea House</i>
Here.

643
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,630
Thank you.

644
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,630
Make a way!

645
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,450
What’s wrong?
Didn’t you sleep well last night?

646
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,740
I had nightmares all night.

647
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,150
You are afraid of nothing.

648
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,710
Do you also have nightmares?

649
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,760
What’s in your dream?

650
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,950
I dreamed about

651
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,280
Shen Tianshu

652
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
attacking me with a bunch of dogs

653
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,150
and the people of Four-guardian Mountain

654
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,840
and Dragon Master.

655
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,040
They formed a Tai Chi
Eight-trigram Formation.

656
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,340
Then I dreamed about

657
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,960
my mother.

658
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,070
She was beating me again.

659
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,320
She thrashed me with a whip
as thick as her waist.

660
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,910
I was like a spinning top.

661
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,520
The sky and earth were spinning round.

662
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,040
I’m still dizzy now.

663
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,190
I can understand that you dreamed of

664
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,240
those people attacking you.

665
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,660
But why would your mother beat you?

666
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
Probably because I made her

667
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,420
look too good this time.

668
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,090
What?

669
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,120
What are you thinking?

670
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,090
If your words are reliable...

671
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,860
Why are my words unreliable?

672
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,930
Look at those people.

673
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,080
Who can be

674
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,760
so knowledgeable

675
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
about the world like me?

676
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,800
What’s so proud of being a gossiper?

677
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,690
According to what you said,

678
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,600
with my ability,

679
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,650
I’m sort of a second-rank master, right?

680
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,660
You are when in a good condition.

681
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,050
What does the good condition mean?

682
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,670
Have you heard how they described me?

683
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,150
They said you skipped two levels.

684
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,150
-You are better than the top expert.
-Yeah.

685
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,000
You are aimed straight for
the grand master.

686
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,040
Other masters are not worth mentioning.

687
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,800
They are too old
and have a bunch of kids.

688
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,820
They are way below you
in terms of youth and beauty.

689
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,460
Say more stuff like that.

690
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,190
Anyway, after I heard what they said,

691
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,000
I almost wanted to kneel down
in front of you.

692
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
Master, how about I serve you

693
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,670
as a groom?

694
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,390
Tell me

695
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,030
when you will knock down
the Heaven.

696
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,600
I’ll have a name for my next play.

697
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,320
The name would be

698
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,000
the Story of Heroine Zhou Bladeless.

699
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,470
I just praised you.

700
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,280
Now you start to make up
horrible stories about me.

701
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,190
Do you believe
I’ll slap you on the tree?

702
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,280
No.

703
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,470
If you slap me on the tree,

704
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,860
how would you go back to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

705
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,630
You’ll probably walk to south

706
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,690
after you leave the room.

707
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,680
Am I that bad at telling the direction?

708
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,150
I’m afraid a lazy master

709
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,870
without general knowledge like you

710
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,490
has to beg at that time.

711
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,320
Master.

712
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,770
Can you sing the begging song?

713
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,870
Do you need me to teach you a few lines?

714
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,590
You might get some money along the way.

715
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,600
You mean,

716
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,220
will Shen Tianshu smear me
behind my back?

717
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,450
How?

718
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,360
Inform the world

719
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,870
that he was defeated

720
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,150
by a little girl?

721
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,660
You are right.

722
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,600
He is a famous villain.

723
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,430
How would he take these efforts

724
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,200
to deal with me, a nobody?

725
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,970
That’s unnecessary.

726
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,280
You don’t often hang out there.

727
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,250
You might not know that.

728
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,910
The people have been
holding a grudge against

729
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,150
Shen Tianshu for a long time.

730
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,740
There were rumors about

731
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,230
a Timber Wolf being defeated

732
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,360
by some kid

733
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,470
every half a month.

734
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,840
That’s already too much for
Shen Tianshu to deal with.

735
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,750
Normally, no one would believe it.

736
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,280
It’s just

737
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,080
your situation is a little special.

738
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,230
The Dragon Master

739
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,700
happened to be dead.

740
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,750
That’s troublesome.

741
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,650
If my mother knows it,

742
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,410
she is going to kill me.

743
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,680
Why are you still
thinking about your mother?

744
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,220
Fei.

745
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,870
Take my advice.

746
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,870
You’d better lay low

747
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,190
these days.

748
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,910
Try to not fight.

749
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,470
And try to play dead

750
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,470
before you go back to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

751
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,600
Let them talk.

752
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,520
As long as you don’t show up

753
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,630
and don’t cause trouble,

754
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,520
they will forget it

755
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,400
in a while.

756
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,040
Every time I chose to fight

757
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,800
because there was no other choice
under the circumstance.

758
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,520
I fight

759
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,230
because I have to.

760
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,080
When I was in
Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

761
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,000
only Li Sheng

762
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
kept picking fight with me.

763
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,420
We haven’t heard anything
about your cousin

764
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,670
along the way.

765
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,710
Don’t worry.

766
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,560
In this chaotic world,

767
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,270
no news is good news.

768
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,870
Don’t worry about it.

769
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,280
After I finish my meal,

770
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,430
I’m going to send a gift.

771
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,430
Well, will you go with me?

772
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,840
Okay, I’ll go with you.

773
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,630
I didn’t know my grandfather’s story

774
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,800
could be used to make money.

775
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,390
Those people are hateful.

776
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,440
They dare to slander...

777
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,760
What a black charcoal.

778
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,580
Who are you?

779
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,910
I’m Yang Jin.

780
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,950
Please!

781
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,280
You don’t look like a bad person.

782
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,560
What do you want?

783
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,390
What footwork is that?

784
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,760
It seems to be in order.

785
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,840
And the moves of the blade.

786
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,740
When did South Blade have such moves?

787
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,080
How is it?

788
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,640
Are you afraid?

789
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,280
What is this again?

790
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,990
Her eyes are full of spiritual power.

791
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,630
Is that Mind-controlling Skill?

792
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,470
Are you nuts?

793
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,470
Won’t you fight?

794
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,430
Sorry. Sorry.

795
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,040
I didn’t mean it!

796
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,360
Did you see Li Yan?

797
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,230
No.

798
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,390
This girl.

799
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,880
She must sneak out to play.

800
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,520
It’s chaotic outside.

801
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,400
If she meets some treacherous people,

802
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:17,400
this is...

803
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,840
This troublesome girl.

804
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,120
Do we need our brothers
in Hengyang to find her?

805
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,930
No.

806
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,040
Madam specifically told us

807
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,000
that we should try to
keep a low profile.

808
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,520
It won’t be good if anyone
notifies the Secret Service.

809
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,910
Yan likes to have fun.

810
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,630
She must go to some busy place
on the street.

811
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,800
Take some people
and look for her with me.

812
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,470
-Let’s go!
-Yes. Hurry up.

813
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:50,024

814
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,700
You’re awake!

815
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,220
You should rest for more days.

816
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,500
Why would I listen to you?

817
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,130
Where am I?

818
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,950
This is my room.

819
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,380
I’ll let you live here for some days.

820
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,150
I shouldn’t

821
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,190
make the move rashly.

822
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,360
But it’s also your fault.

823
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,470
You looked down on me
and refused to fight with me.

824
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,600
After you get better,

825
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,760
please be sure to compete with me
in a serious way.

826
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,470
Are you sick?

827
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,560
You knocked me out first

828
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,870
and made all these explanations.

829
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,180
And you try to lock me up?

830
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,800
Compete what?

831
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,120
Send me home

832
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,260
while I’m not planning to
get back on you!

833
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,870
I’m talking to you!

834
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,080
Are you a descendant of South Blade?

835
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,430
When did I say I am?

836
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,040
Then why are you so clear about

837
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,210
Master Li’s personal life?

838
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,760
Because he is my grandfather.

839
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,950
You call him your grandfather.

840
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,840
And you said you are not
a descendant of South Blade.

841
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,040
You want to fool me?

842
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,600
He is my grandfather,
not your grandfather.

843
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,840
I can say whatever I want.
It’s none of your business.

844
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,390
Listen,

845
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,320
if you dare to touch me,

846
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,520
the entire Fortress of the Forty-Eight
will never let you go!

847
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,360
