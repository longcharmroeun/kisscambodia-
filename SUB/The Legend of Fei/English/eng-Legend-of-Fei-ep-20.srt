<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 20</i>

17
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,270
What are you doing?

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,910
I have principles!

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,310
Help!

20
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,160
No one would pay for your body.

21
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,080
Listen.

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,480
I want to defeat Yang Jin.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,980
And I want to be the God.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,120
You can tell the defect
in Mayfly Formation

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,480
of Mr. Chongxiaozi in one glimpse.

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,440
You must know it well

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,510
how Yang Jin’s
13 Goose-breaking Blades works.

28
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,720
I have no idea.

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,550
I heard it from some storytellers.

30
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,680
No idea.

31
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,160
Please.

32
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,440
What did you just say?

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,890
I’m begging you.

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
What’s the point of begging me?

35
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,160
I can’t make you a grand master

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720
overnight.

37
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,600
If I were that capable,

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,320
I wouldn’t be a song writer

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,450
but a sect founder.

40
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,420
You must have got a way.

41
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,670
Tell me all the details

42
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,080
about Yang Jin’s blades.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,600
Maybe I should reason with her.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,850
She might shrink back from difficulties.

45
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,240
Actually, 13 Goose-breaking Blades

46
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,000
is not that profound.

47
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,110
Speaking of which,

48
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,700
in fact,

49
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,540
it’s not that scary.

50
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,110
There are differences

51
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,160
between it and the broadsword play

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,630
practiced by you people

53
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,180
from famous schools.

54
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,910
If you have great perception,

55
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,270
Goose-breaking Blades

56
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,680
won’t be your match in ten years.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,830
Listen.

58
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,570
Go ask Qian Suiyou

59
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,080
what Miss Zhou’s plan is.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,690
Yes.

61
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,160
His blade

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,850
is both fast

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,270
and heavy.

64
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,510
Heavy?

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,230
One wave of his blade

66
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,170
is much more faster than my hand.

67
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,940
A mediocre martial artist
would parry in a haste

68
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,030
when being attacked.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
You saw Yang Jin’s blade as well.

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
It’s extremely heavy.

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,750
If he suppresses you with such force,

72
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,280
no one can tell if you can hold it.

73
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,380
Moreover, you’re injured now.

74
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,570
I can train my speed these days.

75
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,600
I know you’re trying
to protect South Blade’s reputation.

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
That’s why

77
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,950
you should avoid the fight.

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,640
Now you’re on the right side.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,110
You can take the initiative.

80
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,000
Even if your avoidance of fights

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,390
gets out,

82
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,920
rumors will only have it
that Yang Jin uses indecent tricks.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Everyone might get hurt in a fight.

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,230
Why do you have to pick one now?

85
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,670
You’ll have other chances later.

86
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,390
Even if I escape this time,

87
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,110
can I continue my journey

88
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,760
with a bubble reputation

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,060
as the South Blade?

90
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,790
Then people like Yang Jin

91
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,050
will line up to compete with me.

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,230
I won’t defeat them even with tricks.

93
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,000
But I can still lose with dignity,

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,490
which is better than tucking away.

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,350
Seems like she will go for it.

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,350
You’re not as concentrated as Yang Jin,

97
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,550
nor do you have solid skills as he does.

98
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,790
Also, you lack the fast broadsword play

99
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,980
hammered out with commitment.

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,950
Speed is the core of all martial arts.

101
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,850
Tell me,

102
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,070
how will you break his blade?

103
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,880
Yang Jin has been training himself
for years

104
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,940
only for one thing, speed.

105
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,980
But you’re in a different situation.

106
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,760
The Lis are profound in broadsword play.

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,230
If you lack basic skills,

108
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,350
you won’t even be able to imitate it.

109
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,920
When you studied martial arts
from your parents as a kid,

110
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,670
you must have learned more
than that, right?

111
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,880
They taught you other subjects,

112
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,950
didn’t they?

113
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,510
You’re well-informed.

114
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,390
If you’re observant enough...

115
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,760
Can my Snow-breaking Blade

116
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,720
be faster than Yang Jin’s?

117
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
I don’t care if I can defeat him.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,510
Xie Yun is right.

119
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,320
Being unpredictable is my focus.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,110
I won’t defeat him by speed,

121
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,640
but by being unpredictable.

122
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,200
Come with me.

123
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,070
Show me what you said yesterday.

124
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,040
Wait.

125
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,670
Are you still studying
Goose-breaking Blades’ defects?

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,110
I haven’t had enough sleep.
I’ll sleep for another while.

127
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,200
Show me one more time.

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,830
I’ll sleep for another while.

129
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,160
Just a while.

130
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,270
How fast is “faster”?

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,070
How heavy is “heavier”?

132
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,720
Dig in.

133
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,510
Fei.

134
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,000
What’s bothering you?

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,950
Fei.

136
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,920
Let go.

137
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,080
Let go!

138
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,790
What are you doing?

139
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,550
Pretty.

140
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,940
Are you obsessed with the blade?

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,210
You are not eating?

142
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,510
I’ll have it.

143
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,300
<i>Fenghe Stall</i>

144
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Sorry for letting you suffer.

145
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,670
This is a chaotic world.

146
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,470
Girls’ dresses would draw attention.

147
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,910
It’s more convenient to wear men’s wear.

148
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
You’re quite thoughtful.

149
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,670
But it never occurred to me

150
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,230
that you look

151
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,200
quite handsome

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,410
in men’s wear.

153
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,320
I’m flattered.

154
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,710
Sir, your pancakes.

155
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,820
This place is undergoing a famine.

156
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,840
Pancakes are the only available food.

157
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,030
Please have it, Miss Chuchu.

158
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,840
When we return to the Fortress,

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,640
I’ll ask Aunt

160
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,490
to make you some decent food.

161
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,050
Sorry for all the sufferings.

162
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,760
Mencius said

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,550
“thrive in calamity
and perish in pleasure”.

164
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,840
The calamity I suffered

165
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,790
made me aware of

166
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,110
how hard-won food is.

167
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,640
This pancake

168
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
would suffice me.

169
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,880
Then have more.

170
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
We still have an arduous journey ahead.

171
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,790
God knows

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,520
where the next meal will be.

173
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,640
It’s so hard to make a living.

174
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
See, wars never cease these years.

175
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,210
Plus, there are villains robbing grains.

176
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,880
You’d better finish and leave.

177
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,440
Thank you for your tips.

178
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
Please have more food.

179
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,030
Mr. Xie.

180
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,880
What martial art is she practicing?

181
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Looks weird.

182
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,910
Why does she close her eyes?

183
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,110
It’s odd.

184
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,960
This is

185
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,590
called Eye-shutting Skill,

186
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,440
meaning, use your imagination

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,030
to practice the moves in your head.

188
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,760
Eye-shutting Skill?

189
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
Leave her alone.

190
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Please teach us this song.

191
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Yes. Yes.

192
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,110
Okay.

193
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,400
I returned to the capital.

194
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,280
A pretty appeared
at the winding corridors.

195
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,200
Who is this pretty?

196
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,880
-Could it be someone you admire?
-Who is it?

197
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,910
Admire?

198
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,960
I have no one to admire.

199
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,230
If I did,

200
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,640
I’d fail all my lady friends

201
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
worldwide?

202
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,230
If you don’t tell us,

203
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,960
we’ll detain you as a storyteller
in the troupe.

204
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,910
You’ll have to stay.

205
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,590
-Yes.
-Stay. Yes.

206
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,230
Miss Zhou, what do you say?

207
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,760
Ask him.

208
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,320
Don’t ask me.

209
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,590
You’re his apprentice.

210
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,760
If he stays,

211
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,400
then you’ll have to.

212
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,910
That’s right.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay. Forget it.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,280
My dear apprentice

215
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
is a martial art addict

216
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,150
with nothing but broadsword play
in her head.

217
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,670
She knows nothing about romance.

218
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,440
Stop teasing her.

219
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,280
-She left like that?
-Miss Zhou.

220
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,880
-Forget it.
-Yeah.

221
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,110
Let’s continue.

222
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,670
Teach us this line, Mr. Xie.

223
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,400
-How to sing it?
-Mr. Xie, teach us.

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,710
Master.

225
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,910
It’s all because you insisted on

226
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,790
saving Miss Zhou.

227
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,200
It’s okay.

228
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,590
I’ll recover gradually.

229
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,790
Don’t worry.

230
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,710
Madam Nichang saved my life

231
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,400
by using half of her energy.

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,550
She wouldn’t like me to take the fight.

233
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,910
I can’t make her sad

234
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,960
since she treats me
as her own apprentice.

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,470
Bad news.

236
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,400
The grain robbers are here.

237
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,440
Watch out.

238
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,350
Please give me two more days.

239
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,710
Please, wait for two more days.

240
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,150
-I have no money.
-Give me that, quickly!

241
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,520
Cut your crap.

242
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,590
You have no money
but run a stand?

243
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,880
Close it if you have no money.

244
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,230
Stop eating. Let’s leave.

245
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,320
You’ll see the consequence
if you don’t give me money.

246
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,550
Li Sheng.

247
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,230
Don’t act rashly.

248
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,200
Do you have money?

249
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,150
-But I can’t stand their evil deeds.
-Stop the nonsense!

250
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,910
Give me money!

251
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,840
Cut the crap. You!

252
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,440
You can’t defeat them

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
on your own.

254
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,350
It’ll be worse

255
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,910
if you get the locals involved.

256
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,760
What’s more,

257
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,880
the Demons are after us.

258
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,030
We should stay put.

259
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,840
We need to figure out a thorough plan

260
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,400
to escape.

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
And you,

262
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,030
listen up!

263
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,080
-Listen up!
-Hand in today’s quota

264
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
as promised.

265
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,440
Do you hear me?

266
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,470
Do you hear it?

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
What are you doing?

268
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,590
You fail at your training

269
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,080
and vent your anger at a mere stick?

270
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,080
Are you done with the new play?

271
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,430
I am.

272
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,030
I’m done with a story about escape.

273
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,780
Now, it’s time for a story

274
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,670
about me risking my life
with you for justice.

275
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,230
These words sound

276
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,000
so sarcastic.

277
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,760
Good for you, Yun.

278
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,150
You can tell it now.

279
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,200
I am being sarcastic to myself, okay?

280
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,150
There is a heroine
obsessed with martial arts.

281
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,280
That’s to say,

282
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,150
I’m risking my life with you.

283
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
Are you jealous?

284
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,200
I am not.

285
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,840
Now,

286
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
are your heartbeats accelerating?

287
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,640
Are you sweating?

288
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,590
Are you blushing?

289
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,960
And you dare not
look at my eyes?

290
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,520
I... I am not.

291
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,280
See?

292
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,640
I look straight at your eyes.

293
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,840
Do you buy it?

294
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,470
Why did you beat me?

295
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,930
You...

296
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,910
You ask for it.

297
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,790
Fei, are you alright?

298
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,350
None of your business.

299
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:18,910
Do you have any idea

300
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,760
about your situation?

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,030
You had to use your wits

302
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,110
to defeat Yang Jin normally.

303
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,550
Now you just recover
from the inner injuries

304
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,080
with your strength being damaged.

305
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,350
How can you compete with him?

306
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,030
-I...
-I know you think that I look down on you

307
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,840
and assert your loss.

308
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,840
That’s why I never bring it up
these days,

309
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
but only focused
on your broadsword play.

310
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,880
You saw it.

311
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,760
A mere punch

312
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,870
pained you greatly.

313
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,700
If you fight with Yang Jin,

314
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,420
the result...

315
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,560
I think you know how it’ll end.

316
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,370
It didn’t pain me.

317
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,350
I know you’re stubborn

318
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,990
and keep everything to yourself.

319
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,160
Are you crying? Why?

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,610
Where are you going?

321
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,590
You don’t want your blade?

322
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,670
No.

323
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,030
Then will you fight him?

324
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,350
No.

325
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,710
I’d rather

326
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,230
train myself more with my blade.

327
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,790
Then I’ll keep your blade.

328
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,350
Follow my hints.

329
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,560
Damn it.

330
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,110
Someone is approaching.

331
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,110
Let’s go.

332
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,070
If any of you refuses to hand it in,

333
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,760
I’ll make you suffer.

334
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,680
And you!

335
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,310
Take out your money.

336
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,350
Not a penny less. You!

337
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,560
Hand in your money. Do you hear me?

338
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,400
Hurry.

339
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
It’s mine. Don’t rob it.

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,190
So much money.

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,190
Sheng. Sheng.

342
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,470
You deserve it.

343
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,560
Beat him.

344
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,190
Turns out you’re a beauty.

345
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,680
Catch her. Catch her.

346
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,760
Beat him.

347
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,640
Punk.

348
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,070
I’ll let you go

349
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,070
for the sake of money.

350
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,760
Never mess up with me.

351
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,710
Let’s go.

352
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,070
Let’s go.

353
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,590
Sheng.

354
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,280
Sheng.

355
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,520
Sheng.

356
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,100
You’re bleeding a lot.

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,290
It’s burning.

358
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,950
Miss Chuchu. Miss Chuchu.

359
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,190
Miss Chuchu.

360
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,240
I’m here.

361
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,040
Wait a second.

362
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,470
Take a break.

363
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,000
I’ll put a compress on your forehead.

364
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,560
You must be starving.

365
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,860
Luckily we still have a pancake.

366
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,540
Eat it.

367
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,790
Stop looking at me. Have it.

368
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,000
Here.

369
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,540
Eat it so that you’ll have energy
for the trip.

370
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,810
We can’t stay here anymore.

371
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,240
Have it now.

372
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,040
Does it taste awful?

373
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,920
Annoying!

374
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
Bonehead!

375
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,920
I need to sleep!

376
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,680
Stop the noise. Do you hear me?

377
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,070
It’s so annoying!

378
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,190
Are you deaf?

379
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,830
I’m talking to you.

380
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,430
You’re playing dumb?

381
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,460
Fine.

382
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,830
Wait and see.

383
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,640
Stop the noise. Stop the noise.

384
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,920
Stop it!

385
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,560
Fine, Bonehead.

386
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,830
If you don’t stop, I’ll...

387
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,950
What are you doing?

388
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,350
Can’t you see? I’m crying!

389
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,560
What for?

390
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
You don’t know?

391
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,430
The cracking of your blade

392
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,950
awakes me from my sleep.

393
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,160
I’m so sleepy.

394
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,590
So sleepy.

395
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,470
That’s it?

396
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,760
Eating and sleeping are vital
to a person.

397
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,430
What do you mean “that’s it”?

398
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,310
The most vital thing

399
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,640
should be defeating
all the martial artists worldwide

400
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,070
and being a grand master, right?

401
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,110
That’s your goal, not mine.

402
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,470
You can’t let me sacrifice

403
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,760
just because you want
to be a grand master.

404
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,510
What kind of master will it be?

405
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,870
You make sense.

406
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,060
What do you want, then?

407
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,400
First,

408
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,040
put away your lame blade

409
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,410
and don’t make any noise.

410
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Agree.

411
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Second,

412
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,350
I’m hungry.

413
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,800
Buy me some food.

414
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,710
Okay.

415
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,230
Wait a second.

416
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,400
What again?

417
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,560
I want the best food
in the entire city.

418
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,070
It’s the middle of the night.

419
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,560
Where can I get it?

420
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,640
I don’t care. I want it.

421
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,370
Any good news?

422
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
We haven’t found her.

423
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,040
We’ve searched everywhere nearby.

424
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,800
What a troublemaker.

425
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,230
Where can she be?

426
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,800
We’ve turned the whole city upside down

427
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,520
but found nothing about her traces.

428
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,070
If we lost her,

429
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,780
how am I supposed to explain to Madam?

430
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,680
Mr. Ma.

431
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,830
Should we go on with the search

432
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,920
or do our business?

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Well, the priority

434
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,830
is to find Yan.

435
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,880
Inform all our men
to keep on looking for her.

436
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,420
Yes, let’s go.

437
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,880
All the possible places were searched.

438
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,470
Where could she be?

439
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,000
Yuyi Troupe has arrived in Hengyang.

440
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,090
Could she...?

441
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,060
<i>BESTORE</i>

442
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,560
Wait, wait.

443
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,160
Sir, you came just in time.

444
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,680
We’ll be closed
if you’re one second late.

445
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,040
Come on in.

446
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,580
Sir, what would you like?

447
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,640
This one...

448
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,830
This one...

449
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,800
I have no idea what girls like.

450
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,110
Pack some of every kind.

451
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,190
No problem, sir. Just a minute.

452
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,280
What is it?

453
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,470
Sir, this is our special offer.

454
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,760
Crispy and sweet winter jujubes.

455
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,400
This is dried yellow peach,
which is luscious and fragrant.

456
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
I strongly recommend it.

457
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
I’ve put them in it.

458
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,880
A variety of everything.

459
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,400
Here you are.

460
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,950
Thanks.

461
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,880
Okay.

462
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,310
Sir, see you.

463
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,560
It’s tasty.

464
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,640
The food in Hengyang

465
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,470
really lives up to its fame.

466
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,520
Would you like some?

467
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,640
I’m good.

468
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,590
I have to practice
martial arts tomorrow.

469
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,470
You can only do it when you’re full.

470
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,100
I can’t when I’m full.

471
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,070
You are just like Fei.

472
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,590
When she crossed the Ximo River,
she did the same.

473
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,280
She skipped meals and sleep,

474
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,110
spending every day in that damn river.

475
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,110
Ximo River?

476
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,160
She crossed it?

477
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,310
Yes.

478
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,350
Everyone who tries
to cross it got killed.

479
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,920
How did she do that?

480
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,160
Isn’t she amazing?

481
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,110
Listen,

482
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,000
you’ll be like an egg thrown to a rock

483
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
when competing with her.

484
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,920
You...

485
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,430
For your information, learn from me.

486
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,560
Eat and drink like it’s your last meal.

487
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,110
How comfy life would be.

488
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,040
Why do you have to make your life hard?

489
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,680
What are you doing?

490
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,430
I’m pondering over it.

491
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,140
<i>Secret Book on Martial Arts</i>

492
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,520
Get up! Get up! Get up!

493
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,470
Why are you sitting on my book?

494
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,040
What is the fuss about?

495
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,590
He bullies me.

496
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,000
I didn’t.

497
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,640
You...

498
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,590
Chief Xu, what’s the matter?

499
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,710
Jin.

500
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,230
I’ve heard of something.

501
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,230
If we want the heiress of South Blade
to take the challenge,

502
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,640
it would be difficult.

503
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,610
Why?

504
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,950
Relax, hear me out first.

505
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,400
Miss Zhou had been badly injured

506
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,280
before she arrived in Hengyang.

507
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,040
She was almost dying.

508
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,110
I guess

509
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,400
in Yuyi Troupe,

510
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,230
she’s just got better
after taking a rest.

511
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,160
How can she

512
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,850
take your challenge now?

513
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,000
Badly injured?

514
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yes.

515
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,310
If she is forced to take the challenge,

516
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,250
eventually

517
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,230
this is an unfair contest.

518
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,560
I wonder how Li Yan is now.

519
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,000
With her shrewdness,

520
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,680
who can pick on her?

521
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,280
You should worry more about yourself.

522
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,880
Fei!

523
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,710
Fei, you don’t know

524
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,160
what I’ve suffered these days.

525
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,520
Fei,

526
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
this is Mr. Li’s...

527
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,530
Granddaughter.

528
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,080
Fei, this is...

529
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
Where’s my brother?

530
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,400
Probably taken to get married.

531
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,230
Step aside.

532
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,520
I will tell you later.

533
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,070
Fei.

534
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,920
This Bonehead, he is so mean to me.

535
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,810
You still have time to beg for my mercy.

536
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,220
Mister.

537
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,100
As for the challenge...

538
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,190
Miss Zhou.

539
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,190
I’ve brought you one thing today.

540
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,160
You must need it.

541
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,310
This is a special medicine
made by Small Medicine Valley.

542
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,310
It can help people
who ran out of inner forces

543
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,400
recover at the fastest speed.

544
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,470
I know you won’t take the challenge

545
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,160
because you are badly injured.

546
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,220
Take it and you will be fine.

547
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,230
Right.

548
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,590
Small Medicine Valley is the best at

549
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,710
making medicines.

550
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,190
I can give that to Madam Nichang.

551
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,600
Fei, are you hurt?

552
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,210
Now you start to worry about her?

553
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,110
If it weren’t for Madam Nichang,

554
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,340
you would never see your cousin.

555
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,680
Fei, I was wrong.

556
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,280
Let’s not compete with him.

557
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,230
Bonehead, this isn’t fair!

558
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,710
We won’t take it!

559
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,560
Yan, stay out of it.

560
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,760
It’s between me and him.

561
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,070
I gave her this medicine.

562
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,160
She can fight me after taking it.

563
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,400
Why is it unfair?

564
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Fair.

565
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,050
Madam.

566
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,420
Do you have a blade?

567
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,600
Come with me.

568
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,430
Fei, I was wrong.

569
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,830
Don’t fight him.

570
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,590
The well-known martial artists

571
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,880
may have a weapon
more famous than themselves.

572
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,470
But you borrow a blade to fight me.

573
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,160
You are despising me!

574
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,920
She does despise you.

575
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,640
Fei will take you down!

576
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,830
-You stupid.
-You...

577
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,470
You are stupid.

578
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,400
You are stupid.

579
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,070
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

But it’s ruined by the savage soldiers!

590
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,680
What are you saying?

591
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,710
Get out if you want.

592
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,110
We’re enjoying the music.

593
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,280
Now this world

594
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,040
is full of war.

595
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,400
How can you still drink wine

596
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,800
and enjoy the music?

597
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,520
You...!

598
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,880
Sirs.

599
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,710
Sorry, my friend is drunk.

600
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,470
He spoiled your enjoyment.

601
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,520
Please excuse him.

602
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,430
Let’s drink.

603
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,190
Drink.

604
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,310
What do you care?

605
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,040
Floating Palm?

606
00:33:55,064 --> 00:34:05,064

607
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,160
Try if it suits you.

608
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,590
If you like it,

609
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,640
take it to fight.

610
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,830
After I compete with Yang Jin,

611
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,190
I will return it to you.

612
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,910
Let’s go.

613
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,580
<i>Elegant and quiet courtyard</i>

614
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,600
Blades are heartless.

615
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,360
Excuse me.

616
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,470
He is indeed fast.

617
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Her blade is not out yet.

618
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,000
This is...

619
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,360
There is an irreconcilable gap

620
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,190
between their martial arts.

621
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,040
Fei hasn’t attacked.

622
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,800
Because she knows if she does,

623
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,720
the gap will be exposed,

624
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,360
and she will lose her pace.

625
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,390
He shows her a head-on blow
from the start.

626
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,910
Looks like he will win for sure.

627
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,800
Nonsense.

628
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,710
How can Fei’s martial art

629
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,040
worse than Bonehead’s?

630
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,760
Fei, beat him down!

631
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,470
Qi School?

632
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,470
Why she uses Mayfly Moves of Qi school?

633
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,710
That’s her winning move?

634
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,800
No.

635
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,320
Fei is wearing out his patience.

636
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,430
She’s really smart.

637
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,000
She wants to test how powerful

638
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,670
13 Goose-breaking Blades is,

639
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,280
so she is deliberately stalling.

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,390
Fei is not a spinner.

641
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,000
She cannot always avoid

642
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
without being exhausted.

643
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,570
Unless Yang Jin exposes his weakness.

644
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,240
Yang Jin is rash

645
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,770
and dull.

646
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,040
He might get impatient

647
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,090
and lose it.

648
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,230
Why hasn’t she attacked?

649
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,600
Yang Jin repeated his move?

650
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,080
Yang Jin is not a master

651
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,980
like Dragon Master and Qiu Tianjin.

652
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,150
He can’t beat me

653
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,280
within one move.

654
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,760
He is not as fast as

655
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,910
the blade of Ximo River,

656
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,150
and not as strong as

657
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,890
the spinning wire
that can pull a huge stone.

658
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,760
He hesitated.

659
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,120
A fast blade

660
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,190
allows no moment of hesitation.

661
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,090
You see my blade?

662
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,710
She is much brighter

663
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,710
than before.

664
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,040
One moment of hesitation

665
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,840
finally got him lost.

666
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,120
Fei!

667
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,120
Good job, Miss Zhou.

668
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Today is an eye-opener for me.

669
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,080
Really?

670
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,360
Wait, wait.

671
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,190
You’ve lost. What do you want?

672
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,710
If Fei is not injured,

673
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,230
she would beat you sooner.

674
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,860
Fei, impressive.

675
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,230
Wait.

676
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,670
Don’t call me

677
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,080
the heiress of South Blade again.

678
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,950
My name is Zhou Fei.

679
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,840
Yang Jin.

680
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,190
I will fight you if there’s a chance.

681
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,430
Unbelievable.

682
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,000
-I might have offended you.
-Indeed.

683
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,150
Please forgive me.

684
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,000
If there’s anything Route Gang can do,

685
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,870
feel free to tell me.

686
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,630
Thanks, Chief Xu.

687
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,840
Goodbye.

688
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,150
You’re really the heiress
of South Blade.

689
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,710
Formidably intelligent.

690
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,040
You flattered me.

691
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,710
I want to give this medicine to you

692
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,600
as a thank you gift.

693
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
You won this for me?

694
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,230
If Mr. Li could have seen this,

695
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,710
he would be very pleased.

696
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,800
Fei, you are awesome.

697
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,430
I didn’t realize you are that awesome.

698
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,430
Of course.

699
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,150
You’ve improved a lot.

700
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,910
It’s good to be young.

701
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,000
Here you are.

702
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,190
In this big world,

703
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,390
endless young people are hoping

704
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,430
to achieve something big.

705
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,710
-Let Li Yan accompany you.
-Forget it.

706
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,280
Five or ten years.

707
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,950
How many can manage

708
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,950
to endure the sufferings in life?

709
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,280
You are young

710
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,630
but you can sing well.

711
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,840
Just now I forgot to tip you,

712
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,150
it was my fault.

713
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,230
You are...?

714
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,390
Me?

715
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,360
I am just a disciple of Yuyi Troupe.

716
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,950
I saw you take down the bookish man

717
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,430
by using moves of our sect.

718
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,520
So I came to ask you.

719
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,470
Where did you learn Floating Palm?

720
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,710
What’s your relationship
with Yuyi Troupe?

721
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,910
I once met Master Nichang

722
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,190
when I was young.

723
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,040
I’ve learned something from her

724
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,190
by seeing her performing martial arts.

725
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,760
But it was a parody.

726
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,040
It’s not the real Floating Palm.

727
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,000
I think so.

728
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,120
I don’t think you can learn the essence.

729
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,950
But when you are out,

730
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,760
don’t use other sect’s martial arts.

731
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,430
If someone sees it,

732
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,800
they will think Yuyi Troupe

733
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,950
is afraid of some stupid soldiers.

734
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,540
We will be a joke.

735
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,120
You are right.

736
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,710
But throughout history,

737
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,230
common people don’t fight officials.

738
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,560
The less trouble, the better.

739
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,470
Fighting

740
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,800
isn’t the only way to help others.

741
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,280
Floating Palm is created

742
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,520
by Master and Mr. Li of South Blade.

743
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,890
We don’t have a chance to learn it.

744
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,080
How can a loser like you

745
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,000
use it for showing off?

746
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,320
South Blade?

747
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,800
The famous South Blade

748
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,710
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

749
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,190
Mr. Li.

750
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,430
It’s such a big title.

751
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,840
Big title?

752
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,430
You don’t have it.

753
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,800
I think so.

754
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,230
You were so amazing.

755
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,420
Miss Zhou really uses your brain.

756
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,560
I saw you at the window,

757
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,470
thinking of something.

758
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,000
So this is what you’ve thought of.

759
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,190
Yes.

760
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,280
That’s a dangerous move.

761
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,630
Aren’t you afraid you will lose?

762
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,080
So what if I lose.

763
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,800
I am not afraid of being laughed at.

764
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,630
The worst case is to humiliate myself.

765
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,670
Besides, I’m injured.

766
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,840
His moves are flawless.

767
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,800
But his personality is not.

768
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,710
So I took advantage of it.

769
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,600
That’s smart.

770
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,560
Fei!

771
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,600
Fei, finally I found you.

772
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,470
Stay away.

773
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,040
You started the challenge.

774
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,800
Bonehead is one-track minded.

775
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,910
It’s easy for you to win him.

776
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,470
That’s for sure.

777
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,120
I haven’t asked you.

778
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,710
How did you get here?

779
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,150
Leader permitted me.

780
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,560
What was she thinking?

781
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,630
It’s... It’s true.

782
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,910
She asked Mr. Ma to come with me.

783
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,910
He got something to do halfway.

784
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,670
So he left.

785
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,600
Then

786
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,710
I ran into that Bonehead.

787
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,630
Fine.

788
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,280
I will take you to the Fortress

789
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,040
and see how Leader will deal with you.

790
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,800
Excuse me.

791
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,870
Madam asks to have a chat with you.

792
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,670
This way, please.

793
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,560
What are you nervous about?

794
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,950
You don’t know.

795
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,950
The blade Madam Nichang gave me

796
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,670
seems old.

797
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,120
And

798
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,330
I can tell from her look

799
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,260
that it’s precious.

800
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,520
So I guess

801
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,950
she might be another one

802
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,730
wishing to be my grandmother.

803
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,320
Madam, they are here.

804
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,290
Madam.

805
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,260
You may leave.

806
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,760
Yes.

807
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:15,930
Madam.

808
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,410
Little girl.

809
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,230
Who taught you Snow-breaking Blade?

810
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,750
My mom.

811
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:31,910
Good.

812
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,520
Li Zheng got a great heiress.

813
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,600
I’m afraid

814
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,150
Grandpa will appear in my dream
to scold me.

815
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,200
I played some tricks.

816
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,150
My martial art is not excellent.

817
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,950
When I close my eyes,

818
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,800
I feel like I can see Li Zheng

819
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,760
being serious and calm.

820
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,520
And

821
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,230
he is wearing faded clothes,

822
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,670
talking to a girl

823
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,000
respectfully

824
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,670
within a distance.

825
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,080
I can’t imagine

826
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,470
a girl at your age

827
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,910
to call him Grandpa.

828
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,080
It’s hilarious.

829
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,000
Madam.

830
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,970
Thanks for the blade.

831
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,430
It must be a matching pair

832
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,040
with the sword

833
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,630
hung on the wall.

834
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,210
We two are

835
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,900
evenly matched.

836
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,730
It is hard to tell

837
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,700
who’s the clear winner.

838
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,520
Since we can’t decide that on drinking,

839
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,950
how about

840
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,550
we compete on martial arts?

841
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,670
Here’s the wine.

842
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,760
The blade and the sword were made

843
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,000
by me for two old acquaintances.

844
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,600
The blade is named snow.

845
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,080
The sword is named mountain.

846
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,330
That two old acquaintances,

847
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,670
one was your grandpa,

848
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,630
Mr. Li.

849
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,260
The other was...

850
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,970
Yin Wenlan, the Mountain Sword.
