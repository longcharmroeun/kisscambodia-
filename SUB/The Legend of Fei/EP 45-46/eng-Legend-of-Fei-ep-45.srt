<i>Legend of Fei</i>

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,040
<i>Episode 45</i>

17
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,330
When it’s dog-eat-dog between them,

18
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,650
we can take advantage of it.

19
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,220
That’s right.

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,180
First, Yu Wenzhi asked Pathetic Clam
to steal the tokens

21
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,260
then he told Shen Tianshu to rescue her.

22
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,690
With him in between,

23
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,140
those two will be suspicious
about each other

24
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,740
and won’t be of one mind.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Even if he’s delayed,

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,310
I can still make him

27
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,800
part of the game

28
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,040
to churn the waters

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,910
this time.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,160
Are you saying...?

31
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,230
Isn’t it...?

32
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,230
Yes.

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,320
It belongs to Yu Wenzhi’s spy.

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,240
Since he’s colluding with Pathetic Clam,

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,520
I’ll use him

36
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,520
to drive a wedge

37
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,110
between Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu.

38
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,910
If they’re against each other,

39
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,830
she won’t

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,910
hand over the tokens to Shen Tianshu.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,550
With those tokens in hand,

42
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,750
who will she

43
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,830
side with?

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,360
Aren’t those Demons

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,750
full of tricks and schemes?

46
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,270
Very well.

47
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,440
It’s payback time!

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,190
Let Shen Tianshu be hoist

49
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,800
with his own petard.

50
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,240
Lord Gu,

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,520
bad news.

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
The bridge has been destroyed.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,030
There are no boats around.

54
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,600
How should we cross the river?

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,910
It must’ve been done on purpose.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,270
Correct.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,630
You have to beat me first

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,440
to join Shen Tianshu.

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,750
Madam Nichang,

60
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,720
why are you here?

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,080
What’s it to do with you?

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,750
I’m asked

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,520
to stop you here.

64
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,750
You think you chicks

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,670
are my match?

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,100
Gu Tianxian.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,470
Long time no see.

68
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,960
What about us, too?

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,000
Are we your match together?

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,000
Go, go, go.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Let’s go.

72
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Mr. Li,

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,000
my men found

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,390
eyes and ears of Demons here.

75
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,720
Please follow me.

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,000
Be careful and keep a low profile.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,070
Fei and Mr. Xie arrived here yesterday.

78
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,110
Did anyone see them?

79
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,550
A beggar

80
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,670
saw a man and a woman earlier

81
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,390
who carried a long blade.

82
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,200
That must be them.

83
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,950
Please tell them

84
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,440
to meet us here.

85
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,600
Fei was injured
by Pathetic Clam yesterday.

86
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,480
I wonder how she is now.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,270
Alright. I’m on it.

Chief Xu,

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,230
did you also receive
a letter from Chuchu?

92
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,350
No.

93
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,230
It was Miss Zhou.

94
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,640
She asked me

95
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,790
to teach those bastards a lesson.

96
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,720
Luckily, I asked Madam Nichang for help.

97
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,920

Right after Lord Hu came back,

100
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,920
she argued with Lord Shen.

101
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,230
With those two together,

102
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,040
our chance of winning is slim.

103
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,920
Stop gossiping about her!

104
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,160
That’ll get you killed!

105
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,510

I’m with the Route Gang.

00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
Mr. Li is waiting for you at the dock.

113
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,880
You can go join him.

114
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,880
Thanks.

115
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,440
You must be hungry.

Here.

117
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,830
Have some plum cakes.

118
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,480
That’ll help you remember things.

119
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,110
Why bother?

120
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,000
Feed her my poison.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,920
The excruciating pain

122
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,000
will certainly help jog her memory.

123
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,440
Don’t scare her.

124
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,480
She can take her time.

125
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,600
Let’s play a game.

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,320
You’re a carpenter, right?

127
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,000
You need your hands

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,390
to support your family, don’t you?

129
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,230
The game we’re playing

130
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,000
is called Chopping off Fingers.

131
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,440
Here’s the rule.

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,910
On my count of three,

133
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,710
if you still don’t remember anything,

134
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,590
he’ll lose one finger.

135
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,520
Then I’ll count again.
If I still hear nothing,

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,520
he’ll lose one more.

137
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Let’s see

138
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,320
how many fingers he’ll lose in total.

139
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,150
Let’s begin.

140
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,400
One.

141
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,710
No, no!

142
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,200
Two.

143
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,400
Three.

144
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,550
Stop! I’ll tell you.

145
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,520
I’ll write it down.

146
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,200
Young lady,

147
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,640
here’s a friendly reminder.

148
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,790
I’ve been looking for that treasure

149
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,790
long before you had been born.

150
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,110
Don’t you

151
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,910
try to fool me.

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,880
Li Sheng.

153
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,590
There you are.

154
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,280
Are you alright?

155
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
I’m fine.

156
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu
are together now.

157
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
I know.

158
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,470
We’ve checked around the town

159
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,840
and figured out where their people are.

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,080
It’s too risky

161
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,590
for us to act alone.

162
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,760
The current situation is in favor of us.

163
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,280
I’ve thought up a plan

164
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,030
to cast in a bone between them.

165
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,080
Shen Tianshu is suspicious by nature.

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,200
He can’t tolerate any deception.

167
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,880
As his most trusted help,

168
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,960
Pathetic Clam is colluding
with Yu Wenzhi.

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,400
I’m sure she knows

170
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,960
Shen Tianshu is suspecting her.

171
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,640
She won’t

172
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,880
hand over those tokens easily.

173
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,320
They’re her biggest leverage.

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,760
So I bet they’re still on her.

175
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,000
That’s where we can come in

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,350
and drive a wedge

177
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,590
between them

178
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,110
to avoid battling Shen Tianshu head-on.

179
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,880
It’s us against them, isn’t it?

180
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Let’s do it!

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,520
Why are you making it complicated?

182
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,710
Pathetic Clam is crafty.

183
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,550
Don’t leave her any wiggle room.

184
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,280
Beware of her.

185
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,320
You’re simple-minded.

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,670
Don’t hold us back.

187
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,440
Relax. I once battled her.

188
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
I’m aware of her tricks.

189
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,790
Alright.

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,080
Let’s split up.

191
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,150
If anything happens,

192
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,320
fire the whistling arrow

193
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,760
to alert each other.

194
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,960
Do not take risks.

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,110
Our enemies

196
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,910
are the top two

197
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,640
notorious Demons.

198
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,200
If you’re in danger,

199
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,280
or things go against you,

200
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,590
leave first.

201
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,880
We can abort the plan

202
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,150
and wait for another chance.

203
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,910
Yes, Madam.

204
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,400
Hang on.

205
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,230
You freaked me out.

206
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,710
Miss Zhou,

207
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,400
we still have resources here.

208
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,640
If you need anything,

209
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,400
don’t hesitate to tell me.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,590
Sure. Thanks.

211
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,910
What did you say to Li Sheng?

212
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,840
Nothing special

213
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,760
other than a contingency plan.

214
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,320
I guess Shen Tianshu

215
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,880
didn’t take too many people with him.

216
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,590
We can

217
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,670
bluff him with the Anping Army

218
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,110
if necessary.

219
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,640
Let’s go.

220
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
Leave it to me.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
I’ll lure him out.

222
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Yang Jin,

223
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
you have to really sell it.

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,440
Don’t fall into

225
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
Pathetic Clam’s traps.

226
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,520
Got it.

227
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,670
And you stop Demons

228
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,110
with our men.

229
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,520
Good.

230
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,400
There you go.

231
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,440
Why are you crying?

232
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,080
Could you let us go?

233
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,350
Would you like a plum cake?

234
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,710
Alright.

235
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,910
Your job is done.

236
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,760
We don’t need you anymore.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,790
Not yet.

238
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,960
Tianshu,

239
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,760
she humiliated me

240
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,520
back in the Cloud Ravine.

241
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,640
I must kill her!

242
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,230
Be patient.

243
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,710
Once you’re done crying,

244
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,640
recite the poem

245
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,470
from the beginning.

246
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,030
Then I’ll consider

247
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,880
if I’ll release you.

248
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,670
Let Senior Master Li go first.

249
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,880
Sure.

250
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,960
Why would I

251
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,590
keep a carpenter?

252
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,910
Tianshu,

253
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,440
you aren’t yourself today.

254
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
How could she lead you by the nose?

255
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,470
Tianying,

256
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,910
if she piled up a bunch of nonsense,

257
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,790
she couldn’t recite it accurately.

258
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,910
That’s why I’m asking her to do it.

259
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,910
If one word doesn’t match,

260
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,110
I’ll kill the carpenter.

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,470
And she can

262
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,520
have a taste of your poison.

263
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
Begin.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,230
This dough figure is you, isn’t it?

265
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,960
It’s quite accurate.

266
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,640
I’ll do it. I’ll do it. I’ll do it.

267
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,280
“I go to Wuzhou to see you

268
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,030
where mountains appear at dusk.

269
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,150
Climb... Climb...”

270
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,670
Climb the mountain to overlook
the north or the south?

271
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,880
“Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river.

272
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,910
Send stones and Ganoderma.

273
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,200
The... The...

274
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,670
The valley is beautiful

275
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,110
where birds sing beautifully.

276
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,760
Music comes everywhere

277
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,400
when four songs are played”.

278
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,670
All correct.

279
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,030
Good. Well done.

280
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
Senior Master Li.

281
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,760
Senior Master Li, go.

282
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,670
Says who?

283
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,400
You...

284
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,840
Tianying,

285
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,960
let him go.

286
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,910
As seniors,

287
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,550
we shouldn’t lie to a girl.

288
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,350
Tianshu,

289
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,960
if you let him go, then what?

290
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,670
To alert his people?

291
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,790
People of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight

292
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,760
could’ve followed me here.

293
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,790
It’s time to leave.

294
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,470
Tianying,

295
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,040
where are the five tokens?

296
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,950
Tokens?

297
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,920
I risked my life to get them for you.

298
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,430
Do you know how dangerous it was?

299
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,680
Zhou Fei almost killed me!

300
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,430
Tianying,

301
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,950
that poem

302
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,680
is the clue to finding the treasure.

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,800
We’re all set.

304
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,190
Give me the tokens

305
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,470
and we’ll head to
the Big Medicine Valley

306
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,880
to get the Book of Almighty Medicine

307
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,800
to treat you.

308
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,830
The Big Medicine Valley?

309
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,350
Sure.

310
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,400
Only if you kill her first.

311
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,710
What’s wrong? You can’t do it?

312
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,680
Tianying,

313
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,350
just ignore that girl.

314
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,310
Fine. I’m off.

315
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,210
Tianying,

316
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,250
you...

317
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,940
Do you still care about me?

318
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,850
Why are you doing this?

319
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,460
“Flowers will grow better next year.

320
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,330
Who will enjoy them with me?”

321
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,300
Tianshu,

322
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,420
am I already

323
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,970
a withered flower in your eyes?

324
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,700
What makes you say that?

325
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,490
I tolerated them for so long

326
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,460
only to find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven for you.

327
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,130
Tianying,

328
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,540
don’t argue with me about the tokens.

329
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,130
If it’s for me as you said,

330
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,940
does it matter

331
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,370
who keeps them?

332
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,490
Don’t you trust me?

333
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,300
Look at you.

334
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,490
Listen to yourself.

335
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,460
Every street is under Demons’ watch.

336
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,780
We must be careful.

337
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,660
If... If you kill me,

338
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,970
my aunt will avenge my death.

339
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,940
She’s poisoned.

340
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,780
Maybe she’s dead before you.

341
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,130
Liar!

342
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,210
That’s impossible!

343
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,580
What’s Yan doing here?

344
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,540
So the girl Demons mentioned is...

345
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,610
is Yan!

346
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,420
I asked her

347
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,900
to buy osmanthus liquor for you.

348
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,010
I didn’t know...

349
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,730
Fei,

350
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,580
it’s my fault.

351
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,970
She got caught

352
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,850
because of me.

353
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,250
How about this?

354
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,700
I’ll ask Shen Tianshu to take me

355
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,970
and let her go.

356
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
No!

357
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,300
Hear me out, Fei.

358
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,250
I’ll be his hostage

359
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,700
and get Li Yan out.

360
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,780
Then

361
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,210
I’ll use Gu Tianxian
caught by the Route Gang

362
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,490
to cut a deal with Shen Tianshu.

363
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,900
That way, I can stall them

364
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,780
and

365
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,900
make it easier for Li Sheng

366
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,970
to lure Pathetic Clam out.

367
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,610
But...

368
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,090
Don’t worry.

369
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,820
Shen Tianshu is in debt to my father.

370
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,010
He won’t harm me for old times’ sake.

371
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,540
Besides,

372
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,820
I have questions for him about the past.

373
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,700
All that will be enough to distract him.

374
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,700
Alright. Once I get Li Yan

375
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,010
and take her back,

376
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,730
I’ll wait for you outside.

377
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,850
Be very careful.

378
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,460
If things go south,

379
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,130
I’ll pull you out immediately.

380
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,730
With you protecting me in the dark,

381
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,820
I have nothing to fear.

382
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,060
Xie Yun, don’t get hurt,

383
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,180
or I’ll feed you to sharks,

384
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,300
alive or dead.

385
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,250
Fei,

386
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,820
one lapse can lead to death.

387
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,010
I’m depending on you.

388
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,590
How could you?

389
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,710
We had a deal

390
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,200
that if I wrote down the poem,

391
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,710
you’d let me go.

392
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,320
How could you go back on your word?

393
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,590
You sure can talk.

394
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,320
Let me

395
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,280
stitch your lips together.

396
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,990
Tianying, hurry up.

397
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,680
We have more important things to do.

398
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,440
Shen Tianshu,

399
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,590
aren’t you ashamed

400
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,990
of bullying a girl?

401
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,320
Well,

402
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,710
blame yourself

403
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,560
for not being stupid enough.

404
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,920
Lord Shen,

405
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
it’s been a while.

406
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,990
Xie Yun!

407
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,320
Are you ganging up

408
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,400
on a girl?

409
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,510
Your Majesty,

410
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,350
what brings you here?

411
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,590
I heard that my naive cousin

412
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,990
offended you,

413
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,510
so I’m here to apologize.

414
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,560
Please be lenient

415
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,750
and let her go.

416
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,990
Why should I?

417
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,800
Don’t get me wrong.

418
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,110
I’m here to propose

419
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,680
a swap.

420
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,800
Take me instead of her.

421
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,560
Fair enough, isn’t it?

422
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
Now that you are here,

423
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,080
I can keep both of you.

424
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,510
You can.

425
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,320
But I’m afraid

426
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,160
that’ll get you into trouble.

427
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,510
How so?

428
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,510
Without Li Jinrong,

429
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,590
how could the rest of you

430
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,080
cause me trouble?

431
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,230
We couldn’t

432
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,110
if Gu Tianxian and his force

433
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,590
were here

434
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,510
to help you.

435
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,350
But too bad...

436
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,280
Report!

437
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,990
Lord Gu and his men

438
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,750
are intercepted halfway.

439
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,830
Lord Gu is with one of my friends.

440
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,110
Yan is just

441
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,830
an ignorant girl.

442
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Let her go

443
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,320
in exchange for your right-hand man.

444
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,110
You won’t say no

445
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,160
to such a great deal, will you?

446
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,280
Why should I believe you?

447
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,590
You have eyes and ears
all over the Central Plains.

448
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,080
They’ll soon send the news to you.

449
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,870
If it’s not here

450
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,350
by midnight,

451
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,800
you can kill me.

452
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,080
Deal. You stay.

453
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,470
She can leave.

454
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,160
Xie Yun.

455
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,800
Sorry for disturbing you.

456
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,590
Go. Don’t look back.

457
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,870
Tianshu, you...

458
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,510
Calm down, Tianying.

459
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,960
He and I go way back.

460
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,400
Give us a minute.

461
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,200
I’ll explain everything to you later.

Don’t make Mr. Xie look bad. Go.

Yes.

Li Yan!

Come here.

Fei.

472
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,440
I’ll take you to see
Yang Jin and Li Sheng.

473
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,920
No need. Go on with your work.

474
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,590
I’ll go tell them myself.

475
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,710
You can’t protect yourself.

476
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,080
Don’t be stubborn.

477
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,800
Let’s go!

478
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,320
Bonehead,

479
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,350
she’s all yours.

480
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,590
I’ll go get Xie Yun out.

481
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,040
Behave yourself!

482
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,800
Zhou Fei...

483
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,830
Bonehead,

484
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,960
I thought I’d never see you again.

485
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,160
I’m glad you’re back.

486
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,080
Did I get Xie Yun in trouble?

487
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,110
No worries. Zhou Fei will help him out.

488
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,960
But...

489
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,320
She’ll have to confront Shen Tianshu.

490
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,350
Will she be in danger?

491
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,230
She’s as ferocious

492
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,470
as him.

493
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,680
What’s that supposed to mean?

494
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,200
Yan,

495
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,400
our men will take you
back to the Fortress

496
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,990
to keep you away from the battle later.

497
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,080
That’s your brother’s order

498
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,990
to ensure your safety.

499
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,200
I understand. I’ll stay here.

500
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,990
Be careful out there.

501
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,320
Lord Hu,

502
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,830
Commander-in-Chief’s man came

503
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,870
and said he’s here, too.

504
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,750
Lord Shen

505
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,040
will receive him in person.

506
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,510
Why did he come to me?

507
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,590
He said this would give you a clue.

508
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,280
What else did he say?

509
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,160
He said...

510
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,710
He’s waiting for you
at the pavilion outside.

511
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,350
If you don’t show up,

512
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,080
conditions he agreed on

513
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,830
will be withdrawn.

514
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,830
Just as I expected.

515
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Who else knows about this?

516
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,800
This message is for you only.

517
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,680
I wouldn’t dare tell others about it.

518
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,800
Good. You can keep secrets.

519
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,160
I should reward you.

520
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,590
Lord Hu.

521
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,080
I killed him

522
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,110
for disrespect. Is there a problem?

523
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,400
Of course not.

524
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,590
I’m going out for a walk

525
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,110
and I’ll be back soon.

526
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,560
Don’t say things you shouldn’t.

527
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
I wouldn’t dare.

528
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,510
But what if Lord Shen asks about you?

529
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,630
If he does

530
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,960
before I’m back,

531
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,280
just tell him,

532
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,990
“Flowers will grow better next year.

533
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,200
Who will enjoy them with me?”

534
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Remember,

535
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,750
do not say that to him

536
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,960
until he looks anxious.

537
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,320
Yes. You can count on me.

538
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,750
Clean up the mess.

539
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,440
Yes.

540
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,750
Tianshu, someday,

541
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,400
you’ll realize

542
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,680
only I love you wholeheartedly.

543
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:39,020
<i>Wood Workshop</i>

544
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,590
I’m surprised that this bland tea

545
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,230
is to your taste, Lord Shen.

546
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,440
You must’ve

547
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,350
been through a lot.

548
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,920
You’re still in the mood for tea.

549
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,080
What makes you so certain

550
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,040
that I won’t kill you?

551
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,560
My father

552
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,710
saved your life once.

553
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,510
That’s enough

554
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,400
for you to keep me
until midnight, isn’t it?

555
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,800
I’m not an ingrate.

556
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,110
Fine.

557
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,110
Midnight it is.

558
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,350
Your father is gone

559
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,510
but you still remember his past.

560
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,160
Have you forgotten about it?

561
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,560
When my family members were killed,

562
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,560
your father recruited me
to the Anping Army.

563
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,990
Yes, just as I heard.

564
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
This kind of story never grows old

565
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,990
between a compassionate man

566
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,800
and an ungrateful wolf.

567
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,920
Wang Lin called me an ungrateful wolf?

568
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,110
You know what,

569
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,470
that should be

570
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,400
Zhou Yitang.

571
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,560
Wang Lin trusted him the most,

572
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,590
yet he stole the Tally for a woman

573
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,200
to dispatch troops to help
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

574
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,830
Then he removed his skills,
left the Anping Army

575
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,080
and claimed that
he wished to repay his master.

576
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,800
That was the last time Wang Lin saw him!

577
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,230
Compared with him,

578
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,110
I’m nothing.

579
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,160
Why did you

580
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,320
also quit?

581
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,990
Didn’t Wang Lin tell you that?

582
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,560
I was too busy practicing skills

583
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,710
to come out.

584
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,960
I didn’t realize until now

585
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,560
how different

586
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,590
the younger generation is.

587
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,920
I’m flattered.

588
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,960
Zhou Yitang,

589
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,870
it took us three months of siege,

590
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,200
ten days of attacks to take this city

591
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,080
at the loss of half of our men.

592
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,200
Yet here you are,
Wang Lin’s beloved disciple,

593
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,440
sitting here bossing others around.

594
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,960
I make the rules

595
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,800
on the battlefield.

596
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,110
Those are your own rules.

597
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,870
Why did you kill the captives?

598
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,230
We risked our lives

599
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,750
to win this city

600
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,630
and we deserve to enjoy ourselves.

601
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,110
Or why should we serve you?

602
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,320
We’re the ones

603
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,080
fighting on the battlefield
for Wang Lin.

604
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,200
If there are

605
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,710
so many rules to follow,

606
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,680
I might as well quit.

607
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,560
Let’s go

608
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,510
if you’d like to join me.

609
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,630
Let’s go.

610
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,680
Hold on.

611
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,960
That’s it? You’re leaving?

612
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,510
Fine.

613
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,040
I’ll give you something

614
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,920
to show Wang Lin.

615
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,830
Leader!

616
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,590
No wonder

617
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,350
you attempted to kill
Lord Gantang over and over.

618
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,990
He didn’t deserve to be the commander.

619
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,470
So by your logic,

620
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,160
the weak can only

621
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,830
blame themselves for being killed.

622
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,510
Do you remember

623
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,810
you were one of them

624
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,110
when my father first found you?

625
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,270
General Wang Lin told me

626
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,350
that he established the Anping Army

627
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,630
to protect the masses

628
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,630
from harm.

629
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,870
Mr. Zhou has followed in

630
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,000
his footsteps in that regard.

631
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,870
That’s why I was asked

632
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,830
to bring this badge

633
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,630
to him.

634
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,680
<i>Anping Army</i>
Turns out,

635
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,520
I made the right choice.

636
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,110
Since then, the Xiaos
have run out of their luck

637
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,720
and the Anping Army has fallen apart.

638
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,200
Once I open
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

639
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,630
I’ll build my own force

640
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,830
100 times stronger than Anping

641
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,790
and crush Zhou Yitang.

642
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,240
My lord,

643
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
it’s been confirmed that
Lord Gu and his men

644
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
were ambushed on the way here

645
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,720
by the Route Gang and Yuyi Troupe.

646
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,590
I see.

647
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Lord Shen,

648
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,830
see? I told you so.

649
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,960
Yes.

650
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,680
It’s already midnight.

651
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,350
Let’s see

652
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,070
if anyone will swap you out

653
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,070
the same as you did to that girl.

654
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,440
Commander is occupied. Please hold on.

655
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,160
Why did you come all the way

656
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,830
to see me?

657
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,000
It’s you!

658
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,760
Seize her!

659
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,720
She poisoned Leader Li!

660
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,870
I’m too careless

661
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,720
to see through your shallow trick.

662
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,920
Kill her for Leader!

663
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,920
Watch out for the poison!

664
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Capture her! Go!

665
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,480
-Yes!
-Let’s go!

666
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Your Majesty,

667
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,270
my patience has run out.

668
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,160
Looks like your help

669
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,920
didn’t come as expected.

670
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,960
Lord Shen,

671
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,200
you can’t kill me.

672
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,680
What makes you so sure?

673
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,680
Because he’s here.

674
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,070
Report!

675
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,200
Lord Shen, Lord Hu...

676
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,070
Speak!

677
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,590
She went to meet with
Yu Wenzhi in private.

678
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,310
She has all the tokens.

679
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,790
Go get her back.

680
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,920
Yes.

681
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,310
Why bother?

682
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,350
Yu Wenzhi has had them all.

683
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,550
It’s too late.

684
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
You lured him here, didn’t you?

685
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,270
You’re old

686
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,870
and grumpy.

687
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,830
Too bad,

688
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,270
you’ve thrown good money after bad.

689
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,720
You didn’t expect

690
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,400
he and your woman
would be so close

691
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,270
that they’d stab you
in the back, did you?

692
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,200
Now,

693
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,400
they’re probably on their way back.

694
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,030
So they’re your help.

695
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,760
Unfortunately,

696
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,760
no one can help you now.

697
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,270
Given your condition,

698
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,160
I can kill you in a second.

699
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,000
Wrong! His help is here.

700
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,240
Fei.

701
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,200
Lord Shen,

702
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,070
take a guess.

703
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,960
How long will it take you

704
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,350
to kill me?

705
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,680
This is

706
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,960
all your trick, isn’t it?

707
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,000
Correct. Let him go.

708
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,790
Lord Shen,

709
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,030
when a snipe and a clam fight,
the fisherman wins.

710
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,520
Yu Wenzhi would love

711
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,480
seeing us coming at each other.

712
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,070
Are you alright?

713
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,160
I’m fine.

714
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,270
So quiet.

715
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,350
Anping Army? Why are they here?

716
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,440
Lord Shen,

717
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,480
before Lord Hu left,

718
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,240
she left you a message that

719
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,400
“Flowers will grow better next year.
Who will enjoy them with me?”

720
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,030
Hou Zuo,

721
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,480
ask our men

722
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
to stop the Anping Army.

723
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,070
Yes.

724
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,440
You two follow me.

725
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,790
Li Sheng!

726
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,270
Pathetic Clam is gone.

727
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,440
That’s bad.

728
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,270
If she and Shen Tianshu get together,

729
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,960
Fei will be in danger.

730
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,790
Over there!

731
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,000
Yang Jin, take care of them.

732
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,110
I’ll go find Fei.

733
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,110
No problem.

734
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,160
Tianshu,

735
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,070
someday,

736
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,630
you’ll realize

737
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,870
only I love you wholeheartedly.

738
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,760
Lord Hu.

739
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,270
Commander-in-Chief’s man came

740
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,240
and said he’s here, too.

741
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,200
Report!

742
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,070
No sign of Lord Hu.

743
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,240
We don’t know
if she’s surrounded by enemies.

744
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,440
Kill everyone

745
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,830
in the way. No exception.

746
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,630
Yes.

747
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,480
Where are the tokens? Say it!

748
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,830
Leave when you still can.

749
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,240
Tianshu will soon be here.

750
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,870
Then it’ll be too late.

751
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,440
Fei.

752
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,160
Are you alright?

753
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,480
All good.

754
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,400
Upon receiving Pathetic Clam’s message,

755
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,830
Shen Tianshu rushed to leave
without battling us.

756
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
That’s odd.

757
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,160
Their man said

758
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,630
he had left.

759
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,440
That fast?

760
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,480
No way!

761
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,160
When he left,

762
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,030
the tokens were still on you.

763
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,070
No way!

764
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,400
I gave everything to him.

765
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,070
He wouldn’t abandon me.

766
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,440
He needs the Color of Ocean and Heaven

767
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,400
to save me
with the Book of Almighty Medicine.

768
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,790
He wouldn’t leave me behind.

769
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,110
Book of Almighty Medicine?

770
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,830
The one belongs to
the Big Medicine Valley?

771
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,240
Yes.

772
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,920
Book of Almighty Medicine

773
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,030
includes cures for Worry-burying,

774
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,550
Bone-chilling

775
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,830
and every poison in the world.

776
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,030
Without you,

777
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,720
I would’ve been together with Tianshu.

778
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,760
A treacherous killer like you

779
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,400
bought such nonsense?

780
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,870
Li Sheng, Zhou Fei,

781
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,830
Lord Gantang is back safe and sound.

782
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,720
My father is back!

783
00:46:22,844 --> 00:46:32,844
