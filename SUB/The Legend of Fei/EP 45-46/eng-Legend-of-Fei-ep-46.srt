<i>Legend of Fei</i>

16
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,140
<i>Episode 46</i>

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,960
Li Sheng, Zhou Fei,

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,920
Lord Gantang is back safe and sound.

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,790
Cousin.

20
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,430
She’s... All yours.

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,360
I heard you need medicine

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,070
to suppress the poison in your system.

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,310
Killing you would be too easy.

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
So many people died of your poison.

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,870
It’s time for you

26
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,720
to taste it yourself.

27
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,110
When Shen Tianshu left,

28
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,720
we should’ve known

29
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,520
that he had decided

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,280
to sacrifice others if necessary.

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
You never would’ve guessed

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
that’d be you, right?

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,280
He wouldn’t.

34
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,590
Tianshu would never abandon me.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
He’d come to get me out.

36
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,670
He’d be here soon.

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Grandfather, Aunt,

38
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,000
she’s finally paid

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,160
for what she had done to you.

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,030
“I go to Wuzhou to see you

41
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,670
where mountains appear at dusk.

42
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,670
Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river.

43
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,920
Send stones and Ganoderma.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,160
The valley is splendid

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,000
where birds sing beautifully.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,920
Music comes everywhere

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,670
when four songs are played”.

48
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,520
Lord, is this poem

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,720
the key to finding
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Liu Youliang guarded it with his life.

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,990
It must be useful.

52
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,750
The tokens are irregular

53
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,470
and suspicious.

54
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,800
Were they not,

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,640
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
would’ve been long gone.

56
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,550
What should we do next?

57
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,310
Tiankuang can go with you.

58
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,520
-Lord.
-Lord Shen is occupied.

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,750
-Move!
-Do not disturb.

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,800
Lu Tiankuang.

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,870
-Go away!
-You...

62
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
How did my sister die?

63
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Are you blaming Lord Shen for her death?

64
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,030
It was her fault

65
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,640
that she was weaker than others.

66
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,080
Gu Tianxian.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,150
Are you accusing me of murder?

68
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,150
Hadn’t you sent her to
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

69
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,960
she wouldn’t have died.

70
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,550
When did I send her there?

71
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,840
All she cared about

72
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,470
was you.

73
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,080
She only listened to you.

74
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,620
<i>To Tianshu</i>

75
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,470
After she lost the Seal of Cautiousness,

76
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,680
<i>Dear Tianshu</i>
I asked her to come back in the letter.

77
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,870
That was her response,

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,680
saying she had promised
Commander-in-chief

79
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
to retrieve the five tokens.

80
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,920
You recognize her handwriting.

81
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,430
Read it yourself.

82
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,340
<i>I won’t come back
until I have all five tokens.</i>

83
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,430
Stop wasting your time on me.

84
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,430
Save your strength to avenge her death.

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
How did she die?

86
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,200
The Snow-breaking Blade killed her.

87
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,870
Zhou Fei!

88
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,430
Lord,

89
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,520
I’m going to

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,430
fulfill her lifetime wish

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,310
to obtain Book of Almighty Medicine.

92
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,520
Please help me

93
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,150
get revenge for her.

94
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,150
In that case,

95
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,120
you must obey my orders.

96
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,800
All the sacrifice is worth it

97
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,470
for The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

98
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,640
What do you think?

99
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,800
You’re indeed skilled, Mr. Deng.

100
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
I’m not half as good as my master.

101
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,680
That’s too modest of you.

102
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,200
Few are as capable as you.

103
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,310
I’m not.

104
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,310
I once read a book at my master’s,

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,120
titled Refinement of Iron,

106
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,200
in which skills of refining and smelting

107
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,240
are top-notch.

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,120
They can make weapons

109
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,030
100 times better than those in use now.

110
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,710
I’m nothing compared with my master.

111
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
You don’t believe me?

112
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,000
Have a look.

113
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,550
My master made this blade

114
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,110
according to that book.

115
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,600
Hold it.

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,510
Cut this one.

117
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,760
Go ahead.

118
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,470
See? It’s true.

119
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,790
Incredible!

120
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
I wish

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,350
I could have a glance at that book.

122
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,320
I know. Me too.

123
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,150
But it’s gone with my master.

124
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,790
I don’t think we can read it again.

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,350
You certainly can

126
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
when he’s back, can’t you?

127
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
It’s not that easy.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,710
I heard

129
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,840
he had presented it to His Majesty.

130
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,400
It’s almost impossible to have it back.

131
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,470
Is there someone else who’s read it?

132
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,280
I mean if there is,

133
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,320
I can ask around for you.

134
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,590
I’ve never told anyone about it

135
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,280
except you.

136
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,760
It was a spur of the moment.

137
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,910
This Iron Hand

138
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,590
is the best I’ve ever made.

139
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,880
I’m in luck.

140
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,030
With that book

141
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,280
in my hand,

142
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,520
I’ll become unstoppable.

143
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,320
Fei, Lord Gantang is back.

144
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,640
Father, there you are!

145
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,550
Fei.

146
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,110
Mother...

147
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,470
I should’ve come back earlier.

148
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,710
She’s poisoned with Worry-burying.

149
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,910
According to Pathetic Clam,

150
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,840
the antidote is inside

151
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,910
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,150
Unfortunately,

153
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,400
the tokens are now
in Shen Tianshu’s hand.

154
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,110
Don’t worry too much.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Perhaps

156
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,590
Abbot Tongming on Penglai Island

157
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,550
can remove her poison.

158
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,200
Really?

159
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Yes.

160
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,340
<i>True self</i>

161
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,030
Fei,

162
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,400
what you’re holding

163
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,440
isn’t Unbreakable, is it?

164
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,030
Father,

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,710
that one is broken.

166
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,400
This is...

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,150
A gift from Xie Yun, right?

168
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,670
It must’ve taken him

169
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,760
a lot of effort

170
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,110
to find such a fine blade.

171
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,000
He owed me one

172
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,320
and he was obligated to pay me back.

173
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,200
Fei,

174
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,840
the so-called heaven’s will

175
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,200
or fate

176
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,230
is merely an excuse made by the weak.

177
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,910
We can’t run away from everything.

178
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
I know you

179
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,350
too well.

180
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,670
You aren’t a quitter.

181
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,080
You’ll fight to the end

182
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,400
with your blade

183
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,030
against the enemy.

184
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,760
Remember,

185
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:05,150
stay calm, be brave and you’ll win.

186
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,350
I understand.

187
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,470
I’m leaving with your mother

188
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,710
for Penglai.

189
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
Here.

190
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,790
Have a drink to warm up.

191
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,880
Thank you, Lord Gantang.

192
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,350
It can keep you warm for now.

193
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,470
Ever since Fei left home,

194
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,560
I’ve been watching you.

195
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,590
General Wang Lin once told me

196
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,590
you’re sentimental by nature.

197
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,800
You’re wise

198
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,430
but not cruel enough to be a ruler.

199
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,800
So you might not live long.

200
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,430
I was naive.

201
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,830
I tried so hard to prove him wrong

202
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,040
but I failed.

203
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,190
Lord Gantang, I...

204
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,950
I know.

205
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,560
You’ve been

206
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,230
running away from the name.

207
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,230
“Xiao Chuan”.

208
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,190
You want to be “Xie Yun”.

209
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,950
So when you came to deliver the badge,

210
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,760
I accepted it.

211
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,040
I didn’t force you to go back.

212
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
I’m always grateful to you for that.

213
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,880
Masters of two generations

214
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,950
have gone for that treasure.

215
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,560
Jinrong’s life is also at risk.

216
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,470
As the owner of it,

217
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,160
you still won’t shoulder
your responsibility?

218
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,920
I thought

219
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,590
we can put an end to everything

220
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,560
when we had all five tokens.

221
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,070
To prevent future trouble,

222
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,160
I consulted Madam Li

223
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,830
about destroying the tokens

224
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,680
once and for all.

225
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,590
I know her.

226
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,950
She’d never agree to that.

227
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,920
I’m sorry.

228
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,950
Don’t be.

229
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,520
She didn’t keep them

230
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,710
for you,

231
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,680
but for the greater good.

232
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,800
So

233
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,280
I’m the one

234
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,680
who should apologize.

235
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,190
I’m leaving for Penglai with Jinrong

236
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,710
to have Abbot Tongming treat her.

237
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,190
All that started with me.

238
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,470
I knew

239
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,310
you wouldn’t agree
to have them destroyed.

240
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,190
So

241
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,710
from now on,

242
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,230
I’ll try to locate the treasure

243
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,000
to draw an end

244
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,310
to everything.

245
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,430
Your Majesty, that’s not what I mean.

246
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,400
Think about it.

247
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,520
If it fell into the Demons’ hands,

248
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,640
a catastrophe would rise.

249
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,520
If it was found by ambitious schemers,

250
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,040
blood would be shed.

251
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,230
But if the right people got hold of it,

252
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,000
it could save the world.

253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,680
All that

254
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,160
is up to you.

255
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,520
Your Majesty.

256
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,950
I’ve entrusted Anping Army to Wen Yu.

257
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,310
Please look after Fei for me.

258

You know,

you aren’t alone in this.

261
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,800
You’ve made tons of

262
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,800
like-minded friends along the way,

263
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,800
right?

264
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,350
I know

265
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,830
whatever happens,

266
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,880
Fei will always have my back.

267
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,210
Lord Gantang,

268
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,540
I swear

269
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,930
I’ll protect her

270
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,060
until the very last moment.

271
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,810
And I’ll

272
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,300
pave the way ahead of her.

273
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,260
Fei, take care of yourself.

274
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,420
Your mother will be fine.

275
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,570
Yan,

276
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,020
it’s time to eat.

277
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,060
You barely had anything yesterday.

278
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,500
I’ll practice hard

279
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,420
to impress Aunt when she gets back.

280
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,380
Enough.

281
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,380
Be good.

282
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,020
Take a break.

283
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
Alright.

284
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,660
Chuchu.

285
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,500
You know,

286
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,730
Aunt is always strong.

287
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,930
She’ll be fine, right?

288
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,610
Don’t worry too much.

289
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,090
She wouldn’t leave us behind.

290
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,180
Chuchu,

291
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,060
I’ve been thinking

292
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,260
if I had practiced hard

293
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,970
instead of slacking,

294
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,500
I would’ve been as skilled as Fei

295
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,730
and I could’ve protected others.

296
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,090
That way, Aunt wouldn’t have...

297
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,660
I know you’re upset

298
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,140
and eager to improve your skills,

299
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,180
but what happened isn’t your fault.

300
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,970
Don’t beat yourself up.

301
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,330
I used to believe

302
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,930
there were no good or bad people,

303
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,450
only their stands

304
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,690
and views were different.

305
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,380
But I was wrong.

306
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,500
Some are born evil.

307
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,570
They mean to destroy

308
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,610
what others cherish
by fair means or foul.

309
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,900
I admit that I’m less skilled

310
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,420
and talented than others,

311
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,180
but other than martial arts,

312
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,690
there are other weapons I can use

313
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,780
just like those in this book.

314
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,610
I want to be like Ying Hecong

315
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,810
and kill those Demons myself!

316
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,850
Gentlemen know what to do

317
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,140
and what not to do.

318
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,730
Is it wrong

319
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,610
to kill bad people?

320
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,930
Take poison

321
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,930
as an example.

322
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,610
Both Ying Hecong

323
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,500
and Pathetic Clam use it.

324
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,780
Do you know

325
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,850
the difference between them?

326
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,260
I do, Chuchu.

327
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,570
The last thing we want

328
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,380
is to see you drown yourself in hatred.

329
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,380
I’m more worried about Fei.

330
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,300
Ever since Pathetic Clam died,

331
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,810
she’s locked herself in the room.

332
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,180
Mr. Xie is there with her.

333
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,610
He’ll comfort her.

334
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,060
I know how she feels,

335
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,930
but

336
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,380
that woman’s death
couldn’t repair the damage.

337
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,540
Xie Yun and Aunt

338
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,970
are dying because of her,

339
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,020
but

340
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,780
the mastermind got away with it.

341
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,210
Nobody can handle

342
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,660
such pain.

343
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,180
Fei can.

344
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,260
Everyone,

345
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,780
remember how Old Master took you in?

346
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,540
I could never repay him
for his kindness.

347
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,300
We all know how bad the situation is.

348
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,330
No one can help us.

349
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,330
That’s right.

350
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,140
What if the Demons raided us again

351
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,060
just like the last time?

352
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,380
Look,

353
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,900
we must stay together

354
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,970
in times like this.

355
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,660
We can’t fall apart

356
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,540
from inside.

357
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,380
Fei is here. You can tell her

358
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,020
what you think.

359
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,660
We never force people to do anything.

360
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,420
You’re free to stay or leave.

361
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,300
Fei,

362
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,210
don’t get me wrong,

363
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,090
but other than Madam Li,

364
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,060
who can take charge of the Fortress?

365
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,260
We’re old

366
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,450
and almost got killed
by the Demons more than once.

367
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,260
It’s probably too much

368
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,930
to ask for a peaceful retirement.

369
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,210
Leader Niu,

370
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,540
we’re grateful for your service

371
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,180
all these years.

372
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,930
If you ever wish to come back,

373
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,420
our Fortress

374
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,570
is always open to you.

375
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,690
Elders,

376
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,930
I’m here to tell you

377
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,060
that I’m leaving

378
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,810
to look for
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

379
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,090
And I’m entrusting you

380
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,380
with things here.

381
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,610
You can’t, Fei.

382
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,540
I know how much you hate them.

383
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,140
But don’t act on impulse.

384
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,060
What if something happens...?

385
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,210
Trust me. I know what I’m doing.

386
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,330
As long as the Demons

387
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,180
are after The Color of Ocean and Heaven,

388
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,610
we’ll always

389
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,500
be in danger,

390
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,850
and so will

391
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,930
the rest of all sects.

392
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,970
We can’t run away from them.

393
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,260
“I go to Wuzhou to see you

394
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,540
where mountains appear at dusk.

395
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,780
Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river.

396
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,500
Send stones and Catalpa branches”.

397
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,660
Lord Gu,

398
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,060
where’s the entrance of
the Big Medicine Valley?

399
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,210
It’s right in this poem.

400
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,610
“Where mountains appear at dusk”.

401
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,420
We’re surrounded by mountains.

402
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,210
“Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river”.

403
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,020
“The north of the river”?

404
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,930
What’s there to look?

405
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,090
Open your eyes

406
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,020
and check carefully.

407
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,660
Let me know

408
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,930
if there’s anything matching the poem.

409
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,660
Yes.

410
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,420
Lord Gu!

411
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,660
Lord Gu!

412
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,500
There’s a strange place

413
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,900
where irregular rocks pile on.

414
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,810
“Where mountains appear at dusk”.

415
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,900
Is this it?

416
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,210
Check the surroundings
for anything unusual.

417
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,180
Yes.

418
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,450
Anything?

419
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,540
What did you see?

420
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Lord Gu,

421
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,610
there’s nothing strange.

422
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,180
“Send stones and Catalpa branches”.

423
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,540
Did you see Catalpa trees

424
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,060
on our way here?

425
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,330
Trees are many,

426
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,210
but not of that species.

427
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,180
That can’t be!

428
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,210
The entrance

429
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,260
must be nearby.

430
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,330
Hurry up.

431
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:27,970
Yes.

432
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,500
Be careful.

433
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,780
Don’t drop anything.

434
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,660
Got it.

435
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,020
-Be careful. Slowly.
-Leader Niu.

436
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,380
These are all from Miss Zhou.

437
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,730
What are they?

438
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,660
Knowing that we’re heading to the north,

439
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,900
she’s prepared
thick clothes and food for us.

440
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,610
And

441
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,140
herbs, too.

442
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,810
She said you practice a lot

443
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,420
and suffer from leg pain.

444
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,540
Apply the herbs to your injury

445
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,140
and you’ll feel better.

446
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,930
She’s considerate.

447
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,140
Where is she?

448
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,380
On the training field.

449
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,380
You may leave.

450
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,090
Put it over there.

451
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,330
Got it.

452
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,780
Li Zheng’s granddaughter

453
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,060
wouldn’t dare to lie to me.

454
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,690
Then...

455
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,850
Then I must’ve

456
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,300
missed something in the poem.

457
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,970
But I swear

458
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,610
I’ve done my best.

459
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,970
Never mind.

460
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,930
What should we

461
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,380
do next?

462
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,260
A jade ox.

463
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,810
When I came across it months ago,

464
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,060
I thought it’d be to your taste,

465
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,380
so I kept it for you.

466
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,380
That’s

467
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,180
too kind of you.

468
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,260
As you know,

469
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,570
my brother and I...

470
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,330
I work under him

471
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,210
and dare not to offend him.

472
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,610
Hold on.

473
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,570
Just hear me out.

474
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,730
What I’m saying is

475
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,180
he’s above you now,

476
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,780
but might not be forever,

477
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,500
right?

478
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,540
We’re friends.

479
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,970
If one day, I take his place,

480
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,060
this kind of accessory

481
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,330
might be too cheap for you.

482
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,730
This jade piece is spotless

483
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,570
as if it were a masterpiece of nature.

484
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,730
It’s a rare treasure.

485
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,140
No one deserves it other than you.

486
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,970
I’m glad you like it.

487
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,540
Report!

488
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,210
Commander,

489
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,850
you have a visitor.

490
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,330
Who is it?

491
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,900
A man surnamed Shen.

492
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,380
It’s time

493
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,500
for me to leave.

494
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,090
Thanks for your gift.

495
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,540
If you need anything from me,

496
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,780
just let me know.

497
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,100
Have a seat, Lord Shen.

498
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,370
To what do I owe

499
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,300
the honor?

500
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,060
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

501
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,860
I heard the tokens

502
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,620
are all in Zhou Fei’s hand.

503
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,580
I can’t do anything about it.

504
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,210
Not anymore.

505
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,580
They belong to me now.

506
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,890
Congratulations!

507
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,730
There’s a confusing poem

508
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,370
about the treasure,

509
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,500
and I couldn’t figure it out.

510
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,860
I understand you own tons of talents...

511
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,620
Lord Shen,

512
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,130
they’re useless

513
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,860
compared with your people.

514
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,620
Besides, you’ve warned me to stay away

515
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,650
from what’s inside the treasure.

516
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,300
Why should I help you?

517
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,970
I’ve seldom asked others for favors

518
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,580
and I won’t take back

519
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,500
what I’ve said.

520
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,650
You may be a deterrent

521
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,860
to other sects,

522
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,650
but compared with

523
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,690
my formidable troops,

524
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,690
you’re nothing.

525
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,650
So what

526
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,860
if I turn you down?

527
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,690
Your troops

528
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,780
may be formidable,

529
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,620
but they can’t stop me

530
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,410
from taking a person’s life.

531
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,060
Trust me,

532
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,650
or go back to your tent

533
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,930
and wait for it.

534
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,650
I’m not

535
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,650
an ingrate.

536
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,500
Once I obtain that treasure,

537
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,820
I’ll do my utmost

538
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,450
to help you fulfill your wish.

539
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,060
Tiankuang,

540
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,860
I can find the entrance

541
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,860
on my own.

542
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,450
That treasure concerns our future.

543
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,690
We can’t be too careful.

544
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,500
Lords,

545
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,130
the poem shows

546
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,260
the entrance

547
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,370
is most likely to be here.

548
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,170
But some of the lines are wrong.

549
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,970
Really?

550
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,890
No wonder I didn’t find it.

551
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,730
The good news is

552
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,210
we can use the surroundings

553
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,300
to locate it.

554
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,370
How long will it take?

555
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,650
About two hours.

556
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,820
Make it quick.

557
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,690
Sheng,

558
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,370
have some food.

559
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,650
What’s on your mind?

560
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,300
Fei says she’s going to get
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

561
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,500
but the Demons have all the tokens.

562
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,930
As skilled as she is,

563
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,170
she’s still

564
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,580
not Shen Tianshu’s match.

565
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,340
Sheng,

566
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,650
are you saying

567
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,340
Fei is looking for
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

568
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,260
I know where it is.

569
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,690
It’s in the Big Medicine Valley.

570
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,020
Who told you that?

571
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,970
Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu said it.

572
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,650
It’s true.

573
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,130
Li Sheng, I was just told

574
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,650
Demons Manor had dispatched a squad

575
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,820
to the north.

576
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,970
Their destination is unknown yet.

577
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,930
Go tell

578
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,130
Zhou Fei and Xie Yun
to meet me at the Hall of Elders

579
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,580
for an emergency.

580
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,580
Yes.

581
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,540
Yan,

582
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,970
ask Yang Jin to come over, too.

583
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,020
Got it.

584
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,210
Let’s go.

585
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,690
It’s in the Big Medicine Valley?

586
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,820
That’s right.

587
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,970
Shen Tianshu and Pathetic Clam said so.

588
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,210
Lyu Run’s disciple founded
the Big Medicine Valley.

589
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,410
And he himself wrote
Book of Almighty Medicine.

590
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,820
That book

591
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,540
is highly likely to be there.

592
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,410
General Huang, Huang Shenbian,

593
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,410
was the son of Lyu Run’s disciple.

594
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,780
It makes sense

595
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,580
that he’d keep the treasure

596
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,500
at that secluded valley.

597
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,370
Besides,

598
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,580
Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu

599
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,970
had all the tokens then.

600
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,890
Why would they lie to a girl?

601
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,540
It’s said the entrance

602
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,020
is trapped and concealed.

603
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,370
The poem Liu Youliang left behind

604
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,820
must be the clue.

605
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,860
Anything new about the Demons?

606
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,100
All we know is

607
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,210
they’re heading to the north,

608
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,730
probably in the direction of
the Big Medicine Valley.

609
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,500
If so, let’s go.

610
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,210
Yes.

611
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,540
Hold your horses.

612
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,450
That poem is still a mystery.

613
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,170
If we leave unprepared...

614
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,500
Stop dragging your feet.

615
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,370
Instead of pondering over

616
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,500
those words such as
“mountains” and “dusk”,

617
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,210
why don’t we go there and have a look?

618
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,970
I agree.

619
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,130
But...

620
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,130
Sheng,

621
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,650
Fei is right.

622
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,060
It’s better than

623
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,020
sitting here and doing nothing.

624
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,410
If you’ve made up your mind,

625
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,100
I’ll go with you.

626
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,260
I can

627
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,620
deal with traps there.

628
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,210
I meant

629
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,340
to have you stay

630
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,890
and take care of things here.

631
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,260
It’s imperative to find that treasure.

632
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,820
We need all hands on deck

633
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,930
and end things once and for all.

634
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,820
Besides,

635
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,260
the risk is high this time.

636
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,340
The more the help, the better.

637
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,820
Li Sheng is right.

638
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,410
We can’t let you two go there alone.

639
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,860
We aren’t too skilled,

640
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,210
but we can still be of help.

641
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,210
Yang Jin,

642
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,020
this is

643
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,820
our family matter

644
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,860
and I hate to drag you into it.

645
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,450
It’s just...

646
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,730
If...

647
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,340
things go wrong,

648
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,580
I hope

649
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,620
you can take care of my sister.

650
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,860
I’m officially

651
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,930
entrusting her to you.

652
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,580
You...

653
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,410
What are you doing?

654
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,540
I can take care of myself.

655
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,970
And

656
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,650
I don’t need him.

657
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,540
Now isn’t the time for this.

658
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,780
I’m not afraid of death.

659
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:42,860
Yang Jin,

660
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,780
what about your valley?

661
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,820
The Small Medicine Valley

662
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,020
is built to triumph over evil.

663
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,340
If I could get hold of

664
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,650
rare medical books,

665
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,820
those elders would be thrilled.

666
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,260
They’d trade me for them if necessary.

667
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,970
Is there such a rule in their sect?

668
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,410
Yang Jin,

669
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,450
I know I can’t stop you,

670
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,620
but think about it.

671
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,300
Only two girls are left here.

672
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,890
What if...

673
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,370
Sheng, you don’t know anything.

674
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,860
Chuchu and I have decided

675
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,170
to join you.

676
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,620
I thought you knew better than her.

677
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,450
How come you’re on her side?

678
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,930
Yan,

679
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,020
you’d better stay at home.

680
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,370
We’ll get things done.

681
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,780
What are you talking about?

682
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,930
That poem

683
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,300
started with me.

684
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,580
I must go with you.

685
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,300
Li Yan!

686
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,690
Sheng,

687
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,370
I’m no longer a kid.

688
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,450
I can do

689
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,410
as much as you do.

690
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,780
This isn’t a game.

691
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,690
It’s different.

692
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,500
That’s why I’m coming with you.

693
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,970
Aunt treated me so well.

694
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,540
I must do something for her.

695
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,100
Enough. I’ve made up my mind.

696
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,620
Sheng,

697
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,970
I know you want to protect her,

698
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,370
but can you do that forever?

699
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,340
So

700
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,340
you should respect her decision.

701
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,540
Are you sure about this?

702
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,100
Since my parents were killed,

703
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,100
I’ve decided

704
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,500
to not run away from anything.

705
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,210
I’ll fight side by side with you

706
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,500
to the end.

707
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,580
Zhou Fei,

708
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,130
say something!

709
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,170
I was weak

710
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,930
when I first left home

711
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,620
and I was near death more than once.

712
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Masters I met along the way

713
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,210
never told me to give up.

714
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,300
They all trusted me instead.

715
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,410
Cousin,

716
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,130
none of us wants to quit.

717
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,820
Stop wasting your time.

718
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,130
Let’s go.

719
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,020
Alright. It’s settled.

720
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,890
Whatever comes our way,

721
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,580
we’ll handle it together.

722
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,730
Please!

723
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,210
Fine.

724
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,370
Enemies are still out there.

725
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,020
Damage can’t be undone.

726
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,300
Let’s end everything with us.

727
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,930
-Yes!
-Let’s go!

728
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,600
<i>Hall of Elders</i>

729
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,320
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

730
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,370
Fei,

731
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,340
We’re ready

732
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,300
to go anytime.

733
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,970
Fei,

734
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,970
this trip is full of danger

735
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:39,370
and the unknown.

736
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,780
Listen,

737
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,860
whatever happens,

738
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,890
I’m always here with you.

739
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,690
You aren’t alone.

740
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,020
I’ll kill

741
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,100
whoever gets in my way.

742
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,930
Look at you.

743
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,450
When you’re quiet,

744
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,930
you’re pretty

745
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,970
and lovely.

746
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,410
Once you speak,

747
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:05,410
others will be in awe of you.

748
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,260
You sure can be trusted.

749
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,450
They say

750
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,500
the Demons are a never-ending nightmare.

751
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,340
But I believe however long it lasts,

752
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,860
the ray of light will tear it apart.

753
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,370
Of course.

754
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:33,703
