Fei.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,310
Sounds bustling out there.

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,040
Shall we go have a look?

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
Not interested.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Fine.

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,190
A trip always ends.

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,440
When you’re nearly home,

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,910
I’ve kind of finished my mission.

What does your hometown look like?

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,670
My hometown?

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
It’s cold.

30
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,880
Unlike this place

31
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,190
where trees are green
throughout the year.

32
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,750
Every winter in Jiankang,

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,640
red leaves outside the palace fall.

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,160
Even a thin layer of ice forms
over Qinhuai River.

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,000
The barren ferry falls silent at once.

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,390
Only the palace isn’t cold

37
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,800
where there’s always charcoal fire.

38
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,520
And...

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,160
Well, I don’t remember much.

40
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,670
Anyway, I’m not cold or hungry there.

41
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,270
Nothing else is fun.

42
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,960
There are many rules.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,800
When I grew up,

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,190
I loved to travel to south.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
To save money, small inns don’t

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,160
make a fire for you.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,880
So,

48
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,630
I prefer to bask
in the sun in the south.

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,360
Do you remember...?

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,910
What happened when I was little?

51
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,910
I don’t.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,160
I was too little

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,670
to remember many things.

54
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,830
So, I’m not as miserable as you imagine.

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,550
Don’t always keep everything
to your heart,

56
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,800
making you mysterious.

57
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,550
Girl.

58
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,030
Do you know

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,960
what being curious about someone

60
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,190
means?

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,630
What?

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,190
It means

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,800
you like him.

64
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,110
You want to know what he does every day

65
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,600
and what he is going to do.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,670
You even wonder

67
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,910
what he thinks of every day.

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,110
The lovesickness begins

69
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,320
from being curious about someone.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,350
What’s wrong with you?

71
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,790
I’m talking seriously!

72
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,390
What do you mean lovesickness?

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,390
I’m just

74
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,350
near my home already.

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,920
I think you’re wandering alone

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
and have nowhere to settle down.

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,790
Then I worry about you.

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,550
Don’t bother.

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
I lead a wandering life.

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,950
And I’m used to that.

81
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,440
If you ask me to stay somewhere
and don’t move,

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,230
I’ll feel bored and suffocated.

83
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,950
You will not stop?

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Not really.

85
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,040
If I go to your home

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,830
and your mother asks me

87
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,350
to be her son-in-law,

88
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,920
I can’t run away.

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,270
In your dream!

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,320
Fei! Fei!

91
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,550
Why are you up there?

92
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,670
You know what? Bad news!

93
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,200
Yan is gone!

94
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,350
What?

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,670
Yan is gone!

96
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,670
I knew she wouldn’t be obedient!

97
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,600
When I went upstairs,

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,040
I visited her room,

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,790
only to find it empty

100
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,110
with the windows open.

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,320
Could she

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,790
run out again?

103
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,440
Her room is high.

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,110
Did she dare to jump?

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,880
You’re right. She didn’t dare.

106
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,480
Fei, what do we do?

107
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,830
Jili, don’t worry.

108
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,760
I’ll go get her back.

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,830
I’m going, too.

110
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,830
No! You can’t.

111
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,920
You’ve just recovered.

112
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,550
You had fights
and travelled all the way.

113
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,320
You need more rest.

114
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,510
None of your business!

115
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,270
Don’t follow me.

116
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,480
Give me back the Five-bat Token.

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,830
Why?

118
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,640
I’ll get in
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight anyway.

119
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,200
One day,

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
I’ll get it back from Zhou Fei!

121
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,070
You’re really going
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

122
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,320
A man always keeps his promise.

123
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,480
Fine, for the sake
you helped me sneak out,

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,000
let me tell you.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,670
You can’t get in
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

126
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,600
How about this?

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,480
I’ll ask Fei to give it back to you.

128
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
What do you think?

129
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,230
If so,

130
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,390
I’ll give the token to you.

131
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,270
But I’m still going to
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

132
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,320
Are you really an idiot?

133
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,040
Look at you.

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,950
What else do you know,
except martial arts?

135
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,270
Stop.

136
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,390
Why are you still following me?

137
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,350
When I helped you,

138
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,230
you didn’t say that.

139
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,040
Why are you still following me?

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,720
If I don’t follow you,

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,230
I won’t know how to get there.

142
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,720
How annoying!

143
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,550
Are you looking for me?

144
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,880
Seems like we’re on the same wavelength.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,760
Who is on the same wavelength with you?

146
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,950
The moon is clear tonight.

147
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,110
Go. Let me take you to a place.

148
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,900
<i>Affluence and Prosperity</i>

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,480
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is right ahead.

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,760
We’re at Chunhui Town.

151
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,270
Let’s settle down for a moment.

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,790
You had a hard trip.

153
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,950
Don’t say that.

154
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,480
I was your burden.

155
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,000
The inn is just over there.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,390
Stop following me.

157
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,270
Who is following you?

158
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,510
I’m just walking this way, too.

159
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,550
Sheng! Sheng!

160
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,550
Be careful. He’s wounded.

161
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,070
It hurts.

162
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,640
You must be Miss Wu.

163
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Sheng.

164
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,040
Seems like she cares for you.

165
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,160
Could she...?

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,550
Talk politely and don’t be rude.

168
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,830
Call me Yan.

169
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,110
I’m his sister.

170
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,040
Yan.

171
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,270
Who is this man?

172
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
I’m Yang Jin with Cloud Ravine.

173
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,510
You must be Li Sheng,
grandson of the South Blade.

174
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,200
What Ravine?

175
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,790
Cloud Ravine in the south.

176
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,520
Known as Small Medicine Valley!

177
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,550
Mr. Yang.

178
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,110
Sorry I didn’t recognize you.

179
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,470
Why are you with my sister?

180
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,710
Shall we fight?

181
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,150
He keeps asking Fei for a fight!

182
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,280
But he was defeated.

183
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,590
Right, loser?

184
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,910
I’m just passing by.

185
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,760
I’ve got something else to do. See you.

186
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,470
Oh, Sheng,

187
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,910
how were you hurt?

188
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,000
Now you care for me?

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But you...

190
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,710
Why are you coming down alone?

191
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,880
I’m not alone.

192
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,590
Fei and Mr. Xie are here.

193
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,910
Fei is also here?

194
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,150
Who is Mr. Xie, then?

195
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,320
He’s the man

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,790
who asked Uncle to leave the mountain.

197
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,200
It’s hard to explain.

198
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,550
Let’s get back to the inn first.

199
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,670
Let’s go.

200
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,150
Mr. Ma!

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
Look who’s back.

202
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,670
Sheng?

203
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,400
Good boy.

204
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,910
You didn’t let me down.

205
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,710
You must be Miss Wu.

206
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Great. When you come back safely,

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,840
I can finally stop worrying

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,400
about you.

209
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,080
Thank you for your concern.

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
Speaking of this,

211
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,550
thanks to Fei.

212
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,150
Miss Chuchu said

213
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,200
her trip started dangerously.

214
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,550
Without Fei’s help,

215
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,550
we wouldn’t have come back safely.

216
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,550
Oh,

217
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,550
where’s Fei?

218
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,350
Yan.

219
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,910
Where are Fei and Mr. Xie?

220
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,030
And Mr. Yang.

221
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,590
Fei and Mr. Xie are taking a walk.

222
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,440
As for Bonehead,

223
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,470
I pissed him off and he ran away.

224
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,350
Look at you.

225
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,150
You always make troubles.

226
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,710
Get upstairs and go to bed!

227
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,590
Don’t run about again.

228
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,280
Mr. Ma, don’t be angry.

229
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,760
My brother is wounded.

230
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
I’ll heal him.

231
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,710
It hurts!

232
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
Just go to bed.

233
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
-How rude you are!
-Sheng.

234
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,230
How were you wounded?

235
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,030
Mr. Ma.

236
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,880
Secret Service betrayed us.

237
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,910
We came all the way back,
being hunted down.

238
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,760
So, we shouldn’t stay for long.

239
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,230
We must get back soon.

240
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,350
Okay.

241
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,790
Seems like it’ll be two hours

242
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,760
before the Spinning Wire Formation stops.

243
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,280
Mr. Yutai.

244
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,080
I’ve been waiting for this day
for too long.

245
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Sir.

246
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,080
There comes some noise of fight
near the pavilion.

247
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,960
Please send men to check.

248
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,840
Let’s go!

249
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Look.

250
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,440
That’s my home.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,320
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

252
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,760
It looks the brightest

253
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,280
only when the moon shines
over Ximo River.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,550
I went there before.

255
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,080
Oh, yes. You did.

256
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,670
Yeah.

257
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,760
But I was too busy netting the weeds

258
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,470
to enjoy the moon.

259
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
Now I realize

260
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,880
the moon really looks great.

261
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,030
What’s the difference

262
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,520
between this moon
and that in your hometown?

263
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,350
I’m asking you. Why do you stare at me?

264
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,470
The moon looks the same

265
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,790
no matter where we look at it.

266
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,470
But people who enjoy it are different.

267
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,760
Fei.

268
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,350
People come and go

269
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,880
in your place.

270
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,640
Patrols are everywhere.

271
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,280
Can birds still be highly strung?

272
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,710
Is there

273
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,230
something happening?

274
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,710
Let’s get back to the inn.

275
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,400
Okay.

276
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,550
-Chief.
-Chief.

277
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,110
He is dead.

278
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,760
The mission to restore our sect

279
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,080
counts on us!

280
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,150
We used to be famous spies.

281
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,400
Now, we’re restrained
in the Forbidden Forest.

282
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,760
We’re not free

283
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,670
and even subordinate to
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight!

284
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,860
From today on,

285
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,910
we will restore our sect

286
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,000
and no longer disgrace ourselves!

287
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,150
-We all take your order, Chief!
-We all take your order, Chief!

288
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,840
-We all take your order, Chief!
-We all take your order, Chief!

289
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,110
Lord, according to Mingfeng spies,

290
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,030
it’ll be two hours
before the Spinning Wire Formation stops.

291
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,080
Give my order.

292
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,840
Ask everybody to get ready.

293
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,280
We’ll cross the river and attack
in two hours.

294
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,230
Aye.

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,550
Fine. We’ll get up the mountain
tomorrow morning.

296
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,400
Mr. Ma!

297
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,760
Fei!

298
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,200
Are you getting better?

299
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,910
Yes.

300
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,350
You’re finally back?

301
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,470
Fei, where did you go?

302
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,790
What took you so long?

303
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,550
Mr. Ma.

304
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,230
Something happened
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

305
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,110
What happened?

306
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,230
Mr. Xie and I saw startling birds

307
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,790
from that direction.

308
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,840
There’s more bad news.

309
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,880
Our Secret Service across the state...

310
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,520
Some have betrayed us.

311
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,910
Miss Chuchu and I came all the way back,

312
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,640
being hunted down.

313
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,760
In Huarong,

314
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,430
the Secret Service betrayed us, too.

315
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,760
They were bribed by Demons Manor

316
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,160
so that our disciples died

317
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,520
including Chenfei.

318
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,920
Demons Manor?

319
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,110
Tong Tianyang with Demons Manor
killed Ms. Wang.

320
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,470
If someone hadn’t helped us,

321
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,400
I would have died, too.

322
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,880
Demons Manor?

323
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,810
Secret Service?

324
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,070
Something...

325
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,800
Something dangerous has really happened.

326
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
Sheng, I want to go home.

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,070
Mr. Ma.

328
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,640
We’ll certainly go home!

329
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,640
Fei.

330
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,430
I’ll go with you.

331
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,640
Mr. Ma, time is running out.

332
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,950
Let’s get up to the mountain.

333
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,160
Fine.

334
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,800
But I don’t think

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,400
Miss Chuchu and Yan should go.

336
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,680
They don’t have martial arts.

337
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,230
If something happens,

338
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,310
they’ll be in danger.

339
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

340
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,160
No.

341
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,280
There’s trouble up the mountain.

342
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,520
They may not be safe down it.

343
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,830
We must go together.

344
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,160
Fine.

345
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,710
Let’s get packed.

346
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,830
We’ll go up to the mountain asap.

347
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,190
Chief.

348
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,830
Giant Leopard is ready.

349
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,350
Guards at the gate
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

350
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,640
have been wiped out.

351
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,190
It is time

352
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,880
for winner-take-all!

353
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,830
Ask people down the mountain to act.

354
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,070
Something is wrong!

355
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,280
Strike the gong in the outpost
to warn others!

356
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,190
Report!

357
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Mr. Zhang.

358
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,230
There’s sound of gong
from down the mountain.

359
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,710
I’ve heard it.

360
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,590
Well,

361
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,110
go give my order.

362
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,040
Send men to support at the gate.

363
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,470
Aye.

364
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,640
The rest of you, come with me!

365
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,070
-Aye!
-Aye!

366
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,640
Lord Gantang.

367
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,710
According to spies,

368
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,760
Yu Wenzhi left with private soldiers
three days ago.

369
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,470
Do you know where he has gone?

370
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,560
Not sure yet.

371
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
I’m afraid

372
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,920
he’s up to something else.

373
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,280
I must head for the battalion
in the north of the city

374
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,680
for something important.

375
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,110
Okay.

376
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,350
-Let’s go.
-Aye.

377
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,430
Fei, something is wrong!

378
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,230
We can’t get in through the outer gate.

379
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,430
I know a pathway.

380
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,430
Let’s go this way.

381
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,350
The Formation has stopped.

382
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,160
All of you, go!

383
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,110
-Aye.
-Aye.

384
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,880
Master.

385
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,190
This pathway leads
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

386
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,830
If you worry,

387
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,150
go up there and have a look.

388
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,430
No.

389
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
We’ll head for the north

390
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,790
as planned.

391
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,880
Hyah!

392
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,640
Hyah! Hyah!

393
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,800
Judged from their wounds,

394
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,950
people with Mingfeng killed them.

395
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,430
No wonder their Secret Service

396
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,430
all betrayed us.

397
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Fei.

398
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,430
You’re strong enough
to protect yourself.

399
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,280
Well, run away

400
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,800
with Miss Chuchu and Yan.

401
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Stop treating me like a kid!

402
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
I’ll go with you!

403
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,020
Mr. Ma.

404
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,680
I want to help, too.

405
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,470
No way!

406
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,590
It’s too dangerous.

407
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,070
If you’re in danger,

408
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,680
how can I explain to your mother?

409
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,230
Mr. Ma.

410
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,350
This is her home.

411
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,780
She can’t leave it alone.

412
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,110
I’m not running away this time.

413
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,160
I’ll fight with you.

414
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,350
Mr. Ma.

415
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,880
No matter what the rebels want,

416
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
Aunt isn’t home now.

417
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,800
It counts on me...

418
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,950
On us.

419
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,830
Individuals don’t survive
when losing their homes.

420
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,110
When it’s dangerous here,

421
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,800
so will be other places.

422
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,070
Mr. Ma!

423
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,020
Fine, fine.

424
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,190
But remember,

425
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,950
if you’re in real danger,

426
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,190
you must escape immediately.

427
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,110
Understand?

428
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,950
Mr. Ma, when the third elder rebelled,

429
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,470
how did my mother defend the Fortress

430
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,120
all by herself?

431
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,230
At that time,

432
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,230
your mother was already

433
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,230
the leader.

434
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,190
But without the help of other elders,

435
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,190
she wouldn’t have united everyone

436
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,360
and fought the enemies.

437
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,880
Other elders?

438
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
Precisely.

439
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,640
But now,

440
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
your mother isn’t here.

441
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,280
We don’t have a leader.

442
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,590
I can even imagine that.

443
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,880
Those stubborn elders

444
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,070
don’t convince each other.

445
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,350
Let’s go to the Hall of Elders

446
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,920
and ask them to unite.

447
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,070
Okay.

448
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,450
Fei.

449
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,680
I’m not going with you.

450
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,560
We’re not sure about other places.

451
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,640
I’ll go check it.

452
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,880
Let’s take separate action.

453
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,760
Okay.

454
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,110
Fine. That’s it.

455
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,040
Follow me.

456
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,110
Yan.

457
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,520
I’ll leave Chuchu to you.

458
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,690
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of her.

459
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,760
Li Sheng.

460
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,430
Be very careful.

461
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,350
See you.

462
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,760
Fei, you need tricks

463
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,000
to unite those elders.

464
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,830
Use your brain instead of strength.

465
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,430
The Spinning Wire Formation stops,

466
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,100
but it doesn’t mean Fisherman did it.

467
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
You two.

468
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,710
Calm down. Calm down.

469
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,350
<i>Zhao Qiusheng, An Elder of the Fortress</i>
Only Fisherman can stop the Formation.

470
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,190
Stop making a veiled abuse.

471
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,470
You sound like

472
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,110
you’re complaining about Deng Zhen.

473
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,640
<i>Deng Zhen, An Elder of the Fortress</i>
I can make out what you mean.

474
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,070
Deng Zhen is the elder of defense.

475
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,920
<i>Zhang Bolin, An Elder of the Fortress</i>
He has the responsibility

476
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
<i>Zhang Bolin, An Elder of the Fortress</i>
to explain to us

477
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,400
about what is happening.

478
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,680
Why are you still quarrelling?

479
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,160
The longer you quarrel,

480
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,760
the more men die.

481
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,470
Ma, what’s going on?

482
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,880
Why are you back?

483
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
With strangers?

484
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,230
Mr. Ma, do me a favor.

485
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,640
When we get in the Hall of Elders,

486
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,800
let Fei talk to the elders first.

487
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,710
If you say something for her first,

488
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,830
they’ll certainly think

489
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,160
she’s a follower.

490
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,070
There’s a reason.

491
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,160
It’s a long story.

492
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,230
Our priority is

493
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,160
to solve the rebellion of Mingfeng.

494
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,920
Now,

495
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,400
the outer gate may be broken through.

496
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,540
Even the outer gate...?

497
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,130
How do you know
it’s the rebellion of Mingfeng?

498
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,590
When we got up the mountain,

499
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,920
we saw many disciples killed

500
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,710
by Mingfeng people.

501
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Sounds like

502
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,190
we’re under attack

503
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,700
from all directions.

504
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,850
Deng.

505
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,230
The Spinning Wire Formation
has been stopped.

506
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,040
Enemies will come over Ximo River.

507
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,680
Li Sheng has gone to check other places.

508
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,980
Could you give me some disciples
for support?

509
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,760
Young girl.

510
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,620
How dare you give orders now!

511
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,590
Yun Xiao!

512
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,350
Here.

513
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,680
Order standby posts
to be used immediately.

514
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,830
Send more men for defense.

515
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,680
Ask the remaining disciples

516
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,310
to come here

517
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,230
and get ready to check Ximo River.

518
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,040
If there’s any problem,

519
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,190
shoot to warn us.

520
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,850
Aye.

521
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,250
Whether it’s too late depends

522
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,560
on how strong our enemies are.

523
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,160
Talk firmly to them.

524
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,920
You can’t convince anyone

525
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,880
before you fully trust yourself.

526
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,350
When you take charge,

527
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,110
don’t force them.

528
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,280
Don’t go too far.

529
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,230
Remember, you’re a junior.

530
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,430
You come to solve problem,

531
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,160
instead of making trouble.

532
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
Elders.

533
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,830
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhao.

534
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,520
I was so anxious

535
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,710
that I behaved a bit rudely.

536
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,480
Please forgive me.

537
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,020
Forget it.

538
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,160
I’ll see

539
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,520
what kind of enemies

540
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,110
those traitors can get!

541
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,640
What if

542
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,760
those elders do their own duties

543
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,880
and unite with each other?

544
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,070
Your mother keeps the elders

545
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,920
so that they restrain each other.

546
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,400
So, what we should do

547
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
is to take them down one by one.

548
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,830
My mother told me

549
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,520
you two were the most reliable elders

550
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
in our place.

551
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,350
We depend on you

552
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,350
to defend our fortress.

553
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,950
Your mother is right.

554
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,400
Leave it to us. Don’t worry.

555
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,230
Everyone, how about this?

556
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,590
Li Sheng and I will take care

557
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,680
of the gate and posts.

558
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,000
As for the enemies over Ximo River,

559
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,400
I’ll leave it to you all.

560
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,800
I didn’t teach you

561
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,110
to flatter them.

562
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,350
Good.

563
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,000
It’s wise of you.

564
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,430
Ms. Kou.

565
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,590
Lord.

566
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,430
This is the map
of the Spinning Wire Formation.

567
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,280
Keep it.

568
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,860
Very good.

569
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,200
Let’s stick to the plan.

570
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,000
Our men are ready to attack

571
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,680
from the root of the mountain.

572
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,430
Let’s make a sudden attack

573
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,640
through the Forbidden Forest.

574

<i>Hall of Elders</i>

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,010
My home.

577
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,470
Fight and I’ll live.

578
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,760
Retreat and I’ll die.

579
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,760
I would die, at most.

580
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,000
In a brave way.

581
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,680
Everybody.

582
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,120
We all live here.

583
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,090
We’re brothers

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,500
and families.

585
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,210

Now, the Fortress is at stake.

586
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,640
Whatever,

587
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,280
I want you to get rid of prejudice

588
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,710
and defend our home together.

589
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,110
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

590
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,680
She looks like a leader.

Stay here with Chuchu.

597
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,760
Fei, I also want to go.

598
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,520
I know you’re great.

599
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,640
So,

600
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,250
I have an important task for you.

601
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,650
Protect Chuchu.

Stop!

608
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,640
Go!

609
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,760
We’re right.

610
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,400
Posts of the Forbidden Forest
have been broken through, too.

611
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,560
Senior.

612
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,430
Sheng, are you alright?

613
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,560
I’m fine.

614
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,710
Men in black keep coming in.

615
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,760
They look like

616
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,470
they’re with Demons Manor.

617
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,640
Spinning Wires keep changing.

618
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,430
And they’re covert.

619
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,830
How can they avoid them

620
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,480
so easily?

621
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,280
Seems like

622
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,800
people in Mingfeng collude with them

623
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,150
so that they know
where the Spinning Wires are.

624
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,740
They come this way,

625
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,920
possibly because they want
to reach the center place

626
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,840
in small groups.

627
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,850
Once they get there and cooperate

628
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,740
with enemies coming over Ximo River,

629
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,920
they’ll besiege us.

630
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,130
Senior.

631
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,640
I’ve got an idea.

632
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,260
<i>Fortress of the Forty-Eight</i>

633
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,360
Who are you?

634
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,720
Demons Manor.

635
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,710
You know him?

636
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,270
No.

637
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,120
Cold breeze.

638
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,040
He’s very likely to be Gu Tianxian,

639
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,540
Giant Leopard with Demons Manor.

640
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
They don’t have many men.

641
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,840
They don’t stand a chance to defeat you.

642
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,870
Gu Tianxian especially comes

643
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,080
when my mother is away.

644
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,190
They won’t fight an uncertain battle.

645
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,840
Could they

646
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
have a backup plan?

647
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,190
Whatever!

648
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,320
I’ll rush up,

649
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
kill him and roast him

650
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,870
for celebration party.

651
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,560
I’m Gu Tianxian.

652
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,870
I come without invitation.

653
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,390
Hope you will

654
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,360
forgive me.

655
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,130
Giant Leopard with Demons Manor?

656
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,710
You come uninvited.

657
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,840
We’ll kill you to eliminate the evil.

658
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,770
What do you think,

659
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,550
Ms. Kou?

660
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Kou Dan.

661
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,190
You ungrateful shrew!

662
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,080
You have no idea.

663
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,800
We have a rule.

664
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,770
When a new chief wants power,

665
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,680
he must kill the former one.

666
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,870
You and my master retired. Fine.

667
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,360
In case no one else gets the map

668
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,430
of the Spinning Wire Formation,

669
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,150
you even caught me back!

670
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,670
Leave if you want.

671
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,230
I won’t stop you.

672
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,500
You!

673
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,230
I don’t think I can get information

674
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,360
about the Bracelet from you.

675
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,670
Mr. Yutai died a natural death.

676
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,470
Compared to former chiefs,

677
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,390
I’m merciful enough.

678
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,280
Kou Dan!

679
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,000
We kept you

680
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,630
and protected you.

681
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,430
But you betray us!

682
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,800
Our sect was taken in by Li Zheng.

683
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,630
To show our sincerity,

684
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,710
we used the Spinning Wire Formation
over Ximo River.

685
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,430
It’s such an important formation

686
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,710
that all core disciples involved

687
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,870
have never left this place.

688
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,630
From then on,

689
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,250
we dwelled in the Forbidden Forest

690
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,150
as your gatekeepers.

691
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,530
What’s big deal of being decent?

692
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,370
Mr. Zhang.

693
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,490
Why don’t you ask Madam Li

694
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,120
if she’s fair

695
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,430
to you?

696
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,760
I heard the former chief

697
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,840
caught his youngest disciple

698
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,910
who wanted to escape

699
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,910
just for the Spinning Wire Formation.

700
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,520
After years,

701
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,950
she’s finally cultivated

702
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,910
into a qualified spy.

703
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,230
Seems like

704
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,600
you’re too qualified.

705
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,150
Young man.

706
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,190
You know too much.

707
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,390
Tell me.

708
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,840
Where is Fisherman?

709
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,040
Fei.

710
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,150
Calm down.

711
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
I’ll fight her.

712
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,630
She has fighting experience of decades.

713
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,870
You’re not as strong.

714
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,080
But I know the way she fights.

715
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,160
Cut the crap.

716
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,870
We’re separating from you.

717
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,040
I don’t think Madam Li will give me

718
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,950
what I want.

719
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,150
I guess I need more hostages

720
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,840
to make a deal with her.

721
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,560
Zhou Fei.

722
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
You’re back just in time.

723
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,270
Wait.

724
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,560
When I’m here,

725
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,080
you don’t need to fight.

726
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,320
Wait and see

727
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,120
how I’ll teach her a lesson.

728
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,080
You shrew!

729
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,910
How arrogant you sound!

730
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,150
Ms. Kou.

731
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,470
I’ll fight you.

732
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,000
Zhou Fei.

733
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,710
I haven’t tried
your Snow-breaking Blade yet.

734
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,520
You can try now.

735
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,470
Interesting.

736
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,600
Watch out!

737
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,470
That’s Rain Needle.

738
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,520
You’re fast.

739
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,040
That’s Rain Needle.

740
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,540
Luckily, it’s thick enough.

741
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,600
Be careful with the hook!

742
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:34,654

This is Snow-breaking Blade?

744
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,280
Precisely.

745
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,190
Miss Fei has great marital arts!

746
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,870
Report!

747
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
Mr. Zhao.

748
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,150
A large number of people are attacking
from the root of the mountain.

749
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,040
From all directions.

750
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,360
I’ve fought masters

751
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,600
with Qianzhong Sect and South Blade.

752
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,670
Today,

753
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,080
my trip isn’t for nothing.

754
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,760
You’re heroes.

755
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,000
But to be honest,

756
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,760
when we were fighting,

757
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,190
elite men of Timber Wolf
came all the way up.

758
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,080
When he comes,

759
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,080
he kills people.

760
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,430
But I don’t want

761
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,290
to be sacrificed.

762
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,040
Why don’t we sit down

763
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,670
and figure everything out?

764
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,710
Isn’t it a good thing

765
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,000
to make peace?

766
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,390
Go!

767
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,040
You’ve got a good idea.

768
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,390
Or we wouldn’t have fought

769
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,800
so many enemies.

770
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,470
Our gate and outer gate

771
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,870
have been taken by Mingfeng Sect.

772
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,480
Our next step is

773
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,410
to get our gate back.

774
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,040
Oh, Sheng,

775
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,430
when we were in the Hall of Elders,

776
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,150
I didn’t have the chance to ask Fei.

777
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,420
