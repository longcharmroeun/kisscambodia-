Other than those
of the Big Medicine Valley,

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,510
manuals of other sects

19
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,140
abound,

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,310
such as that of the Mountain Sword,

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,680
-The Mountain Sword?
-and

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,090
the South Blade
my grandfather practiced.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,680
Sounds like

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,950
a collection

25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,310
of all sects, right?

26
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,160
Manuals.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,510
Your grandfather’s blade.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,510
A collection of all sects.

29
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,760
Where are they?

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,120
The Demon-Extermination Assembly

31
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,950
held by Huo Liantao.

32
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,390
Let’s go.

33
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,600
Sure.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,160
Go ahead.

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,240
Alright. I’ll go pack up.

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,830
He can be a hired muscle.

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,270
Only Yang Jin

38
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,670
would buy such nonsense.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,320
Food is ready.

40
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,270
Looking good.

41
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,340
Why is everything cold?

42
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
I’ve checked.

43
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,340
You’d better eat cold food,

44
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,570
because anything hot

45
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,090
may lead to a quicker death
by poisoning.

46
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,560
Which quack told you that?

47
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,230
Poisoner Ying Hecong.

48
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,710
Why?

49
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,010
Was he wrong?

50
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,090
What else did he say?

51
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,130
Reborn Pill of
the Big Medicine Valley...

52
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,530
That’s useless to me.

53
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,820
You knew that already?

54
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,540
Hey,

55
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,100
do you think
I’m after that Bracelet

56
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,690
for the Reborn Pill?

57
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,900
I’m only doing it

58
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,760
as per my ancestor’s will.

59
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,010
Think about it.

60
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,690
That valley was gone a long time ago.

61
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,060
Pills Mr. Yutai took

62
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,660
were the ones

63
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,500
found outside.

64
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,220
You weren’t even born

65
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,780
at that time.

66
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,660
Since then,

67
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,060
so many years have passed.

68
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,780
Those pills would’ve gone bad.

69
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,250
And they weren’t the elixir of life,

70
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,500
right?

71
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,420
You have a point.

72
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,900
Bring me something hot next time.

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,060
These are as bad

74
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,540
as the buns I had

75
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,170
in the dungeon.

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,170
Would you rather die sooner?

77
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,840
No.

78
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,220
But I would

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,820
if you feed me these every day.

80
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,290
I’ll eat them with you.

81
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,620
Fei, you don’t need to do this.

82
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,850
I don’t regret

83
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,410
what happened to me.

84
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,000
It has nothing to do with you.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,620
Aren’t you curious

86
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,540
why I own so much energy?

87
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,010
I’ve never seen anyone

88
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,970
with more energy than you.

89
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,730
So far,

90
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,380
I only know two people

91
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,620
that might be your match.

92
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,130
Yellow and Green Palm, Duan Jiuniang

93
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,940
and the head of Demons Manor,
Shen Tianshu.

94
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,660
You must think I’m too young

95
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,340
to have reached this level,

96
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,340
right?

97
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,730
I’m sure you’ve figured it out.

98
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,660
Technically speaking,

99
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,540
that’s not my energy.

100
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
My uncle forcibly expanded

101
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,060
my meridian channels

102
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,130
and transfused

103
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,960
all his energy to me.

104
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,380
You must’ve learned

105
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,850
at home

106
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,410
once the energy

107
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,970
was drained,

108
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,210
one would only end up dead.

109
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,940
Basically, that’s a life for a life.

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,100
Correct. I’m a murderer

111
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,030
because someone died to save me.

112
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,400
As long as I’m alive,

113
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,410
General Wang Lin’s Anping Army

114
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,010
won’t stop the fight

115
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,450
because they believe

116
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,410
the Xiaos’ offspring

117
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,340
is the hope

118
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,170
to restore the reign.

119
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,250
So

120
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,970
I’m also a threat to the state.

121
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,780
As a murderer and a threat,

122
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,730
I’m living on borrowed time,

123
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,410
don’t you agree?

124
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,660
Who the ruler is

125
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,170
doesn’t matter to the masses

126
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,620
as long as they can live well.

127
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,010
Back in the dungeon,

128
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,060
if you hadn’t come,

129
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,170
I would’ve gotten myself out.

130
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,380
Thanks to you,

131
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,130
I’ve lived one more year.

132
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,340
Consider what I did for the Fortress

133
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,690
a thank-you gift.

134
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,060
Don’t feel guilty.

135
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,540
So you’ve said all that

136
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,660
to relieve my guilt?

137
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,410
Would I turn a blind eye to you

138
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,290
if you weren’t poisoned because of me?

139
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,130
Your business is also mine!

140
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,820
What are you looking at?

141
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,130
Stop talking,

142
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,850
and start eating now or never.

143
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,980
I believe there’s always a way out.

144
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,740
Without the Reborn Pill,

145
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,690
there must be something else.

146
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,900
If I were you,

147
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,340
whether it’s the Big Medicine Valley

148
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,250
or that Bracelet,

149
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,860
I won’t give up any hope.

150
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,740
Even if I fail eventually,

151
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,980
I’ll die with no regrets

152
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,540
and rest in peace.

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Don’t ever

154
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,740
say that again,

155
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,570
or I’ll whack you!

I haven’t had a good night’s sleep

175
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,860
since I arrived in Lingling.

176
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,420
And I was too busy
hiding from the Route Gang

177
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,370
to bathe over the past few days.

178
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,220
Smell it.

179
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,100
I’m sweaty and stinky.

180
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,220
You smell fine.

181
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,490
I’m a renowned figure

182
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,130
after all.

183
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,220
Please do me a favor

184
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,100
and bring me some bathwater.

185
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,980
Alright.

186
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,610
Well...

187
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,300
The lock...

188
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,780
You can bathe with it.

189
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,050
Don’t worry.

190
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,490
It won’t rust.

191
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,540
The quality of Madam Nichang’s product

192
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,740
is guaranteed.

193
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,250
She runs an honest business.

194
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,570
You know that, don’t you?

195
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,180
My hand...

196
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,010
One hand is inconvenient.

197
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,450
Inconvenient how?

198
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,490
It’s...

199
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,250
It’s hard to do things with one hand.

200
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,010
You can use extra hands.

201
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,250
Won’t that be too much trouble?

202
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,180
Not at all.

203
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,490
I don’t want to be a bother.

204
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,900
I’ll ask Li Sheng to help you.

205
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,250
Fei! Fei!

206
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,930
Fei, I can’t bathe in front of him!

207
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,490
No peeking,

208
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,220
or I’ll tell Chuchu

209
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,200
you’re a pervert.

210
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,180
Why would I peek?

211
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,900
And what’s that

212
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,050
to do with Chuchu?

213
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,050
Why would you tell her?

214
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,740
So you two are like sisters.

215
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,130
Sisters?

216
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,370
When did I...?

217
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,180
Are you crazy?

218
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,250
Where are you going?

219
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,980
Unlock me.

220
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,050
It just came to me

221
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,420
that Fei had told me repeatedly

222
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,450
you’d try everything

223
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,300
to drive me away.

224
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
I won’t fall for your tricks.

225
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,980
Let’s go.

226
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,810
I won’t drive you away.

227
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,810
Make it quick.

228
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,130
What... what are you doing?

229
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,570
I can’t bathe like this.

230
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,780
Give me a hand.

231
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,450
What are you? A mandarin duck?

232
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,300
Stop dabbling!

233
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,690
Don’t you bathe like this?

234
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,050
I can only use one hand.

235
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,180
It’s inconvenient.

236
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,540
Give me yours,

237
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,900
or I can’t do this.

238
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,740
Feels good!

239
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,180
Hey, isn’t this awkward?

240
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,010
Don’t forget I’ll have to get dressed.

241
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,490
Hold... Hold on.

242
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,660
I’ll go to the back

243
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,740
and wait for you behind the screen.

244
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,300
How could I get dressed with one hand?

245
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,660
I’ll unlock you.

246
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,930
Really?

247
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,340
Yes, I will.

248
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,220
Alright. Thanks.

249
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,420
Mr. Xie,

250
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,540
Zhou Fei is more stubborn

251
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,100
than she seems.

252
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,660
She’s stubborn as a mule.

253
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,810
Everyone in our Fortress

254
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,610
knows that.

255
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,490
You can say that again!

256
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,930
It’s fine

257
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,300
if she’s just stubborn.

258
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,980
But ever since she met you,

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,450
she’s become evil.

260
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,660
What’s that supposed to mean?

261
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,010
Seeing that

262
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,930
she tied your hand

263
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,450
with your feet yesterday,

264
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,570
I’ve been wondering

265
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,010
if the disciple has outsmarted

266
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,540
the master

267
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,050
and if he’s digging his own grave.

268
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,250
Mr. Xie.

269
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,810
Are you mad?

270
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,690
What’s taking you so long?

271
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,660
Are you done?

272
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,330
Crap!

273
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,780
What are the odds?

274
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,010
Are you also out to see the moon?

275
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,340
When you were bathing,

276
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,660
I knew

277
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,060
I’d find you here.

278
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,420
Your cousin is right.

279
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,690
I am

280
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,290
digging my own grave.

281
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,960
Don’t move!

282
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,330
Fine. I won’t.

283
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Behave yourself.

284
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,250
Good night.

285
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,300
Good night.

286
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,330
Take care.

287
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,630
Get some rest.

288
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,660
Have a sweet dream.

289
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,640
See you tomorrow.

290
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,660
Good night.

291
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,490
What about me?

292
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,850
You?

293
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
I’m going to bed.

294
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,730
Don’t.

295
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,730
I’m not done serving you.

296
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,970
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

297
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,180
I’m sorry, Mr. Li. I was wrong.

298
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,250
-I’m sorry.
-How could you be wrong?

299
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,460
Stop, please. I’m sorry.

300
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,970
I really am.

301
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,240
Behave yourself.

302
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,890
Miss Zhou.

303
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,610
Miss Zhou?

304
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,970
Miss Zhou, are you in?

305
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,540
Miss Zhou?

306
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,490
Are you there?

307
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,180
Sir,

308
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,900
are you looking for Miss Zhou?

309
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,730
You’re awake.

310
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,060
You know me?

311
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,330
We all saw you when Miss Zhou

312
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,940
carried you back yesterday.

313
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,410
Oh, that.

314
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,330
That was a prank.

315
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,460
Sorry about it.

316
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
One of my friends is a foodie

317
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,130
from Jiankang.

318
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,730
Fei, do you mean Mr. Xie?

319
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,490
May I ask

320
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,180
if you’re surnamed Xie?

321
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,970
You know that, too?

322
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,250
Are you from Jiankang?

323
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,490
You aren’t

324
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,460
some fortuneteller, are you?

325
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,850
No. I’m Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect.

326
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,940
Miss Zhou once did me a favor.

327
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,250
I know you

328
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,130
because she told me a lot

329
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,900
about a friend of hers surnamed Xie.

330
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,970
Is that duck stuffed with sticky rice

331
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,090
Jiankang’s specialty?

332
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,700
Yes.

333
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,820
Jiankang is also my hometown.

334
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,700
Miss Zhou said

335
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,780
she’d like to try the specialties there,

336
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,710
so I made this for her.

337
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,970
Mr. Xie,

338
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,540
would you like some?

339
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,210
No, I’m good.

340
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,750
Thank you.

341
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,610
From now on,

342
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,580
serve all his food cold

343
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,460
and bring it to my room.

344
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,540
I’ll give it to him.

345
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,220
Yes.

346
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,280
What’s up?

347
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,970
Miss Zhou,

348
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,820
is Mr. Xie

349
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,610
in poor health?

350
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,240
He seems unwell.

351
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,420
I’ve seen rarities

352
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,900
when traveling with others.

353
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,180
I can keep

354
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,730
fine herbs for you

355
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,780
if you need.

356
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,660
Thank you,

357
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,370
but no need.

358
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,370
I...

359
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:05,850
This...

360
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,180
I can explain.

361
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,760
I didn’t run away.

362
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,540
I left to cook

363
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,940
duck stuffed with sticky rice for you.

364
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,800
Try it.

What do you think?

367
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,320
Is it good?

368
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,970
Which one is better?

369
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,970
Mine

370
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,660
or Mr. Zhu’s?

371
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,420
I don’t know.

372
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,820
I didn’t eat his.

373
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,900
Li Yan did.

374
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,100
You can ask her.

375
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,510
It’s tasty, right?

376
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,130
Just because you cooked this for me

377
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,490
doesn’t mean I’m going to unlock you.

378
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,370
I won’t run away again.

379
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,690
I swear.

380
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,480
What game are you playing now?

381
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,840
I should ask Madam Nichang

382
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,820
if there’s a way to shorten the chain

383
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,730
to stop you from escaping forever.

384
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,730
I couldn’t even stand her

385
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,090
eating someone else’s dish.

386
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,370
How could I leave her?

387
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,850
What do you want?

388
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,060
After you die,

389
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,370
may I keep your body?

390
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,250
Look,

391
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,700
the Bone-chilling poison

392
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,970
didn’t kill you

393
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,130
and you could give yourself
the Soul-searching Needle.

394
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,580
You’re one of a kind

395
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,090
and too valuable to be buried.

396
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,580
Don’t you agree?

397
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,610
Who the heck is he?

398
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,900
I promise

399
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,580
that I’ll

400
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,490
preserve your body well

401
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,940
for future studies.

402
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,740
Do we have a deal?

403
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,090
By the way,

404
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,970
did Hu Tianying

405
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,580
poison you?

406
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,540
I’ve been looking for her.

407
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,180
Can you let her know

408
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,300
you’re still alive

409
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,660
to lure her out?

410
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,210
Then I’ll be able to...

411
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,300
What’s wrong with them?

412
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,010
Don’t they have manners?

Today, Huo Liantao is holding

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,420
the Demon-Extermination Assembly
at this place.

417
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,090
Chuchu and I will go have a look

418
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,730
and ask around

419
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,010
about Old Master Huo

420
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,940
for Taoist Priest Chongxiao.

421
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,250
Do as you see fit.

422
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,970
Take care of Chuchu.

423
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,600
Take me with you.

424
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,250
If I continue lying in bed,

425
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,580
I won’t be able to walk again.

426
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,090
You can’t go.

427
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,440
Just stay put.

428
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,300
I agree.

429
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,940
Mr. Xie, you’re still weak.

430
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,780
Better stay here with Fei

431
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,740
and keep an eye on Li Yan.

432
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,700
Once Chuchu and I get back,

433
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,660
I’ll take her home.

434
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,370
Too late.

435
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,500
She’s long gone.

436
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,730
She’s gone?

437
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,540
My egg!

438
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,350
When did she leave? How did you know?

439
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,060
This morning, I was up early

440
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,010
and I saw your sister

441
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,180
dragged Mr. Yang out

442
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
to some Assembly.

443
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,300
Why didn’t you stop her?

444
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
I...

445
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,180
Sheng,

446
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,540
you know Yan well.

447
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,210
Who could make her stay?

448
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,490
What if she’s in danger?

449
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,420
She’s with that bonehead.

450
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,730
That guy will only make things worse.

451
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,460
I must get her back.

452
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,610
I’ll go with him.

453
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,540
Excuse me.

454
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,300
Coming.

455
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,660

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,090
Can we have more, please?

460
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,320
Sure. Coming right up.

461

Here you are.

462
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,660
Do you also want to go there?

463
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,730
It’s a pity to miss it.

464
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,700
Besides,

465
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,660
despite what you said,

466
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,700
I guess

467
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,060
you can’t help worrying about them,

468
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,130
can you?

469
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,940
Don’t pretend you know me so well.

470
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,850
I know you came all the way

471
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,420
for the Assembly.

472
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,010
You can attend it only under my watch.

473
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,590
But I’m warning you.

474
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,540
Do not try to escape

475
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,850
or engage in a fight again.

476
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,120
Sure. We have a deal.

477
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,650
And

478
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,780
can you

479
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,920
unlock me, please?

480
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,030
Alright.

481
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,010
No problem.

482
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,180
Thanks.

483
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,010
I swear I won’t run away.

484
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,970
Miss Zhou,

485
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,700
didn’t you say you’d unlock me?

486
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,490
I did say that,

487
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,660
but I can

488
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,210
lock you again in another way.

489
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
You win.

490
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,540
What happened to them?

491
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,330
Are they escaped prisoners?

492
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,210
A man and a woman.

493
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,330
Have a look.

494
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,210
-Take a look.
-Are you sure to walk around like this?

495
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,250
We might get arrested

496
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,540
before arriving at the Assembly.

497
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,850
I dare them!

00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,370
we get changed first?

That one?

507
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,610

It’s great. I love it.

dear...?

516
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,850
It’s made of the finest cotton.

517
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,250
The price is a bit...

518
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,130
That’s fine. We can afford it.

519
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,210
I understand.

520
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,540
Are you done?

521
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,190
We got a problem.

522
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,080
Fei, you...

523
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,640
Could you unlock me?

524
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,780
I can’t get changed like this

525
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,900
on my own.

526
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,850
I promise

527
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,420
I won’t escape.

528
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,700
Fei,

529
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,850
I swear to heaven.

530
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,900
Please. I mean it.

531
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,970
Unlock me now.

532
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,900
I’ll trust you this once.

533
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,610
What are you doing?

534
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,090
Do you want to be seen

535
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,850
with me like this?

536
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,250
No peeking.

537
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,130
Close your eyes.

538
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,820
Is it open?

539
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,250
It’s taking longer than I thought.

540
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,250
Didn’t Li Sheng open it at once?

541
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,420
How come?

542
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
I’ve studied

543
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,730
this Eight-trigram Lock.

544
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,490
One must know Eight Trigrams

545
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,330
and the tips

546
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,490
to open it easily.

547
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,450
Think again.

548
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,630
You’ve studied it?

549
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,120
Is this what they call

550
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,250
to hold hands

551
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,760
and grow old together?

552
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,080
Are you alright?

553
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,430
I’m fine.

554
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,740
<i>Luojin Ready-to-wear Clothes</i>

555
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,700
Hadn’t I heard them talking about

556
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,660
a locked couple in the street,

557
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,420
I wouldn’t have known you are out.

558
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,970
Mr. Xie,

559
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,330
you’ve got changed quickly.

560
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,700
But how,

561
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,480
I wonder?

562
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,850
Let’s go.

563
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,980
<i>Luojin Ready-to-wear Clothes</i>

564
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,330
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>

565
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,120
Stop.

566
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,850
Do you have an invitation?

567
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,970
Yes.

568
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,540
May I have a look?

569
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,610
Please.

570
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,370
The invited can go this way.

571
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,770
Stop.

572
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Do you have an invitation?

573
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,220
No.

574
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,180
Hold on.

575
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
No invitation.

576
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,550
Please.

577
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,330
The uninvited go this way, please.

578
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,420
Stop. Do you have an invitation?

579
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,290
Yes.

580
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,050
Please.

581
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,220
Bonehead,

582
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,020
what to do?

583
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,980
They all have invitations.

584
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,940
How about

585
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,460
we steal one?

586
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,740
No.

587
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,290
The one Mr. Zhu received

588
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,460
has his name on it.

589
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,330
Others’ must be the same.

590
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,700
We can’t use

591
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,260
any of them.

592
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,770
Since when did you become so smart?

593
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,050
I always am.

594
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,810
Follow me.

595
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,430
Lord asks for you.

596
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,610
Excuse me, do you have invitations?

597
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,650
Of course!

598
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,660
Where are they?

599
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,570
Bonehead,

600
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,900
do you have them?

601
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,770
You didn’t give them to me.

602
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,610
I did back in the inn.

603
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,810
Find them.

604
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,530
You didn’t.

605
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,330
Yes, I have them.

606
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,530
Give me a minute.

607
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,770
I’m sorry.

608
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,700
My friend here

609
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,180
is a bit slow.

610
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,500
Please bear with him.

611
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,570
It’s fine if you don’t have them.

612
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,320
This way, please.

613
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,460
I’m sorry

614
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,570
but seats at
the waterside pavilion are limited.

615
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,570
As per Lord’s order,

616
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,130
the uninvited go this way, please.

617
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,510
You’ll be seated over there.

618
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,460
Alright.

619
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,660
We aren’t picky.

620
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,920
Please.

621
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,200
Take it away.

622
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,020
I’ve had better food in the palace.

623
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,810
How dare you serve me such trash!

624
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,940
I’m sorry.

625
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,130
On my way to Lingling House

626
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,220
to pick up braised seedpod-shaped pork,

627
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,180
I overheard

628
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,130
the Third Prince,
Chen Zichen, is also in town.

629
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,980
And that concerns me how?

630
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,420
I’m not his mother.

631
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,020
His whereabouts aren’t my business.

632
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,050
Yes. I understand.

633
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,030
Wait.

634
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,980
What’s he doing here

635
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,560
at this moment?

636
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,040
He can’t be here

637
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,260
for the Assembly, can he?

638
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,940
Lord Chu,

639
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,980
Lord Huo and the Third Prince

640
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,810
go way back.

641
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,290
Very well.

642
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,260
Let’s go

643
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,660
pay His Highness a visit

644
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,530
and invite him over.

645
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,330
Lord Chu,

646
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,660
that won’t be necessary.

647
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
Lord Huo has promised

648
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,980
to give you the Seal of Cautiousness.

649
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,700
In case he changes his mind

650
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
and gives me a fake one instead,

651
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,500
I’m going to need His Highness

652
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,090
as leverage.

653
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,020
After all,

654
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,090
the last thing Huo Liantao wants

655
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,810
is to see a prince die at his place.

656
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,500
He’s made enough enemies.

657
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,370
If the court is also on to him,

658
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,180
I’m afraid

659
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,980
the Huo family will stop at him.

660
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,940
Your Highness,

661
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,980
I agree with Mr. Xie.

662
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,460
We’d better

663
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,400
stay away from the Assembly.

664
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,570
We’re already here.

665
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,500
So are talents across the state.

666
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,130
We can take this chance

667
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,020
to hire the best ones to work for us.

668
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,530
If we miss it,

669
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,530
who knows when such

670
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,220
a once-in-a-lifetime chance
will come again?

671
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,180
But...

672
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,570
Your Highness.

673
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,420
Your Highness, Lord Huo

674
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,850
has sent a carriage to pick you up.

675
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,130
How did he...?

676
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,420
He’s made the gesture.

677
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,460
If we refuse to go,

678
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,910
won’t that be disrespectful?

679
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,370
Let’s go.

680
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,770
Do you have invitations?

681
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,390
No.

682
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,610
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>
This way, please.

683
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,180
This way, please.

684
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,290
Do you have invitations?

685
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,810
I have.

686
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,460
They’re with me.

687
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,430
This way, please.

688
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,810
The invited go this way.

689
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,370
-This way, please.
-Do you have invitations?

690
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,570
What?

691
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,660
I can’t go in without one?

692
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,370
You can.

693
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,770
This way, please.

694
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,610
It’s been a while.

695
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,040
Indeed, Mr. Zhuang Bi.

696
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,180
So invitations aren’t necessary.

697
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,770
The uninvited go that way.

698
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,020
Are the guests divided into two groups?

699
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,540
Maybe they’re seated separately.

700
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,050
Are there two sessions?

701
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,790
One for each group?

702
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,660
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>
The waterside pavilion isn’t big enough.

703
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,570
As per Lord’s order,

704
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,700
the uninvited go this way, please.

705
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,090
Your seats are over there.

706
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,630
Fine.

707
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,290
I’ll

708
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,850
see you later.

709
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,700
Guests are separated by invitations?

710
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,900
Miss Zhou, Mr. Xie,

711
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,420
we can go together.

712
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,260
No, thanks.

713
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
My cousins should be over there.

714
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,940
We’ll join them.

715
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

716
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,660
Thank you.

717
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,810
Please.

718
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,020
Let’s go.

719
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,570
What is Huo Liantao up to?

720
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,260
Be quiet.

721
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,100
I’m memorizing the direction.

722
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,570
This forest

723
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,550
is a maze.

724
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,300
It’s hard to get out once we’re in.

725
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,370
Don’t you think something is odd?

726
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,370
Odd?

727
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,220
These trees look fine to me.

728
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,810
How are they odd?

729
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:49,940
I mean,

730
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,960
isn’t this place...

731
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,770
Over there.

732
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,100
Li Yan.

733
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,210
What are you doing?

734
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,530
There might be a snake.

735
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,740
Snake!

736
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,720
Where is it?

737
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,780
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

738
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,260
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

739
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,370
It’s gone.

740
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,290
Wait... wait for me!

741
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,620
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

742
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,260
Stop!

743
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,220
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

744
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,660
Stop!

745
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,740
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>

746
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,330
Don’t touch me,

747
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,090
or there will be dire consequences.

748
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,370
What is he doing here?

749
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,050
Who is it?

750
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,500
He seems to be
that Poisoner with Mr. Xie.

751
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,420
How dare you

752
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,700
release a snake!

753
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,180
I did that

754
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,360
to punish Ding Kui
for bullying a waitress.

755
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,130
It’s the master’s order

756
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,500
to separate the invited
and uninvited guests.

757
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,450
Go to him if you have a problem with it.

758
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,700
Why bully a girl?

759
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
You’re playing the hero.

760
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,810
Let’s see

761
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,980
how tough you are!

762
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,180
Who are you?

763
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,090
Yang Jin from the Cloud Ravine.

764
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,530
And me,

765
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,090
Li Yan from the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

766
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,810
Wait for it.

767
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,260
This isn’t over!

768
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,570
I’ll report to Tortoise Master

769
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,850
to teach you a lesson.

770
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,020
Let’s go.

771
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,810
I learned that move from your cousin.

772
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,770
Didn’t I do it faster

773
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,850
and better than her?

774
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,420
How are your hands?

775
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,500
Am I more skilled than her?

776
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,900
Thanks for your help.

777
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,700
Step back, please. Thanks.

778
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:06,900
Are you from the Small Medicine Valley?

779
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,730
Yes.

780
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,020
But he knows nothing about medicine.

781
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,770
Must you add that?

782
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,740
Hey, why didn’t you

783
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,460
attack them with your snakes?

784
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,940
My snakes?

785
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,980
They’re my babies

786
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,260
and worth much more

787
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,020
than their lives.

788
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,080
My snake!

789
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,330
Hongyu.

790
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,420
Hongyu.

791
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,260
Hongyu.

792
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,770
Hongyu.

793
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,770
Hongyu.

794
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,260
Hongyu.

795
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,740
-Hongyu?
-Hongyu.

796
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,570
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

797
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,660
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

798
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,130
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

799
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,420
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

800
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,500
Hongyu.

801
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,130
Hongyu. Hongyu.

802
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,020
We’ve already saved him.

803
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,850
Why help him find his snake?

804
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,020
Hey,

805
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,700
is a big man like you

806
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,530
afraid of snakes?

807
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,940
I’m not. I...

808
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,490
What is that?

809
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,420
I raised those snakes.

810
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,220
They can recognize
the sound of my flute.

811
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,740
But right after

812
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,130
entering in the woods,

813
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,810
they ran wild

814
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,920
as if something scared them.

815
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:36,423
