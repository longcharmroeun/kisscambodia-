<i>Episode 28</i>

18
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,590
Will your master also go to
Demon-Extermination Assembly?

19
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Yes.

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,000
They’re close friends.

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,000
If your master is in danger,

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,910
he definitely won’t just stand by.

23
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,120
Where is your master?

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,550
I’ll take you there now.

25
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,270
Mr. Xie said that
you’re one of us.

26
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,190
Jiachen.

27
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,440
Yes.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,680
Go inside to report first.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,630
Yes.

30
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,720
-This way, please.
-Okay.

31
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,950
Xie Meimei. Xie Meimei.

32
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,720
Why didn’t you go to
the southern border?

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,550
Why must you come to Lingling Town?

34
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,800
Miss Zhou.

35
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,110
What’s wrong?

36
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,000
It’s nothing.

37
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,240
Let’s go.

38
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,320
What are you looking at?

39
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,470
Thank you for saving my life.

40
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,320
I’m willing to be your servant
in my next life to repay your help.

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
Quit it, Qian Suiyou.

42
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Save those useless fancy words
you learned from books to yourself.

43
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,440
Let me put it this way.

44
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,720
Thank you so much.

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,910
You saved me from my misery.

46
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,110
What you did was like

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
giving me a second life.

48
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,030
That’s more like it.

49
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,830
Last time I saw you,

50
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,630
you were so intimate with Miss Zhou.

51
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,350
Being with her is miserable now?

52
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,760
It’s always like this.

53
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,480
When they meet new people,
the old ones become unimportant.

54
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,350
Miss Lingyu,
haven’t you seen enough?

55
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,320
What a pity!

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,790
For what?

57
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,510
How could a nice man like you

58
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,550
get abandoned?

59
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,040
Not abandoned.

60
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,270
Fei is a nice girl.

61
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,640
I’m not worthy of her.

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,070
Why do you always dress up

63
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,830
like Qian Suiyou?

64
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,160
Yuyi Troupe has many ladies.

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
It’s inconvenient for
a young man like me

66
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,670
to come in and out.

67
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,600
It’s better to stay away from troubles.

68
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,440
And I have to say it again.

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,950
Thank you so much.

70
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,070
I’m willing to be your servant
in my next life to repay your help.

71
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,510
But today I have
important matters to attend to.

72
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,350
I have to say goodbye for now.

73
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,480
See you again in the future.

74
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,200
What?

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
What is he hiding from?

76
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,070
Xie Meimei,

77
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,230
deep in your heart,
you want her to come.

78
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,510
But when you see her,
you turn around and flee.

79
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,950
When she’s not after you, you...

80
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,830
This is hilarious.

81
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,880
I’m fine. I’m fine.

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Sir.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,230
You’re quite tough.

84
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,390
You don’t get hurt easily.

85
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,550
I’m fine.

86
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,880
Why did you get into the carriage?

87
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,110
Young girl.

88
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,440
You’re very impolite to the elders.

89
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Excuse me.

90
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,070
Why are you afraid to look at me?

91
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,200
Why don’t you keep running?

92
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,160
How am I supposed to run
when you’re holding me?

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,550
So you indeed want to flee?

94
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,830
You sent those

95
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,720
Route Gang members?

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,390
Yes.

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,350
But it’s not easy to catch you.

98
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,790
It took Route Gang so long

99
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,480
before they could find you.

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,950
That’s pretty bad for their reputation.

101
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,950
But I’ve thought it through.

102
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,110
If this doesn’t work out,
I’ll go to Huo Liantao’s assembly

103
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,640
to find you.

104
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,110
How do you like that?

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,270
Did you know it was me the moment

106
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,390
I got in the carriage?

107
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,110
So you followed me all the way here.

108
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,230
Fei.

109
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,070
That broke the rules.

110
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,270
How about this?

111
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,920
Let’s do this again?

112
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,160
I haven’t seen you for days.

113
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Why are you trying to fight me
the moment we meet?

114
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,880
Amazing.

115
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,550
You are playing Goose-breaking Blades
crazily.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,440
Are you really this mad?

117
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,470
Fei.

118
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,550
How’s your injury?

119
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,520
You told me when you were
at Fortress of the Forty-Eight

120
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,030
that Bone-chilling is

121
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,080
the deadliest poison in the world.

122
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,150
Those who are poisoned

123
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,080
will start to chill from their bones.

124
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,440
When they die,

125
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,670
their whole body will be frozen.

126
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
How do you know that?

127
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,150
I’ve been traveling around the world.

128
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,320
Well...

129
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,760
Cut it out.

130
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,030
I won’t believe you anyway.

131
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,030
Maybe it’s because I’m knowledgeable.

132
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,670
I know all about
the world and its history.

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,440
The other day, I asked you
where you learned your martial art.

134
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,110
You hit my lethargy point.

135
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,280
You put me to sleep.

136
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,910
Why?

137
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,200
You were injured.

138
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,150
Fei.

139
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,000
You need to rest when you’re injured.

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,440
Why can’t you just let go of
those trivial questions?

141
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,520
You are always asking about
this and that.

142
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,350
No one can put up with that.

143
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,000
I had to put you to sleep.

144
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,550
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is still recovering from the incident.

145
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,710
Why do you have time to

146
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,760
have fun at Lingling Town?

147
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,640
I haven’t seen my mom for a while.

148
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,200
I just met her briefly.

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,440
Then I sneaked out of the mountain.

150
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,200
I followed the ambiguous information

151
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
Route Gang has given me.

152
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,400
I pursued.

153
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,590
I searched.

154
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
How dare you say that

155
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,110
I’m here to have fun?

156
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,470
She came for me?

157
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,960
Of course, I came because of
the ripple-shaped object

158
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,350
on Huo Liantao’s invitation.

159
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,790
What do you think
I am here for?

160
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,000
No one was talking about the Color of
Ocean and Heaven a few months back.

161
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,280
But now so many forces

162
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,790
are after it.

163
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,880
Huo Liantao’s invitation is determined

164
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,910
to make every household
know about this.

165
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,440
Even the Demons know that

166
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,550
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
has two important objects.

167
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,880
If I don’t try to figure it out myself,

168
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,520
I will get dragged into

169
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,790
this mess anyway, won’t I?

170
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,440
Are you satisfied with this answer?

171
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,030
Fei.

172
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,640
I...

173
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,230
Tortoise Master comes!

174
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,440
Run!

175
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,180
<i>Ding Kui, Tortoise Master
of Four-guardian Mountain</i>

176
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,030
I already have one foot in the grave.

177
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,790
Why do I have to drag her down?

178
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,760
What?

179
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,200
Say it.

180
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,790
Look that way.

181
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,230
Tortoise Master
of the Four-guardian Mountain

182
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,230
made such a big entrance in town.

183
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,520
It seems that he’s here
to stir up trouble.

184
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,550
You know who Tortoise Master
of the Four-guardian Mountain is,

185
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,470
don’t you?

186
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,590
I know.

187
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,000
Of course, I do.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,030
I not only know him,
but I’ve also beaten up

189
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,400
some of his pawns.

190
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,200
You!

191
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,110
You don’t always get into trouble.

192
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,150
But once you do,

193
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,670
you mess around with
those who’re big and mighty.

194
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,000
So what?

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
Just some of his pawns.

196
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,470
Do I have to make a report

197
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,000
in advance for beating them?

198
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
You!

199
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,590
You are...

200
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,200
You sneak attacked me in
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

201
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,080
Now I sneak attacked you.

202
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,710
We’re even now.

203
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,960
What’s the use of these long legs?
Might as well cut them.

204
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,670
<i>Lingling Town</i>

205
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,520
Look.

206
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,080
This is Lingling Town.

207
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,030
Why did Ding Kui

208
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,520
rob my invitation?

209
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,560
The four masters of
Four-guardian Mountain.

210
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,030
Dragon Master, Zheng Luosheng,
is deceitful.

211
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,590
Phoenix Master, Mu Xiaoqiao,
is eccentric.

212
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,200
White Tiger Master, Feng Feihua,
can’t distinguish right or wrong.

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,640
Tortoise Master, Ding Kui,
is capricious.

214
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,200
Our Xingnan Sect is small and weak.

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Of course, they’re going to pick on us.

216
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,910
He wants to find an invitation

217
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,950
and rightfully walks into
Demon-Extermination Assembly.

218
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,640
But I didn’t expect them

219
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,950
to make such a scene.

220
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,000
It seems that things are going to change

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,320
in Lingling Town.

222
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,910
Is that Zhou Fei?

223
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,950
That seems to be her.

224
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,350
What is she pushing?

225
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,800
Miss Zhou.

226
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I picked up an old opera writer.

227
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,680
Zhou Fei.

228
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,560
Fei.

229
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,080
Where have you been?

230
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,880
Chuchu.

231
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,510
You came right on time.
Come help me.

232
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,510
Let me help you.

233
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,390
No need.

234
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,240
My cousin said no.

235
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,150
Well.

236
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,120
Sir.

237
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,680
Can we have one room, please?

238
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Why is this old man so heavy?

239
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,440
Isn’t this Mr. Xie?

240
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
What’s going on?

241
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,390
What’s wrong with his face?

242
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,030
That’s a long story.

243
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,270
Fei.

244
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,350
Have you disabled him?

245
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,470
Li Yan.

246
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,950
Stay there.

247
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,200
Come back.

248
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,440
Why are you here?

249
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
No.

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,150
How did you escape?

251
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,510
I...

252
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,640
I don’t want to listen to your excuses.

253
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
You must find the secret service

254
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,000
and go back home immediately.

255
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,240
Go back to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight right now.

256
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,320
You’re her brother.

257
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,440
Can’t you be nicer to your own sister?

258
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,480
People from Fortress of the Forty-Eight

259
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,360
are all so mean.

260
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,800
Can’t you be gentler
to your own sisters?

261
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,320
Li Yan, you’re tough now.

262
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,200
You even have the full support of
those you’ve cheated.

263
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,990
-That’s enough.
-Bonehead.

264
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,030
In all these years of my life,

265
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,320
this is the first time
someone stood up for me.

266
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,030
Sheng.

267
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,230
I heard that Yuyi Troupe is
in Lingling Town.

268
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,150
Can you invite Madam Nichang

269
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,910
for me?

270
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
Sure. No problem.

271
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,320
What are you doing?

272
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,870
Go ahead.

273
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,460
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>

274
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,680
Our master said that

275
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,230
he won’t see any visitors today.

276
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,320
Go tell your Master Huo that

277
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,440
I know he has information about
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

278
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,680
But the Demons have their eyes on him.

279
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,600
So he needs to find alliance
to fight against the Demons.

280
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,030
I, Ding Kui, want to put aside
the grudges and work with Master Huo.

281
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,870
Huo Family is respectable.

282
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,560
We won’t work with scums
from Four-guardian Mountain.

283
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,030
Bastard Ding.

284
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,320
You can’t go inside today
even if you kill me.

285
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,480
The trees behind this wall

286
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,560
are arranged according to
Qi Men Dun Jia Formation.

287
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,270
It was designed for our Master

288
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,360
by Chongxiaozi
from Qi School years before.

289
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,150
If you’re in it, you can never
come out of it in this life.

290
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,750
Great.

291
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,600
Go back and tell your Master Huo,

292
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,560
I’ll have my chance to kill him.

293
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,030
But this time…

294
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,910
Master, you want to
kill them all together?

295
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,030
Yes.

296
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,750
Let them kill each other.

297
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,600
I’ve planted kerosene in the formation

298
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,990
Chongxiaozi has set up.

299
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,960
When these martial artists step inside,

300
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,800
I’ll burn them all.

301
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,750
Great. Great.

302
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,200
Rumor has it that

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,560
Master Huo is stupid and reckless.

304
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,200
But it turns out that

305
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,390
you’re not so stupid after all.

306
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,870
Come out.

307
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,750
With you here,
the Color of Ocean and Heaven

308
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,960
already belongs to us,
Four-guardian Mountain.

309
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,480
Ding Kui, why are you

310
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,200
talking nonsense to yourself?

311
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,840
You and I can rule

312
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,990
Demon-Extermination Assembly.

313
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,270
No.

314
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,510
Mu Xiaoqiao.

315
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,910
I know Huo Changfeng has given you
a meal that saved your life.

316
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,630
But you risked your life for him
for years.

317
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,440
The debt has been paid.

318
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,990
Besides, the Huo’s Manor is
in a different person’s hand now.

319
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,390
Huo Liantao is a joke in the underworld.

320
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,110
Even so, are you still
trying to defend him?

321
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,560
That’s my own choice to make.

322
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,150
I’m here to give you a present.

323
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,440
This person ran out
when the old Huo’s Manor fell.

324
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,960
I happened to have caught him.

325
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,720
He knows many interesting affairs
about Huo’s Manor.

326
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,630
Phoenix Master,
why don’t you hear his story first

327
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,030
before you decide whether you’re going
to defend Huo Liantao

328
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,400
on Demon-Extermination Assembly or not?

329
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,110
Breeze lifted up the cloth.

330
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,750
Moonlight shined on the earth.

331
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,140
<i>Qinghui</i>

332
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,700
<i>Qinghui</i>

333
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,740
<i>Qinghui, the Immortal</i>

334
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:59,180
<i>Qinghui, the Immortal</i>

335
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,960
Master, this way.

336
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,870
Madam, you finally came.

337
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,840
Ever since I met you two kids,

338
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,030
I’ve never had an easy day.

339
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,600
Where is he?

340
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,750
He’s inside.

341
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,510
How come?

342
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,440
Madam, what’s wrong?

343
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,320
I’ve seen this poison before.

344
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,270
This is the deadliest poison
in the world.

345
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,010
Is this Bone-chilling?

346
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,080
How’s this possible?

347
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,910
Madam, is there anything we can do?

348
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,720
Reading from his pause,

349
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,390
I think he can still live a year or two

350
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,630
if he doesn’t use his force.

351
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,150
I might not be the best doctor,

352
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,750
but I can tell that

353
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,960
his force is suppressing the poison.

354
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,390
If he doesn’t use the force,

355
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,510
he’ll be safe.

356
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,110
You must keep a close eye on him.

357
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,480
Madam!

358
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,270
Madam, there’s another thing that

359
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
I need your help with.

360
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,320
Master.

361
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,080
Master, I find it really odd.

362
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
This is the first time I’ve seen

363
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,230
to keep a man that way.

364
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,320
Hasn’t she realized that Mr. Xie
is avoiding her like she’s evil?

365
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,720
Maybe Qian Suiyou tried to
keep himself hidden from her

366
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,440
because his love for her is too strong.

367
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,680
That Tianmen Lock is a treasure itself.

368
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,080
Master, can we really give it

369
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,800
to others so casually?

370
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,440
What’s the use of us having it?

371
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,230
It’s just a piece of junk for us.

372
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,510
But for the lovers,

373
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,750
it’s the matchmaker’s red string of fate

374
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,630
which wealth can’t buy.

What are you here for?

396
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,800
That man wore this earlier.

397
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,270
You dropped it at the door.

398
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,440
I accidentally spilled tea on it.

399
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,680
The smoke of boiling tea
immediately dissipated.

400
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,560
Then I touched the hat.

401
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,270
The inside is freezing.

402
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,150
I want to see the man
who’s poisoned with Bone-chilling.

403
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,600
What Bone-chilling?

404
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,390
I’ve never heard of it.

405
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,150
Who are you?

406
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,510
My name is Ying Hecong.

407
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,990
I’m known as the Poisoner.

408
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,840
The man you carried into the hotel today

409
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,720
was poisoned with
Pathetic Clam’s Bone-chilling.

410
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,910
I can take a look at him for you.

411
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,870
Come in.

412
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,360
Thank you.

413
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,030
What are you doing?

414
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,320
This man’s days are numbered.

415
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,800
Listen. Bone-chilling can
freeze a man to death

416
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,630
in less than three months.

417
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,600
Isn’t that incredible?

418
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,360
It seems that
he was poisoned a month ago.

419
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,290
That’s weird.

420
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,440
Pathetic Clam had been missing

421
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,390
for years.

422
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,810
Who poisoned him?

423
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,280
A month?

424
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,440
What again?

425
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
How can this man have such strong force?

426
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,230
It’s too strong for a man of his age.

427
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,150
How did he do that?

428
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,870
How?

429
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,560
It still doesn’t make sense.

430
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,960
I see.

431
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,800
Soul-searching Needle.

432
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,840
Tanzhong point, Baihui point...

433
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,230
And...

434
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,630
And... And... And...

435
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,840
Fengfu point, Lingtai point,
Tianchuang point, Dazhui point.

436
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,390
Tianchuang point.

437
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,320
Look! This is the mark left
by Soul-searching Needle.

438
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,840
This silver needle itself

439
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
won’t leave a mark.

440
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,110
Even if you’re hit,

441
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,680
the wound should heal
in two or three days.

442
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,480
But those poisoned with Bone-chilling
have special health conditions.

443
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,870
Any small fracture would cause

444
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,080
the blood to clot under the skin.

445
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,320
And the clot will stay for months
because it’s frozen.

446
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,840
Marks left by Soul-searching Needle

447
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,320
will be even deeper.

448
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,480
Isn’t it true that
people will be energized again

449
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,030
for 45 minutes
after Soul-searching Needle?

450
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,990
You are right.

451
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Soul-searching Needle.

452
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,110
I see.

453
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,390
The poison has been in him

454
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,750
for a long time.

455
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,750
But when he was poisoned,

456
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,480
someone put strong force

457
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,510
in him

458
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,440
to suppress the poison.

459
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,390
And they used secret methods
to seal his vessels.

460
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,270
Let me put it this way.

461
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,680
His vessels became

462
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,480
a prison.

463
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
Bone-chilling is the prisoner.

464
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,990
And the strong force is the guard.

465
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,870
As long as the guard
does its job diligently,

466
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,230
the prisoner can’t go anywhere.

467
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,510
But I don’t know

468
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,080
what’s wrong with him.

469
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,720
He pushed out Soul-searching Needle
with his force.

470
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,320
The vessels of those
poisoned with Bone-chilling

471
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,990
function very slowly.

472
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,990
So the effect of Soul-searching Needle

473
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,440
was slowed down.

474
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,750
Do you understand?

475
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,230
Haven’t I explained everything clearly?

476
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,750
He told me that Fisherman recovered

477
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,630
because he ate
Big Medicine Valley’s Reborn Pill.

478
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,630
If I get Reborn Pill
from Big Medicine Valley,

479
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,510
can I help him recover?

480
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,080
For those who just get poisoned,

481
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,560
one Reborn Pill

482
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,390
and spending the rest of their lives

483
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,680
at a place that’s humid

484
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,870
are enough to make sure
they make into their 70s or 80s.

485
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,960
But... He... Well...

486
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,390
We don’t even know how long

487
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,320
he’s been living with Bone-chilling.

488
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,870
Bone-chilling is the seed.

489
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,320
It has long been planted and
has flourished inside his body.

490
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
Forget about Reborn Pill.

491
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,510
Even if you have two magic pills
from Lord Lao Zi,

492
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,320
you still can’t save him.

493
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,840
You can’t save him. You can’t.

494
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
You...

495
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,230
Haven’t you said that
you know how to save him?

496
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,980
There’s really no other way?

497
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,200
His life can’t be saved.

498
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,110
But...

499
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Tell me.

500
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,910
If you want to make the rest of his time

501
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,910
more comfortable,

502
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,910
don’t let him eat any warm food.

503
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,360
It will cause the poison
to get stronger.

504
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,750
Most importantly,

505
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,200
he must not use his force anymore.

506
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,680
If he uses it one more time,

507
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,990
I can guarantee with my life that

508
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,600
he will be dead.

509
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,230
You’re the Poisoner.

510
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,640
And this is all you can do?

511
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,670
That’s just a name they call me.

512
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,600
I only like to

513
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,270
collect all the poisons
in the world.

514
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,080
I don’t know how to treat patients.

515
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,320
How about this?

516
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I’ll give you a snake.

517
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,950
Don’t be scared.

518
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,990
Calm down. Calm down.

519
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,750
Don’t be scared. It’s all right.

520
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,190
I came with good intentions.

521
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,920
Why did you hit me?

522
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,800
I won’t give you my snake anymore.

523
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,400
You repaid my kindness with enmity.

524
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,430
Oh! No!

525
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,080
I forgot to ask who poisoned him.

526
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,030
Maybe next time.

527
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,950
Who asked you to meddle with
my business?

528
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,840
When you were done with
meddling with my business,

529
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,640
you just turned around and ran away.

530
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,470
And you’re gonna die

531
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,490
in a corner where no one knows.

532
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,270
Do you think you’re a hero?

533
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,920
Do you think you’re a hero?

534
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,160
Aren’t you just touched by yourself?

535
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,710
Xie Yun.

536
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,320
Did you do this?

537
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,400
This lock is called Tianmen Lock.

538
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,750
The key has two layers.

539
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,190
The first layer is the cap.

540
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,430
A special way is needed to

541
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,160
open the cap.

542
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,160
When the cap is opened,

543
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,400
the keyhole can be seen.

544
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,320
So,

545
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,560
it’s impossible for Qian Suiyou
to break free.

546
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,030
Even if Li Zheng is
locked on one side

547
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,840
and Yin Wenlan is
locked on the other side,

548
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,750
without knowing the right method,

549
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,920
they’re never gonna
break free from this.

550
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,920
Thank you, Madam.

551
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,950
You’re welcome.

552
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,400
What on earth is this thing

553
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,360
Madam Nichang gave you?

554
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,160
What are you doing?

555
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,230
I’ll buy you a new one someday.

556
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,320
No, no, no!

557
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,160
How dare I?

558
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,670
I should be grateful

559
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,430
you didn’t draw the tortoise
on my face.

560
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,190
You don’t have other good qualities.

561
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,710
But, at least,
you know when to behave yourself.

562
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,320
Beauty... This...

563
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,840
Well.

564
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,230
How did you come up with

565
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,030
this new position?

566
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,470
At lease, I’m a handsome guy.

567
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,560
When I go out like this,

568
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,190
I have to either
bend down or lift my leg.

569
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,230
When I use the bathroom,
I have to stand on one foot.

570
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,920
Well...

571
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,160
I mean...

572
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,600
Look at this.

573
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,560
I’m standing like
I’m kicking a shuttlecock.

574
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,270
Isn’t this hideous to look at?

575
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,750
Blame Li Sheng for this.

576
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,670
Don’t tell anyone else.

577
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,950
Where should I chain him to?

578
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,160
Not to this bed, of course.

579
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,800
This bed can’t keep him chained.

580
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
How about locking him with you?

581
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,600
No.

582
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,320
He’s a man and you’re a woman.

583
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,990
It’s not convenient.

584
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,230
It’s indeed inconvenient.

585
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,840
Put the lock on his foot.

586
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,840
That one.

587
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,750
Perfect.

588
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,640
He escaped my notice for a moment.

589
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,470
And he just put
the other end of the lock

590
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,800
on your wrist.

591
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,160
Otherwise,
I would’ve put it on your neck.

592
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,470
Then you don’t have to stand like this.

593
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,640
You can stand with your feet
in your mouth.

594
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,640
Fine.

595
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,670
You’ve grown up.

596
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,990
As your master, I feel relieved.

597
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,270
I’m hungry.
Is there anything I can eat?

598
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,190
I spent a whole day
in the chase with you.

599
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,560
I haven’t had any water or food.

600
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,160
Sure. I’ll get you something to eat.

601
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,160
Sir.

602
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,800
From now on, the dishes for Mr. Xie

603
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,510
must be as light as possible.

604
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,510
And the food must be cold,

605
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,840
not even warm.

606
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,190
Miss, the weather is hot.

607
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,670
But when the dishes are cold,

608
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,230
the taste will be bad.

609
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,640
Just do as I say.

610
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,710
Thank you.

611
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,230
It’s better than losing your life
for this.

612
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,710
Miss.
There’s a Mr. Yang in the backyard.

613
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,920
He’s been waiting for you for a while.

614
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,360
Yang Jin?

Why are you cheating again?

618
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,640
Is this cheating?

619
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,320
Come on.

620
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,400
Wait! Wait! Wait!

621
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,230
What?

622
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,750
Are you scared?

623
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,840
When Yang Jin

624
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,320
hears the word blade,

625
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,800
he’ll get so excited.

626
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,840
He will become

627
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,120
very gullible.

628
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,160
To get rid of him,

629
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,670
I need to trick him.

630
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,270
Do you know why I come to town?

631
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,670
To joust.

632
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,080
No.

633
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,510
I came here for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

634
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,600
What color?

635
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,120
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

636
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,640
It’s a legacy.

637
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,640
It has collected the legacies
of the sects

638
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,360
that have fallen because of
natural or man-made disasters.

639
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,710
And…

640
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,190
Have you heard of Reborn Pill?

641
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,080
It can boost people’s force.

642
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,190
Really?

643
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,950
