<i>Legend of Fei</i>

17
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Episode 27</i>

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,000
There was a meritorious talent.

19
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,490
When he was little,
enemy troops invaded his hometown

20
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,410
and his hometown was occupied.

21
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,170
He had no choice,
but to wander from place to place.

22
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,770
One day, he strayed
into a fairy mountain.

23
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,130
Because of his extraordinary body,

24
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,020
a Taoist priest took him
as an apprentice

25
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,810
and even taught him invincible skills.

26
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,340
Years later,

27
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,620
the young man came back

28
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,340
in the hope of reviving his state,

29
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,860
and joined the army.

30
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,450
He was incomparably brave.

31
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,650
He led the army,
fighting wars across the state

32
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,500
and being in the limelight.

33
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,930
Unfortunately,

34
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,730
he had bad luck.

35
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,780
He fell in the trap of evil men

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,900
and was poisoned on the battlefield.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,170
He could do nothing, but run away.

38
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,060
When he was dying,

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,060
he saw a flock of crows flying to him!

40
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,810
He then knew his master sent the crows

41
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,650
to save him.

42
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,570
He gave up his battle achievement,

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,290
went away with the crews
and became a monk.

44
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,860
-Good story.
-Good story.

45
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,700
Why does it sound

46
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,060
like the Caw?

47
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,220
Yuyi Troupe hasn’t
visited Chunhui Town yet.

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,730
The story has already come.

49
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,780
Old rocks by the bridge.

50
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,290
There’s much frost.

51
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,420
A travelling man has gone on a journey.

52
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,650
Why doesn’t he come back?

53
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,700
It’s your new play?

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,340
My new play tells a story

55
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,420
about a deserter.

56
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,450
Bone-chilling is

57
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,530
the No.1 poison.

58
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,060
Poisoned people die with chilled faces.

59
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,170
That’s how it was named.

60
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,930
Reborn Pill is said to detoxify it.

61
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,260
Whoever takes it will always need water.

62
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,340
All his life,

63
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,260
he must live
where there’s rich water vapor.

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,060
Fei.

65
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,900
What’s on your mind?

66
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,480
Don’t you find this story weird?

67
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,370
I think I once read about it

68
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,780
on the comment of a martial book.

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,170
About Penglai.

70
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,140
Immortals in Penglai?

71
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,650
What’s the comment about?

72
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,620
There’s a sentence.

73
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,860
Old dreams die down in Penglai

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,530
and sunset impels clouds with no trace.

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,650
But I don’t understand

76
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,570
what that means.

77
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,010
Sunset impels clouds with no trace?

78
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,850
Excuse me.

79
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,900
Miss Zhou.

80
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,820
Have you seen Xie Yun?

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,010
Mr. Xie?

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,570
Yes.

83
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,660
He has left with Madam Li’s badge.

84
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,130
Fine.

85
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Madam.

86
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,970
Disciples down the mountain reported

87
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,780
Junior Master Huo Liantao of Huo’s Manor

88
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,380
was sending out invitations

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,170
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

90
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,660
Let him be.

91
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,690
He printed the ripple pattern

92
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,540
on the invitations.

93
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,540
Huo Liantao.

94
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,730
He has weak skills,
but strong ambitions.

95
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,100
If I weren’t too busy with
rebuilding our fortress

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,250
to go there,

97
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,940
I would like to challenge him.

98
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,060
Aunt! Aunt!

99
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,500
You’re too busy to go,
but I can go for you.

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,730
Li Yan, don’t add trouble.

101
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,290
You?

102
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,730
Before you can fully perform
the blade artistry

103
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,250
I’ve taught you,

104
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,690
I won’t let you leave.

105
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,410
-Aunt.
-Aunt.

106
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,540
I think I can go on behalf of you.

107
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,450
Old Master Huo is a close friend
of Mr. Chongxiao.

108
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,940
Knowing he was ill,

109
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,620
Mr. Chongxiao travelled all the way

110
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,850
to see him one last time.

111
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,620
Old Master Huo died
in front of me.

112
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,220
And before he died,
he chattered about the pattern.

113
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,170
Why don’t we figure out how he died

114
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,340
by attending the Assembly?

115
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,250
We can also tell Mr. Chongxiao about it.

116
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,010
What do you think?

117
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,450
How much does it look alike?

118
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,660
70% alike, at most.

119
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,290
If you want it better,

120
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,820
I’m afraid I need to see the real one.

121
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,170
It’s a sticky business.

122
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,450
I can only take it out secretly.

123
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,690
If he has the real scabbard,

124
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,220
others will cast greedy eyes.

125
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,060
He won’t have me keep it for him.

126
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,340
I can only send out fake ones.

127
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,060
Otherwise,

128
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,500
he would be in trouble sooner or later.

129
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,730
Junior Master.

130
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,060
Master.

131
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,010
Shoot.

132
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,970
Martial artists keep coming
to take revenge.

133
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,380
But they’ve been stopped

134
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,540
by Qi Men Dun Jia Formation
Mr. Chongxiao set up.

135
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,660
Good.

136
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,620
We’re in troubled times.

137
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,450
Since we have the precious thing,

138
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,970
we must be very cautious.

139
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,940
We should prevent martial artists
from making trouble

140
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,170
as well as the Demons.

141
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,380
<i>Auspicious Omen and Luck</i>
I heard they had already attacked

142
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,130
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

143
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,290
Looks like Shen Tianshu is dying

144
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,780
to get the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

145
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,010
Now,

146
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,690
he can’t take down
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

147
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,500
My guess is

148
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,340
he will come here to look for trouble.

149
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,340
Our men patrol day and night.

150
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,450
Elite disciples take turns
to guard the gate.

151
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,780
Without your permission,

152
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,570
we won’t let anyone suspicious in.

153
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,570
Good.

154
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,410
You were born weak.

155
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,620
And you had internal injury.

156
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,940
You’re not strong enough
for martial arts.

157
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,060
Chongxiao!

158
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,620
Chongxiao!

159
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,290
Chongxiao!

160
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,130
Phoenix Pill?

161
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,450
This is Phoenix Pill,

162
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,290
helping to rebuild your body.

163
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,250
What happened to you?

164
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,780
You swallowed the pill directly?

165
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,660
Are you crazy?

166
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,710
Mr. Yang.

167
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,370
Lately, I’ve been too busy

168
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,050
to say thanks to you.

169
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,100
During the trouble we had,

170
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,660
thank you for helping us.

171
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
We’re very grateful.

172
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,100
See you!

173
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,930
Bonehead!

174
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,180
Li Yan?

175
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,010
Why is it you again?

176
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,300
You look hasty.

177
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,490
Where are you going?

178
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,010
I’m going to find Zhou Fei

179
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,970
for a competition.

180
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,810
Fine, since you want a punch.

181
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,340
Let me take you there.

182
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
Only I know where she is.

183
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,010
Let’s go.

184
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,980
Sir.

185
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,250
You... You get me wrong.

186
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,860
We can’t just let Huo Liantao

187
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,370
hold the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

188
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,610
Ask Mr. Chu to go.

189
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,930
Tell him I’m still badly wounded
after the fight in the Fortress.

190
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,780
Under such dangerous circumstances,

191
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,340
I have no choice,
but to ask him to go.

192
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,180
Mr. Chu.

193
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,740
Shen Tianshu wants you
to take back the Seal of Cautiousness.

194
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,180
I’m not going.

195
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
Commander-in-chief asked me

196
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,740
to spend the rest of my life comfortably

197
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,340
in Demons Manor,

198
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,610
instead of being ordered about
by Shen Tianshu.

199
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,780
But Shen Tianshu failed
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

200
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,810
and didn’t get back the token
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

201
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,180
He nearly got Commander-in-chief killed.

202
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,570
<i>Sparrow Chu Tianyu with Demons Manor</i>
Commander-in-chief has been angry.

203
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,930
<i>Sparrow Chu Tianyu with Demons Manor</i>
If you help him

204
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,810
to get back the Seal of Cautiousness,

205
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,930
he will think more highly of you.

206
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,540
By then,

207
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,980
I guess you may take charge

208
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,280
of Demons Manor.

209
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,930
<i>Noodles</i>
Griddle cakes.

210
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,220
Griddle cakes.

211
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,740

212
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,300

213
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,450
Steamed stuffed buns.
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

214
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,570
You must be Zhou Fei
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

215
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,980
The man you’re after is too sly.

216
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,010
Our men all keep an eye on him.

217
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,690

220
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,420
He’s heading for Lingling Town, I guess.

221
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,660
In Lingling Inn,

222
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,540
men with Blue Bat are watching for him.

223
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,540
Thanks.

224
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,860

225

Let’s have a rest over there.

227
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,050
Okay.

228
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,300
Let’s walk a bit further.

229
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,130
Mother, I’m hungry.

230
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,930
Don’t cry, baby.

231
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,780
Have some sleep in my arms.

232
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,420
Then you won’t be hungry.

233
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,930
Mother! Mother!

234
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,490
Mr. Chongxiao?

235
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,570
A secret tunnel?

236
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,100
<i>Phoenix Pill</i>

237

Don’t touch it!

239
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,180
You can’t take it improperly.

You just don’t want me to eat any!

241

Liar!

242
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,900
You said it was the last one.

243
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,100
The Phoenix Pill is a kind
of evil medicine

244
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,900
made by our ancestor Lyu Run.

245
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,370
Taking it will give you great strength.

246
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,250
But a master must bring its property

247
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,900
into your body with his force

248
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,130
and dissolve it.

249
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,300
Or you’ll be in great danger!

250
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Ordinary men

251
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,370
can’t stand such effects.

252
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,740
Soon, they will lose their mind

253
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,980
and die of blood explosion.

254
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,220
A disciple with Big Medicine Valley

255
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,690
once stole the pills and ate them.

256
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,810
He turned into a demon,

257
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,860
and killed many men!

258
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,930

he died of body explosion.

259
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,160

We can’t help much to fight the Demons.

376
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,250
Why must we come?

377
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,940
Ying, don’t talk nonsense.

378
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,010
Old Master Huo’s been nice to us.

379
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,180
Thanks to them,

380
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,580
we have no problem
doing business in the south.

381
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,180
We received the invitation.

382
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,940
Anyway,

383
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,090
we should come
and support Junior Master Huo.

384
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,970
What are you looking at?

385
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,900
It’s summer.

386
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,820
But that man is shivering with cold.

387
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,180
Is he sick?

388
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,610
Ying, go.

389
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,490
Take out a robe from our luggage

390
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,130
and give it to that man.

391
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,060
You’re trying to help people again.

392
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,010
My brother asked me to give this to you.

393
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,540
Thank you.

394
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,850
Thank you.

395
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,900

I’m with Blue Bat.

You’re just in time.

416
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,820
There was a customer,

417
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,330
looking like the man you’re after.

418
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,180
He left the coins.

419
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,610
They’re not special.

420
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,300
But when he gave them to me,

421
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,700
they were cold as ice.

422
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,370
Where has he gone?

423
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,580
I’m sorry,

424
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,420
but I don’t know.

425
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,900
These days, people come and go

426
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,330
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

427
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,370
I’m afraid you can’t catch up with him.

428
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,090
But since he’s in town,

429
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,540
he needs accommodation and traffic.

430
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,660
Our business covers half of
the basic needs.

431
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,090
The man you’re after...

432
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,540
He could be negligent,
however careful he is.

433
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,130
Why don’t you stay in our inn

434
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,490
and wait for more news?

435
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,850
Fine.

436
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,370
Thanks, then.

437
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,820
Isn’t he supposed

438
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,460
to be in the south for sunlight?

439
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,210
Why did he come here?

440
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,400
Let’s sit there.

Get up. Get up.

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,250
I don’t like the food in this inn.

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,330
We’ll discuss about it

450
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,090
and order the dishes later.

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,130
We come for
the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

Why are they wearing the mourning?

474
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,940
I hear Tortoise Master Ding Kui

475
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,210
isn’t a good man.

476
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,610

We have something important to tell you.

478
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,130
Give us the invitation

479
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,420
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

480
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,700
Robbing in the inn in broad daylight?

481
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,090
How lawless you are!

482
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,780
We want the invitation,

483
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,370
just because we don’t like it

484
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,730
when you run errands
for Huo Liantao, the hypocrite.

485
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,730
When he’s holding
the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

486
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,130
you even bring a cart of gifts to him.

487
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,580
Will your cousin

488
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,970
help those people?

489
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,940
She’s here looking for Xie Yun,
instead of fighting.

490
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,660
They’re having a dog-fight.

491
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,060
Why must she interfere?

492
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,210
You want to interfere?

493
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,180
You...!

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,580
We’re just passing by

495
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,010
and teasing Huo Liantao’s dogs.

496
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,570
What?

497
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,370

Who are you?

501
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,210
When Old Master Zhu was in charge,

502
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,460
your family could barely
be a famous sect.

503
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,610
Since he was paralyzed in bed,

504
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,660
you’ve failed to do martial arts

505
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,180
and have even done business for living.

506
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,210
How can you still say
you’re martial artists?

507
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,090
Oh, look at the invalid.

508
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,820
He could never practice martial arts.

509
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,900
He’s as weak as a girl.

510
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,850
I mean, not even as weak as a girl.

511
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,370
No wonder you must ingratiate yourselves
with Huo Liantao.

512
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,540
Without his help,

513
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,820
your family would have disappeared.

514
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,380
Ying.

515
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,490
I don’t care when you slander me.

516
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,420
But when you slander Junior Master Huo

517
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,850
in Lingling Town,

518
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,490
don’t you fear you’ll cause problem?

519
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,180
Problem?

520
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,660
Don’t you know

521
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,370
how he became the master of Huo’s Manor?

522
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,060
Even before

523
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,330
the Demons arrived,

524
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,610
Huo Liantao ran away with fear,

525
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,090
leaving his huge properties behind.

526
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,130
How shameless he is!

527
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,900
And he dares

528
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
to send out invitations?

529
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,330
You’d better give us the invitation,

530
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,300
so that we can challenge Huo Liantao

531
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,540
on your behalf.

532
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,420
Young man, don’t be nervous.

533
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,900
I won’t eat your young master.

534
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,970
Since you’re Junior Master Huo’s enemy，

535
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,460
you can fight with him.

536
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,210
We are mere businessmen.

537
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,900
And we haven’t offended you.

538
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,420
When you don’t dare
to fight him directly,

539
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,460
you give vent on us.

540
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,660
What do you think you’re doing?

541
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,900
Bullying the weak
and being scare of the strong?

542
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,460
You think you can bully
whoever you want?

543
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,250
Let me say it again.

544
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,250
Give me the invitation,

545
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,250
and I’ll let you go.

546
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,820
The invitation is for my family.

547
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,970
Even if you kill me,

548
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,010
I won’t give it to you

549
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,700
in case you deceive others!

550
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,730
Evil!

551
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,940
You defamed my family

552
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,610
and hurt our men so brutally!

553
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,940
Mr. Zhu.

554
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,130
Which matters more,
your sister or the invitation?

555
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,210
Think carefully about it.

556
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,730
Let go of my sister!

557
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,740
<i>Wealth and Fortune</i>

558
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
<i>Wealth and Fortune</i>

559
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,130
On my way here, I heard a lot

560
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,580
that the Demon-Extermination Assembly

561
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,660
was exactly for treasure-grabbing.

562
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,180
Huo Liantao printed the ripple pattern

563
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,460
on the invitations,

564
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,780
calling on people to grab the treasure.

565
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,090
How come?

566
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,900
How does Huo Liantao
have the ripple pattern?

567
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,780
If he has it,
why doesn’t he keep it to himself?

568
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,330
Cousin.

569
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,940
Then why did those men
with Tortoise Master

570
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,770
snatch the invitation?

571
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,460
Go ask the master of Xingnan Sect

572
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,130
if there’s the ripple pattern
on the invitation.

573
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,290
You’re the master of Xingnan Sect?

574
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,220
No, no, no.

575
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,370
I’m from the Zhu family.

576
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,610
I’m Zhu Chen.

577
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,810
My father is the master of our sect.

578
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,900
He was a great man.

579
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,810
But he suffered a sneak attack
on his way to business.

580
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,220
So far, he’s been paralyzed in bed.

581
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,050
So you’re the young master
of Xingnan Sect?

582
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,370
Huo Liantao sent you an invitation?

583
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,180
Yes.

584
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,370
Yes.

585
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,770
I’ve been weak since I was born
and don’t have martial arts.

586
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,610
For my father and sister,
I must reply on Huo’s Manor

587
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,850
and do business within their territory.

588
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,570
This time,

589
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,130
I come to support Master Huo.

590
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,810
Oh,

591
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,810
thank you for saving us.

592
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,260
May I know your name?

593
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,290
Zhou Fei,
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

594
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,220
Li Yan,
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

595
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,530
Don’t be scared.

596
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,420
I just want to have a look.

597
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,810
I won’t snatch your invitation.

598
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,220
It’s okay.

599
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,090
Mr. Lin.

600
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,060
<i>From Huo Liantao with Huo’s Manor</i>

601
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,460
He’s really after this.

602
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Who?

603
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,700
Thanks.

604
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,570
Miss.

605
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,180
Sorry for disturbing your meal.

606
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,020
I’ve prepared some snacks from Jiankang

607
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,610
just to show our gratitude.

608
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,260
No, thanks.

609
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,290
I’m not hungry.

610
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,740
I’m hungry.

611
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,420
Thank you for this.

612
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,260
Waiter.

613
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,330
Be right there.

614
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,050
Mr. Qian Suiyou, why are you here alone?

615
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,570
Madam Nichang?

616
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,420
Long time no see. What a coincidence!

617
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,700
It is?

618
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,740
We come here for the same purpose,
don’t we?

619
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,020
It can’t be a coincidence.

620
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,220
Don’t say it out,

621
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,810
or it’ll be boring.

622
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,460
I just come to see the fun.

623
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,090
He’s here
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

624
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,500
Can you find him asap?

625
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,810
Lately, martial artists from all places
have come into Lingling Town

626
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,290
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

627
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,900
Even if you know he’s also going for it,

628
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,220
I’m afraid it’ll take much time

629
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,130
to find him among so many people.

630
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,130
The man you’re after is sly.

631
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,940
He keeps hiding himself from us.

632
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,050
I’ve exhausted my tricks.

633
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
-Well...
-Miss, if you’re anxious,

634
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,290
I’ll ask our elders

635
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,570
to think of a way

636
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,050
and send more men for help.

637
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,700
Thank you.

638
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,610
How delicious!

639
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,220
Fei, come over!

640
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,660
Famous snacks in Jiankang
are true to their names!

641
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,020
Come over. Come.

642
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,770
Among all great restaurants,

643
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,050
half are in Jiankang.

644
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,130
Miss Zhou, you know this saying.

645
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,850
Have you visited Jiankang before?

646
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,020
When there’s a chance,

647
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,940
I’ll invite you to Jiankang.

648
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,460
Among all great restaurants,

649
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,980
half are in Jiankang.

650
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,090
I haven’t gone there before.

651
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,740
I have a friend fastidious about food.

652
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,130
He’s from Jiankang.

653
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,770
Fei.

654
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,900
Do you mean Mr. Xie?

655
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Mr. Xie?

656
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,090
Focus on your food.

657
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,900
Why are you alone now?

658
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,180
Where is Fei?

659
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,980
I’m used to travelling alone.

660
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,460
Well,

661
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
it’s troublesome to bring a girl.

662
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,980
Hurting my cool image.

663
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,260
Really?

664
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,130
Denying true thoughts

665
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,330
isn’t a good habit for young men.

666
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,050
You will miss her,

667
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,330
perhaps.

668
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,220
How come?

669
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,700
I’m just busy avoiding her.

670
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,570
Avoiding?

671
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,810
Speaking of avoiding,

672
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,050
you’re avoiding
only when she looks for you.

673
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,090
Are you sure she’s looking for you?

674
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,180
What?

675
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,810
You always have a glib tongue.

676
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,260
Now you can’t argue?

677
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,700
Young man.

678
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,740
Don’t deceive yourself.

679
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,660
When we’re fated
to have no happy ending,

680
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:36,740
what else can I do

681
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,940
except avoiding her?

682
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,020
Madam Nichang.

683
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,610
I’ve got something else to do. See you.

684
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,130
If I have new lyrics,

685
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,700
I’ll go see you in Yuyi Troupe.

686
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,020
Qian Suiyou.

687
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,180
Don’t always bother about the ending.

688
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,850
The ending you want
may not be what others want.

689
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,770
Why don’t you just follow your heart?

690
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,500
Go.

691
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,260
Miss Zhou has also
come to Lingling Town.

692
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,330
What a coincidence!

693
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,420
It’s not a coincidence.

694
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,570
All martial artists have come here

695
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,460
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

696
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,220
Our young master also...

697
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,180
You have the nerve to say that?

698
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,900
Unfortunately, Miss Zhou is
also looking for Mr. Xie.

699
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,700
Why is Zichen in Lingling Town?

700
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,740
She isn’t staying with him?

701
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,700
Since Mr. Xie isn’t with her,

702
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
why do you need to meet her?

703
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,130
What if she knows something?

704
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,330
Oh,

705
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,290
when you see her,

706
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,420
show some respect.

707
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,260
If she hadn’t helped us out,

708
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,370
we wouldn’t have run away from Huarong.

709
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,130
Aye.

710
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,660
Who is it?

711
00:43:07,784 --> 00:43:17,784
Sub by WeTV & Ripped by skysoultan
♔ Follow @skysoultan on Instagram ♔

712
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:25,850
Xie Yun?

713
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,770
You freaked me out.

714
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,570
Zichen.

715
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,180
I waited for a long time.

716
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,090
I can finally come in,

717
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,420
when Mr. Bai is away.

718
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,810
Time is running out. I’ll be brief.

719
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,130
Why must you come in

720
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,660
when Mr. Bai is away?

721
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,610
Because he’s with Route Gang.

722
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,420
He’s looking for me
throughout the town.

723
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,740
If Mr. Bai sees us,

724
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,220
I’ll be biting the hook.

725
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,050
Why are they...

726
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,090
Don’t ask why they’re looking for me.

727
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,330
Tell me. Why do you come here?

728
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,290
Did Huo Liantao invite you?

729
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,050
Not really.

730
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,700
Junior Master Huo is holding
the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

731
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,130
I’d like to take this chance

732
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,050
to learn from Lord Mengchang
in the ancient time

733
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,220
so that I can unite
righteous martial artists

734
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,900
and win their trust.

735
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,610
It won’t do harm, anyway.

736
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,770
There aren’t many righteous men.

737
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,020
Even if there were some,

738
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,180
they wouldn’t come to such an assembly.

739
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
Why?

740
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,810
Stop asking why.

741
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,090
There’s much trouble in Lingling Town.

742
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,260
When Mr. Bai comes back,

743
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,660
leave right away.

744
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,260
Why can you come

745
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,530
and why can’t I?

746
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:37,980
Why...?

747
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,290
Stop.

748
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,050
Why do you have so many questions?

749
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,980
Anyway, this is all I can tell you.

750
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,290
I’ll ask no more, then.

751
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,810
Xie Yun.

752
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,330
Why don’t you go with us?

753
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,700
When you and Mr. Bai go with me

754
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,610
and Junior Master Huo is an old friend,

755
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,740
I don’t need to be scared.

756
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,570
Look.

757
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,370
I’ve stayed in your room for a while.

758
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,260
But no men with Mr. Bai have found me.

759
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,260
You really think you’re safe?

760
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,660
Mr. Bai just told me

761
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,900
Miss Zhou was in Lingling Town.

762
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,940
He has gone to pick her up.

763
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,090
When they’re back, I’ll be safe.

764
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,260
What?

765
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,700
Fei has come?

766
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,810
Yeah.

767
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,980
Xie Yun, you know what?

768
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,570
She’s the heir of South Blade.

769
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,700
Mr. Bai said

770
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,050
when we were in Huarong,

771
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,740
Miss Zhou helped us

772
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,090
and held back the Demons.

773
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,420
Otherwise, we wouldn’t have...

774
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Xie Yun?

775
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,810
This way, please.

776
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,700
Elder Bai has come.

777
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,260
He said you saved him

778
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,180
and he’d like to visit you personally.

779
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,330
Elder Bai?

780
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,940
Miss Zhou, thank you
for helping us last time.

781
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,290
You’re welcome, Mr. Bai.

782
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,570
I wonder

783
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,500
what you want me for.

784
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,020
I hear you’re looking for Mr. Xie.

785
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,940
Well, we’re looking for him, too.

786
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,770
But he’s too mysterious to be found.

787
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,850
We only know
he has come to Lingling Town.

788
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:07,660
Yes.

789
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,660
I was just informed

790
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,130
that he would go
to the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

791
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,980
You’re also looking for him?

792
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,610
Yes.

793
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,180
Why do you want him for?

794
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,290
To tell the truth, Miss Zhou,

795
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,810
Prince Zichen heard
of the ripple pattern

796
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,900
and insisted on coming to Lingling Town

797
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,370
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

798
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,940
None of us managed to stop him.

799
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,570
We think

800
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,980
if Mr. Xie could help to persuade him,

801
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,260
that would be great.
