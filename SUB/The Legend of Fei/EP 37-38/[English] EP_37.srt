It’s your first time to speak of her.

Do you hate her?

92
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,150
She’s just a borrowed weapon.

94
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,280
he won’t waste time to hate a weapon.

95
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,310
You suddenly bring her up.

96
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
Is there anything on your mind?

97
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,240
I’m just curious.

98
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,720
After Shen Tianshu was defeated
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

99
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,560
could she still stay

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,590
in Demons Manor?

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,800

-Hyah!

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Weird.

103
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,470
Why are there so many Demons?

104
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,350
Since the token for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven appeared,

105
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,150
the Demons are coming out
more frequently.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,310
I’m an off-staff disciple
with Qianzhong Sect.

107
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,150
I come to take over the secret service.

108

Greetings, Mr. Li.

109
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,440
What are those Demons doing?

110
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,750
They’re heading
for Cloud Ravine in the south.

111
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,720
Looks like

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
they’re after someone.

113
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,240
Bonehead.

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,750
Drink the water
and let’s get into the town.

115
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,750
Someone is there?

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
A thief, I guess!

117
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,520
He ran away so fast.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,680
He must be a spy,

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,590
instead of a martial master.

120
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,750
I must run after him, too!

121
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,520
Or he will think I’m scared of him.

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,280
Our priority is

123
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,030
to deliver Flaming Sage to Lingling.

124
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,120
Don’t ask for extra trouble.

125
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,840
Fine, then.

127
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,910
Wait.

128
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,680
We won’t ride the horses.

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,030
There’ll be loud tramping hoofs.

130
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,840
Get the horses that way.

131
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,310
We will walk.

132
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,070
You sound

133
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,720
much more like your cousin.

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,150
What’s the problem with that?

135
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,350
We risked our lives
to get the Flaming Sage.

136
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,070
If we lose it,

137
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,400
we’ll be sorry to Ying Hecong!

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
Hurry!

139
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,070
Okay.

140
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,030
Have we got rid of them?

141
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,070
They must have followed the horses

142
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,840
and won’t come back.

143
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,660
Let’s go.

144
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,870
Someone is here.

145
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,680
Sheng?

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,000
Why is it you?

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, Li Sheng!

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
Finally, you’ve come!

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
At last, I can give her to you

150
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
without any wound!

151
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
We had such a hard trip.

152
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,520
So hard!

153
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,910
Sheng, you have no idea.

154
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,840
I asked you to go back home, didn’t I?

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,720
Why did you mess up with the Demons?

156
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,800
If you don’t
practice martial arts carefully,

157
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,590
you will regret!

158
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,200
Didn’t Aunt say so?

159
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Didn’t I say so?

160
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,470
You have good luck today.

161
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,200
But can you have good luck every day?

162
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,910
Can you have good luck all your life?

163

Li Sheng.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,910
Yan suffered quite a lot.

165
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,470
Stop complaining about her.

166
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
Yeah.

167
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah.

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,150
She saved our sect.

169
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,120
She isn’t that weak.

170
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,470

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,240
My sister always makes trouble.

173
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,710
Sorry to have bothered you.

174
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
It... It doesn’t matter.

175
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,640
Oh,

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,830
what about the medicine

177
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,590
you looked for Fei?

178
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,120
Here.

179
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,350
This is precious.

180
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,880
We must give it to Fei right away.

181
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,440
Hyah!

182
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,950
Hyah!

183
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,390
Hyah!

184
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,800
A timely arrival is better
than an early one.

185
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,270
You’re all here.

186
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,150
Chuchu.

187
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,910
Take Yan to find Fei.

188
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,080
We’ll stop him.

189
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,030
Okay.

190
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,150
Yan, let’s go.

191
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,950
Wanna run away?

192
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,830
Don’t run after them.

193
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,830
They’re not who Lord wants.

194
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,350
Don’t waste our time.

195
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,910
Li Sheng.

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,120
I know you have the Flaming Sage.

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
Give it to me.

198
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,080
Give it to me!

199
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
Shoot it.

200
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,800
Take them down.

201
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,680
Yan, we have to count on you.

202
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,030
Chuchu, I can just do poses.

203
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,150
You should have told me earlier.

204
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,390
What do we do, then?

205
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,760
Do you think we can convince them?

206
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,950
Let me do it.

207
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,080
Hold your breath.

208
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,560
Hurry!

209
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,560
Yan.

210
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,910
Chuchu.

211
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,270
What powder did you use?

212
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,030
It wasn’t powder, but flour.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Go!

214
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,510
Li Sheng.

215
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Did you send the signal

216
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,320
because you knew
I was just on my way to the south?

217
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,080
I didn’t!

218
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,950
I didn’t know you could come so quickly.

219
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,910
Where is the Flaming Sage?

220
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,760
Where are Li Yan and Chuchu?

221
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,910
They left before us.

222
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,880
Chuchu, I’m too tired to run.

223
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,080
Hold your breath.

224
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,350
This is true powder.

225
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,880
Are you using the same trick

226
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,270
to sprinkle some flour?

227
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,880
Do you think
we’ll fall into the trick again?

228
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,680
Go!

229
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,270
Go!

230
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,200
Chuchu.

231
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,710
What was that?

232
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,560
The sleeping drug your brother gave me.

233
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,760
So,

234
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,120
you’re Zhou Fei,
the heiress of the South Blade

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,470
my Lord mentioned?

236
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,830
Lord Tong.

237
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,510
Long time no see.

238
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,350
You still look strong.

239
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,080
Why are you greeting each other?

240
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,350
We should, of course.

241
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,120
Lord Tong and I are destined to meet.

242
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,830
We’re also old acquaintances.

243
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,240
When I was little,

244
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,470
he tried to snatch the Bracelet from me
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

245
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,390
I poked one of his eyes.

246
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,030
Lord Tong.

247
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,270
For the sake of our acquaintance,

248
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,390
please turn a blind eye

249
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,640
if my cousin has offended you.

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,240
I’ll pay you with the other eye.

251
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,030
Very well.

252
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,640
Chuchu and Li Yan may be in danger.

253
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,270
Go help them.

254
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,470
I’ll hold him back.

255
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,950
No way.

256
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,560
He can turn a blind eye,

257
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,200
but I can’t!

258
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
He’s my enemy!

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,470
So,

260
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
he’s your cousin?

261
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,880
Go.

262
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,150
Can you handle him alone?

263
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,680
He’s a mere Demon.

264
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,030
Just go.

265
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
Lord Tong, the other day,

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,510
Lord Lu tried to snatch
a Fire Lotus from me.

267
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,390
Now you want
to snatch the Flaming Sage from me.

268
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,150
Why do you people

269
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,830
always want medicinal materials?

270
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,830
Shame on you.

271
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,390
Does Lord Shen want to run a pharmacy?

272
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,880
How arrogant you sound!

273
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,680
My Lord wants

274
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,270
to exchange the Flaming Sage

275
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,760
for the Seal of Cautiousness!

276
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,270
You’re not too stupid.

277
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,760
Unfortunately, I don’t have the Seal.

278
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,910
You can’t get it even if you kill me.

279
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,080
Not to mention you can’t kill me.

280
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Think about it carefully.

281
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,390
Lord, Mr. Shen received a secret letter.

282
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,760
Phoenix Master had
the Seal of Cautiousness.

283
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,910
Very well.

284
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,390
You have good luck today.

285
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,150
Let’s go!

286
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,510
I’m too busy to kill you today.

287
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,150
It’s your luck.

288
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,060
<i>Demons Manor</i>

289
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,680
Since when was my sister so strong?

290
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,200
Sheng? Bonehead.

291
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,150
Are you alright?

292
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,080
We are fine.

293
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
Fei came to handle those guys.

294
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,000
But you...

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,830
Since when were you so strong?

296
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,200
You defeated so many Demons.

297
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,270
I didn’t defeat them.

298
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,760
Chuchu did.

299
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,640
Don’t look at me.

300
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,440
I don’t have martial arts.

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,880
I just used the sleeping drug
you gave me.

302
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,510
Are you idiots?

303
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,470
So,

304
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,880
Zhou Fei gave Phoenix Master
the Seal of Cautiousness?

305
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,950
Yes.

306
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,680
Who?

307
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,510
My Lord.

308
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,030
People with Xingnan Sect are coming.

309
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,320
Very good.

310
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,470
They’re just in time.

311
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,590
Young Master.

312
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,910
In my opinion,

313
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,470
we shouldn’t interfere

314
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,080
with strangers.

315
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
Miss Zhou isn’t a stranger.

316
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,440
She saved us.

317
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,150
Do you want my brother

318
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,240
to be ungrateful?

319
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,640
Young Master.

320
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,560
We’re a small sect.

321
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,880
After we annoyed the Demons

322
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,000
and Qinghui, the Immortal
with Four-guardian Mountain,

323
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,880
I’m afraid there’ll be constant trouble.

324
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,270
It’s okay, Mr. Lin.

325
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,030
We’ll just leave Lingling overnight.

326
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,950
Did I allow you to leave?

327
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,830
Kill them!

328
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,440
Sir, you...

329
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It’s okay.

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
Let’s go to Liu’s Manor.

331
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
Aye!

332
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,640
Ying!

333
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,120
Ying!

334
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,870
Last night, I heard

335
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,910
someone was fighting against the Demons
in the suburb.

336
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,110
I didn’t know it could be you.

337
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,800
Do you want to take revenge?

338
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,440
Then you must be strong.

339
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,720
I can help you with that.

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,480
Take it.

341
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,680
Wait.

342
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,080
After you swallow it,

343
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,750
put it on.

344
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,360
When will your lord come?

345
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,870
Please wait a moment.

346
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,750
Mr. Li.

347
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
I’m terribly sorry

348
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,080
to have kept you waiting.

349
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
Where’s your lord?

350
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,680
I’ve been so busy in the forecourt
the whole morning

351
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,890
that I didn’t know he was sick.

352
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,560
Sick?

353
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,910
How was he sick?

354
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,270
He caught a cold, I guess.

355
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,080
Since we’ve come,

356
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,390
I’ll go check on him.

357
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,270
No, no, no.

358
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,720
He’s nearly fine.

359
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,270
You don’t need to go.

360
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,360
He said

361
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,600
when he got better,

362
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
he would visit you personally.

363
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,320
I don’t think he’s sick.

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
He’s just scared of Qinghui, I guess.

365
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,560
He’s getting old.

366
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,680
He just wants as much peace

367
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,030
as he can have.

368
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,360
So, Mr. Li,

369
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,870
please leave

370
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,800
and ask someone else for help.

371
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,390
Mr. Chen.

372
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,320

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,560

374
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,440
Inside the cave.

375
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,080
Go check on him.

376
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,680

When you just seize the rock
on the cliff,

499

you must struggle up again.

500

501

But it just fits you.

679
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,950
Girl.

680
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,230
I’ve named it Rosy Cloud.

681
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,640
What do you think?

682
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,430
What are you laughing at?

683
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,800
I’m laughing

684
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,160
because it’s such a good name.

685
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Sounds glorified.

686
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Do you want it?

687
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,990
If you don’t, give it back to me.

688
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,670
I want it. It’s your gift for me.

689
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,430
-You girl...
-Thank you.

690
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,230
<i>Liang’s Mansion</i>
We’re terribly sorry.

691
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,560
Our chief isn’t in lately.

692
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,800
Where...? Where has he gone?

693
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,120
We’re not sure.

694
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,510
In a few days,

695
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,560
it will be the birthday
of Lord Liu’s mother.

696
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,470
Did he invite you?

697
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,710
He did. But I’m not going.

698
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,160
<i>Tea</i>
When Lord Liu invited you,

699
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,670
it was your great honor.

700
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,880
You don’t understand.

701
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,190
A friend of mine works at Liu’s Manor.

702
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,800
He told me

703
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,990
Qinghui asked Lord Liu for money

704
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,560
the other day.

705
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
Unexpectedly,

706
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,950
Lord Liu didn’t respect him at all.

707
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,670
I’m afraid

708
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,710
if we meet Qinghui that day,

709
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,560
we’ll suffer.

710
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,600
You’re right.

711
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,030
<i>Lord Liu</i>
Mr. Liu.

712
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,190
I asked nearby martial artists.

713
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,670
No one wants to help us

714
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,880
deal with Qinghui,

715
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,510
We have few men.

716
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,400
I’m afraid we can’t kill him.

717
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,880
Since we’ve decided to kill him,

718
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,710
we must do it,

719
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,840
no matter how many men we have.

720
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,990
Look at the martial world.

721
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,320
Huo’s Manor is ruined.

722
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,030
Yin Wenlan is dead.

723
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,510
Qi School has disappeared.

724
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,840
Even people
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

725
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,230
are busy fighting against the Demons!

726
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,640
If we can’t unite as one,

727
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,400
how can we kill Qinghui?

728
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,430
A lot of people are enemies of Qinghui!

729
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,270
As long as we unite,

730
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,990
we will kill him.

731
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,640
Good point!

732
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,840
Master.

733
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,190
A Mr. Li asked to see you out there.

734
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,470
He said he was Li Sheng
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

735
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,750
Li Sheng?

736
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,080
Grandson of Li Zheng?

737
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,800
I’m Li Sheng
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

738
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,920
Greetings, everyone.

739
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,600
Mr. Li, what brings you here?

740
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,750
I come here,

741
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,640
for Qinghui.

742
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,600
Qinghui?

743
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,030
Lord Liu, you must know

744
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,400
what Qinghui has done.

745
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,710
The longer he lives,

746
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,080
the more people will suffer.

747
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,880
I want to unite everyone

748
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,030
to kill him once for all.

749
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,600
What’s your plan, Mr. Li?

750
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,400
I’ve got a plan.

751
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,560
To be honest, we do want to kill him.

752
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,270
But we’re worried

753
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,360
if we have enough men.

754
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,670
I’ve travelled around, asking for help.

755
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,800
I didn’t get as much support
as I expected.

756
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,510
But still a lot of martial masters
are willing to help.

757
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,510
Today, I come to you.

758
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,560
If we can cooperate,

759
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,670
we’ll stand a big chance.

760
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,640
I’d like to set a trap in a few days.

761
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,670
As for the place...

762
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,640
Your yard looks good.

763
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,560
As long as we can kill Qinghui,

764
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,710
I won’t care for a mere yard!

765
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,800
Good!

766
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,160
Fei didn’t come?

767
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,030
Miss Zhou Fei arrived yesterday.

768
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,840
She was wandering around this morning.

769
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,030
I don’t know

770
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,270
where she is now.

771
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,950
I had thought she wouldn’t stay

772
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,360
and I would miss her
when I went for the herbs.

773
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,990
She probably knows

774
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,840
Xie Yun is getting weaker and weaker

775
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,880
and she won’t see him for many times.

776
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,230
She’s stayed for a few more days.

777
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,270
I put the thing she brought

778
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,600
on your bedside.

779
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,130
It’s the Flaming Sage.

780
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,580
She must have suffered a lot

781
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,160
to collect these things.

782
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,880
You’re lucky enough.

783
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,150
I’ll let you go

784
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,920
to pray for Xie Yun.

785
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,990
I feel he’s waking up.

786
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,470
How long has he been asleep?

787
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,320
It’s about time.

788
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,920
Yeah. Yeah.

789
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,430
Anzhi, you’re awake?

790
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,670
Junior Master.

791
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,800
Come on.

792
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,320
Be careful. Slow down.

793
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,560
Get up slowly.

794
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,560
Anzhi, I guess you’re waking up.

795
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,990
Master.

796
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,080
Come on. Take the decoction.

797
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,430
Oh,

798
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,800
how long were I asleep?

799
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,320
Not very long.

800
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,560
Where’s Fei?

801
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,510
You really are a couple.

802
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,400
No wonder you like each other.

803
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,470
When you woke up, she fell asleep.

804
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,080
She’s next door.

805
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,230
Come on. Take it when it’s hot.

806
00:45:34,354 --> 00:45:44,354
