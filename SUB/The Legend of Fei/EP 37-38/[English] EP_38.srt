<i>Legend of Fei</i>

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,940
<i>Episode 38</i>

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,140
<i>Wang</i>

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,870
This is your face print.

20
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,830
Miss Zhou Fei is a handful.

21
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,870
A naughty troublemaker.

22
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,870
<i>Wang</i>
Other things aside,

23
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,590
she wrote “Wang” on your forehead

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,440
and mustaches on two sides
like the character “Ba”.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,400
Together, she’s calling you a turtle.

26
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,950
You’re right.

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,400
I’ll let her know what you say about her

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,080
once she wakes up.

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,360
You’ve taken

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,230
the Three-kind Decoction.

31
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,240
There’s nothing else I can do.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,210
What do you mean, Tongming?

33
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,630
He means

34
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,390
I’ll soon bite the dust.

35
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,600
Be careful.

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
Slowly.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,520
After your last treatment,

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,830
I could barely walk.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,630
Now, I feel much better.

40
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,800
The Three-kind Decoction

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,430
can stimulate your remaining energy

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,760
to keep you from dying silently.

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,270
But they can’t cure you.

44
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,240
Each time your life is prolonged,

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,320
your energy reduces.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,270
After taking the three herbs,

47
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,910
without the antidote...

48
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,070
That’s it?

49
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,550
Is there anything else we can do?

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,910
Bone-chilling is suppressed
by his energy,

51
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,400
but I can’t stop him

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,350
from weakening.

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,990
There’s only so much I can do.

54
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,120
I checked all the medical books

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,800
and came up with such an expedient.

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,990
Master Chen,

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,430
our fate is predestined.

58
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,710
Few could be as energetic

59
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,070
as me

60
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,400
with Bone-chilling.

61
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,120
I’ve been brought back
to life three times.

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,710
That’s unprecedented.

63
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,470
I’m more than content.

64
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,960
How could you?

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,880
You haven’t got married.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,760
Neither have you.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
I... I...

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,070
At least, she’s accepted
my token of love.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,990
I have an idea.

70
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,990
Why don’t you get a cat

71
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,630
to keep you company?

72
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,990
What... what are you talking about?

73
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,630
-You punk! How dare you!
-Master.

74
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,840
I’m done wasting my time on you.

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,190
Where are you going?

76
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,800
Master,

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,350
I want to go out

78
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,030
with Fei.

79
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,030
Are you

80
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,190
sick of us around?

81
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,520
Master, you took me in.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,030
I’d never be sick of you.

83
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,520
Take good care of yourself.

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,620
By the way,

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,030
where’s the blade I made years back?

86
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,860
Already melted,

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,010
without getting sharpened.

88
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,440
Chen said it was poorly made

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,350
and would only be an embarrassment.

90
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,190
I see.

91
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,800
I’ll ask him to teach me

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,190
to make a new one.

93
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,410
You’re free to leave.

94
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,070
And Zhou Fei...

95
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,120
No need to tell her.

96
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,870
What will come will come.

97
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,470
Rushing her is of no use.

98
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,910
Once I can’t hold it any longer,

99
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,000
you can tell her to bid me farewell.

100
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,460
<i>Take a guess.</i>

101
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,870
You made me a turtle.

102
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,560
It’s payback time!

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,150
Your Majesty.

104
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
General Wen.

105
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,470
Long time no see.

106
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,120
My respects to you, Your Majesty.

107
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
Stop. Don’t call me that.
I don’t deserve it.

108
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,350
What makes you say that?

109
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,120
The coming battle is life and death.

110
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
We need your command.

111
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,590
You’ve been out for so long.

112
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,560
It’s time to go back with me.

113
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,240
Go back to do what?

114
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,150
Lead the troops to fight.

115
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,780
It’s a significant battle.

116
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,640
So what if we win?

117
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,150
They don’t care

118
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,440
who sits on that chair.

119
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Victory costs lives.

120
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,350
Whatever the result is,

121
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,200
people will suffer.

122
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,880
So long.

123
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,610
Your Majesty...

124
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,270
General Wen,

125
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,030
that’s no longer who I am.

126
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,380
I’m not Xiao Chuan anymore.

127
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,910
Call me Xie Yun.

128
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,760
Are you alright?

129
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
Thank you.

130
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,080
What’s going on?

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,910
The war zone is right ahead.

132
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,950
Soon, this place will be occupied, too.

133
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,680
How come there’s no sign of it?

134
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,710
To buy us time to leave,

135
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,390
General Wang

136
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,270
has got himself besieged.

137
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,120
Once this place falls to the enemies,

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
the war will spread here.

139
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,200
General Wang.

140
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,830
You mean Wang Lin of the Anping Army?

141
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,560
Yes.

142
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,800
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

143
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,680
Your Majesty.

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Who is it?

145
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,030
<i>Wang Lin Anping Army</i>
You may leave.

146
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,270
Yes.

147
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,150
Your Majesty.

148
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,270
Your Majesty.

149
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,640
General Wang.

150
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,030
Call me Xie Yun.

151
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
It’s dangerous outside.

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,030
Why are you here?

153
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,320
I happened to pass by

154
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,760
and was told

155
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,560
you’re cornered.

156
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,350
So here I am.

157
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,680
Are your skills...?

158
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,200
All gone

159
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
except for the Footwork.

160
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
I can still

161
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,270
get one person out.

162
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,320
I appreciate that,

163
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,470
but I can’t

164
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,760
leave all my men behind

165
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,240
in face of the battle.

166
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I can’t do that.

167
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,140
General Wang,

168
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,320
I understand you care about them,

169
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,760
but there are people outside

170
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,270
waiting for you.

171
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,800
You don’t trust my skill?

172
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
Don’t worry.

173
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,030
I wouldn’t be here

174
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,880
if I weren’t sure enough.

175
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,560
I’ve never doubted you.

176
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,800
But

177
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,760
I’ve made

178
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,680
my decision

179
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,710
regarding the coming battle.

180
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,200
Let me show you something.

181
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,880
I hope that’ll help you

182
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,270
understand me.

183

<i>Gravestone</i>

185
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,910
<i>Gravestone</i>
It’s a tough battle.

186
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
We’ve lost too many lives.

General Wang,

190
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,470
you’ve prepared one for yourself?

191
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,150
Yes.

192
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,830
My mistake

193
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,800
led to our difficulty.

194
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,080
Men should die on the battlefield

195
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,080
and fight to the end.

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,590
General Wang,

197
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,080
is it worth it?

198
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,240
Must you go this far?

199
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,470
Why is it not?

200
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,680
I promised your father

201
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,640
to guard his state.

202
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,000
<i>Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave</i>
This is to honor my promise

203
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,440
even at the cost of my life.

204
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,830
My wish will be fulfilled

205
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,560
without any regrets.

206
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,320
There’s one last problem

207
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
that’s been troubling me,

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,880
but you’re

209
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,830
just the solution I need.

210
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,350
Don’t get me wrong.

211
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,950
I’m not burdening you with anything.

212
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,440
I hope you can bring this badge

213
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,390
to Zhou Yitang

214
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,830
to command the Anping Army.

215

<i>Peace and Prosperity</i>

216
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,590
I heard he’s been living in seclusion

217
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,270
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

218
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,150
and he’s seldom come out.

219
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
You want him to leave there to...

220
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,710
No worries.

221
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,640
Just give him the badge

222
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,870
and play the Song of Anping.

223
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,000
But remember,

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,560
do not alert

225
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
Leader Li Jinrong,

226
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,030
or mention my name.

227
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,750
Feud can’t be forgotten.

228
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,060
I don’t want to get you
in unnecessary trouble.

229
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,860
<i>Graves of the Loyal</i>

230
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
General Wang...

231
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,950
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

232
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,000
You can move again in one hour.

233
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,680
I’ll be on the battlefield then.

234
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,590
Don’t forget about your task.

235
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,540
Farewell, Your Majesty.

236
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,320
Rebels destroyed the state.

237
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
The capital was lost.

238
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,150
Mountains collapsed

239
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,980
in the national crisis.

240
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,630
Seasons changed

241
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,570
amid homesickness.

242
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,230
All that

243
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,240
is probably fate.

244
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,450
Now, I’m all alone

245
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
living on borrowed time

246
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,970
with nothing but bones to leave behind.

247
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,550
Anzhi.

248
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,080
How do you feel today?

249
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,200
Much better.

250
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,560
You don’t seem so.

251
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,720
No big deal.

252
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,960
Even life and death

253
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,670
aren’t that important to me.

254
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,080
Anzhi,

255
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,290
do you have...

256
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,580
Do you have no resentment at all?

257
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,910
Who doesn’t?

258
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,840
Everyone has it,

259
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
so no need to

260
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
make a fuss about it.

261
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,150
But you carry the royal bloodline.

262
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,630
Amitabha.

263
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,600
Abbot,

264
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,870
what do you mean?

265
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,110
Not all the founders of dynasties

266
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,390
rose from the nobility.

267
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,750
We only claim

268
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,200
we’re the chosen ones

269
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,480
to fool the ignorant.

270
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,840
What’s this?

271
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,720
Some light reading.

272
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,440
It’s about someone dead

273
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
who comes back to life.

274
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,360
He wakes up

275
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,680
but finds himself

276
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,750
not in the grave built for him.

277
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,800
He’s confused,

278
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,030
so

279
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,150
he crawls out

280
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,840
to find it.

281
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,200
It’s called

282
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,800
Legend of Bones.

283
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,580
What do you think?

284
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,990
I’ll have it

285
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,150
send to

286
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,480
Madam Nichang’s troupe later.

287
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,270
Maybe,

288
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,870
it’ll become another epic play.

289
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,800
Anzhi,

290
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,440
you’re too intelligent.

291
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,840
Master Chen.

292
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,080
Master Chen,

293
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,360
I want to make a fine blade.

294
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,630
Like what?

295
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,840
What a fine one should be like?

296
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,030
Can you explain it to me

297
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,440
in plain words?

298
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,720
What do you think?

299
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,390
I think...

300
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, I think

301
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,030
good materials

302
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,910
and skills are necessary

303
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,910
to make a blade with a sharp edge

304
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,740
and a steady back.

305
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,680
It can go against the wind

306
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
but not too light to fly away with it.

307
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,910
And it must be durable as well.

308
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,320
That’s a fine blade to me.

309
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,440
If the owner

310
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,910
makes a name of himself with it,

311
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,630
it’ll become a masterpiece of all times.

312
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,680
What’s wrong?

313
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,960
You sound like a swordsmith

314
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,320
because you don’t use blades.

315
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,480
If Fei heard what you said,

316
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,800
she’d laugh at you.

317
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,630
I wouldn’t mind

318
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,110
because she’s the expert.

319
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,270
What do you say as a non-swordsmith?

320
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,600
Just tell me

321
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
what kind of blade you want.

322
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,730
I’ve been wondering

323
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,030
what being born at the wrong time means.

324
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,440
That’s a good question.

325
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,750
What is

326
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,270
your take on it?

327
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,750
If people are born

328
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,230
in peaceful times,

329
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,840
they can support themselves

330
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,800
and enjoy their lives.

331
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,990
But those in troubled times

332
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,480
don’t even have a roof over their heads.

333
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,720
Are they destined

334
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
to be inferior to those living in peace?

335
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,750
The sun

336
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,910
goes up and down.

337
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,720
The moon waxes and wanes.

338
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,840
People live and die.

339
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,230
Of course, there are good and bad times.

340
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,840
We can’t decide

341
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,320
our births.

342
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,480
Whoever born before the sunrise

343
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,080
must be the luckiest

344
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
because they can always

345
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,910
watch the day come to light.

346
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,440
Do you mean Fei?

347
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,560
No.

348
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,080
I mean myself.

349
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,960
Master Chen,

350
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,990
I’ve got an idea

351
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,360
for the name of my blade.

352
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,560
What is it?

353
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,960
Tell me.

354
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,030
Dim.

355
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,320
Dim?

356
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,630
Isn’t there an old saying

357
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,030
that the morning light is too dim?

358
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,510
The sun would soon rise

359
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,630
and drive away the darkness.

360
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,360
What’s there to complain about?

361
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,440
Don’t be too greedy.

362
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,560
The sutra chanted by Master says,

363
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,630
“all that exists on certain conditions

364
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,840
are as temporary

365
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,870
as dew and thunder.

366
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,200
That’s the way to look at this world”.

367
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,390
If I can follow such a way

368
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,080
and withstand changes in life,

369
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,200
won’t I be similar

370
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,930
to the morning dew?

371
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,050
That’s eternity in some way.

Leader Li of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight,

374
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,910
the son of the Mountain Sword,

375
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,360
the daughter of General Wu Fei

376
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,510
and Huo Liantao of Huo’s Manor.

377
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,750
Some are martial artists

378
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,890
while some are not.

379
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,550
Some are good

380
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,660
and some are bad.

381
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,870
But none of them knows

382
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,370
what the ripple pattern stands for.

383
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,260
Perhaps

384
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,990
those who buried
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

385
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,990
decided to end everything with them.

386
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,330
Or maybe

387
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,890
they intended to protect their children.

388
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,730
Anyway, that pattern is passed down,

389
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,570
but The Color of Ocean and Heaven
remains a mystery.

390
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,070
Master,

391
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,280
I’ve taken the third herb.

392
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,910
Do I have a few more months to live?

393
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,910
A year at most

394
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,360
without using your energy.

395
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,630
Otherwise...

396
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,870
Life and death are inseparable.

397
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,960
All roads lead to the inevitable

398
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,510
as we can only live 100 years tops.

399
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,390
Death is only a matter of time.

400
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,680
No need to bother ourselves with it.

401
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,510
I’m glad you can think like that.

402
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Master.

403
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,360
I’m thinking

404
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,050
to go out for a trip.

405
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,910
Is there something else
you’d like to do?

406
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,560
I haven’t got to

407
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,080
take Fei to Jiankang

408
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,870
to introduce my hometown to her.

409
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,690
It’s now

410
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,870
or never.

411
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,480
This isn’t like

412
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,270
any other trips before.

413
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,840
Do not

414
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,110
push yourself too hard.

415
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,870
I understand.

416
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,200
Weed Spirit.

417
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,080
Let’s go.

418
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,270
You’re back, Sheng.

419
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,110
I’m here. Isn’t that obvious?

420
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,200
Are you leaving again so soon?

421
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,270
I’m needed

422
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,800
for some business outside.

423
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,150
What business?

424
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,030
I heard

425
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,320
you’re taking others with you.

426
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,030
It’s about the secret service.

427
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,030
Nothing serious.

428
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
Fei has just left,
and you will leave, too.

429
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,200
No.

430
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,680
Let me go with you.

431
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,360
Look,

432
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,990
Fei is already out

433
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,270
and I’ll be leaving soon.

434
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,870
Someone needs to hold the fort.

435
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,840
You should stay

436
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
and watch the house.

437
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,510
It’s boring.

438
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,990
I’m not a watchdog, am I?

439
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,100
<i>Liu’s Manor Invitation</i>

440
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,750
What is this?

441
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,460
<i>Liu’s Manor Invitation</i>

442
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,720
Lord Liu of Liu’s Manor

443
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,150
is celebrating his mother’s birthday.

444
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,270
I’ll drop a visit to them.

445
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,600
No big deal.

446
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,910
Really?

447
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,750
Why are there so many invitations?

448
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,230
Is there also one for me?

449
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,030
Lord Liu

450
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,480
loves making friends.

451
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,840
All the invitations

452
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,480
are for our members.

453
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,030
They’ve already been taken.

454
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,480
Fine.

455
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,110
By the way,

456
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,320
how’s Chuchu been lately?

457
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,390
She’s been at home

458
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,630
studying martial arts manuals.

459
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,840
That’s even more boring.

460
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,750
Chuchu.

461
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,230
Madam.

462
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,510
I’ve read the manual

463
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,270
of the Xiaoxiang Sect you put together.

464
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,440
It’s well-organized.

465
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,990
I’ve also clarified

466
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,200
a few vague descriptions.

467
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,390
You can have another look.

468
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,840
Thank you.

469
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,870
I thought Yan

470
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,150
showed it to seniors
of the Xiaoxiang Sect.

471
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,960
I didn’t mean to trouble you.

472
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,630
We’re a family.

473
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,720
No trouble at all.

474
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,800
I’ve handed all my work

475
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,230
to the younger generation

476
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,870
and have more free time now.

477
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,600
I’m surprised

478
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,480
that a delicate

479
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,560
well-bred girl like you

480
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,030
would do such an amazing job

481
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,200
in compiling martial arts manuals.

482
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,630
I’m flattered.

483
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,560
Members of the Fortress
all have their duties.

484
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,480
I can read

485
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,200
and write,

486
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,800
and I’m interested in martial arts,

487
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,630
so I’m only trying to

488
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,840
put all I have into good use.

489
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,800
That’s too modest of you.

490
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,150
Organizing such manuals

491
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,990
requires profound knowledge,

492
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,360
persistence

493
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
and selfless dedication.

494
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,910
Few can be

495
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,600
a better fit than you

496
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,910
for the job.

497
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,510
Chuchu,

498
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,360
my father devoted himself
to the Snow-breaking Blade.

499
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,320
He only accomplished

500
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,440
Edgeless out of the three moves

501
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,630
and failed to master the nine skills,

502
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,800
so he didn’t leave any manuals behind.

503
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,390
I was with him all the time

504
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,150
and picked up a few things.

505
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,910
I want you

506
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,630
to sort them out.

507
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,110
Can I?

508
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,600
You won’t be disappointed.

509
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,630
I’ll do my best

510
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,630
and get it done soon.

511
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,030
But

512
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,110
it may take a while before I can begin

513
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,870
as I have an appointment with Lord Liu

514
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,360
to consult him

515
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,080
about certain skills
on the Double Ninth Festival.

516
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,720
Go ahead. No problem.

517
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,840
As long as you don’t pick a fight,

518
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,870
skills you’ve learned

519
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,870
are enough to protect yourself.

520
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,360
Just be careful.

521
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,440
I will.

522
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,800
Thank you.

523
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,910
I’m leaving.

524
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,600
Sheng.

525
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,510
Aunt.

526
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,810
What are you doing here?

527
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,150
To go to the library.

528
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
For books or the person there?

529
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,030
Sheng,

530
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,960
Miss Wu’s father was a warrior.

531
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,030
After he left, she stays with us alone

532
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,910
but she’s tough

533
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,480
and strong.

534
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,360
If you like her,

535
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,630
don’t ever hurt her, understand?

536
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,440
You have my word.

537
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,030
I’ll always cherish her

538
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,230
and won’t bring shame on our Fortress.

539
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,990
Come with me.

540
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,360
We need to talk.

541
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:15,270
<i>Virtuous and Noble</i>

542
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,360
Sheng,

543
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,870
are you sure about this?

544
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,870
Aunt,

545
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,870
Yin Pei has caused too much damage,

546
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,510
including the death
of Taoist Priest Chongxiao.

547
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,630
I cannot

548
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,560
let him go for what it’s worth.

549
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,990
Yin Pei

550
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,230
is a strong rival.

551
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,360
Be extra careful.

552
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,080
I will.

553
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,750
I’ve taken your advice

554
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,840
and arranged everything.

555
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,560
And

556
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,110
Madam Nichang
and the others will help me.

557
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,440
Everything will be fine.

558
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,270
Eliminating him

559
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,390
is the right thing to do.

560
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,840
Have you seen Fei?

561
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,750
Not recently.

562
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,800
She’s probably in Penglai

563
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,320
with Xie Yun.

564
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,200
You kids are old enough

565
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,230
to leave the nest.

566
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,640
Chuchu.

567
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,640
You startled me.

568
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,510
Chuchu,

569
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,990
do you know

570
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,930
Sheng’s leaving?

571
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
Why?

572
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,670
He seems to be invited to some banquet.

573
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,320
And he won’t take me with him.

574
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,840
The host is Lord Liu of Liu’s Manor.

575
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,190
Lord Liu?

576
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,360
The one of Mount Tai Sect?

577
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,750
How do you know?

578
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,230
I’m going to consult him
about martial arts.

579
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,400
Hey,

580
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,230
is Sheng really going to his manor?

581
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,070
Yes. Why?

582
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,770
Nothing.

583
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,360
<i>Jiankang</i>

584
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,780

Hurry. There’s a long away ahead of us.

585
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,060
<i>Jiankang</i>

586
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,270
I assumed

587
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,470
as long as I didn’t come back,

588
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,600
the past wouldn’t haunt me.

589
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,380
Yet here I am.

590
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,100
<i>Jiankang</i>

591
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,430
Jiankang

592
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,880
is colder than I remembered.

593
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,120
Do you feel warm this way?

594
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,120
Fei,

595
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,750
thank you.

596
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,080
Remember I once told you

597
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,470
Jiankang is home to

598
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,190
half of the delicacies in the state?

599
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,400
Of course.

600
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,990
As you ate the drugged bun,

601
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,750
you bragged

602
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,430
that you’d take me to
the best restaurant here.

603
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,030
Let’s go then.

604

605
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,540
Nice!

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,690
Wonderful!

607
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,430
So beautiful!

608
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,360
See that small shop?

609
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,260
Which one?

610
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,580
<i>Sky Lanterns Shop</i>

611
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,510
The name sky lantern

612
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,030
comes with a story.

613
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,670
Decades ago,

614
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,320
a rich young man

615
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,710
bought thousands of sky lanterns

616
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,320
to please a beauty.

617
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,270
They lit up the sky

618
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,080
over the Huai River
for seven days and nights.

619
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,710
In the end,

620
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,430
his effort paid off

621
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,230
and they lived happily ever after.

622
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,560
Later generations

623
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,190
only sold lanterns here

624
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,560
in memory of

625
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,950
<i>Sky Lanterns Shop</i>
their fairy-tale love.

626
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,600
How come your beauty has grown with age

627
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,710
but not your feelings?

628
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,880
I’m not beautiful

629
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,840
and I don’t need such feelings.

630
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,030
Before hearing your story,

631
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,920
I thought

632
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,030
that was our secret service.

633
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,690
Someone used to mistake

634
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,360
a pharmacy for a snack shop.

635
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,270
I assumed people of your Fortress

636
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,230
eat herbs as snacks.

637
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,880
Eat my fist!

638
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,840
No.

639
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,270
-Thanks.
-Have a nice day.

You two make a perfect couple.

to be used at your wedding. This way.

646
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,880
No, no, no.

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,920
We aren’t a couple.

I’m so sorry.

My bad.

657

How could I not recognize

the heiress to our Fortress?

659
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,670
It’s wildly spread

660
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,710
that the heiress to the South Blade

661
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,710
had wiped out Demons and restored peace.

662

You’re invincible.

Why are you laughing?

666
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,540
Stop it.

667
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,840
That’s an exaggeration.

668
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
You’re flattering me.

669
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
And this is...

Well...

674
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,160
Don’t worry about us.

675
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,030
We can look around on our own.

What is this lantern?

679
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,190
It looks special.

It’s for the Double Seventh Festival.

I’ll take this token of love.

Aren’t you going to

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,710
take me to your favorite restaurant?

692
