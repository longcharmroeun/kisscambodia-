<i>Episode 31</i>

18
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,630
You’re foul-mouthed.

19
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,870
I can’t wait to teach you a lesson,

20
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,040
bastard!

21
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,950
I’ll get them out

22
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,870
and be right back.

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,040
Sure.

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,910
Follow me.

25
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,400
Let’s go.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,950
You’re dead!

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,800
Phoenix!

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
You think you can get away

29
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,080
just like that?

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,910
I... I’ve

31
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,080
explained everything

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,600
already.

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,320
All that is true.

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,110
Do you mean how unthankful

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,720
and ungrateful you are?

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,910
Were my brother still alive,

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,030
you... you’d be showing him disrespect.

38
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,630
Shut your pie hole!

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,910
Huo Liantao,

40
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,520
who are you

41
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,110
to lecture me?

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,270
Listen,

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,000
I can’t care less

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
about respect,

45
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,240
let alone your brother is already dead.

46
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,190
Were he not,

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,440
and standing right before me,

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,470
he couldn’t stop me

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,550
from killing you!

50
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,670
You...

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,190
Phoenix,

52
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,160
I’ve finished him for you.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,110
You’re welcome.

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,520
Just give me the Seal.

55
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,470
Phoenix,

56
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,830
I heard there’s a quick guide

57
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,550
to the 100 Destructive Palms

58
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,030
but the side effect is
the older you get,

59
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,270
the weaker you become.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,640
Better take care of yourself.

61
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,320
I don’t owe you

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,830
or Old Master Huo

63
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,720
anything.

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,510
Why risk your life?

65
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,790
You castrated dog!

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,000
That Seal belongs to the Huo family.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will get it back.

68
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,200
Report!

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,670
Lord Chu,

70
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,390
someone helped The Third Prince escape.

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,000
I wonder

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,390
who is it

73
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,040
that got him out of my hand.

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
The Third Prince called him

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,550
Xie Yun.

76
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,790
Xie Yun?

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,640
It’s you, little prince.

78
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,950
Who’d know

79
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,720
I’d run into an old acquaintance’s son?

80
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,600
Help!

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,390
Your Highness. Your Highness.

82
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,110
-Go!
-Leave now!

83
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,640
Stop there!

84
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,390
Don’t!

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,110
Let him go.

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,110
Protect His Highness first.

87
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,000
Let’s go.

88
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,550
Thanks, Miss.

89
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,720
Xie Yun.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Didn’t I ask you to leave?

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,110
Why are you back?

92
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,670
We got lost in the woods

93
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,880
and circled back

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,760
somehow.

95
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,110
Listen.

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,270
Follow the servants

97
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,510
in the Huos’ uniforms.

98
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,000
Just go with them.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,110
I can’t.

100
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
This place is dangerous.

101
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,160
I can’t leave you two behind.

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,350
Your Highness,

103
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,270
never put yourself in danger.

104
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,760
Haven’t you learned enough lessons?

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,000
No.

106
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,600
What should we do now?

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,790
There’s no time to think.

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,510
It’s too dangerous for him to be alone.

109
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,880
Let’s escort him out first.

110
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,550
Sure.

111
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,920
Huo Liantao’s manor

112
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
is as odd as can be.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,510
Better get out of here first.

114
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,140
<i>Huo’s Manor</i>

115
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,510
Where’s Ding Kui?

116
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,270
He’s inside.

117
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,830
We’ve got company.

118
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,790
You’re such a jinx

119
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,390
as your name Meimei suggests.

120
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,510
We’re like

121
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,390
crow bait now.

122
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,790
You’re right.

123
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,070
I hate to say this,

124
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,920
but what a small world!

125
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,550
What do you mean?

126
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,390
-You...
-I know.

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,390
I shouldn’t fight

128
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,600
or use my energy.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
But Fei,

130
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,880
there are things

131
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,040
we must do

132
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,950
ourselves.

133
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,720
But... but there’s no key.

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,510
I know what to do.

135
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,880
Little prince,

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,000
what are you two whispering about?

137
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,150
You’re lucky

138
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,350
to have lived so long

139
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,110
with Bone-chilling in your system.

140
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Look at you two lovebirds.

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,640
You don’t want to die, do you?

142
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,440
I’m sure you know

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,400
only one of us

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,590
can survive by the end of the day.

145
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,880
That’s bold.

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,030
Xie Yun.

147
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,710
Your Highness!

148
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,760
Your Highness!

149
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,670
Little prince,

150
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,520
no,

151
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,880
Your Highness,

152
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,080
the Chens

153
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,670
dethroned the Xiaos,

154
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,200
yet here you’re
serving your enemy’s son.

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
How stupid you are!

156
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
What about you?

157
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,030
You betrayed my father,

158
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,590
killed my uncle

159
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,880
and defected to the enemy.

160
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,880
How has Demons Manor

161
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,080
treated you?

162
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Eunuch Chu, since you’ve recognized me,

163
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,880
it’s time

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
for us

165
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
to settle the score once and for all.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Bring it on!

167
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,470
The legendary Cloud-impelling Palm

168
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,080
is nothing

169
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,760
but a useless skill to me.

170
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,080
Your master

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,350
only made you weak and soft.

172
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,840
What now?

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,640
You think your soft skill

174
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,470
and borrowed energy

175
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,400
can beat me?

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,320
Your Highness!

177
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Calm down.

178
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,230
Fei!

179
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,960
Your turn.

180
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
Not bad!

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,670
Interesting!

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,440
Who are you?

183
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
What’s your name?

184
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,280
A nobody

185
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,320
not worth mentioning.

186
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,550
It’s open!

187
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,030
Yes.

188
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,640
Found it.

189
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,960
Miss Zhou, look.

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Why are you still here?

191
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
Go!

192
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,840
Zichen,

193
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,710
give me your weapon.

194
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,200
Your Highness!

195
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,880
Go back and study hard.

196
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,590
Don’t waste time on other things.

197
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,550
Xie Yun.

198
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,320
Go!

199
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,910
-Get him out of here.
-Let’s go!

200
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,760
No.

201
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,590
-Come!
-Xie Yun!

202
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,470
-Xie Yun!
-Let’s go, Your Highness.

203
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,320
Let me go!

204
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,030
Miss Zhou!

205
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,350
-Young Master.
-Xie Yun!

206
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,280
Let’s go!

207
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,910
Come on, Young Master!

208
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,760
Look how selfless you are!

209
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,110
Why didn’t you leave

210
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,840
with that girl?

211
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,670
She wouldn’t

212
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,200
even if I asked her to.

213
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,230
If you’re

214
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,880
reluctant to leave,

215
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,520
then stay.

216
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,230
Alright.

217
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,230
I can spare some time

218
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,080
for you.

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,960
Your Highness!

220
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,030
Your Highness, don’t worry.

221
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,910
Miss Zhou

222
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,670
won’t let anything happen to Mr. Xie.

223
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,840
Is that

224
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,670
Miss Zhou, Zhou Fei?

225
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,030
Yes.

226
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,150
The way she wielded the blade

227
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,550
was indeed

228
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,110
unforgettable.

229
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Your Highness,

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,200
we should leave now.

231
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,350
Your Highness!

232
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,710
Let’s go.

233
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,400
Let’s go, Young Master.

234
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,530
Come.

235
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,320
I’ll kill you

236
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,200
at the cost of my life!

237
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
Eunuch Chu,

238
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,640
you’ll die here!

239
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,110
As soft as Cloud-impelling Palm seems,

240
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,080
it’s as powerful as I heard.

241
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,960
If we weren’t enemies,

242
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,640
this battle

243
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,320
would be the best

244
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,280
over the past 20 years.

245
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,880
Sadly,

246
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,320
you’re still poisoned.

247
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,710
You have

248
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,520
used your energy earlier

249
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,640
at the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

250
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,350
That poison

251
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,280
will only go deeper

252
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,230
and worsen your condition.

253
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,000
Soon,

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
your joints will freeze,

255
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
your veins will be blocked

256
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
and then...

257
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,200
All that is thanks to Hu Tianying.

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,910
Otherwise,

259
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,640
I would’ve been caught

260
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,200
at a disadvantage now.

261
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,030
How dare you provoke him!

262
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,030
You won’t

263
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,580
get out of here alive!

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,280
Who are you?

265
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,760
The sole heir to
the Big Medicine Valley,

266
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,640
Ying Hecong!

267
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,710
Hu Tianying betrayed us

268
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,230
and defected to Demons Manor.

269
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,430
Then you and Shen Tianshu
massacred all our members!

270
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,190
It’s payback time!

271
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,400
Thank you.

272
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Hadn’t you weakened him,

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,110
I wouldn’t have caught him off guard.

274
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,560
Ying Hecong, you...

275
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,820
Fei...

276
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,710
Xie Yun!

277
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
Don’t go.

278
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,000
The mist is poisonous.

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
That’s called Condensed Dew

280
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,040
from snakes.

281
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,880
It can vaporize

282
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,470
in the air

283
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,800
into colorless and odorless poison.

284
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,830
During your fight,

285
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,950
Eunuch Chu has inhaled a lot of it.

286
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,110
The more skilled one is,

287
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,430
the quicker he or she dies.

288
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,590
Eunuch Chu,

289
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,760
you’re as good as they say.

290
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,950
You...

291
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,820
<i>Seal of Cautiousness</i>

292
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,880
Xie Yun!

293
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,160
Mr. Li,

294
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,350
there you are.

295
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,040
Are you alright, Madam Nichang?

296
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
I’m fine.

297
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,920
Have you seen that pig Ding Kui?

298
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,230
He’s injured tons of our people.

299
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,760
Master meant to kill him,

300
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,800
but he managed

301
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,920
to escape.

302
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,950
I’m glad you’re here,

303
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,640
or we’ll probably get lost.

304
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,310
Enough. This place is dangerous.

305
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,760
Let’s get out of here first.

306
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,830
Let’s go.

307
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,520
Sheng,

308
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,070
you’re out.

309
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,430
Who’s that, brother?

310
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,590
He’s really something

311
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,400
that he clobbered Ding Kui alone.

312
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,560
Hadn’t I stopped that bonehead,

313
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
he would’ve challenged him.

314
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,470
You...

315
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,680
You think I’m that stupid?

316
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,020
All these years,

317
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,180
I’ve never heard of such a figure.

318
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,180
Where’s Zhou Fei?

319
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,500
Isn’t she inside?

320
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,340
I thought you had found her.

321
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,660
She wasn’t there.

322
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,340
Probably left to seize those Demons.

323
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,260
We’d better leave.

324
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,580
Let’s go back to the inn

325
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,380
and ask the Route Gang to look for her.

326
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,900
Xie Yun! Xie Yun!

327
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,550
You...

328
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,740
I’m fine.

329
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,180
Don’t worry.

330
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,270
Take this.

331
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,740
What is it?

332
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,980
The antidote to the Condensed Dew.

333
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
You must’ve inhaled some, too.

334
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,340
I know

335
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,500
it’s the unwritten rule

336
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,860
that however skilled

337
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,020
and noble one is,

338
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,700
that person shall be condemned

339
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,420
for poisoning others.

340
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,860
It’s been three years
since I made this poison.

341
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,540
This is the first time I’ve used it.

342
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,700
Hadn’t you

343
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,660
cornered him first,

344
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,460
he would’ve spotted me

345
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,780
the minute I entered the woods.

346
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,620
Thank you

347
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,780
for helping me get revenge.

348
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,900
I owe you two one.

349
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,620
Why is there just one?

350
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,060
You want more?

351
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,980
He...

352
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,820
He doesn’t need it.

353
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,700
Bone-chilling he has

354
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,340
is the most toxic poison.

355
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,980
Nothing else

356
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,340
can hurt him,

357
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,900
including my Condensed Dew.

358
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,100
He can drink it like liquor

359
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,860
if he wants

360
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,040
and nothing will happen.

361
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,050
Mr. Ying.

362
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,740
Please don’t sugarcoat the fact

363
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,660
of being poisoned

364
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,970
by Bone-chilling.

365
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,020
Well,

366
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,060
I’ve already told you

367
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,700
that his days are numbered.

368
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,780
Unblocking his veins

369
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,180
by force

370
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,900
has only injured him more.

371
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,020
There’s no cure.

372
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,300
My hands are tied.

373
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
You...

374
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,900
You said you owe us one, didn’t you?

375
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,580
How are you going to repay us?

376
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,420
I will,

377
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,940
of course.

378
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,900
But it has to be within my ability.

379
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,940
Removing his poison

380
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,220
is not.

381
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,820
Hey,

382
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,940
you have one last option.

383
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,140
There’s a temple

384
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,260
one kilometer away.

385
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,540
You can go there to pray to Buddha.

386
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,180
Maybe that will work.

387
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,180
Aren’t you the heir

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,180
Does he know

579
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,940
what he’s talking about?

580
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,540
What happened

581
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,980
between you and that man

582
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,940
is only a chapter in your life.

583
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,460
An accident.

584
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,940
He can’t be

585
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,500
what you’re here for.

586
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,720
At first,

587
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,780
I set out

588
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,020
to run an errand for my parents.

589
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,780
No.

590
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,060
As far as I know,

591
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,140
an errand is independent.

592
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,460
When it’s done, it’s done.

593
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,380
It’s not the beginning or the end.

594
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,580
You’re here

595
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,660
for something else.

596
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,340
No.

597
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,060
I’ve never gone out before.

598
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,940
I used to practice my skills

599
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,500
at home.

600
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,140
There’s no beginning or end.

601
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,780
Practice your skills at home?

602
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,340
And why

603
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,140
do you do that?

604
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,740
It’s my passion.

605
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,340
Your errand is done

606
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,700
and you’ve found no one,

607
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,740
shouldn’t you go back
to pursue your passion?

608
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,620
Why did you say

609
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,820
you don’t know where to go?

610
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,380
What do you

611
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,700
practice those skills for?

612
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,140
Why do I practice those skills?

613
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,940
At first,

614
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,700
that was to gain Mom’s recognition.

615
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,140
And then...

616
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,420
This is the first life

617
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,460
the Snow-breaking Blade took

618
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,340
since it reappeared.

619
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,580
Even if I’m the only one left,

620
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,340
I’ll escort you back

621
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,260
to the Fortress.

622
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,420
Right after coming out,

623
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,940
when she saw Demons
attacking Huo’s Manor

624
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,340
she beat them back

625
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,020
on her own,

626
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,820
killed Blessed Dog

627
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,740
and fought her way out

628
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,780
to Mount Heng.

629
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,140
There,

630
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,060
she lured Dragon Master out

631
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,610
and killed him.

632
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,900
To...

633
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,740
To honor my grandfather’s blade.

634
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,340
The Blades, Sword, Palm’s time

635
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,780
is over.

636
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,340
We, as their descendants,

637
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,820
could barely

638
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,820
protect ourselves

639
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,740
with their weapons.

640
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,940
How shameful that is!

641
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,580
It shouldn’t be

642
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,060
like that.

643
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,140
You’re from a prominent family.

644
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,340
I almost forgot

645
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,020
about things at home.

646
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,900
Huo Liantao is gone.

647
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,100
Those thugs like Ding Kui

648
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,690
would become even more unscrupulous.

649
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,900
I need to go back

650
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,280
and tell my mom everything.

651
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,740
And that Bracelet...

652
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Abbot,

653
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,740
could you put me

654
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,860
outside Lingling?

655
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,060
Go check in the cabin.

656
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,920
♪So lucky to get the wooden peach
from you♪

657
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,550
♪So does the hero braving the world♪

658
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,410
♪Petals fly in the dream♪

659
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,140
♪Like greeting the old friend♪

660
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:15,400
♪Keep the vow we made until death♪

661
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,110
♪However far to go♪

662
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,000
♪However high to reach♪

663
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:35,670
♪This moment is worth my forever love♪

664
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,140
Abbot,

665
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,220
can he be cured?

666
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,220
I’ve given him

667
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,260
acupuncture and medicine

668
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,500
to prolong his life.

669
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,540
As for how to remove Bone-chilling,

670
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,100
we’ve been working on it

671
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,280
since decades ago,

672
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,500
but to no avail

673
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,290
so far.

674
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,620
I knew the reappearance

675
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,140
of the Cloud-impelling Palm

676
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,740
was a bad sign.

677
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,260
So I came all the way

678
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,300
but

679
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,760
arrived late.

680
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,060
He seems to know Xie Yun.

681
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,260
Is he here especially for him?

682
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,850
Abbot,

683
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,700
may I ask your name?

684
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,500
Finally!

685
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,660
Think again.

686
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,880
What else have you forgotten?

687
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,660
I’m Tongming,

688
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,820
a nobody drifting from place to place.

689
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,820
I don’t think you’ve heard of me.

690
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,380
Tongming?

691
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,220
Never heard of it.

692
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,560
That little rascal inside

693
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,940
is my disciple.

694
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,140
That said,

695
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,700
unlike me,

696
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,520
he isn’t a monk

697
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,700
of any kind.

698
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,300
He did shave his head
when he was little,

699
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,620
but I knew he has burdens,

700
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,020
so I didn’t convert him to Buddhism.

701
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,620
Back then, nobody took him seriously.

702
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,300
He was bored

703
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,420
and returned to the secular world

704
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,300
a few years later.

705
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,140
Abbot,

706
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,060
now I see

707
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,180
why he’s

708
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,540
such a nagger.

709
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,820
Xie Yun once told me,

710
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,260
thanks to his uncle,

711
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,580
who transferred all his energy to him,

712
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,700
he didn’t die of Bone-chilling.

713
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,500
That was the only way

714
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,620
to stop it from spreading.

715
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,360
I gave him acupuncture
to suppress the poison.

716
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,020
I knew that was only

717
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,660
a temporary expedient.

718
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,740
And Anzhi was born

719
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,580
compassionate.

720
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,340
He wouldn’t turn a blind eye

721
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,500
to others’ suffering.

722
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,330
Anzhi?

723
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,500
That’s his courtesy name.

724
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,980
Didn’t he tell you about it?

725
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,540
He introduced himself as Xie Meimei.

726
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,940
When the mutiny broke out,

727
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,260
Anzhi was still in his infancy

728
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,860
and was taken out

729
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,460
by an old eunuch.

730
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,020
Then we found him on the way.

731
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,300
Master,

732
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,540
why can’t I be a monk?

733
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,180
You’re one

734
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,740
and so should I.

735
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,340
A monk

736
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,220
has to break free from his burdens.

737
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,380
Anzhi,

738
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,260
do you know what burden means?

739
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,500
If you ask me,

740
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,020
you’re too cowardly

741
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,660
to bear your burden.

742
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,700
Why should I?

743
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,140
I can’t choose who my father is.

744
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,180
If I could,

745
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,060
I wouldn’t be his son.

746
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,250
Whose son would you rather be instead?

747
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,780
A fisherman’s, a boatman’s, a porter’s

748
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,420
and so on.

749
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,980
Then I wouldn’t have to study

750
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,260
or practice martial arts.

751
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,620
When I grew up,

752
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,860
I could still make a living

753
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,180
by being a waiter or a carter.

754
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,140
The former could learn
all kinds of information

755
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,460
and the latter could explore the world.

756
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,100
Wouldn’t that be better?

757
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,940
Merciful Buddha.

758
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,780
Master,

759
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,540
am I wrong?

760
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,100
You’ve only seen

761
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,260
those kids on the beach
are living an easy life,

762
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,860
but you don’t know

763
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,940
that’ll only last for so long.

764
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,420
The rest of their lives

765
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,180
won’t be that easy.

766
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,500
Once they grow up,

767
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,740
they’ll start working
for their families.

768
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,660
They’ll have to carry goods

769
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,100
and punt boats day after day,

770
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,740
working from dawn to dusk

771
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,500
only to scrape by.

772
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,510
They can’t afford to rest or have fun.

773
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,940
Their families rely on them.

774
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,220
The burden is so heavy

775
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,500
that they can’t afford
to get sick or die.

776
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,340
The only choice is
to bow their heads and go on.

777
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,540
That’s in the good years.

778
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,780
In the bad ones,

779
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,540
the situation will be worse.

780
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,140
Only few can survive.

781
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Do you know

782
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,410
what are they thinking?

783
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,700
Merciful Buddha.

784
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,180
They’re thinking

785
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,540
why

786
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,380
I wasn’t born into a noble family.

787
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,140
The world is even crueler to girls.

788
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,500
When they are little,

789
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,540
they pray not to be sold.

790
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,140
When they’re married
into other families,

791
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,100
they beg for their mercy.

792
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,260
They can’t control their lives.

793
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,260
As humans,

794
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,900
they’re as helpless as farm animals.

795
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,220
Do you know what are they thinking?

796
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,660
Life and death

797
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,140
are inevitable.

798
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,140
Most people spend most of their lives

799
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,540
trying to change their fate.

800
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,000
But that’s not easy.

801
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,860
You think your life is bitter

802
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,020
because you haven’t seen the worst.

803
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,820
Master,

804
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,960
is there a kind of life
that’s not bitter?
