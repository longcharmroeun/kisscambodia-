<i>Episode 47</i>

18
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,380
Found it!

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,910
It’s planted there on purpose,

20
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,950
but I can’t move it.

21
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,630
There must be something else.

22
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,990
I believe

23
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,380
the plant here

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,630
is the “Catalpa branch” in the poem.

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,550
Could it

26
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,630
be the water?

27
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,460
Water?

28
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,830
Check it out.

29
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,190
Let me try again.

30
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,220
It’s moving!

31
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,020
Lu Tiankuang,

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,350
Lord Shen assigned you

33
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,940
to assist me.

34
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,100
Don’t cross the line.

35
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,460
Fine.

36
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,020
By “assist you”,

37
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,910
he means he doesn’t trust you.

38
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,150
I don’t trust you.

39
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,430
So?

40
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,710
Aren’t you always eager to battle me?

41
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,550
Wait until

42
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,740
we find the treasure.

43
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,020
Bring it on.

44
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,150
Report!

45
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,740
Lord, we found a village ahead.

46
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,100
Bad news!

47
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,030
A bunch of...

48
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,900
A bunch of martial artists are outside.

49
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,940
How did they get in?

50
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,150
What’s happening?

51
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,550
Why are they here?

52
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,620
No idea.

53
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,340
They look scary.

54
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,990
Guard our village!

55
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,620
-Let’s go!
-Gear up!

56
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,100
-Let’s go!
-Go, go, go!

57
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,380
Come on. Let’s go.

58
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,310
Let’s go!

59
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,220
Calm down.

60
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,100
I’m Gu Tianxian,

61
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
also known as Giant Leopard.

62
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,430
He... he’s a Demon!

63
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,180
Demon?

64
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,030
I thought no one could recognize me

65
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,620
in this remote village.

66
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Now that you do,

67
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,470
you’ve spared me the trouble.

68
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,780
What... what do you want?

69
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,900
We’re farmers.

70
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,340
We... we have no money.

71
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,030
-Yes.
-We don’t have anything.

72
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,380
I need nothing from you,

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,030
only some information.

74
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,310
Are you aware of
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

75
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,940
Why bother asking them?

76
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,060
Just seize them all.

77
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,830
What is this?

78
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,180
What to do?

79
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,990
Lord Shen,

80
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,060
I was told

81
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,220
that Lord Gu and Lord Lu

82
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,060
had located the entrance of
the Big Medicine Valley.

83
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,270
Very well.

84
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,830
Let’s go join them.

85
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:44,990
Yes.

86
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,870
Mr. Xie,

87
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,470
I’m here waiting for you

88
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,780
under the Third Prince’s order.

89
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,830
Zichen?

90
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,430
What’s up?

91
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,270
It’s important.

92
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,030
Can we talk somewhere else?

93
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,990
This is His Highness’s letter to you.

94
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,420
<i>Gathering troops...</i>

95
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,180
What’s wrong?

96
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,620
Zichen said

97
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,500
enemies have gathered
troops at the border.

98
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,550
Their intention is unknown yet.

99
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,750
But once they launch attacks,

100
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,590
chaos will arise.

101
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,550
So he needs my advice.

102
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,310
Forget that.

103
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,620
I can’t leave now.

104
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,990
Go ahead.

105
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,870
He needs your help

106
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,750
or he wouldn’t have asked you.

107
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,590
Anyway, it’ll take us a while

108
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,780
to find the entrance to
the Big Medicine Valley.

109
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,900
Just go.

110
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,100
Fine.

111
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I’ll make it quick.

112
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,870
Take care of yourself.

113
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,620
See you soon.

114
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,470
Yes!

115
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,060
Please, Mr. Xie.

116
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,870
Lord Gantang,

117
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,780
how’s your wife?

118
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,870
Thanks for your help,

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,550
Jinrong is still

120
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,590
in a coma

121
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,590
because of the residual poison,

122
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,310
but

123
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,470
her pulse has become steadier.

124
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,670
If you’re worried about the Fortress

125
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,110
and can’t wait to go back,

126
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,670
we can take care of her.

127
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,590
No need.

128
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,940
I’ve asked those kids

129
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,470
to handle things at home.

130
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,470
Aren’t you concerned?

131
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,420
It’s their responsibility after all.

132
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,740
They can’t avoid it.

133
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,910
I admire you for knowing to let go.

134
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,860
And...

135
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,540
what about the Anping Army?

136
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,740
It’s also fine.

137
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,030
Then why are you frowning?

138
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,150
If we don’t sacrifice ourselves
to save others, who will?

139
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,670
Thank you for enlightening me.

140
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,380
Stop.

141
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,300
Stop.

142
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,300
Is everything alright, sir?

143
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,060
What was that noise?

144
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,790
This area is a war zone.

145
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,380
Such noise is common.

146
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,860
By the way,

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,670
is General Wen Yu stationed nearby?

148
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,470
Yes.

149
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,630
After the Demons raided Huxiang,

150
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,470
General Wen

151
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,620
has been battling enemies in this area.

152
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,110
Cities have changed hands repeatedly.

153
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,180
I see.

154
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,620
I need to see him.

155
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,910
Let’s visit him first.

156
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,740
Sir,

157
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,620
considering the situation here,

158
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,300
His Highness asked us specifically
not to hang around.

159
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,470
So

160
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,860
would you rather let me go there alone

161
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
or sneak out

162
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,270
when you aren’t looking?

163
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,620
I’m sorry.

164
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,830
Alright. Let’s go.

165
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,670
Let’s go.

166
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,110
Heard something over there.

167
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,830
Me too.

168
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,350
It’s a boy.

169
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,380
Fei, put away your blade

170
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,740
or he’ll be scared.

171
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,420
Sweetie,

172
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,790
come here.

173
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,620
Careful. Don’t get hurt.

174
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,670
Come.

175
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,830
Their wounds

176
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,830
are still fresh.

177
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,060
Sword wounds.

178
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,710
The victims seemed to be farmers.

179
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,110
They might be villagers in
the Big Medicine Valley.

180
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,030
Who would kill them?

181
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,500
This is the south of the state.

182
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,350
Does the court have no control here?

183
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,620
It’s close to the frontline
where the war never ceases.

184
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,270
Anyone can occupy this place.

185
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,180
Locals have suffered a lot.

186
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,710
This is strange, though.

187
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,110
Stop!

188
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,940
Sweetie,

189
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,180
where are you going?

190
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,670
I’m going home.

191
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,590
Going home?

192
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,910
If he lives in the Big Medicine Valley

193
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,790
and tries to go back,

194
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,830
he may

195
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,030
lead us there.

196
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,620
Off you go.

197
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,540
General, His Majesty has arrived.

198
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,590
-General Wen.
-Your Majesty.

199
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,380
Skip the formality.

200
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,910
You may leave.

201
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,350
Give us a minute.

202
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,470
Yes.

203
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,940
General Wen,

204
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,380
You must’ve learned about

205
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,230
Lord Gantang’s situation.

206
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,470
He had asked me to get prepared

207
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,980
before his departure.

208
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,500
I’ve also heard about

209
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,420
your condition.

210
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,180
Do take care of yourself.

211
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,350
Thanks to Fei,

212
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,180
I’ve taken three herbs
to suppress the poison.

213
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,150
I’m fine for now.

214
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,420
She’s done so much

215
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,230
for you.

216
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,110
That’s all the more reason
to look after yourself.

217
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,350
I wonder

218
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,500
how Lord Gantang is.

219
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,110
He’s left the Fortress

220
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,030
for some reason.

221
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,540
Everything will be fine.

222
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,860
I can manage things here.

223
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,670
Don’t worry.

224
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,110
Your Majesty,

225
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,670
do you

226
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,790
have any future plans?

227
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,060
That’s

228
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,830
what I’m here for.

229
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,110
I’m all ears.

230
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,910
Aside from your stance,

231
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,590
how is the state overall

232
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,350
during the reign of the Chens?

233
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,150
I’m only a soldier.

234
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,670
It’s not my place to judge.

235
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,300
Relax, General Wen.

236
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,500
It’s just small talk.

237
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,740
Take this area as an example.

238
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,470
It’s relatively peaceful

239
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,350
despite occasional conflicts.

240
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,270
Locals have roofs over their heads.

241
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,180
I once said to Fei

242
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,590
all sects will end eventually.

243
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,910
So will

244
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,710
dynasties.

245
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,710
New ones are built

246
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,230
at the cost of innocent lives.

247
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,910
At this point,

248
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,830
are we going to inflict

249
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,790
such suffering on the masses again?

250
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,350
If you ask me,

251
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,110
like I said,

252
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,350
people come first,

253
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,030
followed by the state

254
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,830
and the one ruling it.

255
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,860
If I could

256
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,110
bring peace to people,

257
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,910
I’d die

258
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,500
with no regrets.

259
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,380
Your Majesty,

260
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,670
back then,

261
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,060
I chose to join this army

262
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,710
for returning a favor

263
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,270
and for friendship.

264
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,420
Your ambition has made me realized

265
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,830
what I should do in the future.

266
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,710
Your Majesty, General Wen.

267
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,540
What’s up?

268
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,860
We’ve spotted Yu Wenzhi’s troops here.

269
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,830
How many are they?

270
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,980
Only a few.

271
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,980
But what brings them here is unclear.

272
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,710
General Wen,

273
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,740
when was the last time you battled him?

274
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,060
15 days ago.

275
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,470
About two weeks.

276
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,710
And nothing happened

277
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,500
since then?

278
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,620
No.

279
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,380
I also

280
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,470
find that odd.

281
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,940
I was a commander years back,

282
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,380
but you’ve gained more experience

283
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,300
through battles with General Wang.

284
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,830
I dare not to jump to conclusions.

285
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,710
Your Majesty,

286
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,910
you’d better leave with the Chens.

287
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,180
It’s too dangerous here.

288
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,420
I don’t want to get you in danger.

289
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,180
The terrain here is complex.

290
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,060
Why don’t you dispatch scouts

291
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,230
to check again
within a 10-kilometer radius

292
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,980
in case Yu Wenzhi is
plotting against us?

293
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,300
Go ahead.

294
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,590
Yes.

295
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,020
They must be

296
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,230
up to something.

297
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,420
What’s wrong?

298
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,750
He must’ve

299
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,540
learned how to do all that

300
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,020
from his parents.

301
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,390
The rocks

302
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,110
may be the keys.

303
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,750
Push that.

304
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,780
What?

305
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,180
What did you say?

306
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,870
Push that.

307
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,750
It’s open!

308
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,140
It’s open!

309
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,660
Fei,

310
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,660
what are you doing?

311
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,110
Leaving a sign for Xie Yun.

312
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,140
Let’s go.

313
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:30,034
Sub by Dramacool.ae

314
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,860
So many people

315
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,660
are living here.

316
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,660
Watch out for the Demons!

317
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Lock men and women separately.

318
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,740
Move!

319
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,620
What are you looking at? Go!

320
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,950
This place is filled with
the Demons and troops.

321
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,660
The Demons here are even more

322
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,070
than those sent to the Fortress.

323
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,590
-Looks like they’re
-Go!

324
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,020
gathering the villagers together.

325
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,900
Move!

326
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,710
Hey, you, stop dawdling!

327
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,540
Fei, could we be wrong?

328
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,020
This place doesn’t look like a vault.

329
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
Open your eyes!

330
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,260
It must be important,

331
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,710
or the Demons wouldn’t be here.

332
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,070
Follow them

333
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,620
and see how things go.

334
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,660
Go! Hurry up!

335
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,020
-Keep up!
-Move!

336
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,380
Go!

337
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,190
-Go!
-Go inside!

338
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,310
Hurry!

339
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,860
They’ve caged so many people.

340
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,740
Women and kids are locked up separately

341
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,430
as hostages

342
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,070
to better control men.

343
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,860
Lords,

344
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,540
villagers of the Big Medicine Valley

345
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,660
are kept in the caves in this area.

346
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,310
Have our grains been put away?

347
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,070
Yes. They’re safe.

348
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,470
What do you

349
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,070
need those villagers for?

350
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,780
I don’t need to

351
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,380
explain it to you.

352
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,780
Do you think

353
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,380
you can handle them alone?

354
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,230
Let’s see.

355
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,620
Vulgar!

356
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,190
You think you’re better than me?

357
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,350
You and your sister

358
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,740
have brought shame

359
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,190
on Demons Manor.

360
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,260
Excuse me?

361
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,020
What do you mean?

362
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,190
Your sister hooked up
with Yu Wenzhi in secret.

363
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,350
Who knows how much

364
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,540
dirty business you two have done

365
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,660
behind Lord Shen’s back.

366
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,020
Nonsense!

367
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,780
All that she did

368
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,710
was for Demons Manor,

369
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,500
or she wouldn’t have
been killed by Zhou Fei!

370
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,860
Our loyalty is unquestionable.

371
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
Have you found the entrance
to The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

372
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,710
Not yet, Lord Gu.

373
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,500
Our men have been looking for it.

374
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,260
Hurry up.

375
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,020
Yes.

376
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,620
Follow me.

377
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,740
Both Lu Tiankuang

378
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,620
and Gu Tianxian are here.

379
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,740
They haven’t found the entrance yet.

380
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,380
I’m afraid

381
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,900
they’ve caged the villagers to...

382
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,830
Do you mean

383
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,230
they’re using them

384
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,860
to find the treasure?

385
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,620
Those Demons

386
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,140
will do anything for it.

387
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,070
-Spare us!
-Spare us!

388
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,380
Hey, you!

389
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,230
Brother!

390
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,710
Where’s The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

391
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,860
-I don’t know.
-Don’t kill me, please!

392
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,830
Speak!

393
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,310
Spare me, please.

394
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,350
Listen up.

395
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,190
Tell us where
The Color of Ocean and Heaven is,

396
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,940
or all of you will be dead.

397
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,380
We’re outnumbered.

398
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,070
Let’s go.

399
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,590
Sheng!

400
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,430
I’ll hold him and walk behind you.

401
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,540
We can’t leave them there.

402
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,470
Yan,

403
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,900
there’s only a few of us.

404
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,740
We aren’t their match.

405
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,950
And

406
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,950
don’t forget about our mission.

407
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,830
We need help

408
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,380
to get them out.

409
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,350
Are you saying...?

410
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,780
Ask General Wen Yu for help.

411
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,830
I heard he and his troops are nearby.

412
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,660
Send him a message

413
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,310
and ask him to come over.

414
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,020
Then we can continue the search.

415
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,990
How long

416
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,590
will that take?

417
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,500
By the time we’re back,

418
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,470
all those villagers are already dead.

419
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,900
Fei,

420
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,950
say something!

421
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,380
Back then,

422
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,900
when my skills were poor,

423
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,110
I dared to challenge Dragon Master.

424
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,780
Now, they’re much better,

425
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,980
but I feel as if they tied me up.

426
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,590
Everyone has burdens.

427
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,350
Even if people aren’t afraid of death,

428
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,380
there are things more important than it.

429
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,350
Should I

430
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,540
stick my neck out for strangers?

431
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,070
Fei,

432
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,470
what’s on your mind? Fei!

433
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,350
Are we...

434
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,140
giving them up?

435
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,380
Not exactly.

436
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,190
But we need a plan.

437
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,500
Tell me

438
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,710
where The Color of Ocean and Heaven is

439
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,230
if you want to live.

440
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,710
Otherwise,

441
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,660
I’ll take one of you

442
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,620
every hour

443
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,470
until you cough up the answer.

444
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,710
Li Sheng,

445
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,230
you’re hesitating

446
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,350
because you don’t want to
take risks or feel guilty.

447
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,500
I have no choice.

448
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,110
Do you have better ideas?

449
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,230
No.

450
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,190
Zhou Fei,

451
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,590
just say the word.

452
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,950
I need to find
The Color of Ocean and Heaven,

453
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,860
the cure to Bone-chilling

454
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,190
and go back to the Fortress.

455
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,860
But none of them

456
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,660
sounds justified.

457
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,070
They’re important

458
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,020
to me,

459
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,740
but once I say them out loud...

460
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,470
Chuchu, let’s go.

461
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,830
-Fei.
-Get up.

462
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,860
Fei,

463
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,990
come on!

464
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Sheng,

465
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,350
if we left like this,

466
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,430
once we got back,

467
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,350
would you dare to tell my mother

468
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,780
that we left those people to die?

469
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,430
Yes, Sheng.

470
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,380
Fei,

471
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,950
two Demons and their lackeys are there.

472
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,540
If you acted recklessly

473
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,590
and got killed,

474
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,860
what would happen to Mr. Xie?

475
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,310
Who’d save him?

476
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,260
What about the others?

477
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,140
And your mother and father.

478
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,310
Would you rather
break their hearts again?

479
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,470
I believe my parents

480
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,350
and Xie Yun

481
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,310
will understand.

482
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,660
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

483
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,260
doesn’t raise cowards.

484
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,860
If we back down,

485
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,070
they’ll be more disappointed.

486
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,990
Zhou Fei,

487
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,350
although we’ve battled more than once,

488
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,110
I support you this time.

489
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,190
Are we going to rescue them now?

490
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,710
Sheng,

491
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,540
I agree with them.

492
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,310
That’s great.

493
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,660
Let’s go.

494
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,860
Fine.

495
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,540
We need a strategy

496
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,020
to get them out

497
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,190
successfully.

498
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,950
That’s the best we can do at the moment.

499
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,950
One more thing.

500
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,990
We need someone

501
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,430
to send a message to General Wen.

502
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,900
Who will do it?

503
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,230
I won’t.

504
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,070
Sheng,

505
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,070
let me stay

506
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,740
and help you.

507
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,950
I have an idea.

508
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,950
What is it?

509
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,430
What idea?

510
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,500
Close your eyes.

511
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,110
-Why?
-What for?

512
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,590
Do it.

513
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,470
Alright.

514
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,190
Draw a stick.

515
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,230
What is this?

516
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,110
We’re taught to respect all beings.

517
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,990
Every year during festivals,

518
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,740
we’ll have our fortune told.

519
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,990
I don’t get how the rituals work,

520
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,470
but basically, we follow heaven’s will.

521
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,660
Let’s each draw a stick.

522
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,780
Whoever gets the longest one
will be the messenger.

523
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,140
Deal?

524
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,900
Are you insane?

525
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
If it’s us, who will fight the enemies?

526
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,660
Never mind.

527
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,430
There are no other ways.

528
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,950
Not me.

529
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,540
Not me, either.

530
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,860
Not me.

531
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,380
It’s me.

532
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,620
Chuchu,

533
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,500
I know you’re worried about us,

534
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,660
but sending the message
is equally important.

535
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,710
Without General Wen,

536
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,540
we won’t be able to

537
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,070
get out on our own.

538
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,470
I see.

539
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,140
I’ll go.

540
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,860
The Demons outside are many.

541
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,190
Be very careful.

542
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,070
Chuchu, come here.

543
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Chuchu,

544
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
do you know where our nearest

545
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,540
secret service is?

546
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,590
I do.

547
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,260
I paid attention to that

548
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,350
when you checked them.

549
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,990
But

550
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,590
I need to see General Wen first.

551
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,070
You may have to enter the war zone.

552
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,500
How are you going to find him?

553
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,780
He’s traveling with a large troop.

554
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,260
They must’ve left tracks along the way.

555
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,020
They can be my guide.

556
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,260
No.

557
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,860
That’s too dangerous.

558
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,860
Relax. I hate to leave, too,

559
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,900
but I must

560
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,950
send the message to him

561
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,710
for the safety of the villagers.

562
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,190
Everything will be fine.

563
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,230
This soft armor,

564
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,780
made by the one

565
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,430
who crafted Mrs. Yin’s Muyun Gauze,

566
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,380
is impenetrable,

567
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
but

568
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,380
not able to withstand strong force.

569
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,950
Don’t battle those

570
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,660
with powerful palms head-on.

571
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,350
Just run as fast as you can.

572
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,500
I see.

573
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,740
This is another gadget he made.

574
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,110
I’ve never used it before.

575
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,430
It’s said to be a hidden weapon

576
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
to protect you in danger.

577
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,310
If the target is within 10 meters,

578
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,620
stay calm

579
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,660
and shoot.

580
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,740
Even Yang Jin

581
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,230
and Li Sheng can’t dodge the hit.

582
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
Got it.

583
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,230
Take these, too, if you can.

584
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,500
What are they?

585
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,350
Snake poison

586
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,660
and knockout drops our people made.

587
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,350
I’m not sure which is which,

588
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,020
but they’re all here.

589
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,830
Come on!

590
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,110
Can you be more irresponsible?

591
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,500
Still, they’re better than nothing.

592
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,430
I’ll take them.

593
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,470
Be careful.

594
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,140
This boy will go with me.

595
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,020
It’s dangerous for him to be here.

596
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,590
Let’s go.

597
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,590
Come on.

598
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,830
Take care.

599
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,110
Sheng,

600
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,780
you should go back.

601
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,950
Take care.

602
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,070
Keep this

603
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,830
and take care as well.

604
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,190
What?

605
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,900
You’ll take both of them?

606
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,430
Lower your voice.

607
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,990
Yes.

608
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,380
Or will you do it?

609
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,620
Who is it

610
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,110
to battle two enemies?

611
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,110
Sheng,

612
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,190
here’s what I think.

613
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,500
I can propose a challenge

614
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,780
to battle Gu Tianxian and Lu Tiankuang.

615
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,620
Perhaps they’ll

616
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,660
follow the rules
and take up the challenge.

617
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,140
That’ll buy you some time

618
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,470
to get the villagers out.

619
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,430
Rules?

620
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,990
Would those animals care about rules?

621
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,950
What if they come at you together?

622
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,900
What will you do?

623
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,990
I’m not stupid.

624
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,740
They aren’t exactly friends.

625
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,950
I’ll stall them

626
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,260
for a while.

627
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,780
I’ve got these.

628
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,140
What are they?

629
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,620
Our pharmacists made these, too.

630
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,470
Drop them on the ground,

631
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,830
and they’ll produce smoke

632
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,230
enough to paralyze others.

633
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,710
Then we can get in

634
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,990
to rescue the hostages.

635
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,780
I’ve brought whistling arrows with me.

636
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,740
Seeing sparks they create,

637
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,500
they may think
we’re setting the valley on fire.

638
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,260
That’ll be our chance to escape.

639
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,710
What about those women and kids?

640
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,070
They should be kept nearby.

641
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,950
I... I’ll get them out.

642
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,830
Yan,

643
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,140
are your three moves

644
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,230
enough to do that?

645
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,430
Sheng said

646
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,470
they’re loosely guarded.

647
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,430
And

648
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,950
I’ve mastered more than three moves.

649
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,710
Those Demons aren’t my match.

650
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,780
-Yan,
-Alright.

651
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,900
take them all.

652
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,020
Be very careful.

653
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,350
Once Li Sheng and I are done,

654
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,500
we’ll join you.

655
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I see.

656
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,350
Remember,

657
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,380
if things look bad,

658
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,190
just run away.

659
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,950
Stay away from danger.

660
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,110
Safety matters the most.

661
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,660
Let’s go.

662
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,990
Lords,

663
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,900
the heiress to the South Blade,
Zhou Fei,

664
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,540
is here to challenge you.

665
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,190
The South Blade?

666
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,140
What?

667
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,620
Why is she here?

668
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,830
How many are they?

669
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,020
Just her alone.

670
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,230
That girl

671
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,110
is a cunning fox.

672
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,780
There must be a trap.

673
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,430
It’s just a girl.

674
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,310
Don’t be paranoid.

675
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,470
Now that she’s here,

676
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,310
I’ll avenge my sister’s death on her.

677
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,430
Let’s go.

678
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,620
Lu Tiankuang!

679
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,660
Tell the guards to stay alert.

680
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,100
Let me know

681
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,340
if anyone breaks in.

682
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,300
Yes.

683
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,750
Let’s go.

684
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,030
Who are you?

685
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,340
Anping Army.

686
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Do you serve under General Wen Yu?

687
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,340
Who exactly are you?

688
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,860
How do you know our general?

689
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,990
They must be General Wen’s men.

690
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,550
I’m with the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

691
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,190
I have a message for General Wen

692
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,860
and I need to see him.

693
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,580
It’s urgent.

694
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,820
Please trust me.

695
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,660
Zhou Fei,

696
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,620
I’m here.

697
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,140
It’s been a while,

698
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,230
Lord Lu.

699
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,510
I’m

700
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,580
going to kill you

701
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,190
to avenge my sister’s death.

702
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,660
Brace up!

703
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,580
Check carefully!

704
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,340
Yes.

705
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,950
Report! Report!

706
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,790
Lord Gu,

707
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,820
the cave is under attack.

708
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,550
They’re trying to rescue villagers.

709
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,990
How many are they?

710
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,660
Not too many.

711
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,030
Only two or three.

712
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,270
But they’re highly skilled.

713
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,620
That’s a distraction.

714
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,190
Let us out!

715
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,990
Move! Get in!

716
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,470
Hurry!

717
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,380
Bonehead is right.

718
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,750
Women and kids are kept in the back.

719
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,950
Let us out! Let us out!

720
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,820
Please let us go.

721
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Step back! Step back!

722
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,900
Be quiet!

723
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,470
Calm down. I’m here to get you out.

724
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,660
How did you sneak out?

725
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,140
I...

726
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,230
Get in.

727
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,710
Stay inside,

728
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,550
or I’ll break your legs.

729
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,710
What are you doing here?

730
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,510
Zhou Fei’s sudden appearance

731
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,580
and sneak attack on the cave

732
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,470
are clearly distractions.

733
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,860
Don’t lecture me.

734
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,190
What are Li Sheng

735
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,580
and Yang Jin doing?

736
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,950
What’s taking them so long?

737
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,270
Oh, no!

738
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,430
Yu Wenzhi’s troops are here.

739
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,550
Go!

740
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,990
We’re here to help you.

741
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,380
It’s them!

742
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,300
Seize them!

743
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,710
What to do? We’re doomed.

744
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,060
I’ll stall them for you.

745
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,660
A stranger

746
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,340
is risking his life for you.

747
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,030
How could you give up?

748
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,430
Even if you don’t care about your lives,

749
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,060
think about your parents

750
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,030
and wives.

751
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,270
Your boys are little.

752
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,990
Do you want to see them die?

753
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,990
He’s right.

754
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,100
We can’t give up.

755
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,710
Yes. We still have a chance to live.

756
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,710
We can’t die.

757
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,660
Don’t be scared.

758
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,990
I’m here to get you out.

759
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,860
Trust me.

760
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,620
There will be a mess outside.

761
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,860
Carry the seniors and kids.

762
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,470
We can get out.

763
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,380
It’s bad.

764
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,820
There are so many of them,

765
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,620
including seniors.

766
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,030
Snake keeper!

767
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,340
I’ve killed them all.

768
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:46,900
Let’s go.

769
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,660
Okay. Let’s go.

770
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,430
I won’t leave without my elder sister.

771
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,300
Where is she?

772
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,340
She’s locked up in the northwest cave

773
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,790
by those bad people.

774
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,510
Lead the way.

775
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,230
We’ll get her out.

776
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,380
-Thanks.
-Let’s go.

777
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,470
Let’s go.

778
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,510
Go, go, go.

779
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,660
Let’s go.

785
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,550
Why are there snakes?

786
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,060
Let’s go!

Sheng! Yang Jin!

788
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,060
We’re here!

789
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
Great.

790
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,950
Yan, are you alright?

791
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,340
Open it, Yang Jin.

792
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,430
This “snake girl” helped us.

793
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,900
Ying Hecong!

794
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,860
What... what are you doing here?

795
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,100
I said I’d go back to
the Big Medicine Valley.

796
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,140
Didn’t you listen?

797
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,710
Once I arrived,

798
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,580
the Demons were
holding villagers hostage.

799
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,300
Hadn’t I dressed up like this,

800
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,270
how could I’ve saved them?

801
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,990
Fine, fine, fine.

802
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,990
Let’s go.

803
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,270
My snakes can only hold the Demons

804
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,270
for a while.

805
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,470
This powder will keep snakes away.

806
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,660
Let’s line up

807
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,790
and keep the snakes on one side.

808
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,580
Be careful.

809
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,790
<i>Animal characters made by CG</i>
Watch it.

810
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,900
Be careful. Mind your step.

811
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,820
Go.

812
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,230
Watch out for the snakes.

813
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,060
-Let’s go. Come on.
-Slow down, Father.

814
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,550
Be careful.

815
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,860
Come on.

816
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,900
Let’s go.

817
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,060
Where are you going?

818
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,140
You are...

819
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,900
Don’t be scared.

820
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,660
I won’t harm you.

821
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,190
We were locked up by the Demons

822
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,060
and two young men got us out.

823
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,820
We’re leaving this place.

824
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,580
Two young men?

825
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,470
You almost killed me.

826
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,550
Are you blind?

827
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,660
Stay out of the way!

828
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,710
Dog-eat-dog.

829
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,100
Did the Demons and Yu Wenzhi’s men

830
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,480
store up grains here?

831
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,100
If they’re on fire,
that’ll mess things up

832
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,580
and buy villagers
more time to leave.

833
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,710
Why is it all sand under the rice?

834
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,340
How come the door is open?

835
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,470
Someone must’ve laid eyes on the barn.

836
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,430
Let’s go check.

837
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,900
This isn’t the real barn.

Where do you think you’re going?

Aren’t you a runner?

844
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,950
Where are Ying Hecong and Li Yan?

845
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,710
I’ll go find them.

846
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,580
No need.

847
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,550
They’ll be fine

848
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,510

849

of the snakes.

I’m sorry to trouble you again,

851
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,580
but my uncle is still
in the northeast cave.

852
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,230
Could you... could you get him out, too?

853
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,300
There must be an ambush in the back.

854
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,430
They wouldn’t put all eggs
in one basket.

855
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,750
Their grains and supplies

856
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,820
must be stored there.

857

Let’s go and see what we can do.

858
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,820
Maybe we can make some noise there

859
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,660
to help Fei out.

00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,140
Yes. We can help you.

00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,510
-Let us help you.
-We’ll join you.

-This way.
-Take us with you.

General,

864
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,580
you have a visitor from
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

865
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,380
who asks to see you urgently.

866
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,430
Who is it?

867
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,660
It’s a girl.

868
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,550

Miss Wu!

Miss Wu?

875
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,100
What are you doing

876
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,380
in this middle of nowhere?

877
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,060

Could you send troops to help them?

What’s wrong?

883
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,580
We entered a valley,

884
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,660
but found people there

885
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,030
locked up by the Demons and Yu Wenzhi.

886
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,190
We meant to rescue them

887
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,230
but we were outnumbered.

888
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,380
Please give us a hand.

889
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,510
It’s too risky

890
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,340
for you guys

891
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,710
to rescue them

892
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,230
from Yu Wenzhi’s men.

893
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,950
Guard!

894
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,750
-Yes.
-Gather our crack troops

895
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,030
and set out with Miss Wu.

896
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,950
Yes.

897
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,430
