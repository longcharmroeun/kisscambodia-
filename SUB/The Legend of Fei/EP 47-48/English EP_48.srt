Watch strictly over that direction.

00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,590
It’s there.

21
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,310
-Keep a close eye.
-Aye.

22
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,510
There are too many of them.

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,630
We can’t break in.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,230
What’s in the barrels?

25
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,000
That’s where we store the kerosene.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Be quick.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,310

Lord Lu.

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,910
Your sister Pathetic Clam died
when stealing the tokens.

59
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,870
Shen Tianshu discarded her
as a chessman.

60
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,280
But you’re still fighting for him.

You’d better be killed by me

70
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,240
than be defeated by our enemy.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,190
Don’t disgrace us.

72

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,030
Retreat!

75
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,520
I’m back.

76
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,560
Chuchu.

77
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,680
You’re finally back.

78
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,960
Are you alright?

79
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,310
I’m fine.

80
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,400
Thank you, everybody.

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Miss Wu, you’re welcome.

82
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,960
It’s General’s Wen’s order.

83
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,560
I should do my best.

84
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,240
Everyone.

85
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,960
I’m leaving, then.

86
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Let’s go!

87
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,310
-Aye!
-Go!

88
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,190
Hurry!

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,520
What do we do next?

90
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,280
So many Demons fail

91
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
to get any clue
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

92
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,720
I think we should start from the poem.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Sheng.

94
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,870
Did you find something?

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,070
The sun shines

96
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,560
over that place.

97
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,800
There are birds

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
on the tree.

99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
The valley is beautiful,

100
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,000
where birds sing beautifully.

101
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,000
Does the second half refer to a place

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,440
where the sun shines

103
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,070
and the birds sing?

104
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,030
Precisely.

105
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,440
I think that’s the place

106
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
the poem refers to.

107
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,280
Let’s go there.

108
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
-Go.
-Go.

109
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,220
<i>Frost after autumn rains.
Coolness and silence in the forest.</i>

110
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,590
Run!

111
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,750
Run, everybody!

112
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,630
Help!

113
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,680
-Run!
-Run!

114
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,520
-Help!
-Run, everybody!

115
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,590
Run!

116
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,350
Help!

117
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,150
Be careful!

118
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,510
-Come on.
-Hurry! Run!

119
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,640
Lord.

120
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,440
These villagers ran away
from the Big Medicine Valley.

121
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,800
Seems like

122
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,200
not everything is under control
of Giant Leopard and Hearing Ox.

123
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,350
Someone strong must have gone there

124
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,640
and disturbed them.

125
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,270
Someone held back two lords
at the same time?

126
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,320
In this world,

127
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,270
there are very few people

128
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,240
who have such great martial arts.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,560
Could it be...?

130
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,150
Go.

131
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Aye.

132
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,320
If I guess correctly,

133
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,150
this is the entrance

134
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,560
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

135
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
Sheng.

136
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,150
Did you get it wrong?

137
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,440
It doesn’t look like an entrance.

138
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,710
It’s a mere forest.

139
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,080
If Mr. Li is right,

140
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,680
the entrance can’t be opened
unless we find the mechanism.

141
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,470
You’re right.

142
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,880
Let’s look for it.

143
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,910
Report!

144
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,560
Lo... Lord.

145
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,350
Zhou Fei and her companions
haven’t left the Big Medicine Valley.

146
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,320
Instead, they got into the forest.

147
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,000
They escaped, but didn’t leave.

148
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,150
Can they be looking for something?

149
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Follow them.

150
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,030
If you find anything fishy,

151
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,200
tell me immediately.

152
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,470
Aye.

153
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,640
What did you press?

154
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
A stone over there.

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,240
That’s the mechanism.

156
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,710
It looks like a musical instrument,

157
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,800
named...

158
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,910
Xun.

159
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,120
Lingxun comes from four directions.

160
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,830
Lingxun?

161
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Did I remember it in a wrong order?

162
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,950
It should be Xunling.

163
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,760
That explains.

164
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
There’s another name for Xunling,

165
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,950
the sound of Xun.

166
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,440
It means

167
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,150
four songs are played.

168
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,440
There are another four places like this.

169
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Where are the other three directions?

170
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,910
According to the Eight-trigram
Formation map,

171
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,440
it should be the east, west and south.

172
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,390
Well,

173
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,350
let’s go separate ways.

174
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,030
Let’s look for them separately

175
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,590
and come back later.

176
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,320
After all the troubles,

177
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,350
we’re finally going to find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

178
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,080
We’re not sure what will happen.

179
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,120
The farther we go,
the more cautious we should be.

180
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,030
Miss Zhou.

181
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,080
Don’t worry.

182
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,590
I’ve had a divination lately.

183
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,270
We’re destined to stay

184
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,150
and help each other.

185
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,270
As long as we’re together,

186
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,950
we will turn ill luck into good.

187
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
If you’re actually good at divination,

188
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
why don’t you find the mechanism first?

189
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,680
Here’s my good luck.

190
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
I’ve found it.

191
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,590
Let’s go.

192
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,800
Chuchu.

193
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,680
When I left, you gave me a pouch.

194
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,030
What was that for?

195
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,150
I used to keep the pouch with me,

196
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,710
which blessed me from danger.

197
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,710
I gave it to you,

198
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
so that you would be safe.

199
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,880
Sorry.

200
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,150
I made you worried again.

201
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,950
Look.

202
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,440
There’s some noise.

203
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,800
You know what?

204
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,470
The mechanism must be in the rocks.

205
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,510
We can’t easily find it.

206
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,910
Think about Lyu Run.

207
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,150
He designed the entrance

208
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,080
with the Eight-trigram Formation.

209
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,510
He was awesome.

210
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,150
What an idiot you are!

211
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,030
If it hadn’t been for him,

212
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,150
we would have found
the Color of Ocean and Heaven long ago.

213
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,470
Stop talking nonsense.

214
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,710
Hurry and look for the mechanism.

215
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,910
Come and have a look.

216
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,910
Is this the mechanism?

217
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Try it.

218
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,390
Come over.

219
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,150
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

220
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,470
Look!

221
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
The entrance has appeared!

222
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,800
Why is this

223
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,710
the Forbidden Hall of Qi School?

224
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,510
Can the Color of Ocean and Heaven
be in this place?

225
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,760
Be careful, everybody.

226
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,910
Go.

227
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,510
Tiankuang.

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,390
-Lord!
-Lord!

229
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,830
You look serious.

230
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,800
What’s on your mind?

231
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,590
Lord.

232
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,950
You’re just in time.

233
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,000
I’ve possibly found the entrance

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,800
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

235
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,200
Let me take you there.

236
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,720
Where birds sing beautifully.

237
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,230
It’s indeed the place.

238
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,440
Ying Hecong.

239
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,440
What are these?

240
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,680
Five Poison Saints.

241
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,800
Five Poison Saints?

242
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,560
They’re evil gods in the south.

243
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,990
Villagers who believe in witchcraft
pray to them

244
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,270
so that they won’t be hurt
by poisonous insects.

245
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,030
But later,

246
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,510
some bad men used them

247
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,320
to pretend to be mysterious.

248
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,870
Many weird pictures are on the wall.

249
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,320
What do they mean?

250
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,230
I can’t recognize all the marks.

251
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,150
I can only have a guess.

252
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,440
It’s about a totem

253
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,230
or a sacrifice.

254
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,030
Look at this picture.

255
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,200
This man died.

256
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,750
Their priest brought him

257
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,990
back to life

258
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
by using a book.

259
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,990
Is it the Book of Almighty Medicine?

260
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,910
Perhaps.

261
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,030
Here’s a door.

262
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,230
Let’s go have a look.

263
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,150
Be careful with your blade.

264
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,560
Everybody, look out
for the wall and ground.

265
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Bonehead.

266
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
Seems like this place

267
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,320
extends to the valley.

268
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,960
I wonder where
the Color of Ocean and Heaven is hidden.

269
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,720
In this place, there are many formations

270
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,910
and secret chambers.

271
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,910
If we’re careless,

272
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,630
we may trigger the mechanism

273
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,230
and be caught in danger.

274
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,320
So...

275
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,230
-Fei!
-Xie Yun!

276
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,560
Fei!

277
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,150
They fell in a mechanism.

278
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,600
Let’s search the place
and see if we can open it.

279
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,680
Yes. Let’s look for the mechanism.

280
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Okay.

281
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,990
Watch out!

282
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,990
Mechanisms are everywhere.
It’s too dangerous.

283
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Let’s move forward.

284
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,720
Be very careful.

285
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,910
-Okay.
-Okay.

286
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,840
Sheng.

287
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,720
Sheng! Chuchu!

288
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,030
Yan!

289
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,480
We’re in trouble.

290
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,030
What are you sighing for?

291
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,870
I didn’t expect Dim

292
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,750
to be so fragile as well.

293
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,720
It already has cracks and cuts
on the edge.

294
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,960
You don’t use blades. What do you know?

295
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,270
Dim has been the best blade

296
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,960
I’ve ever used.

297
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,200
Where’s Ying Hecong?

298
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,680
Isn’t he behind us?

299
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,150
He didn’t catch up?

300
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,440
Wait a minute.

301
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,030
Don’t you think we’re circling?

302
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,270
Can Ying Hecong be lost?

303
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,800
Let’s go find him.

304
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,630
Wait a second.

305
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,990
There’s some noise.

306
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,480
What are you doing?

307
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,600
Why are you there?

308
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Come this way.

309
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:22,024
Sub by Dramacool.ae

310
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,150
Please.

311
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,110
Guard at the entrance

312
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,030
with your men and private soldiers.

313
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,150
Don’t let anyone come out.

314
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,230
Aye, Lord.

315
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,990
Shen Tianshu

316
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,680
is so vigilant against me.

317
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,230
The door can’t be opened.

318
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,960
Why is here a stone chamber?

319
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,030
Yeah.

320
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,480
All daily necessities are available.

321
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,630
Looks like someone once lived here.

322
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,320
This is underground.

323
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,480
Who could have lived here?

324
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,150
Door.

325
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,510
There’s a door over there!

326
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,840
Let’s go have a look.

327
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,150
Be careful.

328
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,230
Watch out for traps.

329
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,030
Someone must try it.

330
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,200
You... You go.

331
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,960
Fine, then!

332
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,150
Be careful.

333
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,480
The door can’t be opened.

334
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,390
There must be another mechanism.

335
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,960
It’s icy.

336
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,440
No wonder it feels so cold here.

337
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,910
Weed Spirit.

338
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,840
I guess the one who lived here

339
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,110
must be fat and afraid of heat.

340
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,840
That’s why he lived here.

341
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,840
Why are you still kidding?

342
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,720
No way. Your body feels cold.

343
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,030
We can’t stay here for long.

344
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,750
Let’s check if there’s another exit.

345
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,780
<i>I’m not jealous of immortals,
but the lovers</i>

346
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,270
<i>Painted in the spring of the 35th year,
by Lyu Run</i>

347
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,910
It’s a painting of Priest Lyu Run.

348
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,080
Lyu Run?

349
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,230
Lyu Run is said
to have found a secret place

350
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,630
where nobody knew

351
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,270
to get ready for his death.

352
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,910
I think

353
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,270
this is where he stayed before he died.

354
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,150
Lord.

355
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,680
The arrow was cut.

356
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,630
They must have triggered the mechanism.

357
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,910
Let’s go separate ways.

358
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,640
Lord.

359
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,520
Mechanism here was triggered, too.

360
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,070
Seemed like someone was here.

361
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,910
Get in and have a look.

362
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,910
Aye.

363
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,840
In the Forbidden Hall of Qi School,

364
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,110
there are many mechanisms.

365
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,080
But there’s no decent treasure at all.

366
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,720
Lord.

367
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,870
This painting is wrong.

368
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,200
The old man on the right
uses white chessmen.

369
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,990
But he’s hesitating with a black one.

370
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,440
You have no idea.

371
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,870
Lyu Run was forever engrossed
in pharmacology and martial arts.

372
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,630
He was so obsessed

373
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,200
that he even remained within doors
when he was old.

374
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,750
The chess game in the painting

375
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,680
is very likely to be the true faith

376
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,270
he got in his twilight years.

377
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,750
True faith?

378
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,750
We don’t know why he destroyed it.

379
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,630
What a pity!

380
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,480
I practiced martial arts

381
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,440
in both Yin and Yang ways,

382
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,720
just like the black and white chessmen.

383
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,150
The last level should be Yang.

384
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,030
I abandoned Yin,

385
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,800
trying to make a breakthrough in Yang.

386
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,600
According to the painting,

387
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
I use the white chessmen,

388
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,910
but I guess about the black.

389
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,270
Don’t touch it.

390
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,720
What if it’s poisonous?

391
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,030
I’m impervious to all poisons, aren’t I?

392
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,750
I lost my father at a little age.

393
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,360
My master adopted me

394
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,910
and named me Run.

395
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,320
I was raised and educated.

396
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,840
Run?

397
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,360
It’s Lyu Run’s testament, I guess.

398
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
No wonder
we saw the statue of poison saints

399
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,510
when we came in.

400
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,480
It’s said
that his lover died of sickness.

401
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,750
Lyu Run was so overwhelmed with grief.

402
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,080
Therefore,

403
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,230
he spent his whole life
studying medical skills,

404
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,200
trying to figure out

405
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,840
if there’s a real way
to bring the dead back to life.

406
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,600
Did he find anything

407
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,320
after studying books of poison saints
for such a long time?

408
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,320
Phoenix Grass was from ancient times.

409
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,870
There is little available in this world.

410
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,870
I made all Phoenix Grass into pills

411
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,360
and put them all in this box.

412
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,080
Taking a few of them

413
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,230
and digesting them
with extreme Yang force

414
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,800
will detoxify all poisons.

415
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,360
There’s no more Phoenix Pill.

416
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,800
It opened automatically!

417
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Not automatically. I opened it!

418
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,270
Can it be opened?

419
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,440
No one is here.

420
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,510
We’re stuck here.

421
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,150
These are extreme Yin things

422
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,990
we can hardly see in a century.

423
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,360
So many!

424
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,150
It’s a dead end.

425
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,870
Shall we backtrack?

426
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,320
Let’s go.

427
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,840
Ying Hecong.

428
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,990
Look what a condition we’re in!

429
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,600
Why are you still
checking the moldy herbs?

430
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,990
Help to look for the exit.

431
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,750
It’s Yan’s voice.

432
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,960
Yan!

433
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,360
Yan!

434
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,270
Since we can hear her voice,

435
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,440
it means there’s a crack.

436
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,800
If there’s a crack, there’s a mechanism.

437
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,270
Let’s look for it.

438
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,270
Okay.

439
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
Bonehead.

440
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,030
This looks like a mechanism.

441
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,030
Try it.

442
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,150
Why is it me again?

443
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,030
Ying Hecong.

444
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,750
Here’s a mechanism. Come and turn it.

445
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,270
Oh, you can do it.

446
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,510
Just do it. Hurry.

447
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,870
It can’t be turned.

448
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,360
This can’t be a mechanism.

449
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,560
Let’s keep looking.

450
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,150
Look at this.

451
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,270
Looks like it was pushed.

452
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:18,840
Yan.

453
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,600
Sheng, keep the door open!

454
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,030
Are you alright?

455
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,870
We’re fine.

456
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,560
The door is the only exit here.

457
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,720
Anything special in this chamber?

458
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,080
No.

459
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,150
Oh, Sheng.

460
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,680
Did you see Fei and Xie Yun?

461
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,630
No.

462
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,750
Our priority

463
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,480
is to find Fei soon.

464
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,750
I’ve got to know

465
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,390
about the mechanisms.

466
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,320
Remember.

467
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,150
Do no touch anything.

468
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,110
-Go.
-Go.

469
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,320
Report!

470
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,270
Lord.

471
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,150
Li Sheng and his companions
are right ahead.

472
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,720
Go.

473
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,750
-Aye.
-Aye.

474
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,030
-Go.
-Go.

475
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,270
What a complicated place!

476
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,230
I’m a bit dizzy, walking around.

477
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,030
I didn’t expect to meet you so soon.

478
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,800
It’s you?

479
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,080
Young girl.

480
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,320
Where’s Zhou Fei?

481
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,430
You’re the mastermind
who poisoned my aunt!

482
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,320
I’ll avenge her today!

483
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,990
Yan.

484
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,640
We can’t defeat him. Go.

485
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,880
Let them lead the way.

486
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,270
What’s this book?

487
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,950
Methods of Qi School.

488
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,190
It looks like Tao Teh King

489
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,750
Taoist Priest Chongxiao gave me.

490
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,670
But...

491
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,270
The second half looks different.

492
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,880
Fei.

493
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,160
I didn’t expect the method

494
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,230
to be so strong and fiery.

495
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,510
It is.

496
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,030
This book looks strange.

497
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,640
You’d better stop reading.

498
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,430
Fei.

499
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,030
This method feels so strange.

500
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,430
Stop reading it.

501
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,950
I’m afraid you will...

502
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,990
We have no other way.

503
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,670
We can’t get out, anyway.

504
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,120
I’d like to have a try.

505
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,270
Chuchu just pulled it open.

506
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,190
Let me push it!

507
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,230
Help me.

508
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,560
Push it harder!

509
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,600
I am…

510
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,560
Do you need any help?

511
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
We’ve got many more men.

512
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,950
Come and try

513
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,470
if you’re not scared of the mechanisms.

514
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,800
Push it hard!

515
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,560
Go on with it.
I’ll hold them back.

516
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,400
Attack!

517
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,840
Come and help me!

518
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,230
It’s open. Hurry! Go.

519
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,270
Go!

520
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,710
Are you alright?

521
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,510
Why is here another door?

522
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,950
No wonder it’s a place of Qi School.

523
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,080
A school has many doors.

524
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,080
The two stone phoenixes by the door

525
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,160
could be the mechanism to the door.

526
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,080
One on the left
and the other on the right.

527
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,560
A real one and a false one.

528
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,920
If we pick the false one,
we’ll trigger the trap.

529
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,840
There are mechanisms and doors.

530
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,670
Why do smart people like you

531
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,320
always do such complicated things?

532
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,670
You’re just too stupid to understand!

533
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,750
Go.

534
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,400
They’re right ahead. Hurry.

535
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,160
It’s too late.

536
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,920
Pick one and try our luck.

537
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,950
What...

538
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,190
It’s open.

539
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,840
If we could easily guess the right one,

540
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,360
it wouldn’t be a mechanism.

541
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,120
Go!

542
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,710
They’re over there. Block the door.

543
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,840
Yang Jin, give me your blade.

544
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,880
Stop him!

545
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,430
Lord, I was too slow.

546
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,600
Lord, here’s a mechanism.

547
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,320
Watch your steps.

548
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,880
Since there are so many mechanisms,

549
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,320
there must be hollow parts

550
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,840
in the walls.

551
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,670
They could be the fragile area.

552
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,840
Go find it out.

553
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,600
-Aye.
-Aye.

554
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,230
Look for it!

555
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,270
What’s that?

556
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,120
I’ll go have a look.

557
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,190
These patterns

558
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,320
look a bit familiar to me.

559
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,080
Stop looking.

560
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,920
Smash the door open.

561
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,710
Aye.

562
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,560
Shen Tianshu is catching up.

563
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,920
We can’t pin him down

564
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,120
unless we find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

565
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,670
Stop.

566
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,430
Knock again here.

567
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,190
Smash it.

568
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:24,990
Aye.

569
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,750
What are the Demons doing?

570
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,190
Pulling down the chamber?

571
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,320
Apparently, they’re trying to break in.

572
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,800
I don’t think it’s so easy

573
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,510
to break through the walls.

574
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,750
Mechanisms are everywhere.

575
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,270
The walls may be hollow.

576
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,400
If they keep smashing,

577
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,880
the walls will be broken soon.

578
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,430
Fei.

579
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,880
Fei, what’s wrong?

580
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,510
What happened to me?

581
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,430
I can’t even speak.

582
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,360
Fei.

583
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,920
Feels like

584
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,120
all my energy is being extracted
by the strong method.

585
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,360
I’m having less energy.

586
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,120
Why is this happening?
It doesn’t feel right.

587
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,230
Sheng, what did you find?

588
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,230
There are five patterns on the wall.

589
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,160
The one in the middle seems
to be half missing.

590
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,600
This half, I guess.

591
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,920
Stop.

592
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,400
Why can’t the patterns match

593
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,920
no matter how I observe?
