00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,110
Fei,

174
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,350
you must live well

175
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,590
with or without me.

176
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,030
Understand?

177
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,910
Has Zhou Fei talked to you recently?

178
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,320
No.

179
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,960
Not at all.

180
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,080
She’s only asked me

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,960
to work on your antidote.

182
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,590
Stop hiding it.

183
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,000
I already know.

184
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,520
You know she’s going to
test the antidote?

185
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,590
That silly girl.

186
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,350
I... I... I...

187
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,840
Hecong,

188
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,870
I can’t allow her to do that.

189
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
You two are making me...

190
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,230
No!

191
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,550
My life is hanging by a thread.

192
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,110
There are two antidotes.

193
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,470
One will cure me
while the other will kill me.

194
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,640
It’s 50-50.

195
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
I’ll pick one and live with it.

196
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,590
If it’s the right one,

197
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,790
that’s great.

198
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,230
If it’s not,

199
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,790
a dying man like me

200
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,440
has nothing to lose.

201
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
But Zhou Fei already...

202
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,400
As the heiress to the South Blade

203
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,350
and the new Head of All Sects,

204
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,400
she shoulders heavy responsibility.

205
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,520
She can’t take such a risk.

206
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,960
It’s said,

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,550
“life isn’t a joyride
and death isn’t torture”.

208
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,200
Can’t I choose to live or die?

209
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,790
What do you think?

210
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,520
I’m a physician.

211
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,150
A life for a life
is against my principle.

212
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,440
Alright.

213
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,520
If you’ve made your decision,

214
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,150
I’ll respect that.

215
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,790
Thank you.

216
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,790
Don’t worry.

217
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,670
I know what to do with Fei.

218
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,880
All I need

219
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,840
are the antidotes from you tomorrow.

220
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,080
Sure.

221
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,150
Oh,

222
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,520
one more thing.

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,670
What is it?

224
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,280
I also need knockout drops

225
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,350
that will last an entire night.

226
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,760
This one is colorless and odorless.

227
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Even Zhou Fei

228
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,670
is unable to detect it.

229
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,670
Thanks.

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,470
Fei,

232
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,240
I couldn’t have lived this long

233
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,800
without you.

234
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,120
If the antidote proves to be wrong,

235
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,000
I wish

236
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
I could stop being
Xiao Chuan in my next life.

237
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,030
I’d rather

238
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,760
be a weed in the Ximo River

239
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,150
to guard the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight day and night

240
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,590
as well as you.

241
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,440
Granduncle once said

242
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,890
death is simply

243
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,560
one of the eight pains.

244
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,730
Fei,

245
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,740
thanks to you,

246
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,880
my life,

247
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,580
however short it is,

248
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,460
is meaningful

249
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,680
without any regrets.

250
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,470
I’ve narrowed down

251
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,680
the last herb of your antidote

252
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,560
to Dry Grass or Dry Sprout,

253
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,320
but I’m not sure which one it is.

254
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,800
The wrong herb will kill you.

255
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,860
Fei.

256
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,440
Xie Meimei!

257
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,510
Fei,

258
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,560
see you

259
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,590
in 20 years.

260
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,350
I promise.

261
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,600
My blade can become

262
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,630
the most unpredictable through practice,

263
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,080
but what about my life?

264
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,720
In the end,

265
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,110
nothing is left.

266
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,030
Nothing helps.

267
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Xie Yun!

268
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,110
I must do something.

270
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,230
might be worth a shot.

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,340

351
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,840
Alright,

352
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,740
this is far enough.

353
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,990
After all that we’ve been through,

354
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,230
I’m used to having you around.

355
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,440
He’s leaving to rebuild
the Big Medicine Valley

356
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,710
to save more lives.

357
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,870
We should support him.

358
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,710
I suppose.

359
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,230
I’m lucky

360
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,510
to have met all of you.

361
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,970
And I’ve spent

362
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,590
the happiest

363
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,990
and most meaningful days

364
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,820
with you.

365
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,750
Thank you

366
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,750
for helping me

367
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,230
find the purpose of my life.

368
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,870
Bonehead,

369
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,440
cherish the girl next to you.

370
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,320
Yan,

371
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,830
if he upsets you,

372
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,230
just let me know.

373
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,110
“Snake girl” will teach him a lesson.

374
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,560
Sure. It’s a deal.

375
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,830
Well,

376
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,560
time to go.

377
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,230
See you.

378
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,230
See you.

379
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,470
Goodbye!

380
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,280
Take care.

381
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,090
Check the ruins of the Forbidden Hall

382
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:21,900
for hidden treasures.

383
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,330
Seize all of them.

384
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,020
Oh, no! Demons are here to catch us!

385
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,090
Go with your son Xiaohu.

386
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,780
Xiaohu.

387
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,500
Come here. Come. Get in. Do it.

388
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,850
Stay here. Don’t make a sound.

389
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,090
Go, go, go!

390
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,970
Run!

391
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,380
Anyone?

392
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,420
Xiaohu?

393
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,140
Ms. Chun?

394
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,140
Mr. Lyu?

395
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,420
Xiaohu, are you alright?

396
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,090
What happened?

397
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,450
They... They got my parents.

398
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,380
Report!

399
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,900
Go ahead.

400
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,380
Zhou Yitang’s tally

401
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,970
is in General Wen Yu’s hand.

402
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,810
They’ve camped 10 kilometers ahead.

403
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,500
Well done.

404
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,540
General,

405
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,370
a message from
Shen Tianshu of Demons Manor.

406
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,820
What is it?

407
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,210
He asks

408
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,020
to see you outside our camp

409
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,500
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

410
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,300
What?

411
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,100
General,

412
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,930
he’s ferocious.

413
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,860
This might be a trap.

414
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,500
You’d better not go.

415
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,580
That man is scheming.

416
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,890
He’d never bring up
the Color of Ocean and Heaven

417
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,410
for no reason

418
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,930
unless

419
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,890
he did find it.

420
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,970
Whatever it is,

421
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,060
I have to go.

422
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,970
General Wen,

423
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,780
long time no see.

424
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,820
How have you been?

425
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,060
Let’s get down to business.

426
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,500
I’m here to catch up.

427
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,410
You traitor!

428
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,370
Had I stayed,

429
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,860
Wang Lin would’ve
ruled the state long ago.

430
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,210
You’re so full of yourself!

431
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,020
Do I need to remind you

432
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,730
how you lost that hand?

433
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,970
If I hadn’t,

434
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,170
I wouldn’t have found out

435
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,100
from the blacksmith,
who made my Iron Hand,

436
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,780
about that amazing book,

437
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,300
Refinement of Iron.

438
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,210
Weapons made with techniques in it

439
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,370
are the sharpest and toughest.

440
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,100
And that book

441
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,780
is included in
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

442
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,890
Wen Yu,

443
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,970
I come to you for cooperation.

444
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,020
I own the best weapons

445
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,820
while you command crack troops.

446
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,140
If we join hands...

447
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,300
We’re different.

448
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,130
What a shame!

449
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,100
Wen Yu,

450
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,970
a smart man should choose wisely.

451
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,020
Why did Ying Hecong write to me?

452
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,100
Yes, why you alone?

453
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,620
Why didn’t he write to me?

454
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,890
How would I know?

455
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,060
Why you?

456
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,620
It should be us.

457
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,940
<i>To Zhou Fei</i>

458
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,370
I guess it’s to all of us.

459
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,450
“Fei,

460
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,340
I meant to return to the Valley

461
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,650
to practice medicine,

462
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,890
but once I arrived,

463
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,820
it was hell.

464
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,450
Hundreds of houses were burned.

465
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,690
Villagers were all abducted by Demons.

466
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,780
When I found Xiaohu,

467
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,260
he was desperate...”

468
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,580
Shen Tianshu!

469
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,650
That animal!

470
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,730
In that case,

471
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,260
he must’ve taken away

472
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,820
the treasure as well.

473
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
Report!

474
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,100
News came in

475
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,780
that Shen Tianshu killed General Wen Yu

476
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,580
and took the Tally of Anping Army.

477
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,370
General Wen Yu?

478
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:05,970
That’s right.

479
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,860
Even he...

480
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,780
Right now,

481
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,730
Anping Army is leaderless.

482
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,690
Shen Tianshu and Yu Wenzhi
are allies for long.

483
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,860
I’m afraid

484
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,690
he’s building his own power

485
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,340
to rule the state eventually.

486
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,100
If those two

487
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,370
launch attacks against each other,

488
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,300
countless civilians will suffer.

489
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,170
We must stop them.

490
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,260
That’s right.

491
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,500
It’s time to settle a score with them.

492
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,860
Ask Ying Hecong to come here.

493
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,370
I’m sure he’ll help us.

494
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,890
Sheng and I

495
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,540
will take care of Yu Wenzhi.

496
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,930
What about me?

497
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,650
You should...

498
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,730
Stay and watch the house.

499
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,020
That’s right.

500
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,690
We need someone we trust
to hold the fort.

501
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,930
Sure.

502
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,650
I won’t let you down.

503
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,580
Time is running out.

504
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,930
Let’s go get ready.

505
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,820
I hope the Fortress is still intact

506
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,060
when we get back.

507
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,130
Alright.

508
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,650
Let’s go.

509
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,540
Officials have agreed

510
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,130
to meet with me at the inn in two days.

511
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,410
We’d better hurry up.

512
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,170
I’m sorry for the trouble, Chuchu.

513
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,130
No trouble at all

514
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,650
as long as you’re here with me.

515
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
Let’s go.

516
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,930
Sure.

517
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,890
-Hyah!
-Hyah!

518
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,650
Weapons you made are sharp

519
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,820
but fragile.

520
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,340
Hey, you,

521
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,060
did you follow

522
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,860
Xie Yun’s method to the word?

523
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,100
We did, Lord Shen,

524
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,020
and the weapons

525
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,540
ended up like this.

526
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,730
I believe

527
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,170
he made a wrong demonstration

528
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,100
deliberately for us to copy.

529
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,410
So weapons we made aren’t durable.

530
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,540
Aren’t you an expert?

531
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,620
Couldn’t you tell what’s wrong?

532
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,130
Show me the new blade.

533
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,820
Yes.

534
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,930
Hold it.

535
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,100
If you

536
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,650
can’t be of use,

537
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,500
join your useless ancestors

538
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,780
in hell.

539
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,300
Lord Shen, Lord...

540
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,970
Lord Shen, Lord Shen,

541
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,500
I think

542
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,860
I know

543
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,500
what he did wrong.

544
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,650
I’m listening.

545
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,260
Crumbles

546
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,500
he added

547
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,540
weakened the blade,

548
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
so it broke

549
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,060
soon after being used.

550
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,020
Fix it now.

551
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,370
Yes. Yes.

552
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,260
How’s the investigation going?

553
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,650
Lord Lu,

554
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,340
I’ve checked with those

555
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,260
who went to Hanshui Town that day.

556
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,540
They said

557
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,620
Lord Shen seemed to

558
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,260
left Lord Hu behind

559
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,260
to cover the rest of them.

560
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,370
So...

561
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,210
So she got killed by Zhou Fei.

562
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,970
Shen Tianshu,

563
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,970
we were always obedient

564
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,500
and loyal,

565
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,970
but you

566
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,450
threw us away like trash.

567
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,700

568
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,970
I did it!

569
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,410
I did it!

570
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,100
I succeeded!

571
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,340
Finally!

572
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,970
Yes! I nailed it!

573
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,340
What’s the good news?

574
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,410
Lord Lu,

575
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,620
I’ve cracked the Refinement of Iron.

576
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,970
The newly made blade

577
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,970
is sharp

578
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,580
and unbreakable.

579
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,210
It’s the king of blades!

Yesterday, I was on patrol

583
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,780
and found that blacksmith
packing up to escape.

584
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,300
Turns out he had cracked
Refinement of Iron

585
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,210
and prepared to leave with it.

586
