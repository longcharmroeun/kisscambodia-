You’re smart.

21
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,800

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,910
Look.

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,000
It’s snowing

That’s my grandfather.

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,070
He and the Mountain Sword

56
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,160
had admired each other for long.

57
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,660
Maybe that’s what they say

58
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,600
like knows like.

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,510
You could fight as long as you like,

60
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,920
but why did you break your weapons?

61
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,110
Stop! What’s there to laugh?

62
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,270
What a pity!

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,320
Miss,

64
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,950
someday,

65
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,320
when you find

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,040
your like-minded friend,

67
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
you’ll understand

68
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,550
why we’re laughing.

69
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,390
Weapons can be broken

70
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,640
but not the friendship.

71
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,110
The South Blade

72
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,440
and the Mountain Sword

73
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,790
lost their weapons together.

74
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,000
How ironic!

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,640
Then I returned to the Yuyi Troupe

76
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,550
and had someone

77
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,160
make replicas

78
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,830
of the weapons

79
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,920
they used.

80
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,110
Before I had the chance to give them,

81
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,110
I heard

82
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,720
some rich guy in Penglai

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,510
gave Master Yin
a suit of armor and a sword.

84
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,920
Thinking that

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,350
those priceless treasures

86
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,760
were much better

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,600
than my cheap replicas,

88
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,790
I decided not to embarrass myself.

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,160
Unexpectedly,

90
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,760
two years later,

91
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,320
I couldn’t see them ever again.

92
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,160
So,

93
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,640
as Master Li’s granddaughter,

94
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,880
I want you to take this blade

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,480
to help you practice.

96
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,070
I don’t need it anymore.

97
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,640
After all,

98
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,270
it’s what I owe your grandfather.

99
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,230
Thank you.

100
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,000
I’m old and nagging

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,720
that I told you so much
about the past.

102
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,640
Sit back.

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,320
I still have questions for you.

104
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,670
Who taught you the Mayfly Moves?

105
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,950
Well,

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,440
when we

107
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,760
left the dungeon in Huo’s Manor,

108
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
we ran into a Taoist priest
of the Qi School.

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
He taught me that.

110
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,230
What about Dragon Master?

111
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,440
Did you kill him?

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,110
No.

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,920
I just stalled him

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,390
to buy time for Master Ji.

115
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,480
He forcibly rebuilt his veins

116
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,830
by the Soul-searching Needle

117
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,170
and finished Dragon Master.

118
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,270
You and Qian Suiyou...

119
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,200
We also

120
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,880
met in the dungeon.

121
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
She saved me, to be precise.

122
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,370
You were there, too?

123
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,510
They couldn’t have

124
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,880
hired you to arrange a play, could they?

125
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,390
Stop pretending, young lady.

126
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,070
As far as I know,

127
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,160
you’re asked

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,760
to escort the late General Wu’s children

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,320
to your Fortress by Leader Li.

130
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
Is there anyone else with you?

131
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,320
Qiu Tianjin was hunting us

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,200
in Huarong like crazy

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,520
for a reason.

134
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,000
He must be after something

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,480
Chuchu has.

136
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,950
I can’t leak that out

137
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,600
no matter what.

138
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,390
I’m asking you.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
I...

140
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,040
Something happened

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,210
and I got separated from my family.

142
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
Fei,

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
you’re spoiled.

144
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,470
What happened?

145
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,150
I was treated unfairly

146
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,840
by my parents

147
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,030
because I am a girl.

148
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,030
I got mad and left

149
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,670
and ran into Chuchu

150
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,030
who followed me out.

151
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,790
Later,

152
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,230
when I saw bandits robbing passengers,

153
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,910
I became furious

154
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,280
and...

155
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,400
and interfered.

156
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,640
I chased the bandits

157
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,910
and ended up in that dungeon.

158
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,640
How come?

159
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
I thought parents

160
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,400
would care more about girls.

161
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,760
You know,

162
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,400
when I was about your age,

163
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,520
I was well cared for.

164
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,910
Unlike you,

165
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,670
she has a rough childhood.

166
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,520
Alright, it’s late.

167
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,710
Hey,

168
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,440
you haven’t slept well lately

169
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
and you’re still weak.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,880
Go back and get some rest.

171
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,080
You still

172
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,550
have a long way ahead.

173
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,400
Good night.

174
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,350
Good night.

175
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Wenlan,

176
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,440
as Zheng expected,

177
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,520
his daughter gave birth

178
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,110
to a pretty and smart girl.

179
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,570
She’s tough enough

180
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,910
to pass down his Snow-breaking Blade.

181
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,200
I wonder

182
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,030
how that boy is.

183
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,220
<i>Cortex Dictamni</i>

184
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,280
Hand over the scabbard of the
Mountain Sword if you want to live!

185
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,150
No way,

186
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,710
unless you kill me first!

187
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,790
Who is it?

188
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,880
You’re awake as expected.

189
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,230
Mr. Chongxiao said you’d wake up soon.

190
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,640
Who?

191
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,710
Mr. Chongxiao,

192
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,640
the one who saved you.

193
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,280
He saved me

194
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,470
only to steal my scabbard, didn’t he?

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,520
What?

196
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,470
Nothing. Take me to see him.

197
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,280
Let’s go.

198
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,440
Let go of me.

199
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,440
-Where are your manners?
-Let’s go. Come on.

200
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,590
Let go! Where am I?

201
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,230
Mr. Chongxiao’s house
is on the mountaintop.

202
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,520
Who is Mr. Chongxiao?

203
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,000
Chongxiao is his name.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,280
What’s this place?

205
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,200
Mr. Chongxiao said

206
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,910
this is where
the Big Medicine Valley was

207
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,110
but got deserted for long.

208
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,520
Now, it’s a shelter for the homeless.

209
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,710
A shelter for the homeless?

210
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,960
Yes.

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,470
More like a base for his own force.

212
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,200
By the way, I’m Xiaohu.

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,670
I’m also homeless.

214
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,910
Unlike the others,

215
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,910
I’m responsible for

216
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,350
taking care of Mr. Chongxiao

217
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,590
as he insists on living alone.

218
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,230
So I come here regularly.

219
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,550
Are you also homeless?

220
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,760
None of your business.

221
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,670
Relax. Don’t worry.

222
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,880
From now on, this is your home, too.

223
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,230
And what’s your name?

224
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,150
You have too many questions!

225
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,550
Follow me.

226
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,470
Where to?

227
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,110
-You...
-Come on.

228
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,550
Do you know what you’re doing?

229
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,910
Do you know who I am?

230
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,030
I don’t care.

231
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,670
Let go of me! Let go!

232
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,790
Mr. Chongxiao,

233
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,230
he’s awake.

234
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,670
Finally.

235
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,840
You must be hungry coming out of a coma.

236
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,080
Do I know you?

237
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Taoist Priest Chongxiaozi.

238
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,470
I held you when you were little.

239
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,520
You even peed on me.

240
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,790
Another friend of my father’s.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,110
He had friends

242
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,350
all over the world.

243
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,280
Yes, he did.

244
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,030
Swords represent gentlemen,

245
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,790
and the Mountain Sword tops all.

246
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,320
I’m not sure

247
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,320
if your fathers’ skills
are second to none,

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,640
but no one

249
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,740
deserves to be called
a gentleman other than him.

250
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,000
A gentleman?

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,400
Yes.

252
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
He was too gentle

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,640
to see through others’ lies.

254
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,520
I’ve met tons of

255
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,270
his so-called friends.

256
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,400
They’re all after my family heirloom.

257
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Hey,

258
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,030
how could you say that?

259
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,320
Mr. Chongxiao saved you!

260
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,710
He saved me?

261
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,110
For what?

262
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,440
First, you saved me.

263
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,080
Then you’d take me in as your disciple

264
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
and teach me skills, right?

265
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,470
Is there anything new?

266
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,600
Which animal taught you skills?

267
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,910
You were born weak

268
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,590
and injured internally.

269
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,440
You aren’t fit to practice any skills.

270
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,390
You’re a terrible liar.

271
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,350
Others would offer me something,

272
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,550
yet you wouldn’t give me any.

273
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,470
You’re worse than them.

274
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,420
You know if I’m lying or not.

275
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,200
When you try to mobilize your strength,

276
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,080
do you feel your energy running wild,

277
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,880
your body numb
and hands and feet trembling?

278
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
Can you practice skills

279
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,640
like this?

280
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
I don’t feel anything.

281
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,060
You’re talking nonsense.

282
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,830
You don’t?

283
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,330
No.

284
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,230
Xiaohu,

285
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,520
take him to go get water.

286
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,350
You’re back.

287
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,930
You can’t wait any longer, can you?

288
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,510
Just quit it.

289
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,560
I’ve brought the scabbard with me.

290
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,710
Son,

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,490
I’m sorry for all your suffering.

292
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,950
Drop your act.

293
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
Although you saved me,

294
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,310
I don’t believe

295
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,040
you’d do that to a stranger

296
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,160
for nothing.

297
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,310
I did it for your father’s sake.

298
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,880
Otherwise,

299
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,160
as idle as I was,

300
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,520
I wouldn’t have gone

301
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,950
all the way to look for you

302
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,590
simply based on hearsay.

303
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
Go on.

304
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,310
Keep going.

305
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,110
This is

306
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,040
your father’s letter to me.

307
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,470
Read it.

308
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,380
<i>Priest Chongxiao,
I heard chaos is rising.</i>

309
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,780
<i>About what you mentioned last time...</i>

310
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,880
That’s his handwriting.

311
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,040
They say you’re what you write.

312
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,470
Your father’s handwriting

313
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,160
is smooth and well-honed.

314
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,950
Obviously,

315
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,640
he practiced long and hard.

316
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,350
No one

317
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,710
could copy his style.

318
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,760
<i>Sincerely, Yin Wenlan</i>
Look at Li Zheng.

319
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,560
<i>Sincerely, Yin Wenlan</i>
Although he was a top martial artist

320
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,640
and established his own sect,

321
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,950
his family was inferior to yours

322
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,710
in terms of literary attainments.

323
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,430
What a pity!

324
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,190
What a pity!

325
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,880
Why?

326
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,670
My family isn’t gone.

327
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,110
I, Yin Pei, am still alive!

328
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,280
That’s right.

329
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,820
You’re also a Yin.

330
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
Your physique is poor,

331
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,800
but you aren’t too dull.

332
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,830
There’s still hope
to restore your family’s reputation.

333
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,230
My physique isn’t poor!

334
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,230
Didn’t you get it

335
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,040
when carrying the water?

336
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,110
You aren’t even as strong

337
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,640
as a kid.

338
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,560
Believe it

339
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
or not,

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
you’d better

341
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,670
not use or practice any skills again.

342
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
Or the bloodline of the Yin family

343
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,310
stops at you.

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,690
Stop looking. They’ve all left.

348
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,290
Yuyi Troupe does this all the time.

349
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,430
It’s still warm.

350
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,880
You can’t make them stay.

351
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
Why they insist on leaving?

352
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,460
Because...

353
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,280
Because it’s a secret.

354
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,680
That’s utter nonsense!

355
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,280
Are you killing your dear...?

356
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,760
Dear friend?

357
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Are you my friend?

358
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,760
You’re mine.

359
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
Miss Zhou.

360
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,800
Have some tea.

361
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Yuyi Troupe and Mingfeng Building

362
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
in your Fortress

363
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,800
were neck and neck over ten years ago.

364
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
It’s their rule

365
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,190
to leave quietly.

366
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,070
I understand.

367
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,590
Fei,

368
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,950
what are you going to do next?

369
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,710
What else?

370
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,520
I’ve been out for so long.

371
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,870
It’s time to go back home

372
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,150
and practice my skills.

373
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,830
Can you

374
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,770
take me back with you?

375
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,920
Can’t you walk?

376
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
Do I have to carry you?

377
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,640
Alright.

378
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,640
Who?

379
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,110
Yang Jin has just left.

380
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,220
Is someone else coming to challenge me?

381
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,040
Anyone?

382
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,880
Mr. Ma!

383
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,310
Fei!

384
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,760
Mr. Ma,

385
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,230
you had no idea what I went through.

386
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,280
You know

387
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,830
that bonehead and old fogy

388
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,350
cheated me, held me hostage

389
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,590
and threatened me
in order to battle Fei.

390
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,880
Held you hostage?

391
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,710
Threatened you?

392
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,830
You were well-fed there

393
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,160
and you look round.

394
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,830
How come Leader

395
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,830
let you out?

396
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,310
Did you act up again?

397
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,710
No, Fei.

398
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,830
I can explain.

399
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,070
Those stories they told

400
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,950
made me proud of you.

401
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,110
Yan,

402
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,800
what were you thinking

403
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,510
by going out alone to hear stories?

404
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,800
Luckily, Yang Jin didn’t harm you.

405
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,350
He only meant to challenge Fei.

406
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,640
Otherwise,

407
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,160
what should I

408
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,280
and Fei

409
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,000
say to Leader

410
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,980
and the deceased Old Master?

411
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,760
Sit back.

412
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,280
Sit down.

413
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,760
Now, you’re crying?

414
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,920
Zip it! No more tears.

415
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,920
Calm down.

416
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,290
We’re all safe.

417
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,230
Fei,

418
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,590
who is he?

419
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,310
The one who kidnapped uncle.

420
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,520
What?

421
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,230
He’s a friend.

422
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,710
A friend?

423
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,310
I did deliver a letter

424
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,280
to Lord Gantang,

425
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,820
but I’m no kidnapper.

426
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,640
I first met Fei

427
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,680
in the dungeon in Huo’s Manor.

428
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,330
Since then
we’ve been traveling together.

429
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,870
That’s right.

430
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,090
Hey, where’s Sheng?

431
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,920
He...

432
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,000
He got separated from us

433
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,110
right after we set off.

434
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,790
I don’t know where he is now.

435
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,000
Look at you!

436
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,190
You’re a bunch of troublemakers!

437
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,710
I’ve had enough.

438
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,830
Now that you’re back,

439
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,880
do not

440
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
leave again.

441
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,350
I’ll go pack up.

442
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,800
Let’s go home.

443
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,880
Sure.

444
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,910
Are we leaving so soon?

445
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,110
Are you done,

446
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,310
mad dog?

447
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,260
<i>Kelai Tailor’s Shop</i>

448
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,950
We’re close to Chunhui Town

449
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,400
and we should be safe for now.

450
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Why don’t you get changed?

451
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
I should.

452
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,400
It’s better to meet Leader Li

453
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,160
in a dress.

454
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,540
<i>Kelai Tailor’s Shop</i>

455
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,830
Welcome, sirs.

456
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,640
What can I offer you?

457
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,980
She needs a dress.

458
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
I’m sorry, Miss.

459
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,590
You’re gorgeous.

460
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,230
We have

461
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,920
all kinds of dresses.

462
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Feel free to look around.

463
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,160
What about this one?

464
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,710
I just finished it earlier today.

465
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,000
You’ll look great in it.

466
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,590
This one then.

467

<i>Timely Wind and Rain</i>

468
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,280
You can hang out.

469
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,000
I’ll take care of the carriage
and the horse.

470
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,710
Thanks, Mr. Ma.

471
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,190
I’m leaving.

472
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,280
Be careful.

473
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,800
I will.

474
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
Unload everything.

475
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,000
Fei, what’s that shop?

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,220
Let’s go take a look.

477
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,640
I think

478
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
they sell snacks.

479
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,820
Really?

480
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,930
Would you like some?

481
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,550
Come on. Let’s go.

482
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,230
Toys.

483
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,070
-Have a look.
-Haws on a stick.

484
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,190
Rain hats for rent.

485
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,950
I made a mistake.

486
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,680
The snack shop might be that way.

487
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,310
Over there?

488
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
Haws on a stick.

489
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,040
Rain hats for rent.

490
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,920
Zhang.

491
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,350
Jili, you’re back.

492
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,160
Hello.

493
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,110
Have you got what I asked for?

494
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,400
All ready.

495
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
Let me see.

496
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,280
They are cheap

497
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,640
but made of fine fabric.

498
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,560
See for yourself.

499
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,350
I know.

500
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,190
Mr. Ma, why do you need cheap clothes?

501
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,400
Nothing. Nothing really.

502
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,350
It’s hard to be a father.

503
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,470
He’s away from home all the time

504
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,520
and tries to save
as much money as he can.

505
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,400
But the kids need new clothes,

506
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,880
so he asked me...

507
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,640
Alright. Enough.

508
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,920
Say no more.

509
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,280
Here’s the money.

510
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
Hold on.

511
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
That’s too much.

512
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
Not at all.

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,590
I know you’re being kind

514
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,160
by telling me they’re cheap,

515
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,590
but I can’t

516
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,710
take advantage of you.

517
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,160
If you don’t take the money,

518
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,190
I won’t ask you

519
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,760
for the unsold stock again.

520
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,400
-Take it.
-Fine.

521
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,230
I’ll take it.

522
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,710
Bag them all.

523
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,280
Fei.

524
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,230
Sir,

525
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,040
may I pick it up and have a look?

526
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,920
Sure. Of course.

527
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,950
Mr. Ma,

528
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,000
will I look good in this?

529
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,880
Yes.

530
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,280
Of course, Fei.

531
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,070
Am I right?

532
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,520
Hey,

533
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,310
take my advice

534
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,880
and dress yourself up.

535
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,520
You’ll look so pretty.

536
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,350
You know what,

537
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,350
you and my eldest daughter

538
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,000
are about the same height and weight.

539
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,680
That’s right.

540
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,310
In that case,

541
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,110
what suits me

542
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,760
also suits her.

543
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,310
Take this as a gift.

544
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,800
No, Fei.

545
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,350
Bag it, sir.

546
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,280
-This is too much.
-Here’s the money.

547
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,160
It’s expensive.

548
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,230
You shouldn’t do this.

549
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,000
Mr. Ma, just take it.

550
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,470
You’ve been taking care
of me along the way.

551
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,160
If Mother knows
I didn’t thank you properly,

552
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,430
she’ll call me ungrateful.

553
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,680
Fei, it’s just too much.

554
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,110
I cannot have it.

555
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,070
Just take it and go home

556
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,350
for the kids to try on.

557
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,160
It’s the least we should do.

558
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,160
Take it.

559
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,520
Take it.

560
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,950
Thank you. Thanks.

561
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,520
Thanks, Fei.

562
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,280
You’re welcome.

563
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,280
That was generous of you
but I was going to

564
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,430
buy you a make-do blade
with that money.

565
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,520
You owe me a better one

566
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,560
than a make-do blade.

567
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,110
Write another song and sell it,

568
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,540
then you can afford it.

569
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,870
I won’t take anything
less than this one.

570
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,880
Aren’t you picky?

571
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,230
Have some tea.

572
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,590
Young man,

573
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,400
are you with the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight?

574
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,880
How do you know?

575
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
That’s easy.

576
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
Your look tells me

577
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,230
you’re a martial artist

578
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,040
and the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

579
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,350
is the only sect in this area.

580
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,160
There are no other sects.

581
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,830
I must say you’re lucky.

582
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,350
Although your wife dresses up as a man,

583
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,640
she’s obviously,

584
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,760
a lady.

585
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,520
You mistook us.

586
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,760
She’s not my wife.

587
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,680
I’m so sorry.

588
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,040
Have some tea.

589
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,590
Sheng,

590
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,400
do I look good in this?

591
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,000
Yes. Absolutely.

592
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,470
Ma’am,

593
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,230
I’ll take this one.

594
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Young man,

595
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,920
go pick something for yourself.

596
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Oh, no,

597
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,280
I’m dizzy.

598
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,420
Get some rest.

599
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,100
Are you alright?

600
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,160
Ma’am,

601
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,850
whose horse is it outside?

602
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,070
It’s mine.

603
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,560
Could you sell it to me?

604
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,680
Sure.

605
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,660
<i>Chunhui Inn</i>

606
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,160
We’re close to the Fortress.

607
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,430
Why are we resting here

608
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,950
instead of going uphill?

609
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,160
Fei,

610
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,760
don’t tell me

611
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,470
you’re waiting to get a good look

612
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,950
of your home before going back.

613
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,960
What’s there to look?

614
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,800
Is that my home or yours?

615
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,110
It’s dark

616
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,350
and misty in the woods.

617
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,110
We would’ve got lost.

618
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,590
And...

619
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,560
Well...

620
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,110
Uh...

621
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,470
Do a headcount and make a list of names.

622
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,160
Get all your badges ready.

623
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,400
Give the list and badges

624
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,710
to the first checkpoint before entry.

625
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,710
Yes.

626
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,520
On top of that,

627
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,560
all members must
go through identity checks.

628
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,740
There will be...

629
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,110
There will be...

630
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,350
What?

631
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,280
Our own members

632
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,760
will be checked twice.

633
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,430
The process will be slightly
complicated for strangers,

634
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,880
including authorization
by at least one Elder.

635
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,470
That will take two to three days.

636
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,680
Correct.

637
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,880
Mr. Ma is right.

638
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,640
No wonder.

639
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,830
Alright, everyone, go get prepared.

640
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,600
Yes.

641
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,230
Let’s go.

642
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,840
Brace up and tidy up.

643
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,560
Mr. Ma,

644
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,350
I’m ready.

645
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,590
When can we eat?

646
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,640
I’m starving.

647
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,070
Just a minute.

648
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,680
Mr. Xie, you’ve been to our place once

649
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,470
and you must be familiar

650
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,190
with the checks and the rules.

651
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,920
What are you doing? Come here.

652
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,640
Come over. Why are you here?

653
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,280
Let go!

654
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,400
You people are rude!

655
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,110
Say that to yourself!

656
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,520
You already lost to Fei.

657
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,830
Why are you stalking us?

658
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,560
Speak!

659
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,160
What are you up to?

660
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,210
Nothing.

661
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,590
Greetings, head of the Cloud Ravine.

662
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,160
You abducted my cousin

663
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,680
to force me to battle.

664
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,620
You lost and started to tail us.

665
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,350
Are you

666
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,110
going to abduct one of us again?

667
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,830
You won by luck!

668
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,110
Let’s practice in your Fortress

669
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,800
and I’ll challenge you again.

670
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,310
Even my mother
isn’t so keen on my practice.

671
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,640
Why can’t he

672
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,560
give up and let me go?

673
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,950
You didn’t listen
when I said not to battle him.

674
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,150
Look. You can’t get rid of him.

675
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,080
You shouldn’t be here. Get out now!

676
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,190
Do you know what this place is?

677
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,600
You aren’t welcome here.

678
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,230
And

679
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,190
you haven’t paid the price

680
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,630
for abducting me.

681
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,520
You...

682
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,600
You people...

683
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,080
When you were under my roof,

684
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,120
I treated you as a princess.

685
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,520
Were that called abduction,

686
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,870
many would die for such treatment.

687
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,800
You don’t own this place.

688
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,870
I’m not leaving.

689
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,560
You... You...

690
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,520
What are you doing?

691
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,600
I can’t believe

692
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,360
the South Blade’s offspring is a thief.

693
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,120
I didn’t steal it.

694
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,630
I simply took it.

695
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,040
Just like you took me

696
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,320
for your own purpose.

697
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,470
Give it back!

698
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,080
Give it to me!

699
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,870
No way.

700
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,360
That must be important.

701
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,280
So,

702
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,430
what is it?

703
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,150
Say it, or I’ll toss it away.

704
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,910
That’s the Five-bat Token
of the Route Gang.

705
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,390
When traveling with that token,

706
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,040
the Route Gang

707
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,170
will take care of everything on the way.

708
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,230
It’s quite useful.

709
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,520
Keep it, Fei.

710
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,320
I don’t need it.

711
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,390
Just take it

712
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,560
as a prize

713
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,190
for winning that bonehead.

714
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,670
Thanks.

715
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,560
Feel free to stay here.

716
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,630
You can’t enter the Fortress anyway.

717
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,630
Look what you’ve done!

718
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,800
I’ll talk to him.

719
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,120
He’s the head
of the Small Medicine Valley.

720
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,600
Better not make enemies with him.

721
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,120
Behave yourself.

722
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,430
He kidnapped me!

723
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,280
Look what the cat drags in.

724
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,120
Mr. Yutai.

725
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
What brings you here?

726
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,670
To pay respects to you, of course.

727
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,600
How have you been?

728
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,670
I eat three fish per meal.

729
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,910
You tell me.

730
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,430
Your sense of humor never dies.

731
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,040
Come here.

732
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,840
Let’s chat here.

733
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,990
I received a letter
to the head of Mingfeng.

734
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,470
I thought it was addressed to me,

735
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,760
so I opened it.

736
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,320
Here it is.

737
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,430
<i>Yu Wenzhi Bai</i>

738
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,320
What will come will come.

739
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,670
What do you think

740
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,360
we should do?

741
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,040
I didn’t know the whole truth

742
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,190
about Mingfeng’s retreat

743
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,080
other than the fact

744
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,000
that we offended a powerful force.

745
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,230
The letter

746
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,710
we received

747
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,810
shows they intend to make peace.

748
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,710
I wonder if there’s more to it.

749
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,000
Whatever it is,

750
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,760
if they attempt

751
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,080
to provoke us,

752
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,230
we should let them know

753
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,800
they’re making a mistake.

754
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,040
It’s been so long.

755
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,670
If we can clear the air,

756
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,430
That will be good.

757
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,150
That way, we can stop holing up

758
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,670
with nothing to do.

759
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,040
You have a point.

760
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,430
But,

761
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,560
back then, you’d

762
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,320
do anything

763
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,630
to avoid being a spy.

764
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,630
You refused to be one.

765
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,390
Now,

766
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,390
you seem to have changed your mind.

767
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,190
Well,

768
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,320
the past is the past.

769
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,390
All I want is to

770
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,150
restore Mingfeng to its former glory.

771
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,000
I see.

772
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,430
The thing is

773
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,390
those famous spies

774
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,760
all ended up dead, didn’t they?

775
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,820
Those of the Yuyi Troupe

776
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,810
are the only survivors

777
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,640
because they’ve quit.

778
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,800
Now, they’re selling
information instead.

779
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,040
That’s actually not bad.

780
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,140
At least, they’re still alive.

781
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,610
Whichever path you take,

782
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,510
the most important thing

783
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,180
is to choose your direction.

784
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,150
Let’s pretend

785
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,910
we’ve never seen this letter.

786
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,280
Yes, I understand.

787
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,040
Good day.

788
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,910
Dan,

789
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,050
where did you

790
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
get this letter?

791
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,870
Someone gave it to our member

792
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,560
who went out to do grocery shopping.

793
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,400
They must have been
staking out for long.

794
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,630
Had I

795
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,870
had any ill intentions,

796
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,520
I wouldn’t have shown the letter to you.

797
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,760
I know.

798
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,760
Lord Gantang.

799
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,280
General Wen.

800
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,570
Didn’t you bring him back?

801
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,410
No, I’m afraid,

802
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,660
but His Highness is safe.

803
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,320
It’s just that

804
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,360
Miss Zhou Fei

805
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,800
seems unwell.

806
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,870
So have I been told

807
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,670
by the scouts

808
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,230
I sent to gather information.

809
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,390
I failed in my duty

810
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,390
to bring His Highness
and Miss Zhou back.

811
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,230
It’s not your fault.

812
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,710
There isn’t much we can do.

813
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,280
Luckily, Mr. Xie is resourceful

814
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,800
and Fei is always blessed.

815
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,340
Those two

816
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,950
can look after each other

817
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,190
and get out of the woods.

818
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,910
I’m sure

819
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,430
Miss Zhou will be fine.

820
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,670
I hope so.

821
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,520
Lord Gantang,

822
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,390
there’s one more thing.

823
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,870
I ran into Gu Tianxian at Mount Heng.

824
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Gu Tianxian?

825
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,390
He’s with the Demons Manor.

826
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,630
What was he doing there?

827
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,910
I was confused, too.

828
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,670
Soon after I found Miss Wu,

829
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,710
we were attacked by Demons.

830
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,870
Your nephew Li Sheng

831
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,600
helped us out.

832
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Then Gu Tianxian and his men

833
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,190
left for somewhere,

834
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,840
later known to be Hengyang,

835
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,760
according to Miss Wu and Li Sheng.

836
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,230
Someone was waiting for him there.

837
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,230
Report!

838
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,120
Lord Gantang,

839
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,710
we still haven’t heard anything

840
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,840
about the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

841
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,760
I see.

842
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,800
You may leave.

843
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,600
Yes.

844
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,230
Gu Tianxian must have gone to Hengyang

845
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,280
for a reason.

846
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,470
General Wen,

847
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,190
I received a tip-off a few days ago,

848
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,600
saying Yu Wenzhi
had been spotted at Demons Manor.

849
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,230
With Gu Tianxian in Hengyang,

850
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,500
unrest is growing everywhere.

851
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,360
There must be more

852
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,000
under the table.

853
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,360
Lord Gantang,

854
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
do you mean those two are...

855
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,910
I wish I were wrong.

856
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,390
Mr. Yutai.

857
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,190
While Leader is away,

858
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,230
I came to check
the Spinning Wire Formation.

859
00:44:53,263 --> 00:45:03,263

860

Here.

861
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,710
Let’s drink.

862
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,630
Fei,

863
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,760
people from the Fortress

864
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,000
will probably arrive tomorrow.

865
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,840
Guards at the checkpoint said

866
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,630
Leader had gone out.

867
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,710
So the security

868
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,560
becomes tighter.

869
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,670
Is Leader out?

870
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,920
That’s rare.

871
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,670
Alight,

872
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,150
get some rest after the meal.

873
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,120
Don’t stay up too late.

874
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,230
Yan,

875
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,710
I mean you.

876
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,190
Starting from tomorrow,

877
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,000
no more lie-ins.

878
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,120
You’ve been slack lately.

879
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,190
Mr. Ma,

880
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,710
<i>Liquor</i>
what’s going on outside?

881
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,800
Whatever it is,

882
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,670
it has nothing to do with you, got it?

883
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,710
Are you done?

884
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,190
Go upstairs to sleep.

885
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,600
Go!

886
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,080
Go away.

887
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,890
When will she grow up?

888
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,950
Have a good night.

889
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,040
Fei.

890
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:24,950
You too.

891
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,560
Sure.
