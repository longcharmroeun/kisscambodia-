00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,480
Li Sheng asked us to meet him there.

172
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,000
He’s going to kill Yin Pei?

173
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,510
The martial world is now disunited.

174
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,880
Your cousin has the potential
to be the Head of All Sects.

175
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,880
He has the potential to dream about it.

176
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
He has poor martial arts

177
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,270
and he wants to kill Yin Pei?

178
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,680
Isn’t he risking his neck?

179
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,080
All right.

180
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,390
Let’s go help him.

181
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,440
Is this the way to Liu’s Manor?

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
It is, Miss Zhou.

183
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,640
Except Jiankang,

184
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,880
where else do you want to go?

185
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,730
The Xiang River.

186
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,710
It’s not far away from my home.

187
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,810
You stayed there?

188
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,950
I stayed on Penglai Island
for the longest time.

189
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,350
I stayed in Jiangling for a while.

190
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,780
I just went to the Xiang River
for a few times.

191
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,080
Why do you want to go there?

192
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,260
When my father suppressed the rebellion,

193
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,680
he was drowned in the Xiang River.

194
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,990
At that time,

195
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,420
I was only one year old.

196
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,910
Then my dynasty was gone.

197
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,500
I became a prince in exile.

198
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,250
Whenever I was in confusion
or in danger,

199
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,890
I went to find an answer
by the Xiang River.

200
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,620
I didn’t remember my father.

201
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,770
But later, I got to know

202
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,680
my father told his subordinate

203
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,020
that he would die in the Xiang River

204
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,400
before he went out to the battle.

205
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,930
He even told about his own funeral.

206
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,600
Sounds like

207
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,070
he didn’t care about his death.

208
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,330
Now think about it.

209
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,950
Back then, he might be

210
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,950
under the same situation

211
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
as mine.

212
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,470
You don’t need to be depressed.

213
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,200
You’re different from your father.

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,710
To be bestowed with big responsibility,
you must be crucified

215
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,680
with ordeal and tribulation
to break your will.

216
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,170
Everything will be fine.

217
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,030
You’ve read a lot of books lately.

218
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,640
What’s wrong with you?

219
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,390
You poked me so hard.

220
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,640
I...

221
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,910
I was tricking you.

222
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,200
Who do you want?

223
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
You must be Lord Liu.

224
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,830
I’m Wu Chuchu
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

225
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,030
Please leave.

226
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,510
Come some other day.

227
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,880
Today is my mother’s birthday.

228
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,080
I have guests.

229
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,760
You’d better leave

230
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
and come some other day.

231
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,330
Lord Liu.

232
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,760
Chuchu?

233
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,350
Sheng.

234
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,100
What brings you here?

235
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,060
<i>Forever Longevity</i>

236
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,510
It’s about time.

237
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,830
Today is

238
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,710
my mother’s birthday party!

239
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,390
As the saying goes,

240
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,440
when someone is 73 or 84 years old,

241
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,350
even if the King of Hell
doesn’t want him,

242
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,710
he will die.

243
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,000
Who are you cursing?

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,030
Who are you cursing?

245
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,950
Mother, don’t be angry.

246
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,510
I haven’t finished yet.

247
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,710
Sit back. Sit down.

248
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,200
But I...

249
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
I don’t believe that.

250
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
So,

251
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,510
I invite you here

252
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,480
to have fun.

253
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,590
In the name of the birthday party,

254
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,200
Lord Liu invited martial artists

255
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,830
to kill Iron-masked Demons.

256
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,470
We will get over

257
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,710
all difficulties!

258
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,640
Bravo!

259
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,590
Enjoy yourselves, everybody.

260
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,950
Bravo! Bravo!

261
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,910
Come on.

262
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,760
Cheers. Cheers.

263
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,680
Let’s wait and see.

264
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,000
So much fun!

265
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,950
Go on.

266
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,800
Are you Qinghui, the Immortal?

267
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,950
What?

268
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,470
You haven’t got it ready yet?

269
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,240
I’m sorry.

270
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,270
Today is my mother’s birthday.

271
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,240
So many friends have come.

272
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,470
Could you give me one more day?

273
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,390
I’ll give you what you want tomorrow.

274
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,090
Well, I’m just in time.

275
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,030
I’d like to enjoy the party, too.

276
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,880
Sure. Sure.

277
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,470
What’s this?

278
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,510
It’s an antique.

279
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,240
It’s said to be kept
in the Dragon King’s mouth.

280
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,150
Put in the mouth,
it can resolve all toxins.

281
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,120
It’s really an extraordinary thing.

282
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,880
My father once had one.

283
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
But it was lost
after my family declined.

284
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
What a coincidence!

285
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,640
Why don’t you open it
and let me have a look?

286
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,150
What? I can’t see it?

287
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,710
You can. You can.

288
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,150
Come on. Bring it up

289
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,800
and show it to him.

290
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,710
Aye. Hurry.

291
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,440
Come on.

292
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,910
Come on.

293
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,880
Everyone, let’s kill him!

294
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,710
It’s so easy

295
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,870
to catch him?

296
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,990
He doesn’t look strong enough

297
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,440
to have destroyed
the Four-guardian Mountain.

298
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,080
What has gone wrong?

299
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,990
You’re right.

300
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,440
Intruder!

301
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,910
I’ll make you pay with your life!

302
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,320
Why are there another seven?

303
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,480
He’s shorter than Yin Pei. It’s not him.

304
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,480
Judged from the figure,

305
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,800
none of them can be Yin Pei.

306
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,080
Leave if you don’t want to die!

307
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,680
If you stay, you’ll be dead meat!

308
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,780
I didn’t expect to see another seven.

309
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,910
It’s so stubborn of you.

310
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,360
Don’t blame us for being cruel!

311
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,200
We die a right death for justice!

312
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Come on!

313
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,630
Mr. Yang, I’ll find the real one.

314
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,110
Stall for as much time as you can.

315
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,230
Okay.

316
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,110
They’re fighting
when hurting themselves.

317
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,360
They must have taken Phoenix Pills.

318
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,630
Looks like

319
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,230
they fight
with the formation of Qi School.

320
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,750
No way. If we continue this way,

321
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,150
we’ll have losses

322
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,270
before we find Yin Pei out.

323
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,840
I must find a place

324
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,230
and break their formation

325
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,870
with the same Eight-trigram principle

326
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,440
so that we can defeat them one by one.

327
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,910
Chuchu, hide yourself.

328
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,600
Don’t come out.

329
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,910
Qinghui.

330
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,110
Why do you not show us your face?

331
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,800
What a coward you are!

332
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,620
<i>Lasting Prosperity</i>

333
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,500
<i>Lofty Virtues</i>

334
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,560
Qian, three Yang. Kun, six Yin.

335
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,940
<i>Lasting Prosperity Lofty Virtues</i>

336
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,840
Dui, three Yin on the top.
Xun, three Yin on the bottom.

337
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,200
There are eight Qinghui.

338
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,600
Madam Nichang.

339
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,510
It’s time to strike!

340
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,870
Miss Zhou, how will the whistle

341
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,840
help with the fight?

342
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,390
It’s the secret signal

343
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,870
Li Sheng and I used when we were little.

344
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,960
It’s been years since we last used it.

345
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,630
I wonder if he can hear me.

346
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,870
Qinghui.

347
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,630
My cousin and you are old acquaintances!

348
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,870
If you don’t come out,

349
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,560
she’ll find you personally!

350
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,720
Wait here for me.

351
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,870
Run if anything happens.

352
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,560
Damn it!

353
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,320
Could you stop being a busybody?

354
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,630
Yin Pei?

355
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,440
You’re making trouble again.

356
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:30,664

357
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,750
I’ll kill these evil men

358
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,360
to avenge my family!

359
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,270
Mr. Zou.

360
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,390
I know you can’t hold back your anger

361
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,200
with Iron-masked Demons.

362
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,030
But they are already captives.

363
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,360
If we kill them as we wish,

364
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,150
we’ll be as cruel as them.

365
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,630
Mr. Li, thanks to you.

366
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,960
You’ve been stronger?

367
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
You nearly wound me.

368
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,560
Sheng, let me have a look.

369
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,200
Are you hurt?

370
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,600
I’m fine.

371
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,720
I saw Yin Pei run away.

372
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,320
Yin Pei!

373
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,230
Are you going
to let everyone know

374
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,510
you’re Yin Wenlan’s son?

375
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,510
Shut up!

376
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,720
In the past,

377
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,990
you were not free

378
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,990
and you were threatened
by Zheng Luosheng.

379
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,990
Now you’re free

380
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,720
and no longer take orders from anyone,

381
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,150
yet you become Zheng Luosheng!

382
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,910
You really surprise me!

383
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,680
I killed Ding Kui

384
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,840
for those cowards
who only dare to complain.

385
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,030
I wiped out the Four-guardian Mountain

386
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,080
which always scared them.

387
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,390
I ridded them of their big concern.

388
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,560
Now, I’m the next big concern.

389
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,870
Tell me, is this reasonable?

390
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,360
But later you hired lackeys
and bullied people.

391
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,150
You think you’re doing right things?

392
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,150
I don’t want to argue with you

393
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,030
about reasons or kindnesses.

394
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,480
As long as you correct yourself

395
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,110
and no longer hurt the martial artists
and common people,

396
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,600
I’ll let you go.

397
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,390
Great! How impressive!

398
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,840
I’ll see

399
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,030
how long you can last.

400
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,510
Yin Pei.

401
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,870
You really bring shame
on your ancestors!

402
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,150
What benefits can you get
from harming people and yourself?

403
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,110
What a psychopath you are!

404
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,110
You took me as an outcast first!

405
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,680
Fine.

406
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,440
I will be a mad man.

407
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,840
I’ll make everyone scared of me.

408
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,660
I’ll make them run away
whenever they see me!

409
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,750
My father is dead.

410
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,930
You regard him as a saint.

411
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,990
If he were still alive,

412
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,840
I don’t think you would do that.

413
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,960
This is how you think of your father?

414
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,510
I had thought

415
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,510
Zheng Luosheng killed my father.

416
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,630
Later I thought

417
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
Ji Yunchen was the real culprit.

418
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,390
But now,

419
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
they’ve both been dead.

420
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,600
I still feel the same pain.

421
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,510
It wasn’t until today did I realize

422
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,360
how funny I was!

423
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,390
You distort facts and talk nonsense!

424
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,750
I think, you didn’t only go wrong
when practicing martial arts.

425
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,600
Your brain has also gone wrong!

426
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,390
Zhou Fei.

427
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,800
I owe you
for what happened on Mount Heng.

428
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,600
I’ll let you go today. Leave right away.

429
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,680
We’re even.

430
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,480
Go!

431
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,350
Yin Pei.

432
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,620
Your hands are shivering.

433
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,990
How dare you say you’ll let me go?

434
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,720
I’m saying it one last time.

435
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
Restrain your men!

436
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,080
Otherwise,

437
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,150
I will kill you,

438
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,450
even with my last breath!

439
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,230
Let’s see

440
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,270
if you can.

441
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,290
Zhu Chen?

442
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,440
Miss Zhou.

443
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,110
If I had the afterlife,

444
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,140
I would want to meet you again.

445
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,960
Outside Lingling Town,

446
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,680
-Fei.
-I would invite you to my home.

447
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,440
Many fragrans are grown in my home.

448
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,510
If we go now,

449
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,100
we can see the flowers blossoming

450
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,480
if we travel fast enough.

451
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,150
The second son of Fist Gang?

452
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,070
Fist Gang was famous
in the martial world.

453
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,320
Later, it declined

454
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,990
and then disappeared.

455
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,510
Since you’re all heirs of decent sects,

456
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,840
why do you wear the iron mask?

457
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,270
People choose to be kind or evil.

458
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,680
When you have great martial arts

459
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,910
without a kind heart,

460
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,960
what’s the point
even if you’re invincible?

461
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,560
You’re blindfolded

462
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,630
by the effect of Phoenix Pill

463
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,230
and deceived by what Yin Pei said.

464
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,100
You think you can solve everything
with martial arts?

465
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,990
Hope you’ll wake up in time

466
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,680
and no longer hide behind the mask.

467
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,500
Do some decent things.

468
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,720
Mr. Li, how should we deal with them?

469
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,270
They were deceived by Yin Pei.

470
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,700
Since they took Phoenix Pills,
they would die soon.

471
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,570
Lock them up

472
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,520
and let them reflect on their fault.

473
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,200
Okay.

474
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,840
Take them away.

475
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,110
-Aye!
-Aye!

476
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,800
-Go.
-Go.

477
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,270
Get up.

478
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,460
<i>Xingnan Sect</i>

479
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,320
<i>Grave of Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect</i>

480
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,080
We met so many things
during the trip to Lingling.

481
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,840
Each can be a long story,

482
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,200
except Xingnan Sect

483
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,790
I helped on my way.

484
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,100
We met only a few times.

485
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,580
I didn’t expect him

486
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,130
to save me with his own life.

487
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,180
Do you know

488
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,960
why he did that?

489
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,890
If I just left
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

490
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,410
I would feel confused

491
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,080
and I wouldn’t feel grateful.

492
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,830
But now...

493
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,220
I...

494
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,850
I understand.

495
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,680
If there were a second chance,

496
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,440
I’m afraid he would save you, too.

497
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,540
<i>Grave of Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect</i>

498
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,760
I didn’t have a chance
to say thanks to him.

499
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,150
I remember the Departure Sorrow Pavilion
you once told me.

500
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,320
It was famous throughout the world.

501
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,150
Now, even the poorest actresses

502
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,800
don’t want to sing it.

503
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
Yeah.

504
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
The world is in the chaos of war.

505
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,510
Everyone struggles to survive.

506
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,750
Operas are performed
about family feud and national hatred.

507
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,560
Romance is too far away.

508
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,190
Let’s go.

509
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,510
At least,

510
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,840
we can help small sects
like Xingnan Sect

511
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,360
to stop being bullied.

512
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
Okay.

513
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,400
But...

514
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,270
I still want

515
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,600
more decent martial artists

516
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,920
to protect the people

517
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,320
so that they can enjoy a happy life.

518
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:20,420
<i>Grave of Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect</i>

519
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,430
<i>Longevity</i>
Please help me with it.

520
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,950
Mr. Li, look.

521
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,710
Uh...

522
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,030
Mr. Zou and all of you.

523
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,710
What...?

524
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,030
What are you doing?

525
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,600
Mr. Li, we come to say thank you.

526
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,950
If you hadn’t gathered us

527
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,880
to fight Iron-masked Demons together,

528
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,840
I’m afraid I wouldn’t have taken revenge

529
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,920
for my family.

530
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,840
Mr. Li, please accept our respects!

531
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,920
You’re welcome.

532
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,120
Everybody,

533
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,400
please get up.

534
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,190
Uh...

535
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,400
I was just an initiator,

536
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,710
following the will of everyone.

537
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,950
<i>Longevity</i>
We succeeded

538
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,880
<i>Longevity</i>
because we worked and untied as one.

539
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,190
Thank you, everyone.

540
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,920
Are wounded men alright?

541
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,190
They’ve been taken care of.

542
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,120
Among Iron-masked Demons,

543
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Yin Pei escaped alone.

544
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,400
Some unconvinced ones committed suicide.

545
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,990
Some others realized their mistakes,

546
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,640
saying they would correct their errors

547
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,230
and no longer hurt people.

548
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,800
They’re just frustrated men

549
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,230
who were instigated by Yin Pei.

550
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,840
They tried to satisfy their own desire

551
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,580
in extreme ways.

552
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,800
But Yin Pei is still on the run.

553
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,840
So, everyone,

554
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,190
please pay attention to Yin Pei

555
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,990
where you travel around

556
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,320
so that we can kill him
as soon as possible.

557
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,840
Sure.

558
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,190
We will still try to find Yin Pei.

559
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,470
But...

560
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,510
I think

561
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,800
we need a leader like Mr. Li

562
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,030
for the martial world.

563
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,190
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

564
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,510
I just came out
from the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

565
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,920
I don’t have enough experience.

566
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,600
I have poor martial arts, too.

567
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,880
I believe you’ll find a real master

568
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,710
who has better martial arts
and more experience

569
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,160
to be the leader.

570
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,840
Don’t be modest, Mr. Li.

571
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,920
What happened this time

572
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,080
has proved your ability to be a leader!

573
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,160
Yeah.

574
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,600
I...

575
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,030
I don’t mean to be modest.

576
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,750
I have the same thought as yours.

577
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,360
I just don’t want
to see more men like Yin Pei

578
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
or more evil things like this.

579
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,750
I know what I can do.

580
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,750
I think we should pick

581
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,080
a more suitable man

582
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,800
to be the leader.

583
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,600
But...

584
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,030
Fei, what’s on your mind?

585
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,190
It’s broken again.

586
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,640
My father gave this blade to me.

587
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you think

588
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,680
it can be repaired?

589
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,260
It’s not hard

590
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,400
to repair it.

591
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,840
Even I can do it.

592
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,950
But this was forged

593
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,430
with some special material.

594
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,510
I’m afraid I can’t find proper material.

595
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,600
Besides,

596
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,270
even if it is repaired,

597
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,880
it won’t be as sharp as before.

598
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
If you keep using it that way,

599
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,160
you’ll break it again soon.

600
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,470
You don’t feel sorry for yourself,
but for the blade.

601
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,080
You’re really unique.

602
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,560
Don’t worry.

603
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,270
I owe you a blade.

604
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,840
I’ll give you

605
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,670
a cart of blades wrapped in red silk

606
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,080
and send them to your home

607
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,730
in a big way.

608
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,600
Who wants so many blades?

609
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,510
If they look good,

610
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,600
but turn out to be useless like you,

611
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,800
what do I do?

612
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,030
Anyway, don’t worry.

613
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,640
I’ll make the best blade for you.

614
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,990
Where’s Li Sheng?

615
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,160
Why didn’t I see him?

616
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,190
Yin Pei was defeated.

617
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,800
It was a great satisfaction.

618
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,510
Martial artists like your cousin.

619
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,160
He’s busy associating with them.

620
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,750
Madam Nichang, thank you for helping us

621
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,400
defeat Iron-masked Demons.

622
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,360
Without your help,

623
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,120
we wouldn’t have succeeded so smoothly.

624
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,720
Thanks to your plan, too.

625
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,560
I just used my brain

626
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,920
and thought of a plan.

627
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,750
These martial artists are nice to you,

628
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,800
not only for the sake of your aunt.

629
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,560
You led everyone else…

630
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
to defeat Iron-masked Demons.

631
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,190
I guess they have seen a little hope.

632
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,840
Everyone feels insecure
in such a dangerous world.

633
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,750
When everyone can

634
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,990
hardly breathe,

635
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,990
they all want

636
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,600
to see someone

637
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,190
like Li Zheng or Yin Wenlan.

638
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,450
You’re Li Zheng’s grandson.

639
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,950
Do you understand me?

640
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,100
I’m far weaker than my grandfather.

641
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,710
Don’t think lightly of yourself.

642
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,080
The man who can unite everyone

643
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,800
may not necessarily
have the best martial arts.

644
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,990
Don’t disappoint their trust

645
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,190
on you.

646
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,290
If I hadn’t come to help you
after receiving your letter,

647
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,640
would you have died?

648
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,670
So many martial artists were here.

649
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,710
Why would I

650
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,950
depend on you only?

651
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,950
But we underestimated Yin Pei.

652
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,320
If we recognized him earlier...

653
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,750
Miss Zhou, thank you for saving me.

654
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,920
All right?

655
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,990
All right. All right.

656
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,190
These martial artists

657
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,600
are flattering you now.

658
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,470
Tomorrow,

659
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,750
they may say

660
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,430
you killed 250 Yin Pei.

661
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,510
Later, they’ll make you
the Head of All Sects.

662
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,510
Then the Demons or other evils

663
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,750
coming out of nowhere

664
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,320
will come to ask you for trouble.

665
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,840
In a few more days,

666
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,470
you may be known

667
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,600
as a man

668
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,230
who has a great reputation,

669
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,190
but poor ability

670
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,020
just because of mere trifles.

671
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,220
You’ll be the second Huo Liantao.

672
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,160
Don’t worry.

673
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,320
Like Yin Pei and Huo Liantao,

674
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,360
people choose to be good or evil

675
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,120
within thoughts.

676
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,600
I know

677
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,640
very well

678
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,030
about the martial world.

679
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,920
Fine.

680
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,560
Be very careful.

681
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,880
Don’t get yourself killed
in the middle of night

682
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,080
after so many schemes.

683
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:21,660
<i>Brilliant Prospects</i>

684
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,320
<i>Liu’s Manor</i>

685
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
<i>Liu’s Manor</i>
Mr. Zou, if you have any trouble,

686
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,710
don’t hesitate to come to me.

687
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,920
I will.

688
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,120
Mr. Zou.

689
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,470
Please wait.

690
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,160
Miss Wu, what do you want me for?

691
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,360
Do you have time?

692
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,080
May I have a word with you?

693
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,320
I’ve got something to do.
I’ll leave you alone.

694
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,710
Mr. Zou, to be honest,

695
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,990
I’ve been compiling martial books.

696
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,270
I saw you fight with Iron-masked Demons.

697
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,670
I really admired that.

698
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,880
I wonder

699
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,600
if you want to tell me
your martial arts.

700
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,840
I’ll record them

701
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,210
so that they can be passed down.

702
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,640
It’s so farsighted of you, Miss Wu.

703
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,840
I have planned to do this.

704
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,120
You flatter me.

705
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,190
We’re a small sect.

706
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,190
But our ancestors established it
with painstaking efforts.

707
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,950
Now, my family has been ruined.

708
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,920
I fear our martial arts will be lost.

709
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,320
Don’t worry.

710
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,030
I’ll sort them out
as carefully as I can.

711
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Mr. Yang.

712
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,190
You’re leaving?

713
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,190
I’m going back home.

714
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,030
Come on.

715
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,600
You’re just going
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

716
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,990
Go if you want.

717
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:41,950
I’m not going there!

718
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,880
When you’re not there, why am I going?

719
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,190
We’re not there.

720
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,640
But someone else is.

721
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,400
Yin Wenlan suddenly visited me

722
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,640
and gave me
the Manual of the Mountain Sword.

723
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,190
He asked me

724
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,840
to give it to his descendants

725
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,030
if he died.

726
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
He must have known

727
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,470
he was very likely to die

728
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,030
when being involved in the secret
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

729
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,880
No other martial artists knew it.

730
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,360
But I’ve kept the secret
for over twenty years.

731
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,090
After considering carefully about it,

732
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,120
I think

733
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,220
I should give it to you.

734
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:49,083
