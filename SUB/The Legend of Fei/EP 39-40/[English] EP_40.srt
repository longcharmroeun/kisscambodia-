<i>Episode 40</i>

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,910
What are they doing?

19
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,810
No one is here. Go.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,830
Who are they?

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,600
How did you lose him?

22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,430
Qinghui was badly wounded, wasn’t he?

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,560
I’m sorry. I’m sorry!

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,780
-Enough.
-I’m sorry!

25
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,670
Mr. Yin.

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,160
I know

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,400
you can only pass the Manual
to your descendants.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,880
Yin Pei has gone the evil way.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,910
If I keep it here,

30
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,160
there will be a reign of terror again.

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,960
Many innocent people will die.

32
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,600
So, I’ve decided

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,350
to burn it.

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,830
Mr. Yin, hope you can understand me

35
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,800
in heaven.

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,990
You?

37
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,680
You want to offer a sacrifice
to my father, don’t you?

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,820
Let me take you there.

39
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,190
Why hasn’t Miss Wu come yet?

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,190
I’ll ask someone to get her.

41
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,070
Don’t bother.

42
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,580
I’ll go. We’ll come later.

43
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,520
Chuchu?

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,350
Xie Meimei has gone
to buy some food.

45
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,270
Why hasn’t he been back?

46
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,350

51
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,870
How did you know

52
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,840
when I would use the other hand?

53
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,880
I guessed it.

54
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
I had good luck, I guess.

55
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,240
You use your blade
in a different way as Li Zheng.

56
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,460
I’m surely weaker than my grandfather.

57
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,410
Li Zheng used the blade perfectly.

58
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,720
He took advantage of all martial arts,

59
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,190
and used his blade in a just way.

60
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,190
When I met him,

61
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,870
he didn’t have grave
or all-embracing killing intent

62
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,990
like you do.

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,350
Speaking of martial arts,

64
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,680
you’re inferior to him.

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,000
But if he were alive,

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,630
he might not defeat you

67
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,630
when you fought.

68
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,960
Phoenix, long time no see.

69
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Spare those compliments.

70
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,960
What do you want?

71
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,070
I’ve killed

72
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,910
Pathetic Clam.

73
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,820
<i>Master Huo Changfeng</i>

74
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,150
Get out, all of you!

75
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,870
I’ll sing the opera for him only.

76
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,240
Get out, all of you!

77
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,130
You put the poison in the candle.

78
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,270
That was good.

79
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,690
Are you Pathetic Clam with the Demons?

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
I’ve heard a lot about you.

81
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,520
You use the poison perfectly.

82
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
And you pretend very well.

83
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,400
I came to give back
the Seal of Cautiousness,

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,470
and raised a colossal uproar in town

85
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,840
just to attract you

86
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,750
who seldom come out.

87
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,400
Phoenix, I really admire you.

88
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
You live up to your reputation.

89
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,400
Well, let me tell you.

90
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,070
I poisoned

91
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,350
Old Master Huo.

92
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,350
Unfortunately, my Worry-burying Flower
wasn’t in full blossom

93
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,030
and it wasn’t the most poisonous.

94
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,520
He failed to die immediately.

95
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,630
But he still became a fool
and got paralyzed in bed.

96
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,910
You did that!

97
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,440
It was really you!

98
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
Don’t you want to know

99
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,910
what Old Master Huo said
before he was poisoned?

100
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,680
What poison did you use?

101
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,630
Why is it so toxic?

102
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,590
That’s exactly what he said
before he was poisoned.

103
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,870
You were good friends, weren’t you?

104
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,240
I’ll kill you with the same poison.

105
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
Then you can die with him.

106
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,440
Even if I have to die,

107
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,390
I’ll take you with me!

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Let me remind you.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,640
You can’t use your force rashly.

110
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,950
Otherwise,

111
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,910
you will die sooner.

112
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,080
She didn’t take away the Seal.

113
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,240
Pretty girl, do you want it?

114
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,440
Why do you want to give it to me?

115
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,620
Qi School has disappeared.

116
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,350
The Huo family has no descendants.

117
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,510
Yin Wenlan’s son is great.

118
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,880
He has made himself in a mess.

119
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,390
Only the Li family has

120
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,070
some heirs.

121
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,770
But I’m with the Zhou family.

122
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
You always wanted to get

123
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,680
the Seal of Cautiousness, didn’t you?

124
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,640
Why do you suddenly want
to give it to me?

125
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,710
You were wounded?

126
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,320
To kill the craftiest Pathetic Clam,

127
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,350
I had to pay some price.

128
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Anyway,

129
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,150
you will take care

130
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,950
of the Seal of Cautiousness.

131
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,560
What do you want me to do for you?

132
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,710
All you need to do

133
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,240
is to keep the Seal carefully.

134
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I was poisoned.

135
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,710
I know I will die.

136
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,470
But fortunately,

137
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,830
I’ve avenged Mr. Huo.

138
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,320
I can stay with him in heaven
without concern.

139
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,150
On the snow mountain,

140
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,990
you said you would save
an important friend.

141
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,760
It’s said

142
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,730
that the Phoenix Pill reappeared.

143
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,270
It may help your friend.

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,470
What is the Phoenix Pill?

145
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,080
It’s said that,

146
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,510
when someone takes it

147
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,680
and digests it with strong force,

148
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,510
he will come back to life

149
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,950
and make a thoroughgoing change.

150
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,350
But if taking the Phoenix Pill directly,

151
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,880
he will easily go wrong

152
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,890
or even die of explosion.

153
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,760
Chongxiao was out of his mind.

154
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,510
He left the pills before he died.

155
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,240
If you tell me

156
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,150
the Phoenix Pill can relieve a cough,
improve blood circulation

157
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,150
or even nourish kidney,

158
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,710
I may believe you.

159
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,200
But you said it would make people
come back to life.

160
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
That sounds ridiculous.

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,240
It’s obviously nonsense.

162
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,560
If it weren’t banned drug
to make people come back to life,

163
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
why would Qi School hide it

164
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,340
instead of telling others?

165
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,900
You’re right.

166
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,560
Yin Pei improved
his martial arts greatly

167
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,270
after taking the Phoenix Pill

168
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,820
and killed people everywhere.

169
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,080
Maybe,

170
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,200
it can really help Xie Yun.

171
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
In this world there are terrible men

172
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,660
who do stupid things.

173
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,700
But you.

174
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,350
You look beautiful

175
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,630
and you have good martial arts.

176
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,700
When I leave the Seal to you,

177
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,900
Mr. Huo will feel relieved

178
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,670
if he knows it in heaven.

179
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,840
He’ll think I’ve done a good thing.

180
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,270
I lived my life willfully,

181
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,440
regardless of my reputation.

182
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,850
I left Huo’s Manor in a fit of pique.

183
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,680
I didn’t know
I would get Mr. Huo killed.

184
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,640
He spent the rest of his life

185
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,330
keeping the secret
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

186
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,640
We argued about it for twenty years.

187
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
I owed him a life.

188
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,440
Time to pay him back.

189
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,470
Lord, you took a great risk.

190
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,640
If the powder hadn’t been on her face

191
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,800
and Mu Xiaoqiao had seen
through the substitute,

192
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,680
he would come back to you again.

193
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,490
She’s a woman of sacrifice
I trained for years.

194
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
She was very efficient.

195
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,900
Nothing would go wrong.

196
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,920
Commander-in-chief asked me
to get the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

197
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,560
If I go back empty-handed,

198
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,050
we will be humiliated.

199
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,390
But people
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

200
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,830
have all the four tokens.

201
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,350
Say no more.

202
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,830
I will get the tokens.

203
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,030
It’s Li Jinrong’s birthday next month.

204
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,640
Those young men will go
and celebrate her birthday.

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,250
She will have all the tokens.

206
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,390
As long as I sneak
into the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

207
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,120
I’ll stand a chance

208
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,350
to take them away.

209
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,710
Lord.

210
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,030
You had a relapse of old wound.

211
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,480
You can’t risk your neck to go there.

212
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,390
I even killed Li Zheng.

213
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,880
Why can’t I

214
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,800
kill Li Jinrong?

215
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,910
I hear the Third Prince

216
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,200
has been searching treasures

217
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,240
for Li Jinrong’s birthday.

218
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,800
Is that true?

219
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,680
Yes.

220
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,440
Lord Chu had planned

221
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,350
to catch Chen Zichen to win honor.

222
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,200
Unexpectedly, Zhou Fei saved him.

223
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,080
Since that,

224
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,200
the Third Prince has been
grateful to her.

225
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,590
I’m sure he wants
to find a treasure for Li Jinrong

226
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,240
and make friends
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

227
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
through her birthday.

228
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,830
Seems like

229
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,150
we should go and help him.

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,680
Weed Spirit.

231
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,590
Look what I’ve bought you.

232
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Fei.

233
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,560
What happened?

234
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,880
Go. Go find Yin Pei with me.

235
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,390
Miss Zhou. Mr. Xie.

236
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,910
Mr. Li left a message

237
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,470
that Yin Pei took away Miss Wu.

238
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,840
He’s looking for Yin Pei.

239
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,390
Yin Pei made trouble again.

240
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,750
Mr. Li advised to take separate ways.

241
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,870
He has gone
to the Four-guardian Mountain.

242
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,600
He will contact you
through secret services.

243
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,360
Okay, we know.

244
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,480
Fei.

245
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,960
That’s what you tried to tell me?

246
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,460
<i>Yin’s Mansion</i>

247
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,230
My family was also destroyed.

248
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,720
The Demons killed my father.

249
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,270
Everyone wants the longevity lock
from me.

250
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,560
I understand you.

251
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,720
My family is gone.

252
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is prosperous.

253
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,910
People say

254
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,990
my father isn’t as strong as Li Zheng.

255
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,790
Bah!

256
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,230
We respect your father

257
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,840
and his martial arts.

258
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,800
The Mountain Sword is
an unparalleled martial art.

259
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,870
I’m afraid bad men will use it

260
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,320
to do evil things.

261
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,270
The Mountain Sword belongs to my family.

262
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,800
It’s mine!

263
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,200
Besides,

264
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,080
what evil things did I do

265
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,150
with it?

266
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
Whistling arrow of our Fortress.

267
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,910
Let’s go have a look.

268
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,720
-Go.
-Go.

269
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,440
Have you checked it out?

270
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,270
What was the whistling arrow for
last night?

271
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,320
I just figured it out.

272
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,510
The whistling arrow was shot

273
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,230
nearly Yin’s Manor.

274
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,680
Why did men with the Fortress go there?

275
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,060
<i>Yin’s Manor</i>

276
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,600
Let’s go separate ways.

277
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
If you meet Yin Pei,

278
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,750
don’t fight him directly.

279
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,800
Try to hold him back.

280
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,230
The priority is to find Chuchu.

281
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,230
In case of trouble,

282
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,960
let’s meet in the woods
at the village entrance.

283
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,750
Aye.

284
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,030
Who is it?

285
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,910
Chuchu, it’s me.

286
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,390
Sheng?

287
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,840
Sheng!

288
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,600
Go. Let’s get out of here.

289
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,990
Chuchu, are you alright?

290
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,870
Yes.

291
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,230
Move a step forward

292
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,110
and I’ll kill her.

293
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,780
<i>Yin’s Manor</i>

294
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,630
Do you think everyone wants to kill you?

295
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,870
You feel everyone owes you.

296
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,840
I’d like to give you a second chance.

297
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
Write down

298
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,600
the full Manual of the Mountain Sword.

Have you remembered, Pei?

303
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,110
Just remember.

304
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,680
We practice martial arts

305
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,630
to protect those we love.

306
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,200
I just came up with an idea.

307
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,150
I don’t know if it will work.

308
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,720
He learnt martial arts from his father.

309
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,230
He knew the moves.

310
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,270
But he didn’t know the sequence.

311
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,990
If I change the sequence,

312
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,360
he may not know.

313
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,320
We think alike.

314
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,840
That’s exactly what I thought of.

315
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,200
Men with the Fortress again?

316
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,960
Why are you here?

317
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,390
This was Yin’s Manor!

318
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,200
Why are you here?

319
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,870
Qinghui?

320
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,320
You’re looking for Qinghui, aren’t you?

321
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,720
Aren’t you?

322
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,630
Qinghui!

323
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,600
Let’s go!

324
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,150
Keep an eye on these losers.

325
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,510

The manual

328
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,440
doesn’t look like the one

329
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,840
you burned.

330
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,080
It’s the same.

331
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,750
Compare it and you’ll know.

332
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,070
Practice it.

333
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,720
It’s your family stuff.

334
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,270
Why do you let him practice it?

It’s him!

336
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,480
Over there.

341
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,440
Sister, where are our parents?

342
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,750
Keep your voice down.

343
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,560
Where’s Qinghui?

344
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,960
We don’t know who is Qinghui.

345
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,270
Stop kidding!

346
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,510
He locked you up here, didn’t he?

347
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,030
Stop!

348
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,110
I have the world’s best

349
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,630
Manual of the Mountain Sword.

350
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,200
Do you want it?

351
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,200
I want both the Manual and the scabbard!

352
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,750
Give it to me!

353
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,440
Manual of the Mountain Sword.

354
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,200
You can’t use it.

355
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,600
I keep the unique skill in my mind.

356
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,270
If you don’t believe me, practice it.

357
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,630
Think carefully about it.

358
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,360
You must give the scabbard to me!

359
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,910
Otherwise,

360
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,960
I will kill you all!

361
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,200
The more

362
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,560
I practice,

363
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,230
the worse I feel.

364
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,840
Why do I feel worse?

365
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,150
Tell me.

366
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,150
What’s the unique skill

367
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,560
of practicing the Mountain Sword?

368
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,870
Let us go, or I won’t tell you.

369
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,160
Why do you think

370
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,630
you can negotiate with me?

371
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,230
Tong Tianyang.

372
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,750
Do you want the scabbard

373
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,200
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

374
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,750
We can cooperate.

375
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,720
Why must I cooperate with you?

376
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,600
I can give the scabbard to you.

377
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,480
Let me join the Demons

378
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,680
and help me reinvigorate my family.

379
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,510
Why must I let you in?

380
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,960
I can give you the Phoenix Pill.

381
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,750
I had such great martial arts

382
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,030
by taking the pills.

383
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,360
Don’t you want a try?

384
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,740
<i>Tablet of Yin Wenlan</i>

385
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,990
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>

386
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,990
<i>Ancestral Hall</i>
Father.

387
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,320
I’m finally back.

388
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,870
Don’t worry.

389
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,720
Today,

390
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,270
I will offer a sacrifice to you

391
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,510
with the blood of your enemy.

392
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,320
Let go of me.

393
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,870
Let’s fight in a fair way.

394
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,610
A fair way?

395
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,300
Yin Pei.

396
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,290
I know you want to take revenge.

397
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,080
But the Demons are near, I’m afraid.

398
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,560
Tong Tianyang is missing.

399
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,840
If they come,

400
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
we can’t leave safely

401
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
when they shoot.

402
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,910
That’s great.

403
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,270
Mr. Li, please keep watch for us

404
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,870
at the entrance of the woods.

405
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,960
Miss Wu and I

406
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,870
will take revenge.

407
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,800
Don’t you want to take revenge
by yourself?

408
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,840
I want it.

409
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,200
If the Demons come,

410
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
I’ll let you know.

411
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,700
Let me do it.

412
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,720
How nice was Mr. Yin Wenlan to you?

413
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,230
You mean how nice my father was to me?

414
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,600
Your father?

415
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,630
Yes.

416
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,800
I’m Mountain Sword Yin Wenlan’s son,

417
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,870
Yin Pei!

418
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,800
What are you laughing at?

419
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,480
I heard

420
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
Qinghui with the Four-guardian Mountain

421
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,130
was Yin Wenlan’s descendant.

422
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,360
I had thought it was his nephew

423
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,080
who had gone the wrong way.

424
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,870
I didn’t expect you to be his son.

425
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,230
I guess

426
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,870
you made yourself in such a mess

427
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,080
just to take revenge.

428
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,030
My father was chivalrous

429
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,990
and kind to people.

430
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,270
That’s why

431
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,910
you managed to kill him!

432
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,390
It’s so naive of you!

433
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,200
The Yin family has no more descendant.

434
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,940
You...

435
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,300
You’re not Yin Wenlan’s son!

436
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,680
Nonsense!

437
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,200
At Liu’s Manor,

438
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,480
Madam Nichang tried to kill you,
didn’t she?

439
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,870
Yes, so what?

440
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,230
Madam Nichang was
one of the four major spies.

441
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,630
She never meddles with
the Four-guardian Mountain.

442
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,720
Do you know why she wanted to kill you?

443
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,990
Because you’re the baby

444
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,110
she saved.

445
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,440
Now, you’ve been the biggest bane
to the martial world.

446
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
She feels guilty.

447
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,870
So, she wants to kill you personally.

448
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,110
Countless people want to kill me!

449
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,510
Do you dare to let me finish?

450
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,340
It’s really their family feud.

451
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,380
But how can I leave Chuchu in danger?

452
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,600
I had a friend

453
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,230
named Letang,

454
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,080
who had great artistry of blade.

455
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,200
I had planned to recruit him.

456
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
But he used to live a free life.

457
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,510
He only wanted to rob people.

458
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,230
He even set a Killing Trap,

459
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,200
outside the town,

460
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,630
just to rob all passers-by,

461
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,840
until Chief Chang Huan of Zhongyuan Sect

462
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,150
passed his place.

463
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,750
<i>Grave of Yin Wenlan</i>
Do you know

464
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,750
what Chang Huan loved most?

465
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,840
He was famous for his sick son.

466
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,390
His son was nearly a stillbirth
when he was born.

467
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,800
He survived with all kinds
of wonderful drugs.

468
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,110
He was then known as Baby Ginseng.

469
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,230
Whoever ate his flesh

470
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,150
would be cured of any disease.

471
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,210
Mr. Yin.

472
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,970
When you were little,

473
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
were you weak?

474
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,110
In this world,

475
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,800
a lot of kids were weak!

476
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,870
What a coincidence!

477
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,910
My friend had planned to grab the baby.

478
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,800
After some preparation,

479
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,320
he easily destroyed

480
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,230
Zhongyuan Sect.

481
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,360
You know what?

482
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,870
Two persons interfered with him.

483
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,750
Do you know who they were?

484
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,960
Li Zheng and Madam Nichang.

485
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,200
They didn’t like my friend
for killing innocent people.

486
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,910
They killed him

487
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,150
and took you away.

488
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,990
In front of my friend,

489
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,840
they talked about giving you
to Yin Wenlan.

490
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,440
A minion of my friend’s escaped

491
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,600
and found me.

492
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,870
He wanted me to kill Li Zheng
and Madam Nichang

493
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,110
to avenge my friend.

494
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,990
But Li Zheng hid in the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight for years.

495
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,630
I can’t take revenge.

496
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,230
Yin Pei.

497
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,560
Yin Wenlan has no descendants.

498
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,150
I’m afraid Yin Wenlan’s body
has been ashes.

499
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,030
What’s the advantage of being his son?

500
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,110
You’re lying!

501
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,390
I’m not Baby Ginseng!

502
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,630
I’m not an orphan!

503
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,150
They didn’t pick me!

504
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,340
<i>Grave of Yin Wenlan</i>

505
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,270
Where’s Madam Nichang?

506
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,370
Take me to see her.

507
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,560
Damn it!

508
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,800
What happened here?

509
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,920
Mr. Li.

510
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,990
We were waiting for you and Miss Wu.

511
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,950
But Tong Tianyang came,
following the whistling arrow.

512
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,080
We fought against his minions.

513
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,470
We both lost half of our men.

514
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,270
Tong Tianyang is dead.

515
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,060
But Yin Pei caught Chuchu.

516
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,360
You can leave.

517
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
I’ll go look for her alone.

518
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,920
-Mr. Li.
-Go.

519
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,320
Mr. Li.

520
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,560
We were just informed

521
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,750
Miss Zhou was looking for us.

522
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,320
Shall we get her here?

523
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,270
No.

524
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,160
Ask her to go to Hengyang.

525
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,670
We’ll meet her there.

526
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,600

Lord.

529
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,360
What’s wrong with you?

530
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,230
I’m fine.

531
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,470
I was punched by Qinghui.

532
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,120
He didn’t have

533
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,710
too much force.

534
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,080
Since I took the Phoenix Pill,

I’ve had a bit stronger force.

did you and Mr. Li save a baby?

00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,550
How did you know?

595
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,270
Where was the baby?

596
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,710
Did you give him to Mr. Yin Wenlan?

597
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,230
Mr. Yin.

598
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,800
Take the baby back home.

599
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,320
Or he will suffer here.

600
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,080
Come on.

601
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,270
See? He stopped crying in your arms.

602
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,920
He did?

603
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,080
Sit down and it’ll be easy to hold him.

Look.

605
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,270
He really stopped crying.

606
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,950
Stop crying, baby.

607
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,950
Has Chang named him?

608
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,510
When we saved him,

609
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,710
there was an amulet behind his neck.

610
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,230
<i>Pei</i>
There was a word on it.

611
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,470
-Okay. Let me have a look.
-It’s Pei.

612
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,900
Pei.

613

<i>Pei</i>

614
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,670
But he’s too weak.

615

I’m afraid
he can’t practice marital arts.

616
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,320
If he learns martial arts,
he’ll be like us.

617
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,270
It’s not good.

618
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,750
I’d like him to study hard

619
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,160
and be an official.

620
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,130
Maybe he can help the world
and its people.

the baby is Yin Pei?

624
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,010
Yes.

625
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,770
What a pity that he let us down

626
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,320
and did evil things.

627
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,890
He didn’t turn out to help the world.

628
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,580
We changed his fate.

629
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,580
Maybe we shouldn’t have saved the baby.

630
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,840
It was my fault to save him.

That’s because
every one of the Yin family

has a special type of pulse.

They breathe and practice differently.

No one can use the Mountain Sword

643
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,270
that I held you back,

644
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,280

I would also forget

648
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,600
what happened that year.

649
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,060

656
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Give them to me!

657
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,400

658
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,640
We’re destined to meet.

659
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,320
You were lucky to escape last time.

660
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,750
Now,

661
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,030

666
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,600
Where are the remaining pills?

667
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,640
He took

668
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,600
the last one.

669
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,370
Yes.

670
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,300
It is right here in my stomach.

671
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,410

672
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,950

Tong Tianyang.

674
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,920
You broke into my home several times,

675
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,670
killed my father and Mrs. Wang.

676
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,670

677
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,940

678
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,320
Oh, I remember.

679
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,510
That old woman with you

680
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,800
interfered with my business
