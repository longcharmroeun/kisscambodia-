31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,380
Your kite is going to fall down.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,270
What?

33
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,710
It’s flying steady.

34
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,270
You can let me go now.

35
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,740
Cong Rong.

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,430
I will wait for you here tonight.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,150
I have something important to tell you.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,990
What if I am not coming?

39
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,230
I’ll be waiting no matter what.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,190
Honey.

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,990
Sanbao.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,580
Get me another light bulb.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,580
Here.

44
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,080
Let me peel a lychee for you.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,780
Okay.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,000
You can grill this now.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,580
Yeah.

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,510
Try it.

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,520
It’s so delicious.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,180
I thought you were just bragging.

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,900
I didn’t expect you to be so good.

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,230
I used to work in a restaurant.

53
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,390
Restaurant?

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Why don’t you work for me?

55
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,900
Let’s join forces.

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,900
I refuse.

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,580
I knew you would say that.

58
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,430
Since we met,

59
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,230
I have learned something about you.

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,310
Yeah?

61
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,150
What have you learned?

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,830
Anyway, you are unfathomable.

63
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,830
Expect for being a chef,

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,990
what else did you do?

65
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,670
A guitarist.

66
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,470
A guitarist?

67
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,620
A hipster.

68
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,110
Have you ever been in love?

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,510
Just eat your food.

70
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,710
Good.

71
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,670
How is it?

72
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,270
Are you finished?

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,390
Qin Chu.

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,190
Where’s Zhong Zhen?

75
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,830
Where’s Zhong Zhen?

76
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,030
He is sleeping in the car.

77
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,750
Is he still sleeping?

78
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,580
He has slept for a long time.

79
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,020
We need two pillows here!

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,110
Will these two be enough?

81
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,870
Yeah.

82
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,350
Wen Shaoqing!

83
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,310
Cong Rong.

84
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,390
Come here for barbecue.

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Come on!

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,460
Cheers!

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,780
Come on.

88
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,390
Write down the questions you want to ask
in the paper,

89
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,100
and pass it to me.

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,510
Write down “To XX”.

91
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,420
We will draw four questions to answer.

92
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,160
Alright?

93
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,480
Okay.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,150
Come on.

95
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,220
<i>To: Cong Rong
Do you remember Chubby?</i>

96
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,750
I’m finished.

97
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,100
<i>To: Wen Shaoqing</i>

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,390
Come on.

99
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,020
<i>To: Zhou Chengcheng
Who is your bestie?</i>

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,070
Alright.

101
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,710
Come on.

102
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,310
Good.

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Okay.

104
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,420
I’ve collected all the papers.

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,430
I am Zhong Zhen.

106
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,630
As the host,

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,950
I’m honored to announce

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,830
that the game officially starts now!

109
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,310
I’ll draw first.

110
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,510
It’s for me.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,670
Zhong Zhen.

112
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,900
Are you satisfied with your performance
at Yun Ji Hospital?

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,100
My answer is, I’m very satisfied.

114
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,510
I’m the best!

115
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,190
No one cares about you.

116
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,630
Did you ask this question yourself?

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,540
Is it that obvious?

118
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,110
Alright.

119
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,070
The game officially starts now.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,660
To Wen Rang.

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,900
Have you ever had an unforgettable love?

122
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,150
Wen Rang.

123
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,220
You should know how
we young people play the game.

124
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,630
Just in case,

125
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,070
let me explain the rules first.

126
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,540
You have to answer the question.

127
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,310
You can’t make up an answer.

128
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,390
You have to tell the truth.

129
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,900
What am I afraid of?

130
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,720
It’s just love.

131
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,540
Who hasn’t been in love?

132
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,300
You have?

133
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,950
Who?

134
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,720
Is she pretty?

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,580
How long had you been together?

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,390
What’s the point of being anonymous?

137
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,070
This is for my boss.

138
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,310
Is there anyone here that you like?

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,150
Yes.

140
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,510
A Romeo.

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,390
Go ahead.

142
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,560
Do you want to tell it yourself

143
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,190
or do we exclude one by one?

144
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,160
I will exclude myself first.

145
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,240
It’s definitely not me.

146
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,270
It can’t be me.

147
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,340
Then it’s obvious.

148
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,910
Qin Chu.

149
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,660
Cong Rong.

150
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,460
Who?

151
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,980
That’s an additional question.

152
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,150
I choose not to answer.

153
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,950
You...!

154
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,660
Zhong Zhen.

155
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,600
Okay.

156
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,390
Again.

157
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,910
This is for Sanbao.

158
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,660
For me?

159
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,980
If your husband and Wen Shaoqing
both fall into the water,

160
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,020
who will you save?

161
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,150
Obviously, you asked the question.

162
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,480
It’s such a simple alternative question.

163
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,460
Do I need to answer?

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,780
Of course I’ll save Shaoqing.

165
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,430
Why won’t you save me?

166
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,580
Because you can swim.

167
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,240
I can swim, too.

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,830
See?

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,710
Give him a way out.

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,920
How annoying it sounds!

171
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,070
Alright.

172
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,240
This is the last question tonight.

173
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,190
Who could it be for?

174
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,580
Hurry up.

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,270
It’s still for my boss.

176
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,070
Boss.

177
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,310
You are so popular.

178
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,670
The question is,

179
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,030
Have you known the person you like

180
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,390
for a long time?

181
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,390
Yes.

182
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,350
For a very long time.

183
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,550
That’s too obvious.

184
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,390
Just confess your love directly.

185
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,150
Can’t food gag your mouth?

186
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,950
Have some more.

187
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,360
Have some more.

188
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,060
Have some more.

189
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,550
Come on!

190
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
Let’s drink together!

191
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,870
Come on.

192
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,440
Come on.

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,870
Cheers!

194
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,540
Cheers!

195
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,500
The mood is so subdued.

196
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,540
Should I go inside or not?

197
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,180
I will wait for you here tonight.

198
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,270
I have something important to tell you.

199
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,350
I’ll be waiting no matter what.

200
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,970
Cong Rong?

201
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,900
Can we take a walk together?

202
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,540
Be careful!

203
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,360
How are you?

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,150
Are you all right?

205
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,700
I’m fine.

206
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,300
What’s wrong?

207
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,470
I sort of twisted my ankle.

208
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,750
It hurts a little bit.

209
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,510
Oh, no.

210
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,820
I didn’t bring my phone.

211
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,470
We have to wait for them to save us.

212
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,360
Wait for me.

213
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,230
I’ll go to get someone here.

214
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,390
Cong Rong!

215
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,990
Let’s have a talk.

216
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,260
Are you cold?

217
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,270
Let me give you my coat.

218
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,140
I’m fine.

219
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,790
It’s okay.

220
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,590
I am not cold.

221
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,020
Thank you.

222
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,230
Look,

223
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,540
the moon is so bright today.

224
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,060
A long time ago, a friend told me

225
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,900
that if two moons
appear at the same time,

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,420
then the person you cherish
will never disappear.

227
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,540
What happened to you?

228
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,060
I’ve never seen you cry so sadly.

229
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,780
My dad passed away.

230
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,630
Let me give you a hug.

231
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,510
They said,

232
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,230
if two moons appear together,

233
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,750
then my dad won’t disappear.

234
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,020
Then let the two moons appear together.

235
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,900
Are you finished?

236
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,990
Wait a second.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,820
Open your eyes.

238
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,350
Look.

239
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,750
There are two moons here.

240
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,590
Your father will never leave you.

241
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
<i>Chen Cu</i>

242
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,430
Hello?

243
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,200
Zhou Chengcheng said that Cong Rong
and Qin Chu went to the beach.

244
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,540
They haven’t come back yet.

245
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,020
Let’s go to find them.

246
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,790
Got it.

247
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,510
I’ll be there right away.

248
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,940
You are an excellent girl.

249
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,470
Your father must be proud of you.

250
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,540
Yeah.

251
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,750
I believe

252
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,420
he didn’t leave me.

253
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,660
For him,

254
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,820
I want to become a better person.

255
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,350
Actually, in my life,

256
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,660
there is also a person
who is very important to me.

257
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,840
He is the one

258
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,060
that I’m desperately trying to keep
by my side.

259
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,990
Is it Wen Shaoqing?

260
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,780
Yes.

261
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,540
I have known him for twelve years.

262
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,630
In the senior year of college,

263
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,630
the medical school organized
free clinical treatment.

264
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,900
The road was blocked by heavy snow.

265
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,390
He and I were stuck in the car
for one day and one night.

266
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,300
He let me drink the only hot water.

267
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,270
He never mentioned about it.

268
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,350
That’s who he is.

269
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,780
He doesn’t like taking credit.

270
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,470
He is open-minded.

271
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,900
He is composed.

272
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,350
I’m sure he doesn’t know

273
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,060
the reason that I tried so hard
to be admitted to his institute

274
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,870
and get myself into Yun Ji

275
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,990
is because I like him.

276
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,630
Why didn’t you just tell him?

277
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,000
Because all these years, he has been

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
focusing on surgery and study.

279
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,940
He never looked twice at a girl.

280
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,270
I think it’s just a matter of time

281
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,700
for us to be together.

282
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,870
As long as I keep waiting,

283
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,990
he will see me someday.

284
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,350
Cong Rong.

285
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,540
Cong Rong, I have a huge favor
to ask you.

286
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,750
I know it sounds like a moral coercion.

287
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,470
I’ve also been struggling

288
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,870
for a long time.

289
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,270
But... but...

290
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,350
Cong Rong! Cong Rong!

291
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,350
But I still want to ask you

292
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,470
not to become the variable
between us, okay?

293
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,470
Rong!

294
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,420
Cong Rong!

295
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,120
I know there might be a lot of
joyous moments between you

296
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,630
during the last two months.

297
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,270
But...

298
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,870
There are ten years

299
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,150
of such moments between us.

300
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,230
It’s... it’s our youth.

301
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:43,960
Cong Rong!

302
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,820
Qin Chu!

303
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,420
Rong!

304
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,080
Be careful.

305
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,270
Qin Chu, are you okay?

306
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,590
Qin Chu!

307
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,270
Honey, be careful.

308
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,500
Rong, are you okay?

309
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,350
Get up first.

310
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,510
Cong Rong!

311
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,200
Be careful!

312
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,940
-Be careful!
-Be careful!

313
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,390
Boss, be careful!

314
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,030
Be careful.

315
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,480
Be careful.

316
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,390
Honey, be careful.

317
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,420
How does it feel to like someone?

318
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,870
Compared with the throbbing heart
and sweetness,

319
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,740
sadness and pain
can more prove its existence.

320
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,630
The heart falling for him
is too dazzling,

321
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,110
therefore, we are all

322
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,830
hidden in

323
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,310
the bottomless darkness.

324
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,460
Come on.

325
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,780
Come on. Take care.

326
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,460
Be careful.

327
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,150
Come on.

328
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,740
Slow down.

329
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,910
Come on.

330
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,870
Rong, are you okay?

331
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,830
Rong.

332
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,630
You really scared me.

333
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,160
I’m fine.

334
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,220
I just slid down.

335
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,990
I’ll take a walk there.

336
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,940
Don’t worry about me.

337
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,640
Take your phone.

338
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,030
Don’t get lost again.

339
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,940
Be careful of the pits.

340
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,540
You...?

341
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,710
Qin Chu, what’s wrong with your foot?

342
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,500
Sorry.

343
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,830
I twisted my ankle accidentally.

344
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,550
It’s okay.

345
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,710
I have ointment for sprain.

346
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,940
Just use some
when we are back to the camp.

347
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,500
Let me help you. Let’s walk slowly.

348
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,020
Let me hold you.

349
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,630
Slowly.

350
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,870
Take care.

351
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,590
Cong Rong!

352
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,350
Luckily you are fine.

353
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,110
Let’s go.

354
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,180
I will show you something.

355
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,830
What’s wrong?

356
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,030
Dr. Wen.

357
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,260
There might be some
misunderstandings between us.

358
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,740
Misunderstandings?

359
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,150
What misunderstandings?

360
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,390
You are just a colleague
and a neighbor to me.

361
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,740
We have been too close
last two months.

362
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,220
It’s better to draw a clear line
between us.

363
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Do you really mean it?

364
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,830
Why would I lie?

365
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,240
You think everything I did for you

366
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,940
was done by a colleague?

367
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,980
A neighbor?

368
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,150
Right now,

369
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,590
I only want to finish
my internship in the hospital.

370
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,220
I don’t care

371
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,220
about those irrelevant people
and affairs.

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,260
I hope you can understand it.

373
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,460
Rong!

374
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,740
I still worry about you.

375
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,060
So I’m here to check on you.

376
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,390
Did I interrupt you?

377
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,440
No.

378
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,870
I’ve made it clear for him.

379
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,150
Then I’m relieved to curse him.

380
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,350
Now I finally know
what kind of a person he is.

381
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,640
He said he had liked that person

382
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
for a long time.

383
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,160
Isn’t that Qin Chu?

384
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,550
He likes Qin Chu.
And he flirts with you?

385
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,420
What a scum!

386
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,640
All right.

387
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,070
Don’t get so mad now.

388
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,030
So what do you think about him?

389
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,910
No matter how much I like him,

390
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,350
I won’t allow myself to be caught
between him and other people.

391
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,900
I will only be with someone
who likes me wholeheartedly.

392
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,740
However,

393
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,480
I know the fifth phase

394
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,500
when you like someone now.

395
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,700
It’s heartache.

396
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,440
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

397
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,310
Don’t forget there is a surgery
this afternoon.

398
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,980
Yeah.

399
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,350
<i>Neuromedicine Center</i>

400
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,190
Take a CT.

401
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,790
Okay.

402
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,820
<i>Remember to eat breakfast.
Wen Shaoqing</i>

403
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,540
<i>Remember to eat breakfast.
Wen Shaoqing</i>

404
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,140
<i>Emergency</i>

405
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,940
Dr. Qin, are you off work?

406
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,920
You are pretty today.

407
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,790
Do you have a date?

408
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,940
You can say so.

409
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,180
Where’s Dr. Wen?

410
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,150
Dr. Wen is still in surgery.

411
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,420
Okay.

412
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,590
You’ve had a long day.

413
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,110
Thanks.

414
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,390
Do you have time later?

415
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,030
Let’s have a meal together.

416
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,550
Is there any tricky case?

417
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,460
We can only discuss patients now?

418
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,150
Can’t we just have a normal meal?

419
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,900
Maybe next time.

420
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,030
I’ve been standing
for about eight hours today.

421
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,030
I’m a little tired.

422
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,660
Actually, I have something to tell you.

423
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,590
It’s about Cong Rong.

424
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,310
I’ll see you
at the new steakhouse downstairs.

425
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,590
Give me a minute.

426
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,630
I’ll go to change my clothes.

427
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,790
Steak?

428
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,070
Are you going to eat steak?

429
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,500
Can I...?

430
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,110
We both drank glucose
to finish the operation.

431
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,670
Someone treated my boss to a meal.

432
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,420
I...

433
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,430
I can only eat finger biscuits.

434
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,400
Give it back to me
if you don’t want to eat it.

435
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,180
Go to eat your hands.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,790
Rong.

437
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,420
Is there something wrong with my boss
after he came back from camping?

438
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,030
What’s wrong?

439
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,900
He looks cold.

440
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,790
We dare not take a breath
in front of him.

441
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,700
You know what?

442
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,390
He’s been ignoring me these days.

443
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,940
He hasn’t punished me
to write things for two weeks.

444
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,220
You are very sick.

445
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,740
Do you like being punished that much?

446
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,030
It’s not like that.

447
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,630
There is also a conservation law
for bad luck.

448
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,030
If he doesn’t punish me today,

449
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,180
I’m sure he will punish me
really hard tomorrow.

450
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,740
I dare not think about it.

451
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,220
Now in the whole hospital,
only Dr. Qin can comfort him.

452
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,590
Yes.

453
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,390
They are a perfect couple.

454
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,550
Yeah.

455
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,740
If it wasn’t for Dr. Qin
to treat him to a meal,

456
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,790
I was afraid he would get sick.

457
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,950
Dr. Qin treated him to a meal?

458
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,660
Yeah.

459
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,660
Who else can ask him out?

460
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,460
Where?

461
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,920
Don’t ask me.

462
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,700
You’ll only make me hungrier.

463
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,020
Your boss doesn’t care about you,

464
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,060
but I care about you.

465
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,870
Let’s go.

466
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,150
I’ll treat you to a big meal.

467
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,830
Really?

468
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,460
Steak!

469
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,870
Rib eye steak looks nice.

470
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,590
Come on, try this.

471
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,830
Rong!

472
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,500
Is there a limit of the expense
of this meal?

473
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,030
No.

474
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,870
Order anything as you want.

475
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,920
Why don’t you

476
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,700
come in?

477
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,220
You go inside first

478
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,200
and order whatever you like.

479
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,350
Eat whatever you want.

480
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,350
How do you know whether it tastes good

481
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,700
if you don’t try it?

482
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,030
Come closer.

483
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,420
What am I doing here?

484
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,940
Like a stalker.

485
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,020
I know there is
a good Japanese restaurant.

486
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,980
We can go there together next time.

487
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,500
Qin Chu.

488
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,550
Didn’t you say you had something
to tell me about Cong Rong?

489
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,940
Do you care about her that much?

490
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,260
What is it?

491
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,260
Under the slope that day,

492
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,830
she told me a lot of things about her.

493
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,310
She said

494
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,420
there was a very important boy for her.

495
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,260
Is it someone she likes?

496
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,630
I guess so.

497
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,460
Cong Rong is a good girl.

498
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,390
But do you have to choose her?

499
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,270
We used to study together
and take entrance exam together.

500
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,640
We helped other people
and came to Yun Ji together.

501
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,000
We...

502
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,720
Qin Chu.

503
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,350
Let me finish.

504
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,150
Qin Chu.

505
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,390
I cherish our time together

506
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,070
without distractions.

507
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,630
As good friends,

508
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,630
we helped each other and grew together.

509
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,070
Sir, your bill.

510
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,790
Rong.

511
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,870
Where is she?

512
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,790
No way!

513
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,110
If it wasn’t for Dr. Qin
to treat him to a meal,

514
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,460
I was afraid he would get sick.

515
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,670
In the whole hospital,

516
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,310
only Dr. Qin can comfort him.

517
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,260
Coming!

518
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,700
Oh, no.

519
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,030
I thought it was the delivery man.

520
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,880
Cong Rong.

521
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,000
I know you are inside.

522
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,740
Open the door.

523
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,870
If you don’t open the door,
I’ll keep knocking

524
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,260
until you open it.

525
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,670
How long are you going to hide from me?

526
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,150
Until the end of your internship?

527
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,870
You are such a coward.

528
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,310
Who is a coward?

529
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,590
Go ahead and talk.

530
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,550
Why are you avoiding me?

531
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,180
I’m not avoiding you.

532
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,350
I... I have been too busy these days.

533
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,160
I had no time to talk
to unimportant people.

534
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,110
Unimportant?

535
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,070
That’s the reason
why you drew a line with me?

536
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,460
What’s our relationship now?

537
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,550
Irrelevant colleagues?

538
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,590
Irrelevant neighbors?

539
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,310
Does it matter what our relationship is?

540
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,150
Anyway, you like Qin Chu,

541
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,700
don’t you?

542
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,150
Are you jealous?

543
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,070
Cong Rong.

544
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,500
Let me tell you clearly.

545
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,550
The person I like is not Qin Chu.

546
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,160
I like...

547
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,870
How is it possible?

548
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,190
You said you had liked that person

549
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,150
for a long time.

550
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,630
I guess she

551
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,180
doesn’t even know I like her.

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,700
Just don’t keep flirting with me.

556
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,590
I’m glad that you know

557
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,590

Who else would it be?

563
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,030
Calm down.

564
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,030
Forget it.

565
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,180
It can’t be me anyway.

You will be beautiful after you do it.

569
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,550
Does it hurt?

570
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,440
Not at all.

571
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,550
I do it every day.

572
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,270
I did it before.

573
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:02,640
Really?

574
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,350
Mom, Aunt.

575
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,200
Why did you come here

576
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,070
without telling me in advance?

577
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,070
That’s ridiculous.

578
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,310
Why should we tell you in advance?

579
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,030
Are you hiding something dishonorable?

580
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,710
What dishonorable things can I do?

581
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,540
I mean...

582
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,190
If you need help,

583
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,480
I can arrange it in advance.

584
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,160
I heard that the aesthetic medicine
of your hospital is good.

585
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,550
I’m going to Australia to see Rong.

586
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,550
Your mother asked me

587
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,350
to do something to my face.

588
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,350
Get the...

589
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,310
Mesotherapy.

590
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,680
Right.

591
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,070
We are here to get the mesotherapy.

592
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,980
Mesotherapy?

593
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,150
That’s good.

594
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,260
I knew the young people
would support it.

595
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,670
Your aunt

596
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,550
was worried that Rong would oppose it.

597
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,150
She won’t.

598
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,310
Make a video call now.

599
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,880
I’m sure she will support you.

600
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,310
All right.

601
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,880
Give her a surprise.

602
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,830
Aunt!

603
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,420
A video call is unnecessary.

604
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,200
What’s wrong?

605
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,400
Why are you freaking out?

606
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,180
Yeah.

607
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,190
I mean...

608
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,230
Our Plastic Surgery Department

609
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,990
is among the best in China.

610
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,190
Mesotherapy is a piece of cake.

611
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,350
Rong won’t worry about it.

612
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,590
Are you registered?

613
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,200
If not,

614
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,830
wait for me,

615
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,940
and I’ll go in and register for you.

616
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,310
You are funny.

617
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,950
We are already here.
How could we not register?

618
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,310
We are going to see a specialist.

619
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,500
Go away.

620
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,030

621
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,440
Rong.

622
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,240
Warning ahead.

623
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,270
Your mom and my mom are here now.

624
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,640
They are moving
to Plastic Surgery Department

625
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,350
and are expected to pass through
the outpatient hall.

626
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,200

Our head nurse likes you a lot.

633
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,950
She will definitely give you straight A.

634
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,830
That would be great.

635
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,500
Yeah.

636
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,670

Okay.

640
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,550
Why don’t you give it to me by yourself?

641
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,030
Looks like I lost the chance
to help you.

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,670
Auntie said she...

692
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,470
Critically ill?

693
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,950
Yeah.

694
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,760
Rong.

695
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,550
I didn’t

696
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,700
say anything.

697
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,950
Here is my power to you.

698
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,820
Looking forward to your triumphant
return from the cruel battlefield.

699
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,220
Hope I won’t die in the battle.

700
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,230
Aunt.

701
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,840
I’ll go inside.

702
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,550
Go ahead.

703
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,380
Go ahead.

704
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,220
My beautiful mother.

705
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,780
Even calling me fairy won’t work.

706
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,400
Tell me the truth.

707
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,430
When did you come back?

708
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,110
In early September.

709
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,630
The cute seagulls

710
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,830
and the wind at the port

711
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,590
are all your lies?

712
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,480
You are bold now.

713
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,830
You even lied to me

714
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,110
with Zhong Zhen

715
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,030
and that Zhou Chengcheng!

716
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,910
Mom.

717
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,030
Calm down.

718
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,820
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

719
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,030
I was waiting for the right time

720
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,150
to tell you.

721
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,380
Today is the right time.

722
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,760
If I didn’t run into you today,

723
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,820
when were you going to tell me?

724
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,910
You know it hurts?

725
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,190
You knew Rong was back

726
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,230
and you covered for her.

727
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,670
Don’t you know your aunt?

728
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,590
She will send her back

729
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,910
even by rowing a boat!

730
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,030
Mother.

731
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,510
Save some face for me.

732
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,780
My boss is still there.

733
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,990
I don’t have a say
in your family affairs.

734
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,380
Your boss?

735
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,910
Leader.

736
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,220
If he doesn’t listen to you,

737
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,070
you can also beat him.

738
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,030
See?

739
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,590
Just like this.

740
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,030
Pinch him hard.

741
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,220
Really hard.

742
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,990
I...

743
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,390
All right.

744
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,110
Don’t cry.

745
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,510
Come here.

746
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,430
Come here.

747
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,470
Do you miss me?

748
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,830
You can see me whenever you want.

749
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,960
If you just come back for a vacation,

750
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,990
I support you.

751
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,340
I am not on vacation.

752
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,220
It’s a long-term stay.

753
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,430
Long-term stay?

754
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,150
I understand.

755
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,840
Young people

756
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,030
like to take a gap year.

757
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,910
Right?

758
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,180
As long as you are not back to work,

759
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,150
I will still support you.

760
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,860
I’m back to work.

761
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,110
Work?

762
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,950
What job?

763
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,380
Are you back to be a lawyer?

764
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,660
Well...

765
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,550
What?

766
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,430
You are?

767
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,030
Oh, my god!

768
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,630
Mom! Mom!

769
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,280
Calm down.

770
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,230
Your wrinkles are squeezed out.

771
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,000
It’s not beautiful.

772
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,710
Do I look like a lawyer?

773
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,920
How would a lawyer wear a white coat
all day long

774
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
and wander around in the hospital?

775
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,700
Right?

776
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,070
That’s true.

777
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:19,670
But

778
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,880
why are you staying in the hospital?

779
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,910
Don’t fool me.

780
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,960
Listen, our neighbor Aunt Zhang’s son

781
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,280
is two years younger than Zhong Zhen.

782
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,310
There are few hairs left
on that almost bald head.

783
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,910
Being a doctor is not easy.

784
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,860
I am not a doctor.

785
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,700
I work at the General Reception Office.

786
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,660
Receive whom?

787
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,220
Isn’t that a service industry?

788
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,070
It doesn’t even match your major.

789
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,700
Medical finance.

790
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,110
An emerging industry.

791
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,380
I work at the General Reception Office.

792
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,150
All right.

793
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,960
Don’t tell me those things.

794
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,740
I don’t understand.

795
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,800
Anyway,

796
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,180
I don’t want you to come back to work.

797
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,390
Hurry up and settle your affairs.

798
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,470
I’ll send you back in person.

799
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,220
Mom.

800
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,820
I might not be able to go back.

801
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,920
You were turned down from the job

802
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,990
and you sold the house!

803
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,630
You really want to make me
critically ill, don’t you?

804
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,000
I...

805
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,360
Mom!

806
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,510
Your apartment
was in a very good location.

807
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,960
I even earned 10,000 dollars
after selling it!

808
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,800
That house I bought for you

809
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,070
was not for investment.

810
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,110
I bought it
so you could have no worries!

811
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,590
Why did you tear down the road

812
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,880
I just paved for you?

813
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,030
You came back alone.

814
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,430
How can I not worry?

815
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:20,880
Sister!

816
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,740
Sister!

817
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,990
Auntie.

818
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,920
Give it to me first.

819
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,300
Give this to me first.

820
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,070
Yeah.

821
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,020
Calm down.

822
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,400
Sit down first.

823
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,800
Come on.

824
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,220
It won’t be good
if the liquid flows back.

825
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,190
Am I all right?

826
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,990
You are fine.

827
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,660
Be good.

828
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,550
I think

829
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,030
it’s nice to be back.

830
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,260
Didn’t you read news from abroad?

831
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,630
There are

832
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,760
either explosions

833
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,820
or shootings every day.

834
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,470
Our country is much safer.

835
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,430
I know you worry that Rong
might have a rough time.

836
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,700
But I think Yun Ji is pretty good.

837
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,990
Zhong Zhen is still here.

838
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,430
Although he is not that clever,

839
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,590
he is lucky enough.

840
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,630
Maybe someday

841
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,190
he will become a leader

842
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,950
and can protect Cong Rong.

843
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,110
Waiting for you to protect me.

844
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,220
You’re a bad persuader.

845
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,110
After hearing what you said,

846
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,260
I think her future looks dimmer.

847
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,660
Sister.

848
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,230
You bragged about going to Australia,

849
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,230
but now you can’t.

850
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,350
So, it makes you lose face, right?

851
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,910
That’s why you don’t want
Cong Rong to be back?

852
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,230
Aunt.

853
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,280
How can you say that?

854
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,510
Is my mother such a cheesy,
vain and proud person?

855
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,190
I don’t think your mother is like that.

856
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,590
My mother is kind and open-minded.

857
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,910
Cut it out.

858
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,220
Don’t flatter me.

859
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,820
I don’t agree with you
to come back to work.

860
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,630
My feelings are complicated now.

861
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,470
I need to find a place to rest.

862
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,150
I think it’s good here.

863
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,030
The room is quite big.

864
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,220
The bed is also comfortable.

865
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,220
How about

866
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,990
I stay here for a few days?

867
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,760
No problem.

868
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:36,960
Come on.

869
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,550
Okay.

870
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,510
Auntie, please lie down.

871
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,700
I will arrange it for you.

872
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,150
This is a special ward.

873
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,030
3,800 yuan per day.

874
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,030
How many days do you want to stay here?

875
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,360
Where do you live?

876
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,190
I don’t need to stay in a ward!

877
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,760
Exactly.

878
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,480
It’s better to go back home!

879
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,000
Let’s go!

880
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,510
Take it.

881
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,260
Let’s go!

882
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,280
Hurry up.

883
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,260
Come on.

884
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,660
The sunset clouds are...

885
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,510
Kind of shy.

886
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,950
It doesn’t show up at all.

887
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,280
Wen.

888
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,320
Thank you

889
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,470
for sending us back.

890
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,700
Auntie, you are welcome.

891
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,860
I’m off work

892
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,110
and it’s on my way.

893
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,390
I’m so curious.

894
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,320
What kind of house can you rent

895
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,780
with 2,000 yuan in a big city?

896
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,550
It’s probably an urban village.

897
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,880
It’s not like that, Aunt.

898
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,950
It’s a regular community.

899
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,110
Regular community?

900
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,660
Either it is a group renting,

901
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,630
or the landlord is doing charity.

902
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,230
Auntie.

903
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,880
Yeah.

904
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,110
We’ll be at Cong Rong’s residence soon.

905
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,590
You can have a look

906
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,220
before making your decision.

907
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,700
Wen is right.

908
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,380
I reserve the right to send you back.

909
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,470
Mom, Aunt.

910
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,220
This way.

911
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,180
This building looks not old.

912
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,700
The management looks all right.

913
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,630
Oh, no.

914
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,260
I still have a pile
of law books at home.

915
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,590
Mom, Aunt.

916
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,400
My room is a bit messy.

917
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,960
Give me a minute.

918
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,860
I’ll tidy it up.

919
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,220
<i>Law books</i>

920
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,740
<i>Review of International Law</i>

921

<i>Corporate Law Reform</i>

922
