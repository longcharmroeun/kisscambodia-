Cong Rong.

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,830
You are finally here.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,440
I’ve been waiting for you.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,510
I’m sorry.

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
For so long.

36
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,030
Are you alright?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,710
Yeah.

38
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,060
Of course.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,590
I… I’m good.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,380
Although I’m here to make peace,

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,030
you don’t have to be so passionate.

42
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,280
Is this how doctors

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,980
welcome their new colleagues?

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,060
I’m specifically here to wait for you.

45
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,190
Nobody told me this.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,220
Sorry.

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,310
Sorry to keep you waiting.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,000
Next time you want to see me,

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,910
you can tell me directly.

50
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,190
We don’t need a messenger between us.

51
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,060
Are you here today

52
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,060
to just talk about business?

53
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,100
Not exactly.

54
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,910
If it’s not convenient for you now,

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,660
we can meet another time.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,150
I know

57
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,310
you have your own pride.

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,630
But do you know who I am?

59
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,910
I do.

60
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,100
Wen Shaoqing, the God of Craniotomy.

61
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,350
Sorry, I forgot.

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,430
That nurse told me

63
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,940
that you don’t like
flatulent compliment.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,870
You are Wen Shaoqing, a young doctor
from neurosurgery department.

65
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,750
Did I say something wrong again?

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,220
This guy is hard to get along with.

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,500
I’d better go now.

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
(Zhong Zhen)

69
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,820
Boss.

70
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,150
The meeting is over.

71
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,780
And the task is accomplished.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,980
Any reward for me?

73
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,860
That’s unfair!

74
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,350
I can understand if there’s no reward,

75
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,270
but I’m not a punchbag.

76
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,300
You stood my cousin up,

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,950
and I took the blame for you.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,660
I attended those meetings for you,

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,470
and now you beat me up!

80
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,630
Let’s continue.

81
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,220
Why?

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,180
What did I do wrong?

83
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,950
You must explain it to me!

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,700
Never mind.

85
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,860
You are always right.

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,660
If they bully you again,

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,950
just tell me.

88
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,070
My name is Cong Rong.

89
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,980
You can also call me Swordswoman.

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,030
I’ll marry you when I’m back.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,100
My waiting is not in vain.

94
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,070
Mr. Liang made this

95
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,300
especially for you, Swordswoman.

96
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
If I didn’t see it with my own eyes,

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,560
I would never believe it.

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,510
Right?

99
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,100
Aren’t I a business genius?

100
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,310
Look at this store.

101
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,270
I just randomly took it over.

102
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,320
The cook.

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,350
I randomly hired him.

104
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,320
The name.

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,620
I just randomly
opened a dictionary and found it.

106

108
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,300
Isn’t that amazing?

109
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,540
Life.

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,740
What?

111
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,390
Why do you look so down?

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,630
Some problem at work?

113
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,580
More than that.

114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,380
My career is collapsing

115
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,470
right at the beginning.

116
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,060
Look at them.

117
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,430
We’re all interns.

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,710
But they signed big contracts,

119
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,270
and are appreciated by their boss.

120
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,420
And look at me.

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,350
You are not bad either.

122
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,150
You have your own special advantage.

123
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
What advantage?

124
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,320
Tell me about it.

125
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,270
Me, of course.

126
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,470
I’m a perfect BFF.

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,500
Don’t be afraid of losing your job.

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,630
This place will always be

129

Life is so hard.

132
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,220
It’s OK.

133
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,470
Do you remember that 8.2?

134
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,070
I have 8.2.

135
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,950
No need to give me change.

136
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,350
That extremely cute guy?

137
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,910
Tell me about it.

138
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,980
He’s really unbelievable.

139
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,780
My first task

140
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,270
in the hospital

141
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,740
is about him.

142
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,740
There’s a patient in our hospital...

(Rang Kai Bookstore)

145
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,100
It looks like

146
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,860
you two were bound to meet.

147
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,750
Do you know what that means?

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,660
It means you two are destined
to be together.

149
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,540
You mean I’m destined
to be bullied by him?

150
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,830
If I cannot deal with him,

151
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,300
how will I go back to the law firm?

152
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
Don’t go back then.

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,940
No way.

154
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,220
I want to be a lawyer.

155
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,100
I really don’t understand you.

156
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,550
You’ve got a master’s degree of finance

157
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,070
in Australia.

158
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,470
And you’ve got a great job offer.

159
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,470
Why do you come back to suffer?

160
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,300
I’m not afraid of difficulties.

161
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,030
The thing I’m afraid of is

162
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,220
unable to do what I want to.

163
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,220
That’s the difference
between you and me.

164
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,750
Look at me.

165
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,660
When I play games, I choose easy mode.

166
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,540
That makes me feel relaxed and happy.

167
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,320
But you

168
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,660
are serious about everything.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,270
People like you

170
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,030
are destined to always be tired.

171
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,260
But you

172
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,420
are serious about everything.

173
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,780
People like you

174
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,590
are destined to always be tired.

175
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,520
Dad,

176
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,670
what’s a lawsuit?

177
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,980
That’s like fighting against monsters.

178
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,100
So you are a hero?

179
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,550
Like Peter Pan?

180
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,460
Like Spider Man?

181
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,100
Can you protect good people?

182
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,900
Of course.

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,710
But Lawsuit Man
should conceal his identity.

184
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,920
Please keep this secret for me.

185
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,440
OK.

186
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,670
You promise?

187
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,350
I promise.

188
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,020
This secret will be safe
for a hundred years.

189
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,350
Courage Duck.

190
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,740
The Lawsuit Man shall never lose!

191
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,710
Tomorrow,

192
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,070
I’ll turn on hard mode again.

193
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,790
Fighting!

194
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,860
I don’t mean to start it now!

195
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,140
You are suddenly so nice to me.

196
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,740
I’m a little afraid.

197
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,910
Give it back then.

198
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,900
No.

199
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,310
I’ll fill myself up first.

200
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,790
Zhong Zhen.

201
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,620
Yeah?

202
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,900
Let me ask you.

203
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,340
You rent that apartment
for your cousin?

204
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,140
Yeah.

205
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,670
What’s her name?

206
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,860
Cong Rong.

207
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,740
What’s wrong?

208
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,620
When you introduce someone next time,

209
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,260
say their names first.

210
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,260
My cousin’s name is Cong Rong.

211
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,790
Boss,

212
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,790
do you have other questions?

213
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,260
Let’s make it clear
before it’s too late.

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,350
I don’t accept multiple tenants.

215
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,430
Don’t worry.

216
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,270
She just returned from abroad.

217
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,510
She’s not local

218
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,740
and doesn’t have friends here.

219
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,860
She’ll live alone.

220
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,100
And she can’t put
other people up for the night.

221
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,310
Other people?

222
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,030
Like her boyfriend?

223
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,790
Does she have one?

224
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,550
She does…

225
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,100
not have one.

226
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,740
She grew up

227
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,140
with a lot of girls around her.

228
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,670
None of her friends are boys.

229
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,500
It’s my bad luck

230
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,470
that she doesn’t have a boyfriend.

231
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,500
If she could have a boyfriend,

232
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,070
I’d like to offer incense
to Guanyin Buddha for three years.

233
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,190
That’s for praying for a child.

234
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,900
Is it?

235
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,470
Rong.

236
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,200
Zhong Zhen! Come to my place!

237
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,470
The power is off!

238
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,190
Quickly!

239
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,350
Rong.

240
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,310
It’s me.

241
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,710
Coming.

242
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,110
My dear cousin is here!

243
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,470
It’s such a bad day for me!

244
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,790
You brat.

245
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,070
It’s just been a year,

246
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,310
and you’ve got some
great dorsal muscles.

247
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,380
Rong.

248
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,980
I’m here.

249
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,020
So...

250
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,550
It’s me.

251
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,790
It’s fixed.

252
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,790
It’s the first surgery I did
on circuits.

253
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,140
I’m pretty good, huh?

254
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,430
Come on, you two.

255
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,590
One is my cousin,

256
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,550
and the other is my boss.

257
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,100
Don’t be so shy like this.

258
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,860
Do you

259
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,860
want something to eat?

260
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,260
I can go out to buy something.

261
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,590
The atmosphere
is even colder than Siberia.

262
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,380
Zhong Zhen didn’t tell me

263
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,280
that the apartment was yours.

264
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,860
You are pretty nice
to the landlord though.

265
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,100
You even hugged me.

266
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,220
That’s an accident.

267
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,640
I didn’t know you’d come too.

268
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,220
You always hug your cousin like that?

269
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,190
You are...

270
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,950
Although you are pretty harsh,

271
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,270
your apartment is really good.

272
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,910
And thank you

273
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,020
for coming to help.

274
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,950
As for other things,

275
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,470
don’t bother to worry about them.

276
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,550
To avoid trouble,

277
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,980
we can communicate directly
in the future.

278
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,590
Friend me on WeChat.

279
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,070
I don’t think it’s necessary.

280
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,260
It’ll be easier for you to pay rent,

281
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,640
and to call me for help.

282
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,900
You are a doctor who’s always busy.

283
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,030
I won’t bother you
with my trivial things.

284
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,990
Zhong Zhen can help me.

285
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,430
Zhong Zhen has his things to do.

286
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,020
Also,

287
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,220
you are his family

288
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
and I am his tutor.

289
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,020
It’s necessary for us to keep in touch,

290
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,950
so he can progress faster.

291
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,910
Dr. Wen,

292
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,430
you are pretty funny.

293
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,040
Why don’t you keep in touch

294
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,470
with your patients instead?

295
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,980
(Febuxostat)
You seem pretty idle now.

296
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,200
Why don’t we

297
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,430
talk about Mr. Lin’s case?

298
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,950
OK.

299
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,590
The summary is not
that complicated actually.

300
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,220
I was going to send it
to you through WeChat.

301
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,550
Now that you don’t want to friend me,

302
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,620
just forget it.

303
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,420

306
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,470
Any problem?

307
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,740
Your WeChat username

308
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,380
is as abstruse as you are.

309
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,740
So,

310
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,070
what time will I get the summary today?

311
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,620
Did I say today?

312
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,100
Are you kidding me?

313
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,140
When it’s ready,

314
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,470
I’ll tell you.

315
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,310
It’s pretty late now.

316
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,550
Go to bed early.

317
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,260
I’m back!

318
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,430
You two enjoy.

319
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,430
Boss,

320
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,470
are you leaving?

Rong.

322
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,070
Help yourself!

323
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,310
What did I do wrong again?

324
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,140
That’s so embarrassing!

325
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,740

Let me figure out

350
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,900
what’s up your sleeve.

351
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,550
Where’s the summary?

352
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,900
I knew it.

353
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,270
So,

354
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,660
you want to take me out
for a walk so early?

355
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,180
Put these on.

356
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,120
What on earth do you want?

357
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,420
Do you want the summary or not?

358
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,590
Not bad.

359
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,750
Let’s go.

360
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,880
Don’t tell me

361
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,070
you just want me to jog with you.

362
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,030
That’s right.

363
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,790
Is there a problem?

364
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,510
Yes!

365
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,750
I can sacrifice my sleep

366
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,350
for my work.

367
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,700
That doesn’t mean

368
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,230
you can order me around.

369
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,230
Please stop wasting
my feeling and energy.

370
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,070
Remember

371
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,430
to send me the summary.

372
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,310
Thank you.

373
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,230
Wait.

374
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,230
That’s a deal.

375
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,700
If you trip and hurt yourself,

376
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,270
that doesn’t count as
an occupational injury.

377
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,620
This guy

378
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,140
is really weird.

379
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,270
You are pretty good.

380
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,790
If I ran behind you,

381
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,350
it would look like
I was being walked by you.

382
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,510
I’m not your dog.

383
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,780
You’re wrong.

384
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,440
My dog

385
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,590
always runs ahead of me.

386
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,310
My legs just had their own ideas.

387
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,600
This is the right position.

388
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,660
Don’t you know

389
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,460
the position is not fixed?

390
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,510
Dr. Wen,

391
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,030
running backwards is pretty dangerous.

392
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,180
It seems that she didn’t change much.

393
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,660
What did you say?

394
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,460
I said, a good doctor
calls for a healthy body.

395
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,750
I’m not being a doctor.

396
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,230
What are you doing?

397
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,080
It hurts!

398
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,270
You are too slow.

399
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Do you want to pass your sports test?

400
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,710
Do you want to get rid of your nickname

401
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,940
“Little Spinning Top”?

402
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,860
Faster!

403
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,270
Does this count as a pass?

404
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,620
You want to cheat?

405
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,420
Another kilometer then.

406
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,350
Get up!

407
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,310
Come on!

408
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,870
I can’t.

409
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,620
Come on!

410
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,870
No.

411
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,700
I’m done.

412
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,660
I’m done.

413
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,380
All right.

414
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,030
Can you give me the summary now?

415
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,750
I didn’t say I’d give it to you
after the jog, did I?

416
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,100
Wen Shaoqing!

417
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,350
If you really want to do your work well,

418
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,590
come with me and try
to experience the life as a doctor.

419
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,620
How about that?

420
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,620
But...

421
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,230
I really... I...

422
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,980
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

423
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,780
Judging from the CT scan,

424
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,350
(Inpatient Department)
the patient needs a surgery ASAP.

425
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,790
Do any of you have a plan?

426
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,070
Zhong Zhen.

427
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,620
Tell us about the possible risks
of this surgery.

428
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,700
There might be a hemorrhage,

429
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,940
which would cause
an intracranial hypertension.

430
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,230
At which part?

431
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,070
The foramen magnum.

432
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,310
Copy the formation
of cerebral hernia for 50 times.

433
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,700
You are not allowed to get off work
before you finish.

434
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,660
50 times?

435
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,700
Director! Director!

436
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,100
However hard it is,

437
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,860
the surgery needs to be done.

438
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,350
Gentlemen,

439
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,790
work out a operation plan today,

440
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,030
and take every possible risk

441
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,620
into consideration.

442
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,350
I want to see it on my desk
before you get off work.

443
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,420
That’s all.

444
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,940
Shaoqing,

445
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,230
I was going to ask you just now.

446
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,990
Who…Who’s this?

447
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,310
Is she a new intern of our department?

448
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,550
General reception office.

449
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,400
Good.

450
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,420
Good.

451
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,230
You are something, Wen Shaoqing.

452
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,440
You are with a girl
from general reception office.

453
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,270
What are you playing?

454
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,420
Minesweeper?

455
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,180
I volunteered to come to experience.

456
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,600
Experience?

457
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,160
Some people say

458
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,840
I should know my subject well.

459
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,910
So I came.

460
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,460
Hello.

461
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,200
I’m Cong Rong.

462
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,080
Nice to meet you.

463
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,790
Hello.

464
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,860
I’m Chen Cu.

465
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,950
Nice.

466
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,860
Cong Rong.

467
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,080
It sounds peaceful

468
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,120
and calm.

469
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,030
Nice name.

470
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,920
Come on.

471
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,990
Let’s go make the rounds.

472
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,790
50 times.

473
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,270
50 times.

474
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,740
What’s going on?

475
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,460
Why do I feel
he has a problem with me?

476
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,980
Isn’t it obvious?

477
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,620
When you are close
to general reception office,

478
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,180
you are close to trouble.

479
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,070
Of course he has a problem.

480
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,180
I loathe you for knowing nothing.

481
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,790
I’m already miserable enough,

482
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,630
and you still hit me.

483
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,510
What are you waiting for?

484
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,900
That’s enough!

485
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,350
Your despondent face

486
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,700
is going to scare the patients.

487
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Rong,

488
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,750
do you get why 30-year-old doctors

489
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,740
look like they are 50 now?

490
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,700
Why?

491
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,600
It’s all because of tutors like him

492
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,140
who like seeing people suffer.

493
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,860
If your logic is right,

494
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,790
she’s only 10-year-old?

495
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,220
Dr. Qin Chu?

496
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,270
She’s different.

497
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,100
She enjoys equal popularity
with my boss.

498
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,300
Equal popularity?

499
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,510
In our hospital,

500
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,020
their operation abilities

501
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,200
are among the top two.

502
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,750
Thank you.

503
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,790
Wen Shaoqing is the best.

504
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,990
Qin Chu is the second best.

505
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,440
Their faces are blessed

506
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,880
by the God of Youth.

507
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,030
And their hands are kissed
by the God of Surgery.

508
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,070
They are favored by the creator.

509
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
That classmate of ours

510
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
has become a medical representative.

511
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
And he wants to treat
all our classmates to dinner.

512
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,160
Do you want to go?

513
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,790
It’ll be a social dinner.

514
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,430
I’m not going.

515
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,590
I knew you’d say that.

516
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,860
I’ve turned it down for you already.

517
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,860
Thank you.

519
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,700
Dr. Wen.

520
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,620
Wang Hongmei.

521
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,150
How do you feel today?

522
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,190
Doctor,

523
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,230
can I have the surgery this afternoon?

524
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,160
I’m having a bad headache.

525
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,120
I’m not sure yet.

526
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,460
You’ll be informed.

527
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,100
Doctor, when is my surgery?

528
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,230
This afternoon.

529
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,510
But I don’t know the specific time.

530
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,700
Do you feel your legs now?

531
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,160
Yes.

532
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,180
Yes?

533
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,900
Wang Peilan.

534
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,020
How do you feel after the surgery?

535
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,100
You are recovering well.

536
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,990
But you still can’t drink tea or coffee.

537
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,550
Understand?

538
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,920
If there’s no exceptional case,

539
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,030
you can be discharged in three days.

540
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,150
But you still need to watch
what you eat.

541
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,080
Have a good rest.

542
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,750
OK.

543
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,350
OK, goodbye.

544
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,160
We’ve been to so many wards,

545
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,460
but the questions are all the same.

546
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,510
Those who didn’t have a surgery

547
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,300
would ask about the surgery time.

548
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,160
And for those who had their surgeries,

549
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,860
we’d tell them the do’s and don’ts.

550
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,540
I’ll be able to recite those lines

551
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,740
in a few days.

552
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,420
You understand the difficulties
to be a doctor now?

553
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,990
The patients always have questions.

554
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
They ask questions

555
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,310
anytime and anywhere.

556
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,870
As for us,

557
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,190
put it as one sentence.

558
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,750
Humans are repeaters in nature.

559
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,510
But I’m special.

560
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,270
I’m carbon paper.

561
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,400
What you saw just now...

562
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,140
Dr. Wen! Dr. Wen!

563
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,880
I’m the daughter
of the patient in Bed 38.

564
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,920
I have to ask you again

565
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,180
about the surgery time.

566
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,270
Be patient, please.

567
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,030
We don’t know.

568
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,950
It depends on
the operating room arrangements.

569
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,840
If the surgery can’t be arranged today,

570
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,900
you may have to wait until tomorrow.

571
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,080
Impressive!

572
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,990
Dr. Cong.

573
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,630
You’re right.

574
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,700
Humans

575
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,030

Excuse me.

Your spaghetti.

579
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,080
The dishes are all served.

580
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,940
Please enjoy.

581
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,790
How is it?

582
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,950
Do you like the food?

583
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,670
Good. Good.

584
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,440
Very delicious.

585
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400

586

We are having a surge
in customers today.

590
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,990
Judging by the situation now,

591
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,780
some of them will have to wait
till tonight.

592
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,790
They might get impatient

593
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,030
and just leave.

594
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,400
Only if we could set up
several more tables.

595
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,150
Waiter.

596
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,070
Can I order now?

597
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,270
Set up more tables?

598
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,270

Hello?

603

I think I heard something.

Hello.

If there’s somebody in there,

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,790
can I have a talk with you?

607
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,100
Nobody’s in.

00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,940

outside your store?)

611

No?

612
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,660
Why so stingy?

613
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,990
(Please don’t be so “arbitrary”.
We should help each other.)

Yeah?

623
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,350
Do we set up the tables or not?

624
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,350
Yes!

625
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,350
OK.

and waiting for 40 minutes

628
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,310
is also a part of doctor’s daily life?

cold hospital canteen food?

Dr. Wen,

643
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,360
I want to tell you

644
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,230
that I have done
a thorough self-reflection.

645
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,160
And this half-day experience
made me realize

646
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,270
that you are really busy

647
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,230
and tired.

648
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,550
When you gave me only 1 minute,

649
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,100
there was nothing personal.

650
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,620
Yeah.

651
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,100
I’ll have a look.

652
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,310
Let him come to me with his CT result.

653

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,700
And since you have achieved
your ultimate goal,

655
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,070
I’ll be out of your way
for the afternoon.

you’d experience a whole day.

00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,070
Also, I haven’t finished it yet.

661

Yesterday, you said this morning.

662
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,230
And this morning, you said tonight.

663
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,070
And now you are telling me
you didn’t write it?

664
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,230
Does my face say “lie to me” to you?

665
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,940
Do you think I have time
to write it in the daytime?

666
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,150
You gave all your time to them.

Why don’t you save some
for the general reception office?

Do you know what one second means?

Writing a letter?

670
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,880
It could mean the difference
between life and death.

Several muscle cells

672

and a milliliter of lactic acid

673
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,550
can cause the change of brain swelling.

674

In one second,

675
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,100
a surgery could go
from a success to a failure.

belong to my patients.

for the surgery.

688
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,200
OK.

689
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,990

Weren’t you invited
to the neurosurgery department

695
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,460
to have an experience by Dr. Wen?

697
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,470
You heard about that?

698
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,590
I also heard

699
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,710
that after you identified yourself,

700
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,750
those brats were scared off immediately.

701
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,910
That’s when I realized
our status in this hospital.

702
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,750
We are just like Voldemort.

703
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,070
They even don’t dare to talk about us.

704
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,100
It’s just that,

705
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,700
how should we mediate things like this?

706
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,940
Actually,

707
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,070
you trying to walk into
doctors’ daily life

708
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,140
is a very good start.

709

Mediation

710
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,830
is to bring different opinions
into agreement.

711
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,750
And you

712
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,590
are the bond which links the two ends.

713
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,270
I’m that important?

714
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,660
Even more important than that.

I do.

739

But look at it.

740

These guests have waited for hours.

741
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,310

762
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,940
You...! You...! You...!

What do you want?

00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,310
There was a man named Cao Shang
in ancient Song State.

767
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,380
You know that?

768
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,710
Who?

769
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,420
The kings of Song and Qin
awarded many carriages to him.

770
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,270
So he came to Chuang Tzu to show off.

771
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,580
Do you know
what Chuang Tzu said to him?

772
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,710
What?

773
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,940
Chuang Tzu said,

774
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,060
“Out you go.”

775
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,540
What?

776
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,750
Get out.

777
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,790
Get out!

778
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,230
He told that damn story
to let me get out!

779
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,830
Nobody ever talked to me like that!

780
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,590
For the past years,
I opened the restaurant

781
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,600
without the help from my family.

782
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,310
I got where I am from scratch.

783
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,830
I just want to prove myself.

784
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,830
But now,

785
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,640
my loyal guests

786
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,790
were scared away by him.

787
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,740
Since they are loyal guests,

788
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,160
they won’t abandon you so easily.

789
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,190
Just apologize to them
and give them a discount and that’s it.

790
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,270
Is that the point?

791

794
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,580
I’m so depressed now.

795
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,120
Who told me not to be so serious,

796
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,350
to relax a little bit

797
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,520
and not to be so tired?

798
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
You don’t know

799
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,630
how he sounded and looked like.

800
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,460
Get out.

801
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,110
Could you stand that?

802
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,860
He won over you
with a smile on his face.

803
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,750
This man is something.

804
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,790
Right?

805
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,350
Right?

806
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,540
He’s something, huh?

807
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,350
Are you my friend or his?

808
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,790
Why are you complimenting him?

809
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,430
Come on.

810
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,630
When I’m done
with this busy period of time,

811
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,790
I’ll go seek revenge for you.

812
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,940
No need for that.

813
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,020
I’ve done it myself.

814
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,630
He was trying to act
like he knew everything.

815
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,190
Then I did the same to him.

816
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,230
The way that I took was powerful

817
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,670
and the influence would be profound.

818
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,220
He’ll remember it for a long time.

Where did you get them?

825

That’s a very long story.

827
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,830
this is the limited edition
for this spring and summer?

828
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,560
I looked everywhere
and couldn’t find them.

829
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,160
But you are actually wearing them.

830
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,190
I don’t believe it!

831
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,750
Limited edition?

Who’s it?

835
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,150
So there’s really something going on.

836
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,630
Tell me about it.

To let me experience
the hard daily life as a doctor,

839
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,750
he gave me these shoes.

840
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,980
Does he want me
to run around behind him every day?

841
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,940
According to my rich love experience,

842
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,950
he must have feelings for you.

843
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,270
He just wants to scare me off.

844

But after this whole day,

845
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,960
I realized the difficulties
to be a doctor.

846

when the surgery is finished,

861
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,230
we’ll inform you about it.

862
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,200
Don’t worry.

863

It’s going to be all right.

That day,

I finally learned another side of him.

869
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,740
On the battleground of life and death,

870
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,160
he’s like Kratos, the God of War,

871
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,160
who carries people’s trust,

872
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,860
fighting against death with his life.

behind the door

876
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,540
finally realize
the taste of long waiting.
