Hello.

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,780
When did you become so close that

91
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,290
you’re having dinner together?

92
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,320
What drink do you want?

93
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,530
Water, please.

94
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,850
I haven’t interrogated you yet.

95
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,080
Now you’re turning yourself in?

96
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,900
What happened?

97
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,010
What?

98
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,380
He’s just finished an operation

99
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,490
and came here for dinner.

100
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,610
Don’t overthink.

101
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,880
Rong.

102
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,780
Don’t you think he’s the type

103
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,820
who’s cold on the outside
but passionate on the inside?

104
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,170
Zhou Chengcheng.

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,000
He can’t hear us.

106
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,170
If it weren’t for my Lulu

107
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,840
who treats me like a queen,

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,850
I’ll pursue him myself.

109
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,970
Stop. Stop. Stop.

110
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,760
Did you see that?

111
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:33,700
Fine.

112
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,530
Go, go, go.

113
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,260
Forget about me.

114
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,000
Go ahead.

115
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,760
It’s raining.

116
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,730
Why are you sitting outside?

117
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,970
Don’t you feel cold?

118
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,220
This is a very trendy restaurant

119
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,240
where people have to
wait in lines all night.

120
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,820
It’s fortunate that we can find a seat.

121
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,410
Others would beg for our seats.

122
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,370
Really?

123
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,340
You spend most of your time
with the patients.

124
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,370
This information is
beyond your field of expertise.

125
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,610
You’re right.

126
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,640
So, in the future, when you’re free,

127
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,570
you can find time to educate me more.

128
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,240
We can teach each other.

129
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,440
Does an operation really take so long?

130
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,610
Some may take even longer.

131
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,640
Have you seen an operation
that takes 24 hours?

132
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,090
Does it really take that long?

133
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,250
What if you want to use the restroom?

134
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,290
What if you’re tired?

135
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,970
Brain surgeries are complicated.

136
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,800
They often require group cooperation.

137
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,410
So when the other surgeons
are operating,

138
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,730
I can adjust myself.

139
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,240
Come on.

140
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,530
This is our original
Sichuan style steak.

141
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,460
Have a try.

142
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,240
Thank you.

143
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,370
Take your time.

144
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,530
Do you know how to cut through
a person’s skull?

145
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,930
How?

146
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,370
First, you have to shave his hair.

147
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,000
Then you use a fretsaw

148
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,200
to cut through the skull

149
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,490
and remove the bone flap.

150
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,530
Cut the dura.

151
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,800
Find the location of the tumor.

152
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,560
And remove it.

153
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,320
Then the operation is completed.

154
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,680
You did this on purpose?

155
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,490
But, unfortunately,

156
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,090
this won’t affect my appetite.

157
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,440
Don’t throw up.

158
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,490
It’ll be embarrassing
if your friend sees.

159
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,410
This is too spicy.

160
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,410
Aren’t you good at eating spicy food?

161
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,530
Who said that?

162
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,290
I never eat spicy food.

163
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,250
Doughnut.

164
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,680
You’re not full again?

165
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,880
Great.

166
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,290
I can’t finish mine.

167
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,320
You can have mine.

168
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,490
You lied to me.

169
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,050
Doughnut.

170
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,280
You’re a fat spinning top

171
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,460
that can’t spin

172
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,640
because you’re too big.

173
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,120
Why are you bullying him?

174
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,800
It’s none of your business.

175
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,760
I’m the swordswoman.

176
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,970
At the sight of injustice,

177
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,330
I shall draw a sword and help.

178
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,920
Let me eat it for you.

179
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,690
Is spicy food really that scary?

180
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,850
You really can’t eat spicy food?

181
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,400
Dr. Wen,

182
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,370
are you obsessed with eating spicy food?

183
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,120
Or,

184
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,940
your standard for friendship

185
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,240
is evaluated by one’s ability
to eat spicy food?

186
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,120
If you’re not scared of them,

187
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,160
they can’t bully you.

188
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,730
Okay.

189
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,400
All right.

190
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,570
If they bully you again,

191
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,760
come to me for help.

192
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you.

193
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,120
Where can I find you?

194
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,210
Class Eleven.

195
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,160
My name is Cong Rong.

196
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,330
You can also call me swordswoman.

197
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,970
I have a friend.

198
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,650
She lied to me.

199
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,370
I see.

200
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,370
It seems that you’re really
holding a grudge.

201
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,160
I really want to figure out
what’s in her head.

202
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,260
(Western cuisine)

203
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,280
Don’t catch a cold.

204
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,880
Let’s go see Mr. Lin later.

205
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,060
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

206
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,210
Mr. Lin?

207
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,730
So he actually eats.

208
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,120
If he really has been fasting for days,

209
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,490
he would be receiving glucose now.

210
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,090
How do you know he’s eating here?

211
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,760
Did you send food to him?

212
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,490
It was Zhong Zhen.

213
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,420
Zhong Zhen is so simple.

214
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,060
If you hadn’t said anything,

215
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,450
how was he supposed to think of this?

216
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,330
I thought you were so rational
that you became indifferent.

217
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,420
Mr. Lin’s brain tumor

218
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,760
is now oppressing his brain stem.

219
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,450
It’s a time bomb

220
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,090
that might explode at any time.

221
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,970
Rather than letting him go home,

222
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,240
it’s better to keep him supervised.

223
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,330
If that’s the case,

224
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,330
why did you allow him to leave?

225
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,120
I’m a neurosurgeon.

226
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,920
I’m not the god.

227
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,280
My job is to cure their body.

228
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,600
But I can’t change the way they think,

229
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,240
nor can I change their life’s path.

230
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,210
I can only respect their choice.

231

(Well done. I’ve given you
a few comments. You can submit it.)

241
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,780
(Thank you.)

242

(You had a tough day.
Go to bed earlier.)

243

(Good night.)

244

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,970
See you tomorrow.

She’s the girl in the photo?

254
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,370
Yes, she is.

255
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,090
Director Yan.

256
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,460
Yes?

257
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,420
This is the briefing
Dr. Wen wrote overnight

258
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,040
and the responsibility
confirmation report I wrote.

259
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,090
After I’ve communicated it with Dr. Wen,

260
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,690
I can discuss it in details
with Mr. Lin.

(Briefing on

262
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,290
Great.

263
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,370
This is very detailed.

Cong.

265
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,810
Dr. Wen is pretty nice, right?

266
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,970
In which aspect?

267
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,920
Personality or professional competence?

268
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,000
Nothing.

269
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,690
Go talk to Dr. Wen.

270
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,490
Cong Rong.

271
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,730
She is the new legal intern.

272
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Really?

273
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,690
She just arrived a few days ago.

274
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,060
This happened so fast?

275
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,820
Romance

276
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,570
is about feelings.

277
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,280
If time is all that matters,

278
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,090
the kid of Dr. Wen and me
would be over 3 years old

279
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,370
because I’ve been here

280
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,730
since Dr. Wen was an intern.

281
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,330
In your dreams.

282
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,370
What is that?

283
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,010
I heard a rumor.

284
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,770
What?

285
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,700
The one in the photo is not Cong Rong.

286
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,300
Who is it then?

287
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,520
It’s Dr. Qin.

288
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,040
I said so.

289
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,840
It must be Dr. Qin.

290
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,420
Dr. Wen and Dr. Qin
are supposed to be together.

291
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,400
No.

292
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,120
I don’t agree with that.

293
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,440
I think Dr. Qin and Zhong Zhen
are meant to be.

294
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,980
That’s more acceptable to me.

295
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,950
One vote for Zhong Zhen.

296
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,750
He posted that photo.

297
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,270
Why did you vote for him?

298
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,710
Speak of the devil.

299
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,420
Dr. Zhong,

300
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,510
you dropped your casebook.

301
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,820
You dropped your integrity as well.

302
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,590
Cousin.

303
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,240
Tell me.

304
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,350
What have you done?

305
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,270
I didn’t mean to leak it.

306
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,810
Last night after work,

307
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,370
I helped Boss deliver food to Mr. Lin.

308
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,400
Boss told me that

309
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,040
I must not be found.

310
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,450
But a nurse happened to pass by.

311
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,570
So, in the panic...

312
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,640
Zhong Zhen,

313
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,180
why don’t you go home after work?

314
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,240
What are you here for?

315
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,690
What did you just put there?

316
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,280
I...

317
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,690
Isn’t this the time for our daily routine
of worshiping Dr. Wen’s beauty?

318
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,050
Look.

319
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,340
I’ve taken enough photos.

320
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,730
I have over nine photos.

321
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,300
Really?

322
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,370
Then send them right now.

323
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:04,890
Sure.

324
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,880
Remember to send in full sizes.

325
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,100
Done.

326
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,090
Take your time and enjoy.

327
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,250
That’s it.

328
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,440
(Yun Ji Dr. Wen’s fan group)
That’s how the photo was leaked.

329
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,650
(What’s going on?)
I didn’t mean to send it.

330
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,700
(I’m jealous.)
But I was afraid that Boss’s plan

331
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,680
(I want to lean on his shoulders.)
will fail if people find out

332
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,200
(I can’t believe this is true.)
that we’re delivering food to Mr. Lin.

333
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,910
The heaven and earth

334
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,100
can testify for my integrity.

335
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,430
It was an accident.

336
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,060
I almost believed you.

337
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,470
Did you take the photo or not?

338
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,110
Photo? What photo?

339
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,710
Everything you say now

00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,780
I confess.

343
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,030
I took the photo.

344
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,020
But when I took it,
I didn’t know it was you.

345
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,060
Besides, I didn’t mean to send it.

346
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,380
When I realized it,

347
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,820
it was too late to recall.

348
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,470
It was just a mistake?

349
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,150
Wait for me!

350
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,270
Wait for me!

351
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,860
What are you planning again?

352
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,860
Come in.

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,320
I’ve reviewed Mr. Lin’s case.

354
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,820
I think it wasn’t
the hospital’s responsibility.

355
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,340
From today on, I’ll try to persuade
Mr. Lin to leave the hospital.

356
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,060
According to the hospital’s
customary practice,

357
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,390
the patient and the doctor

358
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,510
will meet at
the general reception office.

359
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,790
When will you have time?

360
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,950
I need to see him anyway.

361
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,790
Why don’t you arrange a time?

362
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,910
How about 3:30 this afternoon?

363
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,580
OK.

364
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,540
I’ll go see him now.

365
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,340
Wait.

366
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,020
Is the general reception office so busy

367
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,300
that people can’t have a chat?

368
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,230
What else do you need?

369
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,270
Are you free at 6 or 7 o’clock?

370
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,510
Do you have to work on the cases
during your free time?

371
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,540
Aren’t you gonna educate me
on the trendy restaurants?

372
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,860
I’m still waiting.

373
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,560
Are you trying to create more rumors?

374
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,510
Dr. Wen.

375
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,430
What rumors?

376
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,230
Haven’t you heard it this morning?

377
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,710
It’s been spreading all over
the hospital.

378
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,430
Should we clear that up?

379
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,300
Well.

380
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,470
Rumors are like neural paralysis.

381
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,020
They spread quickly
but go away quickly as well.

382
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,430
Don’t mind it.

383
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,070
Don’t you think it’s like a tumor?

384
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,800
If you don’t get rid of it,

385
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,750
won’t you be afraid
that it might mutate?

386
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,950
Well done.

387
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,270
You can now make examples
with medical terminologies?

388
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,750
I’m not kidding.

389
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,190
I’m new here.

390
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,950
It’s not right to let others
mistake our relationship.

391
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,080
Shouldn’t you clear up the rumors

392
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,630
and keep your distance with me?

393
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,580
I don’t think we need
to keep a distance.

394
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,380
I don’t agree.

395
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,150
But...

396
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,620
But if you insist,

397
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,340
I can help you out this time.

398
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,380
I can help you clear up the rumors.

399
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,470
Really?

400
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,750
But you’ll owe me one.

401
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,630
Well,

402
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,540
(Nurse Station)
there are three choices. A, B, and C.

403
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,510
Let’s bet.

404
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,150
Losers have to pay for
the afternoon tea.

405
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,100
Great.

406
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,320
Let’s have afternoon tea.

407
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,510
Why don’t I make a bet too?

408
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,470
Dr. Wen.

409
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,780
The rumors are getting more outrageous.

410
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,580
Let me clear that up.

411
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,390
So, is it really Cong Rong?

412
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,280
No, no, no.

413
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,150
No.

414
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,100
You’re right.

415
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,470
That’s her.

416
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,670
What are you talking about?

417
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,780
What’s your relationship?

418
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,230
We...

419
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,380
We are childhood sweethearts.

420
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,990
I’ve been secretly having a crush
on her for decades.

421
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,150
Unfortunately,

422
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,950
my love hasn’t been reciprocated.

423
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,120
Wait.

424
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,350
Secretly having a crush for decades?

425
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,840
Dr. Wen.

426
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,230
May I ask how old are you?

427
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,350
Well done. Dr. Wen.

428
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,950
You have such a creative way
to clear up rumors.

429
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,660
That’s it.

430
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,080
That’s it.

431
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,060
That’s it.

432
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,710
Are you crazy?

433
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,120
The rumors have been cleared up.

434
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,190
Are you serious?

435
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,540
How do you think?

436
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,580
Does he have a grudge against me?

437
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,190
He’s always like that.

438
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,270
He’s so evil inside.

439
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,710
Really?

440
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,600
When he was in university,

441
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,150
a person used to copy his answers.

442
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,750
So he intentionally filled in the wrong
answers with the multiple choices.

443
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,700
That person copied
all the wrong answers.

444
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,190
And their teacher was furious.

445
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,150
He’s a recidivist.

446
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,830
No wonder!

447
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,360
His smile conceals his ill-intentions.

448
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,060
You really don’t know
what he’s thinking about.

449
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,540
I thought you’re getting along well.

450
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,140
What?

451
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,100
He’s teasing me for fun.

452
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,670
Fine.

453
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,670
I’ll scold him for you.

Please, no.

What?

461
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,470
I’ll do it myself.

he won’t do it again.)

465
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,270
if you put this up?

466
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,470

467
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,060
there’s really no need for this?

Yes.

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,230
Can I have a few more days
with the dissertation?

471
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,470
Why do you think so?

472
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,910
I figured it out the moment I saw it.

473
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,950
Who am I?

474
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,110
I can read your mind.

475
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,020
Then guess the reason.

476
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,230
What happened today?

477
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,270
Because of the rumors?

478
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,780
Fine.

479

The deadline for the dissertation
is deferred to next Friday.

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,180
My head.

512
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,520
They hurt like hell.

513
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,750
Don’t worry.

514
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,790
I’m here today

515
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,670
because I have some good news for you.

516
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,150
Our company

517
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,910
has a new bed.

518
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,910
A European one.

519
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,380
Just one.

520
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,870
Of course,

521
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,100
it’s a bit pricey.

522
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,070
You have no idea

523
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,750
how the other directors
are trying to rob me of the bed.

524
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,540
Pricey? How pricey is it?

525
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,600
I might not have enough money.

526
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,800
Well. That’s fine.

527
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,460
You don’t have to pay right away.

528
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,190
Well.

529
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,470
We have a public lecture today.

530
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,510
And there’s a chance to try it for free.

531
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,190
How about I take you there?

532
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,180
You can try the bed.

533
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,340
If it’s comfortable,

534
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,670
you can find ways to pay for it.

535
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:10,630
Let’s go.

536
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,140
Great.

537
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,940
Get in the car.

538
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,360
Let’s go.

539
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,150
Let’s go.

540
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,630
Come.

541
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,320
Well.

542
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,110
This way.

543
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,100
Be careful.

544
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,300
After you.

545
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,540
Go back to the company.

546
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,150
Okay.

547
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,750
I see.

548
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,800
Okay.

549
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,670
Don’t worry.

550
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,020
Okay.

551
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,580
Come home earlier.

552
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:00,950
Okay.

553
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,620
Bye-bye.

554
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,340
Listen.

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,100
I’d rather die than going there

556
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,540
the next time they ask me to.

557
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,000
I’d rather just be a walker-on.

558
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,620
Right!

559
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,670
That’s disgusting.

560
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,790
The steak almost had me

561
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,910
lose my teeth.

562
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,060
And the spaghetti

563
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,420
is too spicy.

564
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,910
Did they cook it with hot pot seasoning?

565
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,460
You know what?

566
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,230
It’s better if we just
eat instant noodles here.

567
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,230
Yes.

568
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,670
If it weren’t for
the commission of 100 yuan,

569
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,100
I wouldn’t go there.

570
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,190
What are you talking about?

571
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,580
What 100 yuan?

572
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,100
Who gave you 100 yuan?

573
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,190
Make it clear.

574
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,870
We’ve signed
a confidentiality agreement.

575
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,540
Right.

576
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,270
What confidentiality agreement?

577
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,280
I’ll give you 500 yuan.

578
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,100
Are you telling me or not?

579
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,950
Isn’t this clear enough?

580
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,510
Why are you here?

581
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,830
The fool of the rich doesn’t know
where rice comes from.

582
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,910
Now, I’ve seen a modern version.

583
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,820
What do you mean?

584
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,380
Can’t you just be straightforward?

585
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,150
Let me translate it out of kindness.

586
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,710
Who else, besides your parents,

587
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,100
will pay for the grandiosity
of your restaurant?

588
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,620
We didn’t say anything.

589
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,190
We didn’t.

590
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,020
Nothing.

591
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,760
Hello.

592
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,470
Dad.

593
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,320
Where are you?

594
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,670
We need to talk.

595
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,860
(Treasures fill the home.)

596
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,620
(Xihuantong Medical Equipment Co., Ltd)

597
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,670
The importance of sleep is obvious.

598
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,710
(Xihuantong Medical Equipment Co., Ltd)

599
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,230
Our physiotherapy bed

600
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,910
can help cure sleep problems

601
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,080
for all of you.

602
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,020
When you get older,

603
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,100
your sleep becomes lighter.

604
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,230
Sleeping in this bed is helpful.

605
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,340
You can read the instructions

606
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,750
to learn more about the product.

607
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,060
What are you doing?

608
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,580
Who?

609
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,910
What are you doing here?

610
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,910
I... I... I’m...

611
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,510
Give me your phone.

612
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,230
Give it to me.

613
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,230
Give it to me.

614
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,380
Give it to me.

615
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,270
We said we would meet at 3:30 pm.

616
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,360
Honey.

617
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,580
You’re on the first floor.

618
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,470
I went to the wrong place.

619
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,280
Fine.

620
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,270
I’m coming down now.

621
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,870
(Western cuisine)

622
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,430
Next one. No. 32.

623
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,860
Come in.

624
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,000
This way, please.

625
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,910
Wait a second, please.

626
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,150
Here.

627
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,520
Check out the menu.
What do you want?

628
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,870
What have you accomplished?

629
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,230
If it weren’t for me,

630
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,340
your restaurant
would’ve closed long ago.

631
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,120
You’re a girl.

632
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,990
Why do you have to work so hard?

633
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,910
Do you want to be a woman entrepreneur?

634
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,520
Opening the restaurant is just for fun.

635
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,560
As long as you’re happy,

636
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,660
you can take our family’s money
as what you’ve earned.

637
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,630
Your father can still

638
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,180
afford this.

639
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,760
This is our love for you.

640
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,140
Let’s go.

641
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,430
We’re closed today.

642
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,950
Go home.

643
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,950
We’ve been waiting for quite a while.

644
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,630
We’re closed.

645
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,190
We haven’t started yet.

646
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,630
We’re closed.

647
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,670
What’s going on?

648
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,630
Bye.

649
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,000
We’re very sorry.

650
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,360
We’re very sorry.

651
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,270
We’re very sorry.

652
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,100
Let’s go.

653
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,110
We’re very sorry.

654
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,630
We’re very sorry.

655
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,270
We’re very sorry.

656
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,150
We’re closed.

657
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,910
Let’s go.

658
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,360
Come again next time.

659
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,060
We’re very sorry.

660
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,950
Go home, you two.

661
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,230
We’re closed today.

(Lulu)

663
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,310
Hello.

664
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,270
Lulu.

665
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:58,950
Where are you?

666
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,380
Come back.

667
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,040
Haven’t I told you that

668
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,510
I went out for a business conversation?

669
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,060
I don’t care.

670
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,190
Come back right now to console me.

671
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,420
Listen.

672
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,990
I argued with my dad.

673
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,390
I want to cut off my relationship
with him.

674
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,020
So, I have to depend on you recently.

675
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,560
You won’t turn your back on me, right?

676
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,060
You won’t leave me, right?

677
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,580
Hello.

678
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,020
What did you just say?

679
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,340
It’s a bit noisy around me.

680
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,560
Hello.

681
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,340
Hello.

682
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,510
Hello.

683
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,320
Stop at the roots of a cabbage.

684
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,800
Hold on to one of it with the fingers.

685
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,360
Take your time.

686
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,190
We’re not closing soon.

687
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,760
Thank you.

688
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,670
This book is quite interesting.

689
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,150
It’s boring.

690
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,100
It’s boring to be alive.

691
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,910
If you buy it and read it
thoroughly at home,

692
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,420
you’ll have a different experience.

693
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,230
Right.

694
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,430
Nonsense!

695
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,990
All nonsense!

696
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,360
I’m sorry.

697
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,430
How about this?
You can sit here and read.

698
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,020
Right.

699
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,710
No one cares for me.

700
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,780
No one understands me.

701
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,270
You don’t even know what I want.

702
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,540
I’d rather just disappear!

703
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,020
I think the noise won’t die down here.

704
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,670
Bye.

705
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,560
I’m sorry.

706
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,430
I’m really sorry.

707
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,150
Goodbye.

708
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,150
You’re welcome to come by next time.

709
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,380
Why is there a new room?

710
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,380
How did you get in?

711
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,790
How did you get in?

712
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,830
Who are you?

713
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,300
Why are you breaking into my restaurant?

714
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,790
That is your restaurant.

715
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,880
And this is my place.

716
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,860
Nonsense!

717
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,270
This is my place.

718
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,630
I see.

719
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,030
This is Platform 9-3/4.

720
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,120
You’re drunk.

721
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,710
Go home.

722
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,230
Go.

723
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,040
I won’t go home.

724
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,150
I don’t have a home.

725
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,190
Let go of me!

726
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,900
No one cares about me in my family.

727
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,230
No one acknowledges me.

728
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,590
They only use money
to force me to give up.

729
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,590
Am I, Zhou Chengcheng, the type
of person who gives in to money?

730
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:07,630
I’m a loser.

731
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,480
You’re pathetic.

732
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,420
I’m pathetic too.

733
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,550
But you still have to go home.

734
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,230
Rise.

735
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,920
Come on.

736
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
One, two, three.

737
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,630
I’m not going home.

738
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,000
Let me go.

739
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,030
Let go of me!

740
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,990
What was dropped?

741
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,310
My career.

742
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,820
My romance.

743
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,030
Romance.

744
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,550
I want to...

745
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,750
I want to prove myself.

746
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,710
This is my bed.

747
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,900
This is uncomfortable.

748
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,510
It’s uncomfortable.

749
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,710
If you don’t move,
I’ll have to make you move.

750
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,420
This is uncomfortable.

751
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,710
Get up.

752
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,230
One.

753
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,270
I’m not moving.

754
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,230
Get up!

755
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,100
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

756
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,660
I suspect that there’s another reason
behind his request for refund.

757
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,860
This company doesn’t seem
to be a decent one.

758
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,220
It’s located at the food market
behind the hospital.

759
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,870
And it’s hidden in the abandoned house.

760
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,510
It’s so desolate.

761
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,440
When I start to film,

762
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,270
two men came out of nowhere
and tried to stop me.

763
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,080
What happened next?

764
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,400
You called right on time.

765
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,560
And I was smart.

766
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,670
I used it as an excuse and got away.

767
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,150
Next time...

768
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,070
Next time?

769
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,420
Are you really courageous enough
to do it again?

770
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,230
Don’t you think about the consequences?

771
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,780
I haven’t thought too much.

772
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,750
I just think I should not
leave Mr. Lin alone.

773
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,190
You have no idea

774
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,780
how shocked I was

775
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,190
when I heard about this.

776
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,980
Just do well in your job.

777
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,590
Those are the patients’
personal matters.

778
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,860
They have nothing to do with you.

779
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,190
Don’t get involved.

780
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,140
(Wife)

781
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,670
You’re her husband.

782
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,030
Come and pick her up.

783
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
You finally came.

784
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,670
Take her away.

785
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,230
She is about to eat me alive.

786
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,000
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

787
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,180
I’ll take her away right now.

788
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,190
What happened?

789
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,000
Why did you drink so much?

790
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,900
Where’s Lu?

791
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,380
Why are you here?

792
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,670
Your place isn’t the morgue after all.

793
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,950
Besides me,

794
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,380
you still have some visitors.

795
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,070
How come you know each other?

796
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,350
Who are you?

797
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,670
Don’t touch me!

798
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,820
I’m Cong Rong.

799
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,710
Rong.

800
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,860
There you are.

801
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,750
I’m not going home.

802
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,080
Fine.

803
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,000
Fine. Fine.

804
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,460
I’ll take you to my home, okay?

805
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,920
What do you mean?

806
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,030
You found her so quickly?

807
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,500
As you can see.

808
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,190
Great.

809
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,980
Things finally work out for you.

810
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,340
Does she still recognize you?

811
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,780
It’s natural that
she can’t recognize you.

812
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,960
No one’s like you

813
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,590
who can remember what happened
in your fourth grade.

814
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,670
She’s an average person.

815
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,590
You’re not.

816
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,590
So when will you tell her?

817
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,030
I may not.

818
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,270
It doesn’t matter
if she recognizes me or not.

819
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,190
What’s most important is
to keep her by my side.

820
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,870
You’re so cunning.

821
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,030
I admire you.

822
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,500
I’m flattered.

823
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,040
How about you?

824
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,420
So you’ll continue to go against
the wishes of your family.

825
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,750
What else can I do?

826
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,830
But now you’re in the same trench
with me,

827
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,820
I’m free.

828
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,660
From this point onward,

829
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,400
I’ll drink on my own.

830
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,080
I’ll hang out with my shadow.

831
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,190
I’ll bury myself in books.

832
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,380
Bye.

833
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,980
Slow down. Watch out.

834
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,790
She’s so wasted.

835
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,150
This way. This way.

836
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,350
Wen Shaoqing.

837
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,820
Yes?

838
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,440
Help me handle her for a moment.

839
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,830
Okay.

840
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,750
I’ll get the shoes.

841
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,030
Cong Rong.

842
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,940
It seems that...

843
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,780
She threw up.

844
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,470
This is the biggest robe I can find.

845
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,390
Wear this for now.

846
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,070
I’ll ask Zhong Zhen to
send some men’s clothes.

847
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,660
(Settle Mr. Lin’s dispute)

848
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,820
(Dispute settlement)

849
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,040
Understanding the patients

850
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,150
is the first step to
successful dispute settlement.

851
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,380
Wen Shaoqing.

852
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,670
When I go over this humiliation,

853
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,500
I can conquer Mount Everest.

854
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,900
(Mount Everest 8848M
Yellow Mountain 1865M)

855
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,940
I’m a piece of junk.

856
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,260
A big piece of junk.

857
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,670
Nonsense.

858
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,230
I’ve never succeeded at anything.

859
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,110
Why did my dad say that to me?

860
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,270
But I couldn’t refute him.

861
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,300
Rong.

862
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,270
I don’t want to work hard anymore.

863
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,030
It’s so tiring.

864
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,870
You’re still young.

865
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,460
What do you expect to achieve?

866
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,270
If you don’t want to work hard,

867
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,960
you can stop for a moment.

868
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,230
Take some rest.

869
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,630
Go to sleep.

870
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,080
I just asked you to follow me

871
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,710
and experience the daily life
of a doctor.

872
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,110
You’re really good at improvising.

873
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,190
Isn’t that a good thing?

874
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,270
I didn’t graduate from a law school.

875
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,120
So this internship is
a hard-earned chance

876
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,230
for me.

877
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,820
I can only improvise.

878
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,460
If I don’t work harder than others,

879
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,420
I can’t catch up.

880
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,750
You corrected most parts of

881
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,150
the briefing I wrote.

882
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,340
I didn’t do well in my work.

883
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,750
And I was involved in rumors.

884
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,380
And my improvising

885
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,300
wasted your time.

886
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,340
Sometimes, I wonder.

887
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,230
Am I really that awful?

888
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,340
Do you want to hear the truth?

889
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,980
Tell me.

890
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,860
I’m prepared for the truth.

891
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,670
Actually, not many interns
can adjust themselves to

892
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,110
the hospital’s environment.

893
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,590
You did pretty well.

894
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,860
You’re special.

895
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,310
At that moment,

896
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,230
I’m a drop of water
that finally finds the wind.

897
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,270
I fall freely from the sky.

898
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,310
This is the acknowledgment
I’ve been looking forward to.

899
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,500
It makes me feel that

900
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,430
the 20 years of persistence,

901
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,580
4 years of betrayal,

902
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,270
and 12 hours of waiting

903
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,350
are all worthy.
