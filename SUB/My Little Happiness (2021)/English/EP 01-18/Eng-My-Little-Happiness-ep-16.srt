I’m close.

Why didn’t you ask me
to pick you up?

61
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,340
Your boss worked late with you

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,220
and you asked him to drive you home.

63
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,860
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

64
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,860
What’s wrong?

65
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,020
I now think your occupation is

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,660
a high-risk one.

67
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,500
It’s necessary to fill you up
with first-aid knowledge.

68
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,140
First, it’s artificial respiration.

69
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,300
What’s the matter?

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,180
I don’t want to go home now.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,940
Can you walk with me?

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,060
What’s wrong?

73
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,380
I’m too naive.

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,860
Isn’t it a good thing?

75
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,740
Well.

76
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,020
I think it feels good to pinch you.

77
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,620
That’s not what I’m talking about.

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,700
Fine.

79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,580
I’ll stop.

80
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,780
Tell me about it.

81
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,500
I was trying to help everyone.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,980
I tried very hard to do it, too.

83
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,460
How come it still ended up
with causing troubles for them?

84
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,500
I feel useless.

85
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,340
Actually,
the same situation happens to everyone.

86
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,820
You too?

87
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,820
Of course.

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,060
I participated a surgery
during my internship.

89
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,020
We failed to rescue the patient.

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,060
I think there are no other occupations

91
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,740
that would feel more powerless
than doctors.

92
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,500
Because we deal with life and death.

93
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,740
So I always feel

94
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,020
that if I could have done better...

95
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,620
You did your best.

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,300
So did you.

97
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,020
Right?

98
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,140
As long as we tried,
there’s a lesson learned.

99
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,100
All the frustrations are temporary.

100
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,780
Yeah.

101
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,020
I have to do a better job faster

102
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,940
and stop causing trouble
for Mr. Shangguan.

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,020
Then I’ll become a brilliant lawyer

104
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,580
just like Mr. Shangguan.

105
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,740
You talk about

106
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,820
Mr. Shangguan so much.

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,620
I may get jealous.

108
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,020
Now I finally know

109
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,620
that you’re a jealous man.

110
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,700
That’s true.

111
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,100
I haven’t told you
about artificial respiration,

112

Yes?

Mr. Shangguan.

120
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,580
Health conditions
of lawyers matter, too.

121
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,020
Or it’d be irresponsible
for the clients.

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,500
We’ve met at Wen Rang’s bookstore.

173
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,100
You forgot?

174
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,980
You bought books there.

175
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,180
Yeah.

176
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,060
I came alone.

177
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
What are you...?

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,010
I’m here to visit you.

179
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,340
Come in, please.

180
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,060
Take a seat.

181
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,940
Okay.

182
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,260
Look.

183
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,140
This is the dried meat floss
that I bought.

184
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,380
Here are some desserts.

185
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,300
These are egg rolls.

186
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,380
There are walnuts and jujubes.

187
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,020
Thank you.

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,220
It’s said they are good for the brain.

189
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,220
They are good for your sleep, too.

190
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,620
But you look young

191
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,700
with an elegant temperament.

192
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Your face gives a healthy glow

193
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,940
and you’re energetic.

194
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,140
You probably don’t need these.

195
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,660
I’m already this age.

196
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,860
I have my own problems.

197
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,900
How come?

198
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,380
You look about my parents’ age.

199
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,380
No way.

200
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,940
By the way.

201
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,620
Aunt.

202
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,140
Do you need anything to help with?

203
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,660
I can help with anything.

204
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,900
Girl.

205
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,500
Do you shop for groceries?

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,410
Yes.

207
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,420
Let’s go to the vegetable market then.

208
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,620
Sure.

209
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,740
See if there’s anything you like.

210
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,420
Grandma Wen.

211
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,140
You came.

212
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,580
Hello, hello.

213
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,100
Is this your niece?

214
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,420
Your granddaughter?

215
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,340
Or your daughter-in-law?

216
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,380
The vegetables look fresh.

217
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,300
The pakchoi looks fine.

218
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,980
Let’s buy some.

219
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,740
So fresh.

220
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,860
White beech mushrooms are nice.

221
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,780
You know what?

222
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,900
Fried white beech mushrooms
and pakchoi are tasty.

223
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,740
Here.

224
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,980
Get more mushrooms for us.

225
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,540
Okay.

226
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,260
Pick the smaller ones.

227
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,620
The big ones aren’t as fresh.

228
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,580
You daughter-in-law surely
knows how to live a life.

229
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,540
Young people nowadays

230
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,380
hardly shop at the market like her.

231
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,020
Your son is lucky.

232
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,380
Aunt.

233
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
What else do you want?

234
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,300
Let’s buy some more.

235
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,380
Their sweet potatoes are great, too.

236
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Should we buy some?

237
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,180
Sure.

238
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,260
Ma’am.

239
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,780
Get more of the sweet potatoes for us.

240
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,220
Alright.

241
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,860
Okay.

242
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,380
Is it too heavy?

243
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,180
Since I’m here as your labor,

244
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
buy some more

245
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,580
of the heavy ones

246
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,220
that you can’t carry.

247
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,980
I’ll carry them for you.

248
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,420
Do you want some radishes?

249
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,060
I’m okay.

250
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,540
That’s enough.

251
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,100
I’m good.

252
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,820
That’s good.

253
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,580
I got it. I got it.

254
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,020
Okay.

255
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,740
Be careful.

256
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,380
How much in total,

257
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,980
ma’am?

258
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,100
That’s 18.2 yuan.

259
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,700
Here.

260
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,220
Okay.

261
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,860
I’ve transferred it to you.

262
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,540
Okay.

263
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,540
Thank you.

264
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:57,940
Great.

265
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,260
Let’s go.

266
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,620
See you.

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:58,900
See you next time.

268
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,740
Grandma.

269
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,780
Is it heavy?

270
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,820
Let me take it

271
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,020
No need.

272
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,620
I can carry these little things.

273
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
You learned how to buy vegetables

274
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,180
from Rang, right?

275
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,300
Yeah.

276
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,460
We’ve been not only
to the market together,

277
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,620
but also to the aquatic product market

278
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,020
and drysaltery.

279
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,420
Mr. Wen has taught me a lot of things.

280
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,820
Stop pretending in front of me.

281
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,300
You call him Mr. Wen?

282
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,700
I know you two are pretty close.

283
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,020
My son

284
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,740
is not easy to get along with, right?

285
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,220
He’s alright.

286
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,340
At the beginning, there were
some misunderstandings.

287
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,780
But, he later took good care of me.

288
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,620
He helped me

289
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,900
solve many problems.

290
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,020
My son’s biggest advantage

291
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,100
is his strong living ability.

292
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,540
His disadvantage is pretty obvious, too.

293
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,140
That is he’s not good
at making girls happy.

294
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,540
If he says something mean,

295
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,980
don’t take it seriously.

296
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,380
Don’t worry, Aunt.

297
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,460
Here.

298
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,820
Thank you, Aunt.

299
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,060
Do you know what

300
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,060
Rang likes?

301
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,100
Well, I’ve got you to help me.

302
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,900
Smart.

303
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,860
You came to the right person.

304
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,700
I’ll teach you some dishes later.

305
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,020
In the future,

306
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,060
if you have any problems,

307
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,220
just come to me.

308
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,940
Okay.

309
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,180
I’ll come and visit you often.

310
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,300
Thank you, Aunt.

311
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,020
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

312
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,500
<i>Grandma</i>

313
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Shaoqing.

314
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,860
Do you know there’s a girl

315
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,940
who likes Rang?

316
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,460
She came to my home today.

317
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,460
Her name is…

318
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,740
Feng Chengcheng.

319
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,500
Well.

320
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,460
Feng Zhouzhou.

321
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,900
Zhou Chengcheng?

322
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,820
Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,020
It’s Zhou Chengcheng.

324
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
Do you know about her?

325
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,140
I gave her the address.

326
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,620
I didn’t think she’d really go there.

327
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,940
This girl is just lovely.

328
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,620
I think she’s decent and adorable.

329
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,620
She came to the market with me today.

330
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,660
She was great at picking vegetables.

331
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,020
You see, people’s life is long.

332
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,140
It’s important to know
how to pick and buy.

333
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,540
Grandma.

334
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,380
That you like her doesn’t mean
my uncle does.

335
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,100
I know. I know.

336
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,460
Rang probably

337
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,740
hasn’t understood what’s going on yet.

338
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,740
That’s okay.

339
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,620
You and I can help.

340
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,580
You will be

341
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,220
in charge of asking more young people

342
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,900
to talk to him.

343
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
To help him clear his mind.

344
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I will

345
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,900
help Chengcheng to use some tricks.

346
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,140
Let’s work along both lines.

347
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,020
To make sure your uncle
is on the right track.

348
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,540
Okay. Grandma.

349
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
I got it.

350
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,980
That’s great.

351
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,460
Finally a girl is

352
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,100
chasing Rang.

353
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,140
Rang is finally going
to have a girlfriend.

354
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,420
He and his father
can break the ice, too.

355
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,540
Isn’t it right?

356
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,220
Grandma.

357
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,260
I’ve got patients here.

358
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,700
Go back to work.

359
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
Don’t forget about it.

360
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,420
I gotta go.

361
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,020
Bye-bye.

362
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,700
Okay, bye.

363
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,220
<i>Book Order</i>

364
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,260
How come so many copies
were sold within a week?

365
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
WJ?

366
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,450
It’s the same person.

367
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,780
Hurry up.

368
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,580
Hurry.

369
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Put it right there.

370
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,300
Hello.

371
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,820
Excuse me.

372
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,860
Is this Warehouse No.3?

373
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,980
That’s right.

374
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,620
Is anyone in charge here?

375
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,340
Yes.

376
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,660
But he’s not here today.

377
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,140
Thank you.

378
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,820
Are you Mr. Wen?

379
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,660
I am.

380
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,580
Wait for a second.

381
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,100
There’s a letter for you.

382
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,220
Our boss has said

383
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,620
once there’s a Mr. Wen here.

384
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,860
I should give him the letter.

385
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,980
Thank you.

386
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,140
Hurry. Hurry up.

387
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,420
Nanshan District.
Out of the North Second Ring Road.

388
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,910
At the roof of Weiyege Hotel.

389
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,570
See you on December 31st.

390
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
Thank you, doctor.

391
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,580
Hello.

392
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,260
What’s up?

393
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,060
Zhou Chengcheng is
such a wonderful girl.

394
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,780
She looks decent and adorable.

395
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,180
She’s good at buying groceries
and picking fruits.

396
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,100
She’s suitable to be with forever.

397
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,020
And me?

398
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,860
I’ll help to clear your mind

399
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,500
with other young people around you

400
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,100
so that you’ll be
on the right track earlier

401
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,380
and settle with grandpa.

402
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,260
What’s wrong with you?

403
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,980
You got brain-washed?

404
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,460
I got brain-washed by grandma.

405
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,460
That was grandma’s attitude.

406
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,220
Since when did Zhou Chengcheng
know my mom?

407
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,220
Zhou Chengcheng is a one-track mind.

408
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,700
If she likes you,

409
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,380
she’ll do anything that’s about you.

410
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,100
As for you,

411
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,460
if you don’t like her,

412
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,700
just hurry up and tell her.

413
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,860
Don’t let her have hope.

414
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,820
Alright.

415
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,380
I’ve done my part.

416
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,660
Think about it.

417
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,940
<i>Roof of Weiyege Hotel,
see you on December 31</i>

418
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,660
<i>Inpatient</i>

419
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,340
Your tailored taxi driver has arrived.

420
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,060
Automatic charging starts
in 5 minutes.

421
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,060
I will not get off the car
no matter what.

422
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,980
Listen, my waist

423
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,980
has got other functions.

424
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,100
It hurts...

425
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,100
Why do you love sitting

426
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,500
in the front seat so much?

427
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,940
Give me a ride, please.

428
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,700
I can go to the back right now.

429
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,220
The point is both of you are here.

430
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,340
It doesn’t matter
who’s picking up whom.

431
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,900
Right?

432
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,780
But we still are

433
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,980
delivering the rice to home.

434
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,340
Right?

435
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,660
Since we are all here today,

436
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,620
it means we’ve got business to do.

437
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,700
Anyone who’s not senseless

438
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,940
will find an excuse and run.

439
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,580
What’s the business that you have?

440
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,180
It sounds all serious.

441
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,700
-Dating.
-Buying lingerie.

442
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,140
Don’t buy red ones.

443
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,900
What did I do to deserve this?

444
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,020
Zhong Zhen!

445
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,940
Come here!

446
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,220
Carry the rice!

447
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,300
What’s wrong with my feet?

448
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,740
They always lead me to Chen Cu.

449
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,900
Come on.

450
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,580
Alright.

451
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
You are my savior.

452
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,460
Let’s go.

453
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,620
Here we are.

454
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,300
What?

455
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,060
We’re not shopping for lingerie.

456
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,180
We’re already here.

457
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,260
I’m not going.

458
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,100

Jiang Yao.

461
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,340
I’ll marry you sooner or later.

462
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,420
I love you.

463
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,660
You haven’t eaten yet, right?

464
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,820
I happened to cook

465
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,900
a few dishes for you.

466
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,620
Have a try.

467
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,140
Fried pakchoi with white beech mushroom.

468
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,740
Pan-fried yellow croakers

469
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,100
and diced chicken with green pepper.

470
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,940
They go well with rice.

471
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,300
You met with my mom today?

472
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,220
I just went to visit her.

473
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,140
You like me, right?

474
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,700
It doesn’t matter.

475
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,100
It doesn’t matter whether you do or not.

476
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
How come it doesn’t matter?

477
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,660
I...

478
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,300
What matters is that I don’t want
to be in a relationship again.

479
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,180
Not anymore.

480
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,900
I’ll probably stay like this forever.

481
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,860
Is it because of your ex-girlfriend?

482
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,740
It’s not about other people.

483
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,260
It’s about my desire for life

484
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,500
can only go this far.

485
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,820
It’s meaningless for you
to waste energy on me.

486
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:39,820
But I thought we were pretty close.

487
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,860
It’s my fault to care too much
about you recently.

488
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,700
But, in the future,

489
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,660
I don’t want to be involved in anything

490
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,860
that I’m not interested in.

491
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,460
Your restaurant will be reopened soon.

492
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,740
Go back to work.

493
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,740
Don’t come here again anymore.

494
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:41,380
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

495
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:55,260
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

496
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,020
What’s the matter?

497
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,780
We’ve been walking all day.

498
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,740
My feet hurt badly.

499
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,300
What?

500
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,500
You said that your feet hurt.

501
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,380
Isn’t it a hint for me
to princess-hug you?

502
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,460
Put me down.

503
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,700
It’s like I fall
into Alice’s wonderland.

504
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,940
The one and only Mad Hatter
brings me special experiences.

505
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,740
Closing my eyes,

506
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,500
I’m mouthing “I like you”.

507
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,700
Just like raven is like a writing-desk.

508
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,020
From now on,

509
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,460
my biggest happiness would be

510
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,740
you are always in sight.

511
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,980
Luckily you showed up.

512
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,780
Luckily tonight’s moon is pretty

513
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,060
and your hair is messy.

514
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,460
So...

515
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,900
I can be with you to my heart’s content.

516
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,740
Rong.

517
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,580
My heart is broken.

518
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,420
Stop eating.

519
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,420
It’s already your fourth bowl.

520
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,020
Really?

521
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,260
How come I’m still hungry?

522
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,220
Rong.

523
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,820
I’ve never felt this way.

524
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,900
Staple food is mostly made of starch.

525
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,940
Too much intake of starch

526
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,260
makes the sugar go into the liver.

527
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,820
It’ll convert into glycogen.

528
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,460
Too much stored glycogen

529
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,020
can’t be consumed by the cells.

530
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,700
The rest will become fat stored
in your body.

531
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,820
Yes.

532
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,100
You’ll get fat if you keep eating.

533
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,140
Fat?

534
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,740
Yeah.

535
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,540
No, no.

536
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,540
I can’t be fat.

537
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,740
I will stop.

538
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,180
What’s so good
about the one-track-mind Wen Rang

539
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,340
that you can’t let go of him?

540
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,660
Everything about him is good.

541
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,780
He’s arrogant

542
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,420
but not aloof.

543
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
It seems like he’s keeping distance
from everybody.

544
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,420
Actually, he’s a warmer person
than anyone.

545
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,460
He’s just sophisticated, handsome
and talented.

546
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,460
I remember the time

547
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,180
when he was playing the guitar
and singing.

548
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,260
Looks like

549
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,940
she’s being serious this time.

550
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,900
Of course.

551
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,500
Why would I give up
on such a wonderful guy?

552
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,020
I need to tell him
about my feelings again.

553
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,740
Again?

554
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,940
Yes.

555
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,980
Know yourself and the enemy,
so that you never lose a battle.

556
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,300
He’s your uncle.

557
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,140
You must know him better than I do.

558
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,180
Do you have any suggestion?

559
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,820
My suggestion would be

560
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,980
“find another guy.”

561
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,020
No.

562
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,660
I’ve locked my target.

563
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,140
I thought about it carefully.

564
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,820
I wasn’t prepared this time.

565
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,900
Next time I can’t be so reckless.

566
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,020
You see.

567
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,660
It took you so much effort
to chase Cong Rong.

568
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,620
You didn't dare to act rashly.

569
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,300
Let alone Wen Rang,

570
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,780
he’s been hurt before.

571
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,900
Don’t use me as a metaphor.

572
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,700
Let’s be serious.

573
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,980
What’s your plan?

574
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,940
New Year’s Eve is coming, right?

575
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,500
I’ll arrange a party for the four of us.

576
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,540
We can eat hot-pot

577
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,780
and go to karaoke.

578
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,940
Break the ice between us first.

579
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,420
When we’re settled,

580
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,380
I can chase and flirt him

581
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,380
as a friend.

582
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,860
No.

583
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
I’ll just be his friend first.

584
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,260
It’s a nice idea.

585
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,100
But do you think he’ll agree

586
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,780
due to your current situation?

587
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,740
Yeah.

588
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,260
Right.

589
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,540
If he keeps a good distance from me,

590
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,740
I can only go back to be sad.

591
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,300
Rong.

592
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,140
You’re all I have now.

593
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,260
Alright. Alright.

From now on,

I will probably be stuck here
for a while.

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,460
I’d volunteer to be on duty.

689
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,940
I’d get home after work

690
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,060
and cook a feast for Rangyirang.

691
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,540
To thank it for a whole year of company.

692

Let’s go home later after hot-pot.

Why?

694
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,940
They don’t need us there anyway.

695
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,300
We need to give them enough space.

696
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,060
After that, we can count down together.

697
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,140
What?

698
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,020
Any opinion?

699
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,740
No.

700

It’s your call.

701
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,460
Okay, that’s the plan then.

I’m fine.

705

Are you a lawyer?

I’m an apprentice lawyer.

712
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,300
I’d like to know

713
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,700
how much a case costs.

714
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,100
It depends on the case
and the represented lawyer.

715
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,020
It ranges from several thousand
to tens of thousands.

Thank you.

717

Alright, Miss Cong.

724

You’re about to be late.

725

Wait.

726
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,220
It occurred to me,

727
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,020
how about we ride
and celebrate tonight?

728

You go and join them first.

I want to finish this year’s work first,

734
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,700
so that I can celebrate with you
without pressure.

741
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,660
You asked for me.

742
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,940
Is this a new bike?

743

Looks good.

744
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,260
You have quite a perspective.

I’ve ridden it for three days.

746

Waterproof sealed countershaft.

00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,860
It’s lightweight

but pretty cool.

752

You came for consultation, right?

773
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:45,900
Yes.

774
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,100
You look good.

775
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,660

00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,220
It’s great.

I’m fully recovered.

778
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,980
This paragraph of statement
of grounds is not bad.

779
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,620
But the logic within

780
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,660
isn’t ideal.

781
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,980
If you can write it backwards,

782
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,140
it’d be better.

783

The rest is fine.

784
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,380

A guy in his middle twenties
loaned online.

He failed to repay the debt
due to compound interest.

He ended up suicide.

Those silly kids.

799
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,980
If they have just a little
common knowledge in law,

800
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,940
they wouldn’t have lost their lives.

If you are asked to take this case,

807
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
These kinds of cases
are thankless tasks.

I marked dates on them, too.

These are needed two weeks later.

816

Those are plaints of other two cases.

817

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,020
Watch out!

859
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,060
Do you know...?

860
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,740
Boss.

861
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,220
Did you get hurt?

862
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,980
Zhong Zhen.

863
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,060
Did you buy an inferior?

864
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,340
How come there’s no brake?

865
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,900
You went away
before I finished talking this morning.

866
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,900
Regular braking doesn’t work
for my bike.

867
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,100
Boss.

868
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,500
You don’t know how to ride a bike?

869
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,660
Why are you suddenly learning it?

870
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,780
Your cousin invited me
to ride bikes with her tonight.

871
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,340
Why didn’t you say it earlier?

872
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,980
This is the wrong bike.

873
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,660
You should borrow a 28-inch bike.

874
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,300
Put her on the bar and

875
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,140
arms around her from behind.

876
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,060
Let the wind blow her hair

877
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,460
gently to your face.

878
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
It gives a mellow fragrance.

879
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,420
How romantic is that?

880
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,020
I won’t be using this bike then.

881
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,500
Here you go.

882
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,260

You’ve suffered a lot.

884
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,060

00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,740
on prototypes these months.

886
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,700
I have no budget to fix you.

887
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,980
You can only hold on for a few months.

That’s a lot.

890
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,220
That’s enough for a new bike.

903
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,780
Who are they?

904
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,540

It’s okay.

906
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,740
Tell me clearly about it.

907
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,980
Let’s settle this together.

908
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,140
Here. Sit down.

909
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,140
She came here for work for three months.

910
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,780
Then she knew a guy named Xu.

911
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,980
Xu told her that

912
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,580
they could start a small business together

913
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,740
to make some money.

914
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,060
He only needed to borrow her ID

915
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,780
to help others to register a company.

916
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,300
How much did she lose?

917
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,540
With compound interest added,
it’s more than one hundred thousand.

918
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,020
The lending platform has been urging her

919
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,900
that if she doesn’t repay the money,
it’ll affect her credit investigation.

920
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,780
They’ll tell her family

921
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,700
as well as her company.

922
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,940
Did she go to the police?

923
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,500
I’ve gone with her.

924
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,820
But that’s far from enough.

925
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,700
According to her,

926
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,380
there are plenty of people deceived
like her.
