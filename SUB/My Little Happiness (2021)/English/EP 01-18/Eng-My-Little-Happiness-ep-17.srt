00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,350
you’ll be sick the whole year.

173
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,510
Bless received.

174
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,940
Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,300
Mr. Shangguan.

176
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Are you alright?

177
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,150
Where do you feel sick?

178
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,020
Does it hurt?

179
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,270
I’m fine.

180
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,910
Why are you here?

181
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,360
I…I’m here to see a friend.

182
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
He doesn’t matter.

183
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,790
Mr. Shangguan.

184
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,150
Why are you here alone?

185
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,700
Let me stay and take care of you.

186
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,790
I’m fine.

187
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,990
Take care of your own business.

188
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,360
Mr. Shangguan.

189
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,420
Wait for a second.

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,150
Mr. Shangguan.

191
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,200
I got a blanket for you from a nurse.

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,910
IV makes you feel cold now.

193
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,030
Don’t catch a cold.

194
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,790
You’re still sick.

195
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,630
Alright?

196
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,660
Thanks.

197
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,790
It’s dropping too fast.

198
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,790
My grandma said

199
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,910
too fast is not

200
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,990
good for the heart.

201
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,300
We should make it slow.

202
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,720
Mr. Shangguan.

203
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,360
Are you thirsty?

204
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,790
How about I get you some hot water?

205
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,030
Wait here, I’ll be right back.

206
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,060
I’m fine.

207
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,670
Have some water.

208
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,700
Mr. Shangguan.

209
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,480
Put...just leave it here.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,110
OK.

211
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,200
I bring some fruits here.

212
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,270
Which one do you want?

213
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,120
How about a banana?

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,270
No…no, thank you.

215
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,270
No banana on an empty stomach.

216
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,660
How about an apple?

217
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,390
I’m fine.

218
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,380
Have a seat.

219
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,120
No way.

220
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,020
Mr. Shangguan.

221
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,240
It’s late,

222
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,550
what if…

223
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,270
Xiong Jingjing.

224
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,390
Let’s get some porridge.

225
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:10,870
Mr. Shangguan.

226
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,440
Wait here.

227
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,390
I’ll be right back.

228
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,910
Buying a bowl of porridge
doesn’t need two people.

229
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,630
You think we’re kids and hold hands
to the restroom?

230
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,150
Can’t you see?

231
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,350
He doesn’t need too much attention
right now.

232
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
What he needs is rest.

233
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,670
Thanks for the heads-up.

234
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,350
I know what I should do.

235
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,390
Do you know what drugs he uses?

236
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,440
What’s the contraindication?

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,270
What’s the dosage?

238
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,150
What can he eat now?

239
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,180
What do you mean?

240
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,510
Are you telling me how to
take care of him?

241
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,180
I don’t have time for that.

242
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,900
I just can’t stand it and want
to remind you

243
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,360
that the way you please him

244
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,420
will only annoy him.

245
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,830
If you want to push him away,

246
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,150
then carry on.

247
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,510
Looks like there’s hope for you.

248
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,700
Doctor’s orders.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,020
Food after six hours.

250
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,110
Liquid food.

251
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,540
Try to have regular three meals a day.

252
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,390
You know what to do.

253
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,310
Why are you being so nice?

254
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,780
You’re the one who’s been taking
me as your imaginary enemy.

255
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,480
Mr. Shangguan is my mentor.

256
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
I have nothing

257
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,270
but respect for him.

258
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,030
Besides, I already have a boyfriend.

259
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,020
He’s on his way to pick me up.

260
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,320
Really?

261
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,150
Of course.

262
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,590
Why would I lie to you?

263
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,910
This is the list for his IV today

264
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,750
and medical records.

265
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,750
<i>Test Report</i>
Time to change medicine.

266
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,420
Please go find the nurse.

267
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,350
Mr. Shangguan.

268
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,180
I’m sorry, Mr. Shangguan.

269
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,300
It’s all because of me.

270
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,470
Don’t worry about that.

271
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,350
It’s an old problem.

272
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,540
Cong Rong.

273
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,180
I’m gonna ask you one more time.

274
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,990
Are you really gonna take Zhang’s case?

275
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,540
Yes.

276
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,910
To get justice without
any strings attached

277
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,420
is why I want to be a lawyer.

278
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,270
Mr. Shangguan.

279
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,470
I’m back.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,720
Mr. Shangguan.

281
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,510
I’ll leave now.

282
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,590
Get some rest.

283
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,990
Can…

284
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,820
Can you take her with you?

285
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,700
Don’t worry, Mr. Shangguan.

286
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,390
I won’t make any trouble.

287
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,750
Where are you?

288
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,940
I’ll meet you outside the E.R.

289
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,470
Ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,180
New Year is just around the corner.

291
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,300
Let’s count it down!

292
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,230
Five!

293
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,270
Four!

294
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,180
Three!

295
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,180
Two!

296
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,510
One!

297
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,420
Happy New Year!

298
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,740
<i>See you on December 31</i>

299
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,420
<i>Closed</i>

300
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,440
It’s almost empty.

301
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,590
I’ll go get the doctor.

302
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,390
OK.

303
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,860
<i>Happy New Year</i>

304
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,580

<i>About Zhang’s case today</i>

306
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,700
Happy New Year.

307
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,870
Happy New Year.

308
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,540
You look very happy.

309
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,060
A full stomach makes me happy.

310
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,470
Today I decided to do something.

311
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,350
What is it?

312
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,750
I’m not gonna tell you.

313
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,780
Not before I make it.

314
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,820
Though I don’t know the result yet,

315
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,550
I feel like I’m one step closer

316
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,110
to my dream.

317
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,310
You always look so shiny to me.

318
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,700
Really?

319
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,310
Of course.

320
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,310
Heroine Cong.

321
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,260
We didn’t count down the clock
because of my work.

322
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,150
I’m sorry.

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,260
Should you be punished?

324
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,350
Of course.

325
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,740
I’m sorry.

326
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,900
We’re closed today.

327
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,220
I don’t eat skewers.

328
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,590
Hot pot is fine.

329
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,980
But…I already ate them.

330
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,710
It’s OK.

331
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,740
There is still plenty of food.

332
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,180
I’ve never met someone
who eats others’ leftovers.

333
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,550
I’ve never met a shop owner

334
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,110
who refuses to earn money.

335
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,940
You got wine?

336
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,960
Yes.

337
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,510
Wait here.

338
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,420
I’ll get it for you.

339
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,110
Here.

340
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,830
Do you mind?

341
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,310
I don’t.

342
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,270
Isn’t hot pot better with more people?

343
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,030
Sit down now.

344

Don’t do the barbecue restaurant.

348
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,030
Open a late-night hot pot restaurant.

349
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,550
For people who eat hot pot
alone late at night.

350

This kind of lonely atmosphere

516
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,730
I’m gonna teach him a lesson.

517
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,770
Let’s sit while waiting.

518
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,170
Come on.

519
00:26:59,170 --> 00:26:59,690
Slow down.

520
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,580
Watch your step.

521
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,600
Easy, easy.

522
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,730
Chengcheng.

523
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,010
Madam!

524
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,780
Sir.

525
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,290
She’s the Zhou Chengcheng
I told you about.

526
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,210
It’s you.

527
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,050
How are you, sir?

528
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,450
Come on in.

529
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,010
OK, OK, OK.

530
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,930
OK, OK, OK.

531
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,010
Have a seat, please.

532
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,410
Just give me a second.

533
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,530
I’ll get you some water.

534
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,840
Don’t worry about it.

535
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,450
Chengcheng.

536
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,530
Don’t bother.

537
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:26,900
It’s OK.

538
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,820
We’ll just sit here for a while,

539
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,810
and wait for Rang.

540
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,140
Of course. Of course.

541
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,250
I’ll be right back.

542
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,250
Young lady.

543
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,380
You’ve got a nice little shop here.

544
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,730
OK.

545
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,490
Thank you.

546
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,210
You’re doing this all alone?

547
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,540
I have someone who helps me.

548
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,560
He went to stock up.

549
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,800
Wen Rang comes to help sometimes.

550
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,880
Don’t put in a good word for him.

551
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,170
I know what he’s like.

552
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,450
He is

553
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,560
stubborn

554
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,480
and lacks manners

555
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,690
in dealing with people.

556
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,440
No, no.

557
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,160
Wen Rang is good.

558
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,900
He sold a lot of books.

559
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,200
And he has his own ideals and pursuits.

560
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,490
What kind of pursuit is that?

561
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,770
He opened the bookstore
out of anger.

562
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,250
Mom, Dad?

563
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,120
What are you doing here?

564
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,200
Rang.

565
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,300
You’re back.

566
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,160
Have a seat.

567
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,800
Come on.

568
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,770
Sit down.

569
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,120
Your dad is here to see you.

570
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,410
Don’t be angry.

571
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:24,860
I’m not angry.

572
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,840
Leave me alone.

573
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,560
You little rabbit!

574
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,450
You old rabbit.

575
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,140
If you’re looking for me,

576
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,640
why are you bothering others here?

577
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,730
Who are you calling old rabbit?

578
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,780
Who are you calling old rabbit?

579
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,880
Are you against your father?

580
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,210
You called me little rabbit,

581
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,140
then you must be old rabbit.

582
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,600
It’s biogenetic.

583
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,770
You’re never good at
anything growing up,

584
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,720
but there’s a lot of back-talk.

585
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,560
Calm down. Calm down.

586
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,100
Sir.

587
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,690
Have some water.

588
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,560
Calm down.

589
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,200
Be nice.

590
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,120
Be nice.

591
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,120
Tell me.

592
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,120
Do you remember our bet?

593
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,600
I didn’t forget.

594
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,450
I don’t care about the bet.

595
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,720
I just wanted to ask you,

596
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,920
when are you gonna
pull yourself together?

597
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,930
Look at you.

598
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,690
I mean, look at you now.

599
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,880
Wait.

600
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,730
Why do you insist on forcing me?

601
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,050
I don’t care that much
about my career.

602
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,300
It’s impossible for you

603
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,730
to have no grandchildren.

604
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,530
So can’t you just leave me alone?

605
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,360
Why our Wen family

606
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,010
has a loser like you?

607
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,320
Tell me.

608
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,880
Are you still thinking about
that woman?

609
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,400
Dad!

610
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,610
Why are you bringing that up again?

611
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,360
You want to pretend

612
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,250
this never happened?

613
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,380
Why did she break up with you?

614
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,970
She thought you’re a loser.

615
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,330
Look at you.

616
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,290
If I were I woman,

617
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,410
I wouldn’t like you, either.

618
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,250
Honey!

619
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,620
Be nice.

620
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,290
Fine.

621
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,490
One last thing.

622
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,330
Your mother and I

623
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,600
are in our 70s.

624
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,970
We don’t expect anything else from you.

625
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,370
I just want you to be a normal person,

626
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,250
OK?

627
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,050
Wait a minute.

628
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,330
How am I not normal?

629
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,540
I didn’t live up to your wishes,

630
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,640
so I’m not normal?

631
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,450
Well, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.

632
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,800
I’m never gonna be normal.

633
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,250
Wen Rang.

634
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,560
OK, I’m done here.

635
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,320
He…he…he…he’s with me.

636
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,770
I…

637
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,620
Well…

638
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,900
We’re not

639
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,480
exactly on solid ground yet.

640
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,860
I wasn’t gonna tell you

641
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,010
until we were stable.

642
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,340
Come on, sit down.

643
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,120
Sit down.

644
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,010
Thank you, Ms. Cong.

645
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,330
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

646
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,170
I’ll find a way

647
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,690
get my other friends here.

648
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,770
Okay.

649
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,120
Thank you.

650
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,490
Mr. Shangguan.

651
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,250
How did you know I was here?

652
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,590
Your Moments.

653
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,000
I didn’t even notice.

654
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,560
Mr. Shangguan.

655
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,530
Why you suddenly changed your mind?

656
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,490
What about you?

657
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,930
Why wouldn’t you drop the case?

658
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,530
They have just got into society.

659
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,560
They’re supposed
to have a bright future.

660
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,490
They are not supposed to be ruined.

661
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,160
So you feel sorry for them?

662
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,080
Because it’s illegal.

663
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,300
The so-called silent majority is

664
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,210
actually the accomplice of the villain.

665
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,360
Although my power is very limited,

666
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,780
as long as I make a little change

667
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,800
to the society,

668
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,930
then my dream is coming true.

669
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,560
I remember you once said

670
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,170
that we should uphold the justice

671
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,250
of each and every one of our clients,

672
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,730
even if it’s trivial.

673
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,120
If I didn’t get there,

674
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,840
were you gonna tell her that

675
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,840
you’re helping her with this case?

676
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,800
Don’t forget.

677
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,010
You’re just an intern.

678
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,620
You don’t have the skills
or qualifications

679
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,050
to handle this case on your own.

680
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,120
But now you’ve convinced me.

681
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,560
Go over the files again.

682
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,300
It’s gonna take a lot more than that

683
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,440
to win this case.

684
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,210
OK.

685
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,580
With your help,

686
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,050
we definitely will win.

687
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,010
It’s too early to tell.

<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

689
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,000
Don’t mind about what happened

690
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,120
this morning.

691
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,730
I know.

692
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,160
It’s temporary.

693
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,770
Uh-huh.

694
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,050
I didn’t mean it.

695
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,580
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore
Burang Barbeque</i>

696
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,530
So, are you gonna go...

697
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,930
I’m almost there,

698
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,000
<i>Febuxostat</i>
wait for me.

699
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Right away.

700
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,540
I’m almost there,

701
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,490
wait for me.

702
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,250
Right away.

703
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,080
How much is it?

704
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,890
15.

705
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,740
You’re so smart.

706
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,760
You got an umbrella.

707
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,760
Of course.

708
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,450
Let’s go.

709
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,700
It seems to be the first time we

710
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,450
shop in a supermarket together.

711
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,680
Tell me about it.

712
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,490
Last time it was because of
someone else.

713
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,010
But that’s okay.

714
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,680
We’re gonna have more opportunities.

715
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,450
Have you tried Shaanxi Pasta?

716
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,640
Isn’t it called Cat’s Ear?

717
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,730
You know how to do that?

718
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,010
It’s very difficult.

719
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,010
When I studied abroad,

720
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,280
my roommate was a native of Shaanxi,

721
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,380
and I learned from him.

722
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,260
Did you learn how to cook

723
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,570
when you were studying abroad?

724
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,410
Em.

725
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,810
Haven’t you heard the expression?

726
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,130
Before going abroad,

727
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,050
people thought you learned English
in New Oriental.

728
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,160
After you went abroad,

729
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,330
people thought you learned cooking
in New East.

730
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,370
Ha-ha.

731
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,810
Compared to you, I cook like

732
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,170
a backhoe I learned in Lanxiang.

733
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,970
Next time, do the backhoe thing for me.

734
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,120
Do you like pickles?

735
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,380
I’d like to buy it for breakfast.

736
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,280
No, no, no.

737
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,450
I marinate a lot of this stuff at home.

738
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,760
It’s much better than this.

739
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,370
You can have as much as you want.

740
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,160
You make pickles?

741
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,930
I thought doctors only took a regimen,

742
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,090
and never ate anything
with excess nitrite.

743
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,050
Why can’t we?

744
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,090
I once had a colleague

745
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,570
who ate pickled chicken claws

746
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,450
and analyzed its chemical composition.

747
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,650
And more.

748
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,240
Wang Zengqi once said,

749
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,860
man should eat things

750
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,610
from a wider range.

751
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,160
Try all kind of tastes such as

752
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,340
sweet, salty, spicy and sour ones.

753
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,560
So do doctors.

754
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,960
We should eat wider.

755
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,240
The attitude towards life
will then be much better.

756
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,120
Good point.

757
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,490
It’s almost done.

758
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,760
I’m gonna make you Shaanxi Pasta
and pickles.

759
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,010
What else do you want?

760
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,930
I…can’t.

761
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,760
I have a lot of work to do.

762
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,560
I have to go back to the office.

763
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,760
So I

764
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,680
only deserve this.

765
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,930
So you took the small gap to see me.

766
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,810
Yes.

767
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,170
What I promised you, I will deliver.

768
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,120
With that Mr. Shangguan again?

769
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,450
You spend a lot more time with him

770
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,640
than you do with your boyfriend.

771
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,570
Mr. Shangguan

772
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,450
is representing the case.

773
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,220
Besides,

774
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,450
I took this case myself.

775
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,010
No matter what, I must do my best.

776
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,120
Only to succeed,

777
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,330
not to fail.

778
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,120
I’m sure my boyfriend will support me.

779
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,930
Right?

780
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,970
Yes.

781
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,970
All because my girlfriend is so great.

782
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,860
You delivered your promise,

783
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,080
then I shall take you to your office.

784
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,010
See you.

785
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,080
Drive safe.

786
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,010
Bye-bye.

787
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,230
Until this day I turn round
to look at you,

788
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,590
I suddenly understand that

789
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,750
the one who hangs up
the phone first is so blessed.

790
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,920
It’s like one person is waiting alone

791
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,550
on one side of the world,

792
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,600
while the other person is happily

793
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,750
circling a circle.

794
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,980
In order not to have a time difference
with you,

795
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,570
all I can do

796
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,180
is turn around

797
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,110
and hug you tightly.

798
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:31,984
