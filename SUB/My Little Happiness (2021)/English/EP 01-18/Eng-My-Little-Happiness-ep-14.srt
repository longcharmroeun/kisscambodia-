<i>My Little Happiness</i>

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>Episode 14</i>

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,350
Actually, our present case

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,920
has precedents.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
It was in 1978.

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Registering identical or
similar trademarks

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that are likely to lead to confusion…

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,150
Forging the marks of a registered
trademark without authorization

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,190
or selling the marks…

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
In detail,

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,560
let’s do some analysis.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,780
My paralegal, Cong Rong, will
give a presentation.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,950
As you can see,

41
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,080
the evidence of use of trademark

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,360
must show the mark

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,520
and the user of the trademark,

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,900
which includes the trademark proprietor

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,840
as well as the ones authorized
by the proprietor.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,550
Notes by Lawyer Cong Rong:

47
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,270
I was sent to a business trip
on the first day.

48
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,180
Not only did I meet the client
for the first time,

49
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,020
but also I got a chance
to give presentation.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,670
Though I was in a rush,

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,300
I felt it novel and exciting.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,860
Mr. Shangguan,

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,070
you’re really conscientious.

54
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,310
It’s an unexpected situation.

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,430
You have to come all the way here.

56
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,190
We’re so sorry.

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,270
It’s my job.

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,710
If there’re more problems,

59
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,960
feel free to contact
Cong Rong at any time.

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
She is very capable.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Here is my business card.

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,900
I appreciate your kind consideration.

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,680
OK.

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,900
I have a reservation at a famous
Cantonese restaurant tonight.

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,800
Do you get time

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,460
to have dinner with us?

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,560
Unfortunately,

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,990
I have an appointment
with a client later.

69
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,790
Maybe next time.

70
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,310
No problem.

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,060
There’s still time.

72
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,460
Thank you so much.

73
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,860
You’re welcome.

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,060
See you. See you.

75
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,270
Mr. Shangguan.

76
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,280
Where’s the next destination?

77
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,340
I’ll call a cab.

78
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,870
There’s no next destination.

79
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,900
I made it up.

80
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,030
I’ve contributed most of my time

81
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,430
to my work.

82
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,580
I don’t want to waste
the little spare time

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,580
on socializing.

84
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,460
Besides, a lawyer must remain impartial.

85
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,310
Dining or wining with clients will

86
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,390
inevitably involve personal feelings in.

87
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,550
So it is.

88
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,710
You just did a good job.

89
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,550
If you have nothing else to do,

90
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,150
would you go somewhere with me?

91
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,750
Sure.

92
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,780
I don’t have anything to do.

93
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,060
What’s the number?

94
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,960
<i>Financial and tax service,
invoice issuing</i>

95
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,390
Why isn’t it the one I expected?

96
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,110
Cong Rong.

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,020
Coming. Mr. Shangguan.

98
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,990
Let’s go in and have a look.

99
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:19,340
<i>Ruipeng Pet Hospital</i>

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,460
Kitty.

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,310
Kitty.

102
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,510
What a surprise.

103
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,300
Mr. Shangguan.

104
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,900
Do you like cute kittens too?

105
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,870
So?

106
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,020
In your mind,

107
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,300
am I a serious and old-fashioned man?

108
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,260
No, no.

109
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,260
What’s wrong with its eyes?

110
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,170
I think they’re inflamed.

111
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,100
Do you have a cat too?

112
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,290
I have a Siamese cat.

113
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,380
It’s very naughty

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,580
and stubborn.

115
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,850
But every time when I get home,

116
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,970
it acts like a spoiled child.

117
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,820
It will rub around my feet,

118
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,580
as if it welcomes me back.

119
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,870
That makes me feel less tired
in a second.

120
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,670
Because it hasn’t seen you for a day.

121
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,610
It must miss you.

122
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,930
Do you like cats, too?

123
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,410
I like dogs better.

124
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,920
White and chubby ones.

125
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,050
Dogs are cute, too.

126
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,410
Wait for a second.

127
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,650
How much is this?

128
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,530
30 yuan.

129
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,440
Okay.

130
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,360
Thanks.

131
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,850
Let’s go.

132
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,730
It must be happy to be your pet.

133
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,810
It gets gifts.

134
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,770
I chose to keep it.

135
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,850
I must pamper it.

136
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,700
Sure.

137
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,680
You chose it.

138
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,090
Is my cell phone broken?

142
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,120
I’ve sent you so many messages
and you’ve replied none of them.

143
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,930
Don’t reply me.

144
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,320
You mustn’t reply.

145
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,090
What if he calls me?

146
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,970
I won’t answer it.

147
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,680
I won’t.

149
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,560
Hey.

150
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,850
Why did you wait so long to call me?

151
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,900
I’m sorry.

I’m a little tired today.

163
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,880
And then?

164
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,210
I’m going to bed.

165
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,730
You should go to bed, too.

166
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,650
He hung it up?

167
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,290
Did he just hang up on me?

168
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,210
He is so glacial to me
on our first day of being together.

169
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,970
He dare hang up on me.

170
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,850
Unsurprisingly,

171
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,090
all men are unfaithful.

172
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,090
Who is it?

173
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,560
Room service.

174
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,480
There’s no one.

175
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,320
Wen Shaoqing.

176
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,360
I can’t wait until tomorrow.

177
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,480
I want to see you today.

178
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,440
I’m so tired today.

179
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,410
Let me hold you for a while.

180
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,530
Wait.

181
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,530
You have clinic hours tomorrow.

182
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,730
Don’t you have to go to work?

183
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,210
I’ll take an early flight home.

184
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,370
There’re a few hours.

185
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,890
Why don’t we take the time

186
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,680
to do something we’d like to do?

187
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,890
Yeah.

188
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,500
You may think the food stall
is simple and crude,

189
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,250
but the food is delicious.

190
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,170
Is this what you’d like to do?

191
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,800
We agreed to have dinner together.

192
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,490
We must make it.

193
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,010
Miss Cong,

194
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,690
were you expecting something else?

195
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,840
I wasn’t.

196
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,080
Don’t get me wrong.

197
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,490
Yeah.

198
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,370
Delicious.

199
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,050
Have a taste.

200
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,080
What do you think?

201
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,490
Good.

202
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,130
Surely it is.

203
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,290
Wait.

204
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,250
You’re old enough.

205
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,890
How can you get food on your face?

206
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,600
My wife told me

207
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,860
you brought a girl.

208
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,080
Where is she?

209
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,920
Is she… Is she the girl?

210
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,840
How do you do?

211
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,600
Do you know each other?

212
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,050
More than that.

213
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,410
We have a friendship of life and death.

214
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,800
Tell you what,

215
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,290
you finally show up.

216
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,130
I can guarantee you with my scar.

217
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,010
Marry him.

218
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,800
You won’t regret.

219
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,620
You’re mistaken.

220
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,890
I haven’t decided to marry him.

221
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,800
Who do you want to marry?

222
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,020
Please,

223
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,080
another fried pork chop.

224
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,290
Okay. Okay.

225
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,720
Okay.

226
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,800
You haven’t answered my question yet.

227
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,920
The food stall is famous.

228
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,380
Is the food good?

229
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,140
It is.

230
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,960
We’ll come again if you like it.

231
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,320
Is the man

232
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,650
acquainted with you?

233
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,010
Did you tell him about me?

234
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,010
Yes.

235
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,920
I told him when you were a kid,

236
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,960
you ripped your pants while
climbing over a wall.

237
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,530
Never mind.

238
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,920
I was joking.

239
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,050
In fact, I did tell him lots of things.

240
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,720
Because he is a special friend to me.

241
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,960
I saved his life when I

242
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,320
first performed a surgical operation.

243
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,490
That’s why he said you have
a friendship of life and death.

244
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,620
I remember his girlfriend plucked at me

245
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,600
outside the operating room and said

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,440
no matter what he turned into,

247
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,370
even if he couldn’t move,

248
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,960
she would still marry him.

249
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,840
But at that time, I was a half new hand.

250
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,500
Standing by the operating table,

251
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,600
I was nervous.

252
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,050
I thought I mustn’t fail.

253
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,960
I must save him,

254
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,560
so that the girl could tell him
on her own.

255
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,800
Dr. Wen,

256
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,010
you’re brilliant.

257
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,130
They must be grateful to you.

258
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,560
In fact, I was more grateful to him.

259
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,890
Seeing a patient recover,

260
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,320
leave the hospital,

261
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,130
and start a new life

262
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,250
is the belief that
supports medical staff and

263
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,920
maintains their original intention.

264
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,890
What photos are you taking?

265
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,530
It’s nothing.

266
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,650
Just the scenery.

267
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,800
Do you see that escalator?

268
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,500
I suddenly remember a funny thing
from my childhood.

269
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,810
I bet with my friends

270
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,250
I could get off the overpass
with my eyes closed.

271
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,380
But I made a misstep

272
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,370
and knocked off two front teeth.

273
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,720
Do you want to

274
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,600
try that again?

275
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,330
I can’t.

276
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,130
What if I fall over?

277
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,440
Just close your eyes.

278
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,010
I’ll hold your hands.

279
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,490
You will only fall over on me.

280
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,490
What?

281
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,920
Don’t you believe me?

282
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,170
Yes, I do.

283
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,050
Let’s do it.

284
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,050
I’m taking a step.

285
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,680
Go ahead.

286
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,080

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,560
Have I got there?

293
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,840
Soon.

294
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,070

295
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,000

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,050
All right. I won’t tease you again.

301
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,370
After boys go to junior middle school
and get much taller,

302
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,410
they get thinner naturally.

303
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,720
Did any girls like you?

304
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,130
Of course.

305
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,960
You don’t know how much temptation
I’ve resisted

306
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,940
because of you.

307
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,540
I only glanced at their love letters
before I threw them away.

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,350
Did you?

309
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,470
All these years,

310
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,510
what have you been doing?

311
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,150
Becoming handsome.

312
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,300
I can see that.

313
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,230
What else?

314
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,230
Imaging us to be together.

315
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,420
What is it like?

316
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,780
In junior middle school,

317
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,990
I imagined that I waited for you
outside your apartment,

318
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,900
went to school with you

319
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,230
and took bus home with you.

320
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,700
In high school,

321
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,540
boys started to date.

322
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,820
I thought it was no big deal.

323
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,430
When you were back,

324
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,780
I would hold your hands like this,

325
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,300
to make them jealous.

326
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,470
I didn’t expect you were so childish.

327
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
Men are childish in front of

328
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,700
their love.

329
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,270
What happened next?

330
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,230
Then I went to college.

331
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,540
It was hard to study medicine.

332
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,390
I only had a few minutes to miss you
before I went to bed every day.

333
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,110
I wanted you to be my medical model.

334
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,300
I wanted to hold you,

335
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,190
and touch you.

336
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,390
Wen Shaoqing.

337
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,420
To touch you to check which section
of your spine has scoliosis.

338
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,390
People are cheated by your
elegant appearance.

339
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,630
You’re a rogue.

340
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,070
I shall send you a lawyer’s letter.

341
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,780
I’m not a rogue.

342
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,940
Um.

343
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,230
Go to bed if you’re sleepy.

344
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,230
I’m not sleepy.

345
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,900
Then lean on me.

346
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,120
In fact, there’re a lot of things

347
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
I want to do with you, too.

348
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,020
I promise you.

349
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,200
I haven’t told you yet.

350
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,390
No matter what it is.

351
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,420
Wen Shaoqing?

352
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,150
Wen Shaoqing?

353
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,690
How did I fall asleep?

354
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,500
<i>Febuxostat: Already aboard.
Don’t worry.</i>

355
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,180
<i>Have a safe journey.
Send me a message when you arrive.</i>

356
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,140
<i>Girlfriend</i>

357
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,540
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

358
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,290
I’m so tired.

359
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,050
Today is another hard day.

360
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,600
Miss, are you tired?

361
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,360
How do you feel about my massage?

362
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,930
Don’t try to sell me your massage card.

363
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,050
It’s free.

364
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,880
You are the angel
of the Angels in White.

365
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,450
The Nurse in White.

366
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,060
Why are you trying so hard

367
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,900
to flatter me today?

368
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,560
Why?

369
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,050
Do you want a favor?

370
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,120
I want to ask you something.

371
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,690
Don’t you have much first hand
information of the male doctors

372
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
in our hospital?

373
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,360
Sure.

374
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,490
I want to know if there are

375
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,630
any young talents who are unmarried,

376
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,840
and not baldheaded,

377
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,770
more importantly,

378
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,730
at a higher position than my boss?

379
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,770
Yes.

380
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,730
Really?

381
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,960
If any, I’ll keep him to myself.

382
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,730
Why?

383
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,640
You want to fight with me over him?

384
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,400
I’m not a gay.

385
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,330
Then what do you want?

386
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,320
I want to

387
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,010
put up personal ads

388
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,170
to seek marriage for my cousin.

389
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,560
Seek marriage for your cousin.

390
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,210
Does your cousin know it?

391
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,530
I see.

392
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,560
You try to sell your cousin, don’t you?

393
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,560
I won’t hold the candle to the devil.

394
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,930
Xia.

395
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,880
Xia.

396
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,160
Xia.

397
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,490
Xia.

398
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,400
Do me a favor.

399
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
Xia.

400
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,730
Help me this time.

401
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,840
Just this time.

402
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,170
I just want to look for a husband
for my cousin.

403
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,090
Come on.

404
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,380
You must have made stupid mistakes.

405
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,490
You are no longer able to fool around
in Dr. Wen’s charge.

406
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,900
So you try to hug close

407
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,620
a more powerful guy
through your cousin.

408
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,050
Start an uprising.

409
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,640
Can you see it?

410
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,000
I was hoping that

411
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,770
as long as my boss and my cousin
got together,

412
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,400
it would do me some good.

413
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,050
I didn’t expect my cousin
would refuse him.

414
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,840
Was it real?

415
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,160
Wow,

416
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,970
Cong Rong is so determined.

417
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,800
My cousin must have a good eye,

418
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,360
knowing he isn’t a good man.

419
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,360
Generally speaking,

420
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,100
I’ve lost my bargaining chip.

421
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,540
As I’m still a houseman,

422
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,120
I’d better move on
to another department.

423
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,860
Death arrives.

424
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,930
You think so, don’t you?

425
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,060
Frequent shifts make a tree dead
but a man prosperous.

426
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,200
If I don’t make shifts right now,

427
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,690
the Butcher will send me
to the mortuary sooner or later.

428
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,880
I’ve tried my best.

429
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,570
Dr. Wen.

430
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,920
Did your clinic hours end?

431
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,610
OK.

432
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,250
You must be tired.

433
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,450
Excuse me, then.

434
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,450
See you at night.

435
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,450
Where do you want to shift to?

436
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,530
I’ll give you a hand.

437
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,490
Don’t bother, boss.

438
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,930
I can handle it.

439
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,860
Seven o’clock, tonight.

440
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,610
Don’t forget.

441
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:07,970
Rest assured.

442
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,540
I won’t forget.

443
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,770
We’ll set out as soon as
Sanbao gets off work.

444
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,840
It’s early now, isn’t it?

445
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,970
Why do you come to the parking lot?

446
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,770
Accompany me?

447
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,210
Don’t flatter yourself.

448
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:18,850
Accompany you?

449
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,820
I come in advance to

450
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,580
turn on the air conditioner of my car,

451
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,450
to make my precious wife
feel more comfortable.

452
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,400
Show off.

453
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,530
Do you envy me?

454
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,410
Yes.

455
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,050
I admit

456
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,410
you

457
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,370
are a little more handsome

458
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,930
and a bit taller than me.

459
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,170
But I have a wife.

460
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,880
So,

461
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,080
do you have one?

462
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,370
What if I have one?

463
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,010
Drop it.

464
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,880
I don’t believe you at all.

465
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,450
Shaoqing.

466
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,010
Shaoqing.

467
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,450
You moved a long time ago.

468
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,340
How come you get an attack of conscience

469
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,410
and throw a house-warming party?

470
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,160
Will you come or not?

471
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:50,970
I will.

472
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,930
I surely will.

473
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,290
I like to scrounge free meals.

474
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:53,930
So,

475
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,970
what shall I bring to you?

476
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,290
Just bring your mouth

477
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,290
so I can feed you.

478
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,320
Who else have you invited?

479
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,160
Some acquaintances from the hospital,

480
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,320
interns,

481
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,210
and a mysterious guest.

482
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,120
Are you leaving?

483
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,400
A mysterious guest?

484
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,120
You live far away, don’t you?

485
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,560
I’ll take you home
if you’re not in a hurry.

486
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,240
But we have to make a detour
to the company first.

487
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,170
Don’t worry about me.

488
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:23,640
I…

489
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,360
Wait for a second.

490
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,290
Hello, how are you?

491
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,690
Mr. Li.

492
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,820
I just came back from a business trip.

493
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,400
Mr. Shangguan.

494
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,250
OK. OK.

495
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,860
I gotta go. Bye.

496
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,540
OK.

497
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,290
Bye.

498
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,380
<i>Cong Rong: I got on a cab.
See you in half an hour.</i>

499
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,060
<i>Wen Shaoqing: Waiting for you.</i>

500
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,400
Hey.

501
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,600
Welcome back.

502
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,730
Mr. Shangguan asked to take me home,

503
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,160
but I figured it would take 50 minutes.

504
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,130
It took only 30 minutes by taxi,

505
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,250
so I came back by myself

506
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,880
to see you earlier.

507
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,640
I miss you.

508
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,880
I miss you too.

509
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,450
But I think I should tell you
something first.

510
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,080
Let me hold you for a while.

511
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,160
Hey.

512
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,610
Why didn’t you tell me
you have so many guests?

513
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,370
Didn’t you say you want to
hold me for a while?

514
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,250
I… I feel so embarrassed.

515
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,380
OK.

516
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,900
Come in.

517
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,490
I don’t want to come in.

518
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,060
Come in.

519
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,580
No.

520
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey.

521
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,930
Hey.

522
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,880
Honey,

523
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,840
actually, I want to tell you

524
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,400
I miss you.

525
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,730
I miss to hit you.

526
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,960
Look at you.

527
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,450
So, is my senior fellow apprentice

528
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,080
really dating Cong Rong?

529
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,320
I heard she refused him.

530
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,380
Zhong Zhen has given me

531
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,770
the wrong third hand news.

532
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,170
Um.

533
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,930
Before I came,

534
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,210
he told me

535
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,210
I needn’t bring anything

536
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,100
other than my mouth.

537
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,780
He has food to feed me.

538
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,690
I figured it out just now.

539
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,340
The so-called food

540
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,560
is public display of affection.

541
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,600
What has delayed you?

542
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,450
Cong Rong,

543
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,450
why are you here?

544
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,770
Why is your face blushing?

545
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,640
Hot.

546
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,010
Where’s my boss?

547
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,010
In the kitchen.

548
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,450
Are you okay?

549
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,410
You look upset.

550
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,320
I performed an operation today.

551
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,160
Bad mood got me make an error.

552
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,560
The patient died on the operating table.

553
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,060
You haven’t graduated yet.

554
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,050
How can you perform an operation?

555
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,860
Don’t your hospital and college
care about that?

556
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,770
They do.

557
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,050
So I got zero in anatomy.

558
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,290
This is my patient.

559
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,730
An authentic garden chicken.

560
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,880
Cong Rong,

561
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,410
can you tell me something?

562
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,120
Speak.

563
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,530
You live across the hall.

564
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,090
Do you know

565
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,010
who my boss is dating?

566
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,000
Actually, I know.

567
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,930
What’s wrong?

568
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,450
I may have offended her.

569
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,730
Have you?

570
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,600
Ever since she appeared,

571
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,640
my status in my boss’s heart
has suffered a disastrous decline.

572
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,450
My life hasn’t been easy.

573
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,880
Zhong Zhen.

574
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,360
Yes.

575
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,250
Your boss called you.

576
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,730
Go in there.

577
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,160
Don’t dawdle.

578
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
It’s just a little housework,

579
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,250
and it makes you tired.

580
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,100
If I don’t come out later,

581
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,600
please chant the mantra for me.

582
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,770
What’s wrong?

583
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,210
Got a problem with your neck?

584
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,050
No.

585
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,290
It’s just a little cold.

586
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:27,600
OK.

587
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,360
Let’s have an anatomy demonstration

588
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,840
with the chicken

589
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,360
that brought by Zhong Zhen.

590
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,640
Press the knife in the
soft tissue of bone,

591
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,360
dissect it along the suture joints,

592
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,880
avoid the kidneys,

593
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,400
and find the fifth segment
of the lumbar spine.

594
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,930
Do you know where the fifth
segment of the lumbar spine is?

595
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,880
Yeah, yes.

596
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,600
Here.

597
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,320
OK.

598
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,010
Look carefully.

599
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,640
The chicken has fatty liver.

600
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,600
You should all touch it.

601
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,320
Zhong Zhen,

602
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,320
where are you touching?

603
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,560
Boss.

604
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,120
I kneel down to you now.

605
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,640
Could you let me live?

606
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
Debone the chicken clearly.

607
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,400
Make sure no residue left.

608
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,490
I’ll cook soup with it.

609
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,210
Who starts first?

610
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,100
Come on, you guys.

611
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,650
Hurry up.

612
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,540
I dare not. I dare not.

613
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,820
My boss said where I should start?

614
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,250
Okay. Okay. Okay.

615
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,300
My fellow apprentice.

616
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,210
Why do you come out?

617
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,490
I want to know what would you like
for staple food?

618
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,540
Staple food?

619
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,100
We’d like to have…

620
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,120
How about rice?

621
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,010
OK.

622
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,930
Do you like baby cabbage or lettuce?

623
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,930
Either is fine.

624
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,620
Would you like
stir fried yogurt for dessert?

625
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,690
It turns out
you didn’t ask the questions

626
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,580
to get our answer.

627
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,100
Yeah.

628
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,730
That’s right.

629
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,530
He hasn’t even looked away from her.

630
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,100
As a former fan of yours,

631
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,010
it’s my greatest sincerity
not to lash out at you.

632
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,780
Go back to cook.

633
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,640
Hurry up. Hurry.

634
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,530
Look at them.

635
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,970
How sweet.

636
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,250
Let’s continue.

637
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,080
Let’s continue.

638
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,210
Come on.

639
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,970
It’s your turn.

640
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,340
Hurry.

641
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,660
So sweet.

642
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,820
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

643
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,800
Fifty-four.

644
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,690
Fifty-six.

645
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,600
Fifty-eight.

646
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,800
Aren’t you happy that
your books sell so well?

647
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,090
I’m so happy that
I can’t sleep every day.

648
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,930
I’m happy.

649
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,080
You don’t show any happy signs.

650
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,720
You’re an emotionless robot.

651
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,640
You know what?

652
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,210
Man’s fortune is like a sine curve.

653
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,250
It goes up and down.

654
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,600
You’d better keep calm,

655
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,820
lest be caught in a dilemma.

656
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,640
Receipt?

657
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,540
Receipt may help.

658
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,640
Invoice must include tax point.

659
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,930
Why are you smiling?

660
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,640
Why do my books make you so happy?

661
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,330
Because I got credit for selling them.

662
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,840
I made a star out of you.

663
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,530
Since when I’ve been a star?

664
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,490
Two months ago.

665
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,360
Well.

666
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,400
Let me show you.

667
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,850
I recorded your daily life

668
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,440
and uploaded it on to WeSee.

669
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,530
You’ve got hundreds of thousands
of fans now.

670
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,210
Then I take advantage

671
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,820
to recommend your poetry collection.

672
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,410
How virtuous!

673
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,930
Then the sales begin to rocket.

674
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,770
What does that mean?

675
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,250
It means I’m good at sales promotion.

676
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,490
I have a business mind.

677
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,060
When did you take the videos?

678
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,730
You took so many.

679
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,880
Don’t worry about that.

680
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,640
Anyway, I’m the woman behind you.

681
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,400
Why don’t you treat me to a meal?

682
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,640
I’m starving.

683
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,820
You interrupted me.

684
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,080
I forgot how many I’ve counted.

685
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,250
Fifty-eight.

686
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,050
Forgetful woman.

687
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,240
Yeah.

Get to work.

701
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,600
He referred to the receipt, didn’t he?

I’ve spent the day with Wen Rang again.

730
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,580
I’m so upset.

731
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,450
Why… Why did you say “again”?

732
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,080
Why did you say “again”?

733
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,780
I have some words to say to Jiang Yao,

734
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,930
to say it seriously.

735

Speak.

736
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,130
I’ll marry you sooner or later.

737
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,920
When?

738
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,730

I’m sorry.

I… I didn’t mean to…

742
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,620
You should go back now.

743

I want to be alone.

744
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,860
It’s my fault.

745
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,330
I was curious.

746
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,790
I didn’t know it was your…

747
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,900
Do you want to stay?

748
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,800
Then excuse me.

I feel embarrassed.

I really want you to taste the soup.

776

I really want to kiss you, too.

777

I heard my boss’s girlfriend
would come today.

804
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,650
This spot must be reserved for her.

805
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,200
How can you sit here?

806

Well, are you dim-witted?

Your cousin is Dr. Wen’s girlfriend.

811

Why don’t you dig a hole…?

812
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,680
And bury yourself?

Do you have a problem?

Today, I invite you over

817
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,290
to announce two things.

818
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,490
The first one is business.

819
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,850
Cong Rong has officially joined Daren.

820
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,280
She’ll no longer go to the hospital
for internship.

821
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,720
So this is a goodbye party.

822
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,730
Cong Rong.

823
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,050
Although today is your last day
of working in the hospital,

824
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,050
we’ve already got along well.

825
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,490
We must keep in touch in the future.

826
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,410
Yes.

827
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,410
Our colleagues in the hospital
all like you very much.

828
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,120
I like you too.

829
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,080
My fellow apprentice

830
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,690
especially likes you.

831
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,560
Thank you.

832
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,400
I like you all, too.

833
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,560
I’ll be back a lot.

834
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,720
The second thing is personal.

835
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,330
What I said before was true.

836
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,900
Cong Rong and I have known each other
since we were children.

837
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,240
I’ve been waiting for her for years.

838
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,410
Now we’re finally together.

839
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,120
Don’t make jokes and
couple me with other women again.

840
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,780
Come on.

841
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,440
Congratulations.

842
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,860

Your names are a good match.

847

Gentle and unhurried.

848
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,930
Live a quiet life.

849
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,450
Isn’t it beautiful?

850
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,850
You’re honey-lipped.

851
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,240
Yours are a good match too.

852
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,120
Look at us.

853
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,220
So sweet.

854
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,720
Public display of affection.

855
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,610
Let’s eat.

856
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,220
Eat, eat.

857
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,050
Honey, have some more.

858
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,240
Cong Rong.

859
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,240
If I said something wrong,

860
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,200
don’t harbor grievance against me.

861
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,300
Taste the soup.

862
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,500
It’s wolfberry chicken soup.

863
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,570
It’s nutritious.

864
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,850
Have a taste.

865
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,720
Taste it.

866
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,600
Just drop it.

867
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,600
Thanks, honey.

868
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,530
Congratulations again.

869
00:36:59,700 --> 00:36:59,930
Here.

870
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,260
Cheers!

871
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,530
Lasting happiness to you!

872
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,330
Cheers.

874
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,530
Dr. Wen.

875
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,410
Goodbye.

876
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,050
Bye.

877
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:24,890
Bye.

878
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,660
Dr. Wen

879
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,050
and your girlfriend.

880
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,970
Goodbye.

881
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,930
Bye.

882
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,530
You live across the hall now.

883
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,050
Will you live together one day?

884
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,560
Nonsense.

885
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,410
Don’t disturb them.

886
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,530
Insensitive.

887
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:38,850
Fellow apprentice

888
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,970
and your girlfriend,

889
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,210
goodbye then.

890
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:41,860
Bye.

891
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,610
Bye. Sister.

892
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,370
Bye.

893
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,850
Cong Rong.

894
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,490
Boss.

895
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,530
Goodbye.

896
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,240
Mrs. Wen,

897
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,560
shall we have a walk?

898
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,720
I’m not Mrs. Wen yet.

899
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,700
Don’t hide.

900
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,560
I know it’s you.

901
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,970
So the deep love

902
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,530
you referred on camping

903
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,330
was her?

904
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,680
Yeah.

905
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,530
Why did you break up?

906
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,220
Does it need a reason to break up?

907
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,010
The love was just gone.

908
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,610
Did you stop loving her

909
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,120
or did she stop loving you?

910
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,450
No answer.

911
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,050
I guess she broke up with you.

912
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,600
I just don’t understand.

913
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,820
You’re one in a thousand.

914
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,280
Why did she break up with you?

915
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,760
Am I one in a thousand?

916
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,560
I’m not a celebrity.

917
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,050
I have no money.

918
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,700
I can just sing a couple of songs

919
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,560
and write a couple of poems.

920
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,240
Why must she like me?

921
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,720
You don’t understand.

922
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,680
Isn’t there a saying that

923
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,080
beautiful skins are the same,

924
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,330
and interesting souls are foolish.

925
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,120
Isn’t it funny?

926
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,750
I didn’t say you’re foolish.

927
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,720
I mean you are interesting.

928
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,490
You have interesting souls.

929
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,050
You also have talents.

930
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,120
I also think

931
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,450
you’re a very, very nice man.

932
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,970
She didn’t understand you.

933
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,410
It’s not worth you denying yourself.

934
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,930
I’ve read all of your poems.

935
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,370
Though I don’t understand all of them,

936
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,600
I can still tell

937
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,970
if you were happy or painful

938
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,600
when you wrote them.

939
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,860
A track-minded person like me

940
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,370
can see you’re a good man.

941
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,810
I believe others can see it too.

942
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,200
Really?

943
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,490
Yeah.

944
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,300
Doesn’t the sales

945
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,760
prove that your talents are recognized?

946
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,260
Those people are just on a whim

947
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,080
to support an internet celebrity.

948
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,410
You’ll bite my arm again
if you’re drunken.

949
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,930
Wen Rang.

950
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,050
I see that.

951
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,630
You’re wrestling with yourself.

952
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,050
Yes.

953
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,640
I’m wrestling with myself.

954
00:41:45,614 --> 00:42:05,614
