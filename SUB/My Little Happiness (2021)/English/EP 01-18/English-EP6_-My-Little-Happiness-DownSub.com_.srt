30

Why are you here?

31
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,150
Rong, don’t be scared. It’s me.

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,600
So you’re the one

33
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,280
who bought me sandwiches and coffee,

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
and called a taxi for me earlier today?

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,750
Right.

36
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,430
So you’re my new next door neighbor.

37
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,190
Yes.

38
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,430
But why did you move here?

39
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,870
Because it’s close.

40
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,260
Close to where?

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,220
The hospital.

42
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,710
The hospital?

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,150
How could that be the hospital?

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,270
He’s here because it’s close to you.

45
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,820
Don’t talk too much.

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,950
This is a chance.

47
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,560
You must grab it.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,350
Be serious.

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay.

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,430
Don’t eat too much.

51
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,560
I’ll be serious.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,260
I’ll be serious.

53
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,150
I’ll deal with it.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,670
Say no more.

55
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,280
Okay. Okay. Okay.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
I know. I know.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,590
I know.

58
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,470
Thank you.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,950
So, this is why you shocked her?

60
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,820
Shock?

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,750
This is the housewarming gift
I prepared.

62
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,560
If it’s a gift,

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,900
just give it to me directly.

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,780
Why do you have to act like a stalker?

65
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,820
That memo.

66
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,630
That sign.

67
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,600
What does it mean?

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,750
It’s the molecular formula of dopamine.

69
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,820
Dopamine

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,910
is a neurotransmitter.

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,350
When a human brain emits dopamine,

72
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,030
it means that he’s happy and excited.

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,590
I’m saying that

74
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,910
I’m glad to be your neighbor.

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,510
Next time please just say it.

76
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,780
Don’t beat around the bushes.

77
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,150
This soup is so delicious.

78
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,350
Dr. Wen.

79
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,100
You’re such an amazing cook.

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,070
Do you aspire to be an ideal
stay-at-home boyfriend?

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,150
Well.

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,350
It’s acceptable.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,070
Acceptable?

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,190
What’s your zodiac sign?

85
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,220
Why are you so romantic?

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,220
Pisces?

87
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,830
Scorpio.

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,740
Scorpio.

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,660
Cherish your life and stay away from...

90
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,830
No, no, no!

91
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,120
Scorpios are fine.

92
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,830
They’re stately and thoughtful.

93
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,070
What’s your ascendant sign?

94
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,200
Are you a census enumerator?

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,070
I’m just asking.

96
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,560
Do your parents urge you to get married?

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
What’s your type like?

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,560
Let’s go home.

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,390
Go home.

100
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,200
I don’t want to.

101
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
I haven’t finished it yet.

102
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,120
You’ve not only finished.

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,760
You’re pretty full too.

104
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,070
I packed this for you.

105
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,880
Take it.

106
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,240
I don’t need this.

107
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,830
You...

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,680
Thank you.

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,470
Thanks a lot, Dr. Wen.

110
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,310
You really beat me.

111
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,470
You ate and then you took it home.

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,630
Dr. Wen

113
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,420
acted a bit like a straight science guy.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,780
But he’s quite crafty.

115
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,510
It’s not bad.

116
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,150
Though he expresses himself oddly,

117
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,550
it’s clear that

118
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,390
you’re important to him.

119
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,860
Come on!

120
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,950
Seriously.

121
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,300
What do you think of him?

122
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,390
He’s a good doctor.

123
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,710
He’s also a good man.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,910
Is it possible that...?

125
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,860
What?

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,220
Are you having a cramp in your hands?

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,300
Don’t play stupid.
Is it possible that you get together?

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,460
Sure enough.

129
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,980
Gifts blind the eyes.

130
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,460
I’m serious.

131
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,070
He talked about dopamine,

132
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,870
and how happy he is to be your neighbor.

133
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,070
I think he’s confessing his love to you.

134
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,590
The scent of romance.

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,260
Give me a break.

136
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,390
We only just met.

137
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,300
How could he possibly love me?

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,860
I don’t believe you.

139
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,060
Let’s go through everything together.

140
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,180
What happened between you?

141
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,110
Make way.

142
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,830
Don’t move.

143
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,990
I’m the intern sent from Daren Law Firm.

144
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,920
I hope to get along well with you.

145
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,780
My name is Cong Rong.

146
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,860
You’re finally here.

147
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,750
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

148
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,200
If you fall down later,

149
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,470
I won’t take it as work-related injury.

150
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,920
We are childhood sweethearts.

151
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,700
I’ve been loving her for decades.

152
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,590
Unfortunately,

153
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,980
my love was not reciprocated.

154
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,320
I’m minding your business.

155
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,970
It’s my business too.

156
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,070
I want to see if you’ll care for me.

157
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,390
Gosh.

158
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,390
Do you really believe that

159
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,860
these are just coincidences?

160
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,950
You’ve just met.

161
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,910
And how many times you’ve hugged?

162
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,920
One, two, three, four.

163
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,030
Four times.

164
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,510
I’ve been in so many relationships.

165
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,270
I’ve never hugged so many times
in one relationship.

166
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,070
Hearing you say that...

167
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,740
Maybe... Possibly...

168
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,310
Maybe, there’s one percent probability.

169
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,660
One percent?

170
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,270
This is so obvious.

171
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,880
You’re the only one still doubting it.

172
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,910
Is this obvious?

173
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,910
Of course, it is.

174
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,710
Wait.

175
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,950
If a man loves a woman,

176
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,910
isn’t a confession the most direct way?

177
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,300
Why does he have to beat around
the bushes and make me guess?

178
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,260
If he tells you directly,

179
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,470
how will you react?

180
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,180
I’ll probably say no.

181
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,660
That’s it then.

182
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
He’s so confident and smart.

183
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,740
He won’t do something that
he’s not 100 percent sure about.

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,860
I’ve figured out the rest of
the story for you.

185
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,100
What is it?

186
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,280
You’ll accidentally meet
on your way to work.

187
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,830
And he’ll give you the breakfast
he prepared for you with love.

188
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,310
When you’re at the hospital,

189
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,100
he will use work as excuses
to get close to you.

190
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,310
And he’ll try to make you
his responsibility.

191
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,920
And then you...

192
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,470
Stop!

193
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,350
Stop your Mary Sue fantasies.

194
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,680
I’ve been selling my used items all day.

195
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,980
I’m so tired.

196
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,310
I’ll sleep first.

197
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,950
Milk and bread are on the desk.

198
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,920
Oatmeal is in the cupboard.

199
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,140
Look for it yourself.

200
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,920
Good morning.

201
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,020
Which cupboard?

202
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,520
Go to work with Dr. Wen.

203
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,260
Don’t mind me.

204
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,380
Good morning.

205
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,260
Do you want breakfast?

206
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,070
I’ve figured out the rest of the story
for you.

207
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,850
You’ll accidentally meet
on your way to work.

208
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,680
And he’ll give you the breakfast he
prepared for you with love.

209
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,070
Is it good?

210
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,350
It’s hot.

211
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,860
The taste…

212
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,740
How is it?

213
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,340
It’s not as good as the 5-yuan pancakes
sold by the uncle at the gate.

214
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,710
You should learn from him.

215
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,230
Dr. Wen,

216
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,500
aren’t you driving today?

217
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,620
What a coincidence!

218
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,350
I’m taking the bus to work today too.

219
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,400
Great.

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,120
Let’s go together.

221
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,520
I’m sorry.

222
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,610
It’s too crowded.

223
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,850
You just had breakfast.

224
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,640
Standing up is good for digestion.

225
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,770
Dr. Wen.

226
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,130
You’d better drive next time.

227
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,850
The bus is not suitable for you.

228
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,530
There’s nothing I can hold here.

229
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,690
Go somewhere else.

230
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,280
Fine.

231
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,120
I’m sorry.

232
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,970
It’s fine.

233
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,480
We still have time.

234
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,640
Let’s go get a cup of coffee.

235
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,770
Sorry.

236
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,280
I’m busy today.

237
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,490
Bye.

238
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:39,940
(Administrative Building)

239
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,970
Are you looking for trouble?

240
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,850
What?

241
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,370
Did I hurt you?

242
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,210
I’m sorry.

243
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,520
What do you want me for?

244
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,730
Cousin.

245
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,160
You should be proud of me.

246
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,800
I was selected!

247
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,460
(Outpatient)

248
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,100
(Outpatient)
This year’s competition will revolve

249
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,700
(Medical Knowledge Contest)
around basic knowledge evaluation,

250
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,100
(Contest content)
nursing, hospital infection control,

251
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,410
rescue, medical safety control,
and doctor-patient relationship.

252
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,880
You okay with so many aspects?

253
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,530
Why not?

254
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,840
We have Dr. Chen and Dr. Qin this year.

255
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,700
And we have Boss
to increase our average score.

256
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,010
As long as I don’t mess up,

257
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,850
the championship is surely ours.

258
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,640
Where did you find the courage
to join this team?

259
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,120
Did you get in by pulling the strings?

260
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,610
Pulling the strings?

261
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,810
That’s too nasty.

262
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,210
I got in with my own effort.

263
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,210
Our Boss said that

264
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,920
I need to be put to the test.

265
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,880
So I can stand up before big challenges.

266
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,090
My Boss also said that...

267
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,820
Why are you always talking about him?

268
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,730
Why do you admire him so much?

269
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,210
Haven’t I told you?

270
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,850
When I was in university,

271
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,970
I didn’t know Boss.

272
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,090
One day, there was
a patient’s family member.

273
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,250
He was in such a hurry.

274
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,450
He ran to the operation room.

275
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,610
Since we wore white robes, he grabbed
on to us asking questions nonstop.

276
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,210
I didn’t know anything.

277
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,520
I was so scared.

278
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,050
At the time, Boss had just finished
an operation that lasted over ten hours,

279
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,690
and didn’t get the time to change.

280
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,730
There was blood on his clothes.

281
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,160
That day

282
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,970
he explained the patient’s conditions

283
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,570
to the family devotedly and patiently.

284
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,400
I think he’s so incredible.

285
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,520
Later, he opened lectures.

286
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,120
He talked about being a good doctor.

287
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,800
And he said that to be a good doctor,

288
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,920
one must learn to be a decent man first.

289
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,000
"You have to live up to your conscience,

290
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and must not disappoint your patients."

291
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,450
He also said,

292
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,760
if there’s a cause,

293
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,220
a thousand foe won’t bend my will.

294
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,450
If there’s a cause...

295
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,220
My will...

296
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,160
A thousand foe won’t bend my will.

297
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,690
Cousin.

298
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,640
Before that,

299
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,610
I had never felt that

300
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,400
studying medicine is such
an important cause for me.

301
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,290
On that day,

302
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,970
I was suddenly inspired by him.

303
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,330
I want to be a good doctor

304
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,250
like him.

305
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,970
Cousin.

306
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,370
Why are you so interested in Boss?

307
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,690
I’m not interested in him.

308
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,940
If I had known how much you would talk,

309
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,800
I wouldn’t have asked you.

310
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,850
You blame me for telling everything?

311
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,040
This knowledge contest.

312
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,640
Take Qin Chu, Chen Cu

313
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,400
and the intern

314
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,010
to attend it.

315
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,450
Our chance of winning will be high.

316
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,400
Fine.

317
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,090
Director Yan.

318
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,210
I have a question about
doctor-patient dispute

319
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,370
that I’d like to ask you.

320
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,090
Okay.

321
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,520
Just in time.

322
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,850
What do you want for me, director?

323
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,930
Do you know

324
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,800
the knowledge contest?

325
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,520
Dr. Wen

326
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,850
is here to ask us a question about

327
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,210
doctor-patient dispute.

328
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,120
You’re a specialist in this area.

329
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,370
So I’ll hand it over to you.

330
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,460
I have a few cases at hand.

331
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,570
I’ll take care of those first.

332
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,250
What took you so long?

333
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,280
I’ve been waiting for you.

334
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,880
Are you really going to
attend the contest?

335
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,610
You’d better not.

336
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,000
Your job is busy.

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,090
Even I feel tired for you.

338
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,920
Are you worried about me?

339
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,290
I’ve thought it through.

340
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,570
Our lecture can be arranged

341
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,420
at any time after work.

342
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,280
You can pick the location.

343
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,720
We live close to each other anyway.

344
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
So from tonight on,

345
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,330
you are my teacher.

346
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,010
When you’re at the hospital,

347
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,690
he will use work as excuses
to get close to you.

348
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,120
How about the others?

349
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,690
I have to decline private lectures.

350
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,760
Plus,

351
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,760
depriving me of my time off work
is not acceptable.

352
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,220
Anyway, my work time is

353
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,690
fully occupied by operations.

354
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,490
You can arrange the rest of the time.

355
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,640
So you will still take up my off time.

(Wife)

357
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,040
Hello, Rong.

358
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,740
Did you have any progress today?

359
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,500
Maybe.

360
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,300
Or maybe not.

361
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,120
What?

362
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,100
Speak louder.

363
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,190
He asked me doctor-patient disputes.

364
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,180
Well.

365
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,180
Is this work content?

366
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,120
Say that again.

367
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,140
I didn’t hear you clearly.

368
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,110
Why is your place so noisy?

369
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,750
Don’t mind it.

370
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,110
I’m at the renovation site.

371
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,470
Tell me the progress.

372
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,780
I’m so anxious to know.

373
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,470
Forget it.

374
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,590
Let’s talk later.

375
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,470
I have more questions.

376
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,350

Wen Rang. Wen Rang.

What is it?

383
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,080
What?

384
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,840
Why are you so alert?

385
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,750
What do you want?

386
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,100
Here’s the money I owed you.

387
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,470
The fine

388
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,310
and the money for the BBQ.

389
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,230
Where did you find this money?

390
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,230
I sorted out and sold my bags,

391
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,350
clothes, shoes, and so on.

392
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,670
I need to renovate my restaurant.

393
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,950
It might get a bit noisy.

394
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,940
But only for a few days.

395
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,310
Okay.

396
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,070
What else?

397
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,550
I have a question for you.

398
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
Please, answer it honestly.

399
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,860
Your nephew, Wen Shaoqing.

400
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,360
Does he have anyone he likes?

401
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,590
You’re not his type.

402
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,070
I’m not talking about myself.

403
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,500
I’m asking for my friend.

404
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,510
Answer it honestly.

405
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,140
Yes, he has.

406
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,160
Really?

407
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,990
Who?

408
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,620
But it’s quite far-fetched.

409
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,380
He likes her.

410
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,100
But their distance seems far.

411
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,920
What?

412
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
I don’t understand.

413
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,510
So does he have one he loves or not?

414
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,590
You can say he doesn’t.

415
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,590
I’ll kick your ass.

(Wen Shaoqing)

417
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,030
Nephew, I didn’t expect
this will happen to you.

418
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,700
Being so dramatic isn’t your style.

419
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,620
Tell me.

420
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,380
What happened?

421
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,350
Just then,

422
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,350
the girl you like asked someone

423
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,920
to question me

424
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,510
if you’re in love with someone or not.

426
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,160
Do you understand?

427
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,070
Yes.

428
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,510
Great.

429
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,100
Do you want to know what’s my answer?

430
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,600
If you want,

431
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,400
say a few compliments about me to my dad

432
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,590
when you pick up the dog today.

433
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,310
It depends on your performance.

Where’s Grandpa?

436
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,360
Don’t get me started.

437
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,690
He’s been in a bad mood

438
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,970
because of your uncle.

439
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,490
If one of you don’t make us worry,

440

You don’t have to

444
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,080
worry about me anymore.

445
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,210
I figured that you must
have some good news

446
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,770
the moment I saw you coming in.

447
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,800
Something about your relationship?

Where’s my mobile phone?

Where’s my mobile phone?

451
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,930
I have to make a call.

452
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,770
Don’t tell Mom and Dad.

453

It’s not settled yet, Grandma.

Right!

It’s a quiet environment.

for your mental damage?

Your conditions

will be used as evidence

Now I have to go back to take a rest.

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,000
I’m still worried.

516
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,080
I’m a doctor.

517
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,000
You have to listen to me now.

518
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,780
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

519
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,600
Hello, Dr. Qin.

520
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,450
Hello.

521
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,930
Hello, Dr. Qin.

522
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,540
(Who’s at the hospital tonight?)

523
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,060
(Wen Shaoqing)

524
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,360
Hello.

525
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,540
I’m on duty tonight.

526
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,410
What?

527
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,000
Zhang.

528
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,370
Help me queue up.

529
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,000
Dr. Qin, why are you here?

530
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,000
Thanks.

531
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,200
I’m sorry to bother you this late.

532
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,930
It’s fine.

533
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,250
Is your patient all right?

534
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,970
She’s fine.

535
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,780
But she needs an inspection,

536
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,730
just in case.

537
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,360
Sure.

538
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,920
Who was hurt?

539
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,890
Your family member?

540
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,170
It’s all taken care of.

541
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,320
Let’s go.

542
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,930
Is your head really okay?

543
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,170
Does it still hurt?

544
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,130
If it hurts, you have to let me know.

545
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,360
It seems all right.

546
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,210
Yes.

547
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,360
What a coincidence.

548
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,490
How did you meet each other?

549
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,000
I live next to her.

550
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,970
You moved?

551
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,290
When did this happen?

552
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:03,840
Not long ago.

553
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,800
She needs to be supervised.

554
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,730
Why hadn’t you invited us to
your housewarming party?

555
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,040
The more people, the merrier.

556
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,410
Let’s talk about this later.

557
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,740
(CT Examination Room)

558
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,080
How’s the result?

559
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,890
Do you want to eat something?

560
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,490
Is it really so serious?

561
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,360
The hindbrain connects skull
and cervical vertebra.

562
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,080
Compared with the rest of
the skull and brain,

563
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,410
the size of hindbrain is rather small.

564
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,690
If it’s hurt and bleeds,

565
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,610
it’s likely to suppress the brainstem.

566
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,560
Wait a minute.

567
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,280
I don’t understand.

568
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,730
What do you mean?

569
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,690
You have to be supervised for a night.

570
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,250
So, you have to sleep

571
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,000
under my supervision at my place tonight.

572
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,500
Supervision for a night.

573
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,610
Don’t I have to be hospitalized?

574
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,730
Why do I have to stay in your house?

575
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,610
You know well about

576
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,690
the shortage of hospital beds.

577
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,570
If you stay at my place,

578
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,730
I can send you to the hospital at once

579
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,200
if you have any discomfort.

580
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,130
If I feel ill,

581
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,300
I can go to the hospital myself.

582
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,370
I don’t need to sleep at your place.

583
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,980
When a person realizes he’s ill,

584
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,130
it’s often too late.

585
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,320
I’m the expert.

586
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,050
I can give you emergency treatment.

587
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,520
Can you do emergency treatment yourself?

588
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,650
Also,

589
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,520
Rangyirang is the culprit.

590
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,000
I need to be responsible to you.

591
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,000
And he’ll try to make you
his responsibility.

592
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,970
I can invite Zhong Zheng to my house.

593
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,360
I’ll be just fine if he watches over me.

594
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,280
Fine.

595
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,170
When you ask him to come over,

596
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,170
ask him to bring his textbooks.

597
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,810
I can highlight key points for him

598
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,280
in case he panics

599
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,360
and can’t find the information he needs

600
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,000
when he goes through

601
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,280
his thick medical books.

602
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,370
I’ve thought it over.

603
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,000
I don’t like staying
at a stranger’s house.

604
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,370
I can go to your house then.

605
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,130
What I mean is that

606
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,320
we’d better not stay at
each other’s place.

607
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,850
I don’t care.

608
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,780
I want to go home.

609
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,050
Don’t follow me.

610
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,560
I’ll take care of myself.

611
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,660
(Rang Kai Bookstore)

612
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,210
I’m sorry.

613
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,930
The renovation

614
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,170
must have caused you some disturbance.

615
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,560
This is my compensation.

616
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,820
I’m sorry.

617
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,040
The renovation will be over soon.

618
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,250
One cup for me.

619
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,650
How dare you drink liquor again?

620
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,040
Drink this.

621
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,130
I didn’t expect that

622
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,450
one day we’ll be drinking together.

623
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,130
I thought that you’ll be
forever distant and reserved.

624
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,080
When was I distant?

625
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,000
You never finish your words.

626
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,450
Or you say something I can’t understand.

627
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,520
Let me ask you.

628
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,280
Do you always speak in
such a refined manner?

629
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,080
Are you always so casual?

630
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,560
So what?

631
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,930
Do I have to be crying
all day and night?

632
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,000
Nobody cares about me if I cry.

633
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,890
Don’t your parents care about you?

634
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,200
If you ask them

635
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,250
when golden dragon seal was made,

636
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,800
they can give you a perfect answer.

637
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,160
But if you ask them which grade
their daughter is in,

638
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,280
they have no idea.

639
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,930
They threw me in the boarding school

640
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,570
and flew around the world
with Jun porcelain.

641
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,520
I don’t get to see them often.

642
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,080
I’m used to it.

643
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,020
You said you’re used to it.

644
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,250
But I think you quite take it to heart.

645
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,820
It’s a miracle that I’ve grown up healthily

646
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,820
without mental problems.

647
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,840
Right?

648
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,930
Really?

649
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,820
Do you know why I’m best friends

650
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,450
with Cong Rong?

651
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,250
When we were in Australia,

652
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,600
I lived with her.

653
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,410
Whenever I go home,

654
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,040
I can smell dinner.

655
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,760
I thought

656
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,520
that’s the smell of home.

657
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,840
Now, my parents care about me.

658
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,040
But I think

659
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,890
it’s not as good as

660
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,490
Cong Rong’s home.

661
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,890
They never spent time with us before.

662
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,560
Now they try to make up to us
in their own ways.

663
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,280
Why do the elders believe they can do
whatever they want?

664
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,600
That’s what I think.

665
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,300
Well.

666
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,970
I’ve passed the rebellion phase.

667
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,600
My parents are old too.

668
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,280
Maybe we can sit down and try to
clear the misunderstandings.

669
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,890
But why is this

670
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,650
a luxury for me?

671
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,130
They now try to blame me.

672
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,320
They say I’m unreasonable.

673
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,560
Just random chat.

674
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,520
I don’t expect you to get me.

675
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,600
I understand you.

676
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,690
A family should defend you.

677
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,600
But now it’s the knife that stabs you.

678
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,410
Right.

679
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,730
That’s what I mean.

680
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,840
A bookstore owner like you is really
good at expressing yourself.

681
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,250
Here.

682
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,690
Cheers.

683
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,500
Sir.

684
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,060
My code lock has run out of batteries.

685
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,760
Can you come and take a look?

686
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,060
Look what time it is.

687
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,800
How about tomorrow?

688
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,600
Do you have a spare key?

689
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,100
I’m the landlord.

690
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,560
I’m responsible for
the power failure of the lock.

691
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,040
To compensate you,

692
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,280
you’re welcome to sleep
at my house tonight.

693
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,450
Stay at your place?

694
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,450
Choose one. The bed or the corridor.

695
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,210
Come in.

696
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,800
Don’t you know that you’ve messed up?

697
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,160
As a punishment,

698
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,560
you won’t have any cookies today.

699
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,730
Reflect on yourself.

700
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
(Password)

701
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,730
By my guest.

702
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,800
If you’re bored,

703
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,210
you can use the Wi-Fi.

704
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,170
(Password)
These are just random numbers.

705
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,320
What?

706
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,760
There is a rule.

707
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,040
Where’s the rule?

708
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,690
How did you come up with these numbers?

709
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,130
(Password)

710
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,930
Wait.

711
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,210
Have you forgotten your own password?

712
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,410
I forgot to tell you that

713
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,170
the colon and the full stop
are both parts of the password.

714
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,930
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

715
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,650
Are you really so scared that
people hack into your Wi-Fi?

716
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,860
(Password)

717
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,760
Here.

718
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,250
Have a cup of honey passion-fruit drink.

719
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,520
It relieves thirst, clears phlegm, eases
inflammation, and relieves headache.

720
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,080
Is it really so magical?

721
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,280
It’s just the placebo effect
of sweet things.

722
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,210
Am I using its cup?

723
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,130
No.

724
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,460
You’re having nice treat.

725
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,280
But he doesn’t have any.

726
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,320
He’s upset.

727
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,690
You.

728
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,130
Stop staring at her.

729
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,250
Have you had dinner?

730
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,920
Yes.

731
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,570
I had lunch.

732
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,130
Wait a second.

733
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,860
(Brain structure)

734
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,480
Impressive!

735
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,620
(Jugular notch)

736
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,540
Listen.

737
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,250
Your reckless action has injured others,

738
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,800
which is punishable by the criminal law.

739
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,440
Since you turned in yourself willingly,

740
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,610
I’ll let it pass.

741
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,760
I won’t charge you.

742
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,880
You’re really Wen Shaoqing’s dog.

743
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,250
You really know how to push your luck.

744
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,010
Cong Rong.

745
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,250
Come here.

746
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,460
You’re truly a family man.

747
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,730
Zhou Chengcheng is correct.

748
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,530
I’ll take that as a compliment.

749
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,210
That’s the truth.

750
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,980
If I take a photo of you right now

751
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,370
and post it on the hospital’s forum,

752
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,170
many girls will be crazy for you.

753
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,730
You mean,

754
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,690
I make your heart

755
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,320
leaps?

756
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,730
If my heart doesn’t leap, I’m dead.

757
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,650
Oh.

758
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,170
Bring me the apron.

759
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,130
I mean put it on for me.

760
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,880
You’re insane.

761
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,130
Is it done?

762
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,730
It’s too late.

763
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,280
We don’t have much time to cook.

764
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,250
Just make do with this.

765
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,690
Does it want to eat this?

766
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,880
No.

767
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,570
You’re sitting on its seat.

768
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,440
Why don’t you sit next to me?

769
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,010
This is so delicious.

770
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,320
You can create a style of cooking
on your own with your skills.

771
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,480
I can advertise for you.

772
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,010
And I can get you an apprentice.

773
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,760
Is that you?

774
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,650
I’ll have to decline if it’s you.

775
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,840
Why do you look down upon me?

776
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,960
If I’ve taught you everything,

777
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,400
will you still come to eat at my house?

778
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,090
These chopsticks are pretty.

779
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,690
They’ve got carvings on them.

780
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,600
Where did you get those?

781
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,280
These are just average chopsticks
from the market.

782
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,840
But I carved them myself.

783
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,010
You can have those if you like them.

784
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,410
I’ve finished.

785
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,500
In a family, if one cooks,

786
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,480
the other one will wash the dishes.

787
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,120
Fine.

788
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,360
I’ll wash the dishes for you.

789
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,280
Who’s his family?

790
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,840
I’ve changed new sheets and
quilt cover for you.

791
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,890
This is the key.

792
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,050
If you’re worried,

793
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,280
you can lock the door from inside.

794
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,280
I’ll sleep on your bed.

795
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,050
What about you?

796
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,320
I’ll sleep here.

797
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,250
If you’re feeling dizzy or ill,

798
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,210
call me immediately.

799
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,570
It’s not right for me to
seize your room for myself.

800
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:47,880
All right.

801
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,960
Take my quilt.

802
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,170
Sleep on the coach.

803
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,530
Remember to sleep on your stomach.

804
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,480
Don’t put pressure on your injury.

805
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,610
I see.

806
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,320
Different encounters

807
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,400
nurture different relations,

808
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,920
and breed different emotions.

809
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,880
At that moment,

810
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,530
I seemed to have grasped

811
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,730
the emotions beyond
the friendship as neighbors.

812
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,650
Confused, I tried to pull it out,

813
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,610
but then I found its roots were
deeply connected to my heart beat.

814
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,250
So in that moment,

815
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,960
my heart beats with it.

816
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,880
Wen Shaoqing,

817
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,800
are you asleep?

818
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,530
I said I’ll be there for you.

819
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,570
You...

820
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,130
Do you like me?

821
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,800
Do you want to know the answer?

822
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,250
I’ll tell you.

823
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,880
Yes.

824
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,090
I like you.
