Director Yan.

32
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,020
The competition is tomorrow.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,070
But something came up at Chen Cu’s home,

34
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,940
so he can’t make it.

35
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,910
What?

36
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,220
Chen Cu can’t make it
because something came up at his home?

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,740
What should we do?

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,710
What about other doctors?

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I have asked everyone.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,150
They don’t have time.

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,660
What to do?

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,740
We lost an able member.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,950
My first debut

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
is for setting off others.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,030
If there is no other way,

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,000
the three of us...

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,580
Let Cong Rong do it.

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,830
Me?

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,510
How is it possible?

50
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,860
What?

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,430
I think you can do it.

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,870
I also think she can do it.

53
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Yeah.

54
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,310
This is a good idea.

55
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,000
Time is running out.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,390
There is no other choice.

57
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,670
It’s decided.

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,700
Cong Rong.

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,750
Ask Dr. Wen to catch you up on later.

60
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,560
We don’t need you

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,830
to win this time.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
Just play it safe.

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,990
All right.

64
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,390
Go to work.

65
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
What a bad idea did you come up with?

66
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,740
I am not a doctor.

67
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,770
I won’t do it.

68
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,520
I can’t.

69
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,640
I can. That’s all it takes.

70
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,240
Just sit there to fill the position.

71
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,140
It’s better than leaving it empty.

72
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,010
You might as well
put a teddy bear on the seat.

73
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,250
Dr. Qin.

74
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,520
Was there any team

75
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,680
of two doctors and two interns?

76
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,570
Yes.

77
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,700
Yes.

78
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,580
I mean,

79
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,010
I am fully prepared this time.

80
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,050
If we don’t win,

81
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,130
it must be Rong’s fault.

82
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,410
Yeah.

83
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,130
All my preparation is in vain.

84
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,450
I’ve decided.

85
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,680
This is my reward.

86
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,450
You need to join with me.

87
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,420
This is not rewarding you.

88
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,240
This is clearly punishing me.

89
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,610
Am I that kind of person

90
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,770
who can sit there at ease

91
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,180
without answering any questions?

92
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,050
Perfect.

93
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,760
You can ask me to teach you.

94
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,330
I’ll keep teaching you
until you learn it all.

95
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,330
Boss.

96
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,640
Rong.

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,130
I heard that Chengcheng opened
a new barbecue restaurant.

98
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,050
We can go there and learn.

99
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,170
Let’s go there together.

100
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,730
Okay.

101
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,410
<i>Burang Barbecue</i>
Chengcheng.

102
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,650
I’m hungry again.

103
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,460
Grill ten kabobs

104
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,490
and ten chicken gristle skewers for me.

105
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,570
You want more?

106
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,420
It’s all in the kitchen.

107
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,640
Make it for yourself.

108
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,850
You make it more delicious than I do.

109
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,900
Come on.

110
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,420
Some beverages for you.

111
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,970
Thank you, Chengcheng.

112
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,900
There is more in the refrigerator.

113
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,880
Get it for yourself if you want more.

114
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,880
Rong.

115
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,730
Here is the key.

116
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,090
Lock the door for me when you leave.

117
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,770
I’m going to read books.

118
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,000
I’m studious.

119
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,890
Enjoy your time.

120
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,920
Bye.

121
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,410
Rong.

122
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,700
Let me stress again.

123
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,810
Patients suffering heart failure,
pericardial effusion

124
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,680
and bronchial asthma attacks

125
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,730
are in orthopnea position.

126
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,410
Patients with dyspnea
caused by cardiopulmonary disease

127
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,970
are in fowler position.

128
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,050
Isn’t it the concave position?

129
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,900
That’s for shock patients.

130
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,620
Isn’t supine position
for shock patients?

131
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,580
What’s the position for patients
under spinal anesthesia

132
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,700
and lumbar puncture?

133
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,140
What position?

134
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,970
Gosh!

135
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,970
Who can remember that?

136
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,580
Can I quit now?

137
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,680
No way!

138
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,210
Next is the emergency
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

139
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,060
Needless to say.

140
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,090
I know this.

141
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,210
The compression frequency is 100
to 120 times per minute.

142
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,290
The depression depth
is 5 to 6 centimeters.

143
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,650
Relaxation time and compression time
each account for about 50%.

144
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,250
The bottom of the palm cannot
leave the chest wall during relaxation,

145
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,920
so as not to shift the pressing point.

146
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,650
You have rich theoretical knowledge.

147
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,160
I wonder how your actual operation is.

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,280
I learned it before.

149
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,020
Besides,

150
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,210
they won’t test me it tomorrow.

151
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,020
Then tell us about the use
of emergency equipment,

152
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,620
such as automatic external
defibrillator, electrocardiograph

153
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,610
and positive pressure respirator.

154
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,460
I fully understand the hardships
of medical staff.

155
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,090
You guys

156
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,290
are not human.

157
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,730
You are gods.

158
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,090
Take your time.

159
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,820
No hurry.

160
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,500
We also felt our way

161
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,290
to learn it.

162
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,170
All right.

163
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,560
Let’s take a break.

164
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,120
I’ll get you something to eat.

165
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,560
Cong Rong.

166
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,530
What do you want?

167
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,820
Just the noodles last time.

168
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,850
Okay.

169
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,320
Same old for me.

170
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,730
Why do you all look like
that you have a checkered past?

171
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,650
Same old for me, too.

172
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,210
Okay.

173

Write it 50 times.

174
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,650
Am I being treated badly

175
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,320
because I’m too cute?

Rong.

How do you feel about living next door

178
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,090
to my strict boss?

179

Are you suffering?

180
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,880
It’s okay.

181
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,290
Anyway, he didn’t let me
write it 50 times.

182

Hello, pot. I’m cattle.

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,060
He asked me to write.

He asked you to walk his dog.

185
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,170
We are the same.

186
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,770
In the end,

187
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,820
you are just trying
to feel less inadequate.

188

He asked you to walk his dog?

192
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,000
Just for once.

193
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,090
Your relationship is
much better now than before.

194
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,970
I thought you would be upset
about living next door to him.

195
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,730
I didn’t know him well before.

196
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,480
Look.

197
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,960
Look at this.

198
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,590
That’s how it is written.

199
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,950
That’s right.

200
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,670
Look at mine.

201
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,910
Yours is the same.

202
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,200
It’s the same.

The skull consists of 23 flat bones
and irregular bones.

205
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,920
All the bones in the skull

Only mandible and skull…

But why can’t my feet stop shaking?

I know.

Looking at you now,

it reminds me of a scene.

Challenger player with Bronze player.

236

Boss.

237

and becomes a Bronze player in the end.

Do I look like someone

who will be dragged down?

244

The air is full of anxiety here.

245

I need to go out to calm down.

Okay, that’s correct.

247

I told you that you found
the wrong person.

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,090
You said we were stealing the dog.

346
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,860
Do you have any evidence?

347
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,810
I don’t just have evidence.

348
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,440
I also suspect that you two
are not first offenders.

349
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,170
What’s in your hand?

350
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,100
Chocolate.

351
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,440
Everyone who owns a dog knows

352
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,960
that chocolate contains caffeine.

353
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,560
Caffeine can cause
permanent damage to dogs.

354
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,740
Those who use chocolate to lure the dog

355
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,960
can never be the owner.

356
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,560
There is only one possibility.

357
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,170
You want to steal the dog

358
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,720
by using poison or luring it.

359
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,850
We just bought the bog.

360
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,260
We still lack dog knowledge.

361
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,770
-Right?
-Yeah.

362
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,960
I think you lack legal knowledge!

363
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,720
According to the latest
judicial interpretation,

364
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,170
stealing public or private property
worth more than 1,000 yuan

365
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,290
can be considered as larceny.

366
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,100
If there is any previous
conviction for theft,

367
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,130
the standard amount
can be reduced by 50%.

368
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,410
This dog is worth more than 500 yuan.

369
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,680
Do you want me to keep talking?

370
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,010
How did you look after your dog?

371
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,640
Don’t you know your dog is lost?

372
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,500
If it wasn’t for me today,

373
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,680
it would become a dog meat feast.

374
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,650
This dog is quite cute.

375
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,890
Cute?

376
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,200
When you like it, you touch its head.

377
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,210
You cast it aside
when you don’t like it.

378
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,530
You are fickle

379
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,530
and changeable!

380
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,800
How can you do that to me...?

381
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,560
How can you do that to Rangyirang?

382
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,010
Rangyirang?

383
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,770
You mean it’s Rangyirang?

384
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,720
Then who is this dog in my house?

385
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,920
They... they look the same.

386
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,770
Then... This is...

387
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,770
You brought it back.

388
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,770
How could I know it?

389
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,320
Aren’t you afraid of dogs?

390
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,410
Why did you save it?

391
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,440
Are you worried about

392
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,720
my dog that much?

393
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,170
It has nothing to do
with whose dog it is.

394
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,860
This is the minimum sense of justice

395
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,090
as a lawyer.

396
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,500
So when you saved it,

397
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,170
were you threatening them
with legal means?

398
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,720
Don’t ask how I saved it.

399
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,840
What to do now?

400
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,170
I brought it back

401
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,440
because it looks like Rangyirang.

402
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,320
You should take at least
half of the responsibility.

403
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,320
I’m responsible for bringing it back.

404
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,250
You are responsible
for helping it find its owner.

405
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,170
That’s it.

406
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,130
Tonight...

407
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,010
You are not a shy dog.

408
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,080
Do I have other choice
but to be responsible for you?

409
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,370
Come in.

410
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,630
<i>Wen Shaoqing: Found the owner.
He treated me to supper.</i>

411
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,100
<i>He wants to express his thanks
to my kind and brave girlfriend.</i>

412
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,770
Who is your girlfriend?

413
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,120
No way.

414
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,400
I can’t keep flirting with him.

415
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,890
Rangyirang.

416
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,770
I’m leaving.

417
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,360
Don’t bite the sofa.

418
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,540
<i>Remember to eat breakfast.
Wen Shaoqing</i>

419
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:06,930
Sir?

420
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,970
You don’t need to prepare
breakfast for me. I’ll buy it myself.

421
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,970
Thank you, sir.

422
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,770
What’s wrong with her again?

423
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,600
-Morning!
-Morning!

424
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,400
Have you heard?

425
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,160
We got an incentive fund

426
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,100
for winning the championship this time.

427
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,080
We can go out and have some fun.

428
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,530
That’s good.

429
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,530
Where do you girls

430
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,690
like to go?

431
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,140
Anywhere is fine.

432
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,970
I’m not picky.

433
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,210
Does it concern you?

434
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,770
Drop the ball at the last minute.

435
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,050
You’re back.

436
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,400
Have you finished your family affairs?

437
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,050
Yeah.

438
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,010
Listen,

439
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,170
I won’t steal the fruits
of your victory.

440
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,970
I’ll take my family member
at my own expense.

441
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,640
Can I?

442
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,400
You can.

443
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,010
For the sake of Sanbao,

444
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,560
I’ll reluctantly count you in.

445
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,560
Rong.

446
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,170
Sorry.

447
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,400
I sent the photo of us four to my mom.

448
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,320
Are you tired of being alive?

449
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,840
You are exposing me!

450
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,210
I blurred you out.

451
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,770
Your sex is hard to tell.

452
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,640
Then why did you say sorry to me?

453
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,400
My mother believes
that I blurred my girlfriend.

454
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,130
So she sent it to your mother.

455
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,970
After your mother knew

456
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,960
that even I have a girlfriend,

457
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,580
naturally,

458
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,560
she is aiming at you.

459
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,860
What did you say?

460
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,050
What should I say?

461
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,060
Just say,
“According to medical evidence,

462
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,650
minding one’s own business

463
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,770
can boost longevity.”

464
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,140
Then I’ll be really
tired of being alive.

465
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,010
You are impressive.

466
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,010
I can’t figure it out.

467
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,060
How did you win

468
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,730
without me?

469
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,800
We won because you weren’t there.

470
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,300
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital Cong Rong</i>

471
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,210
These three swordsmen

472
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,120
can directly form a group
and make a debut.

473
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,560
They make such a good team.

474
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,930
Right?

475
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,320
You got a bunch of couples to support.

476
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,360
Pay more attention to work!

477
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,800
Zhong Zhen.

478
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,090
Hurry up.

479
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,800
Coming!

480
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,290
Let’s go, Rong.

481
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,290
Boss, thank you.

482
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,530
Morning, Cong Rong!

483
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,240
Morning, everyone!

484
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,930
Morning!

485
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:32,880
Morning!

486
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,690
Morning!

487
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,620
You should know
about the incentive fund.

488
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,930
How do you plan to use the money?

489
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,170
Why don’t we

490
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,140
go camping?

491
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,450
We have been talking about it for years.

492
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,250
Good.

493
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,860
I remember we went camping

494
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,770
every year when we were at school.

495
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,900
After we came to Yun Ji,

496
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,160
we just lost the tradition.

497
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,050
How is it, Wen Shaoqing?

498
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,360
Good.

499
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,320
We can make a shift.

500
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,610
Let’s take a break for a few days.

501
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah.

502
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,160
What do you think?

503
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,320
Me?

504
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,360
Is my opinion that important?

505
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,000
Then I’ll make my precious vote.

506
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,160
I listen to you.

507
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Since it passed unanimously,

508
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,560
my task is finished.

509
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,050
I’ll report it to Director Yan.

510
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,450
That’s it.

511
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,690
Let me know the time.

512
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,130
I’m leaving.

513
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,530
I’m leaving, too. Boss.

514
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,880
Come over.

515
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,290
I have something to ask you.

516
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,880
Are you mad at me?

517
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,160
No.

518
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,080
Why should I be mad at you?

519
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,010
What does the note you posted

520
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,200
on your door this morning mean?

521
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,690
The literal meaning.

522
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,560
You don’t need to bring me
breakfast anymore.

523
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,880
Didn’t you still enjoy it
a few days ago?

524
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,210
You were also picky
about my cooking skills.

525
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,900
I don’t think there is any reason for me

526
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,450
to keep troubling my colleague.

527
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,600
We are just colleagues?

528
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,120
Also neighbors.

529
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,110
We are just neighbors?

530
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,870
Dr. Wen.

531
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,300
What else can we be

532
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,070
except for colleagues and neighbors?

533
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,780
We are...

534
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,590
I remember.

535
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,980
I’m also your dog sitter.

536
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,740
Don’t forget to give me the money.

537
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,500
Why do you talk glibly today?

538
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,150
You’ve done all the talking.

539
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,270
Is there anything else?

540
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,300
If not, I should leave.

541
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,950
Yes.

542
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,430
About camping.

543
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,060
Sorry.

544
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,020
I forgot to tell you.

545
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,190
Your camping

546
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,870
doesn’t seem to have much to do with me.

547
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,260
I’m not going.

548
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,430
You have the money.

549
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,540
You have to go.

550
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,190
Not anymore.

551
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,540
Well done.

552
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,190
I didn’t lose.

553
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,750
Good morning!

554
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,430
Good morning!

555
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,700
Dr. Wen.

556
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,710
I heard that you got a bonus
from the hospital.

557
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,540
What is it?

558
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,220
My contrarian.

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,950
It’s full!

560
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,550
What are you thinking about?

561
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,300
You seem absent-minded.

562
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,670
I’m thinking...

563
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,980
I’m thinking about Wen Shaoqing.

564
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,040
Wen Shaoqing?

565
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,350
Did he take you to a consultation again?

566
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,350
Do you think I have been

567
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,740
too Buddha-like these years?

568
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,260
Too Buddha-like?

569
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,700
You mean private affairs?

570
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,350
Yeah.

571
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,150
My god.

572
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,040
You finally came through.

573
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,300
You are not too Buddha-like.

574
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,220
You are the Buddha himself.

575
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,630
Don’t exaggerate it.

576
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,670
I’m not exaggerating it at all.

577
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,740
Do you know what you two look like?

578
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,470
You two are like

579
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,300
the golden boy and jade girl
posted on the door during festival.

580
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,590
You two respect each other like guests.
You are going to

581
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,060
standing there still for eternity.

582
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,740
What if I take a step forward?

583
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,260
I’ll applaud and scatter flowers
for you!

584
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,270
The long story I’ve been
following my whole life

585
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,740
is finally over!

586
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,720
<i>Burang Barbecue</i>

-Hello, come in and take a look.

588
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Don’t miss such a good chance.

589
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,510
Burang Barbecue,

590
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,830
the barbecue that won’t let you down!

591
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,150
Miss, do you want some barbecue?

592
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,700
Our barbecue can make you
become more beautiful.

593
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,000
Uncle, Aunt.

594
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Do you want some barbecue?

595
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,590
Come in.

596
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,630
Come in and have a taste.

597
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,340
-No need.
-You’ll find a boyfriend

598
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,380
and become more beautiful
after having our barbecue.

599
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,390
Do you want some barbecue?

600
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,140
You can find a girlfriend
after having our barbecue.

601
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,870
No, thanks.

602
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,670
Thank you for your support.

603
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,300
Remember to

604
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,190
bring your mom and dad here next time.

605
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,150
It won’t work in this way.

<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

<i>Carnegie</i>

608
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,260
How is it?

609
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,300
Is it tasteful?

610
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,980
It’s okay.

611
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,960
Try something else.

612
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,350
Give me some specific suggestions.

613
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,150
Potatoes are slightly salty.

614
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,950
Duck heart is overcooked.

615
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,390
In general,

616
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,520
there is room for improvement.

617
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,860
Is there any room in your stomach?

618
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,630
I’m full.

619
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,260
Good.

620
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,110
Ten sticks in total.

621
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,980
It’s 30 yuan.

Zhou Chengcheng.

623
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,350
I am your strategist.

624
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,990
That’s the price for the strategist.

625
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,350
It’s the opening sale today.

626
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,460
I have given you a discount.

627
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,300
I see.

628
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,260
You are doing business by defrauding.

629
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,980
I have no other choice.

630
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,000
If my business were doing better,

631
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,110
I wouldn’t do such a thing.

632
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,830
Do you know why your business
is not good?

633
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,540
Small shop front?

634
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,110
No.

635
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,720
Poor location?

636
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,540
No.

637
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,910
Then why?

638
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,150
Because you lack marketing thinking.

639
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,350
You can’t just sell barbecue.

640
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,590
You should sell feelings and stories.

641
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,780
There is no story

642
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,020
for your barbecue.

643
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,150
I just sell barbecue.

644
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,860
What story can I have?

645
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,020
Let me make an example for you.

646
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,350
Like the diamond.

647
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,110
Its composition is the same as carbon.

648
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,060
Why is it so expensive?

649
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,150
Because it has a story?

650
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,390
A diamond

651
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,980
is forever.

652
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,720
What they sell is not the ingredient,

653
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,430
but a love story.

654
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,500
It seems to make sense.

655
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,550
But

656
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,980
what story can I sell for barbecue?

657
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,060
Come on.

658
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,380
<i>Story</i>
Take this book back and read it.

659
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,550
The godfather-like screenwriter
of Hollywood

660
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,830
will teach you how to tell a good story.

661
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,780
Really?

662
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,440
This is good. This is good.

663
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,270
You need to look at the big picture

664
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,300
when you do business.

665
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,830
Learn a little about economics.

666
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,950
Take “The Wealth of Nations”?

667
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,950
It’s the first time I feel
that doing business

668
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,830
is such a complex thing.

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,990
I’ll take another book.

670
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,630
No problem.

671
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,500
Take any book as you want.

672
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,390
This one is good.

673
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,350
It doesn’t have many words.

674
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,520
If I’m tired of reading these two books,

675
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,110
I can read this one to relax.

676
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,870
Subtract 30,

677
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,140
just give me 50.

678
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,520
Okay.

679
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,430
How to pay it?

680
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,820
<i>WeChat Alipay</i>

681
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,440
I’ve transferred the money.

682
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,500
I’ll go back now.

683
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,150
Enjoy the food.

684
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,950
Bye.

685
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,480
Boss.

686
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,430
Didn’t you go to sell barbecue?

687
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,950
Yeah.

688
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,630
Why did I buy three books instead?

689
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,790
He taught me about marketing.

690
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,220
He doesn’t have customers, either.

691
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,390
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

692
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,150
Wen Rang!

693
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,220
Wen Rang!

694
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,470
You are a fraud!

695
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,040
You swindled money from me

696
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,300
and brainwashed me.
Now you are hiding inside.

697
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,780
Give my money back!

698
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,800
Once sold,

699
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,780
not refundable.

700
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,460
Come again if you want to buy books.

701
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,430
You...!

702
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,700
Welcome.

703
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,390
Hello!

704
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,350
What do you want to eat?

705
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,980
It’s you.

706
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,460
Where’s Cong Rong?

707
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,870
I want to ask you a favor.

708
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,550
Rong.

709
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,870
Did you hear me?

710
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,720
Please.

711
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,270
Rong.

712
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,550
Just help me.

713
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,300
This is the only big order

714
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,340
since I opened the restaurant.

715
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,760
How can I reject it?

716
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
The survival of the restaurant

717
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,270
depends on this final fight.

718
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,830
Take the order.

719
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,590
Don’t worry about me.

720
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,300
Didn’t Wen Shaoqing sign
a contract with you?

721
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,460
It’s just that I also counted you in.

722
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,110
What does that mean?

723
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,790
Look.

724
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,740
This is the contract.

725
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,260
Camping Catering Contract.

726
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,670
Additional terms.

727
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,670
The order is void

728
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,870
if Cong Rong doesn’t come.

729
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,070
I’ve been supporting you so much,

730
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,680
and you just sold me out
in a blink of an eye.

731
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,750
What a traitor!

732
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,480
I have nothing to lose.

733
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,020
I also extorted a worker.

734
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,350
Rong, please help me.

735
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,540
Look, I bought all the ingredients.

736
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,150
It cost me a lot of money.

737
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,150
If I don’t take this order,

738
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,520
I won’t be able to sell these things.

739
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,700
Then my business will fail.

740
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,950
Will you support me at that time?

741
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,460
It’s not impossible.

742
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,630
Okay then.

743
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,870
That’s it.

744
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,430
When you hate me one day

745
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,910
and abandon me,

746
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,190
I will become a nonviable fowl

747
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,430
which is released into the wild.

748
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,980
I can only wait for my death.

749
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,990
All right.

750
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,060
You always have all these reasons.

751
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,000
I’ll go.

752
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,950
Really?

753
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,590
You are the best!

754
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,910
Mua!

755
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,220
Did Wen Shaoqing tell you

756
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,300
why I had to go?

757
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,300
Yeah.

758
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,870
Why?

759
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,110
He said you also made
a contribution to win the contest.

760
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,110
He is trying to be fair.

761
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,830
That’s it?

762
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,670
That’s it.

763
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,950
Trying to be fair.

764
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,870
Right?

765
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,670
I also think his reason
is particularly untenable.

766
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,740
Do you think he is playing hard to get?

767
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,020
Hard to get?

768
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,300
Why is he the only one who can play it?

769
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,980
What?

770
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,830
Bomb!

771
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,380
Qin Chu.

772
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,670
Let’s settle it quickly.

773
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,270
Come on!

774
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,430
Why is there another bomb?

775
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,350
I’m not playing.

776
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,300
Dear.

777
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,630
How long will we be there?

778
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,780
About two hours later.

779
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,220
That long?

780
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,270
We’ll be there soon.

781
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,430
Play with them for a while.

782
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,200
Chengcheng won’t play.

783
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,980
My nephew.

784
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,670
Try to remember

785
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,590
what you told me last night.

786
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,150
I said we came out to relax.

787
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,150
I didn’t say how many people
there would be.

788
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,150
Well done.

789
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,190
Are you unwilling?

790
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,150
If so, it’s not too late to get off now.

791
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,540
No way.

792
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,630
He is my free worker.

793
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,190
Peel this for me.

794
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,520
Why can you order me?

795
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,700
Because I know some information.

796
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,870
If you don’t peel it for me,

797
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,110
I’ll tell his grandma

798
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,480
that I’m your girlfriend

799
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,630
and I want to marry you.

800
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,220
A wise man knows when to give in.

801
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,020
Peel it well.

802
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:57,830
Come on.

803
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,590
Go on.

804
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,540
I don’t believe it.

805
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,870
You want to play again?

806
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,500
Yeah.

807
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,020
Come on. I’ll reshuffle the cards.

808
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,950
Come on.

809
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,060
Here we are!

810
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,190
We are finally here!

811
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,310
It’s so beautiful!

812
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,910
It’s so beautiful!

813
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,700
We arrived earlier than expected.

814
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,910
Be careful.

815
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,630
Sorry.

816
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,390
It’s okay.

817
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,190
You must be Sanbao.

818
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,520
I haven’t introduced myself.

819
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,220
My name is Cong Rong.

820
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,260
Hello.

821
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,680
Actually, I knew you a long time ago.

822
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,550
You knew me?

823
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,110
Yeah.

824
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,540
The rumors about you and my alumnus

825
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,040
were bubbling with noise
in the hospital a few days ago.

826
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,480
Our department even heard about it.

827
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,380
Alumnus?

828
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,000
Who?

829
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,870
Wen Shaoqing.

830
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,110
We share the same major.

831
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,270
If it wasn’t for Chen Cu
to pursue me stubbornly...

832
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,910
If it weren’t for me
to purse you stubbornly,

833
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,310
would you be so happy now?

834
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,310
We’ve been married for years,

835
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,340
and you are still missing your alumnus.

836
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,950
Let’s go.

837
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,480
But...

838
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,500
I...

839
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,510
Your man has good luck with women.

840
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,390
My man?

841
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,660
What does he have to do with me?

842
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,300
I’ll say a few words.

843
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,790
Our plan is casual today.

844
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,600
We’ll set up

845
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,870
the camp first.

846
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,100
Change our clothes.

847
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,100
And we will eat barbecue
at night after we get tired.

848
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,080
By the way, the food is provided

849
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,200
by Burang Barbecue.

850
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,950
Thank you, Chengcheng!

851
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,630
Thank you, guys!

852
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,910
I’d appreciate your help!

853
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,870
Let me take this for you.

854
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,710
Let’s go together.

855
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,560
Chengcheng.

856
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,060
Let’s go.

857
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,640
Let’s go!

858
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,350
Rang!

859
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,910
I can’t wait.

860
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,500
Let me help you.

861
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,120
No need.

862
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,870
I can do it myself.

863
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,030
I think we’ve been here before
during college.

864
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,070
Do you still remember?

865
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,830
I remember.

866
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,420
We were planning
to see the sunrise together.

867
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,670
But we didn’t see the sunrise

868
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,100
and were blown back by the storm.

869
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,560
I remember it.

870
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
Shaoqing gave
all the umbrellas and rain capes

871
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,270
to us girls that time.

872
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,870
Only you

873
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,060
left without us.

874
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,350
I was looking for umbrellas.

875
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:21,720
Besides,

876
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,160
he gave them to Qin Chu.

877
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,460
What does that have to do with you?

878
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,710
I didn’t.

879
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,660
I treated everyone equally.

880
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,980
It hurts. It’s going to break.

881
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,060
Cooperate with me.

882
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,150
Chengcheng.

883
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,600
Last time you posted marriage
advertisement on the forum for me.

884
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,640
There are quite a lot of replies.

885
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,950
I want to pick some nice guys
and meet them.

886
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,750
There was still no reply yesterday,
right?

887
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,340
Yeah.

888
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,120
I told you that you should
go on a blind date.

889
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,990
I think that PhD in Finance is good.

890
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,640
He even gave up the green card for you.

891
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,350
Just give him a chance.

892
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,660
I feel the same way.

893
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,310
I think

894
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,680
he is basically perfect.

895
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,710
He is handsome.

896
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,680
He has a good body.

897
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,750
And he is rich.

898
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,080
That racecourse...

899
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,720
Enough, enough.

900
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,380
It’s too much.

901
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:07,980
It’s too much.

902
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,910
Anyway, I agree to this marriage.

903
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,140
What are you talking about

904
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,230
that makes you so happy?

905
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,870
It’s a secret between us girls.

906
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,950
Yeah.

907
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,910
I’m running!

908
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,310
Come on, release it!

909
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,200
I will release it!

910
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,310
Release it when there is wind.

911
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,540
Three, two!

912
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,180
No one flies a kite like you did.

913
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,680
In this way.

914
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,430
Put it upright. Come on.

915
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,180
Get ready.

916
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,310
You need to drag it!

917
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,710
It’s so comfortable.

918
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,540
How long has it been
since we took a vacation together?

919
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,830
A long time.

920
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,390
Do you think

921
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,350
Shaoqing is interested in Cong Rong?

922
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,910
No way.

923
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,910
You are too insensitive.

924
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,140
I vote for them.

925
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,640
Rong.

926
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,310
Look.

927
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,620
Our kite is flying the highest.

928
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
That’s not our kite.

929
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,180
The one below it is ours.

930
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,230
Yeah?

931
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,500
Shaoqing and Qin Chu.

932
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,580
They are still so in tune
outside the operating room.

933
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,270
I don’t think we have
much of a chance to win.

934
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,140
I’ll go to sleep in the tent
for a while.

935
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,310
When I flew a kite before,

936
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,830
I always wanted to fly it high and far.

937
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,430
I feel different now.

938
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,140
Now I want to pull it back

939
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,230
and get it to myself.

940
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,600
This kite is stable now.

941
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,460
Hold it.

942
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,790
Are you really going to
go on a blind date?

943
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,500
Yeah.

944
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,310
I’m not that young.

945
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,990
If you have any suitable candidate,

946
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,180
you can also introduce him to me.

947
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,950
Do you have any specific requirements?

948
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,140
How about using me as a reference?

949
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,870
In terms of appearance,

950
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,180
you are not bad.

951
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,100
What about economic conditions?

952
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,310
Can it work without a racecourse?

953
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,990
I have no rigid requirement
in this regard.

954
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,350
I value the inner more.

955
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,620
Tell me about it.

956
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,860
He has to be simple

957
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,830
and devoted.

958
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,070
It’s best not to be too popular

959
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,020
and have close lady friends everywhere.

960
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,270
Why are you smiling?

961
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,100
You don’t have a blind date at all.

962
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,790
You are just jealous.

963
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,720
You are jealous!

964
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,800
What does it matter to you
whether I go on a blind date or not?

965
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,910
Why do you care so much?

966
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,270
Your kite is going to fall down.

967
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,310
What?

968
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:53,384
