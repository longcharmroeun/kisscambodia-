30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,270
Wen Shaoqing,

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,100
do you

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,020
like me?

33
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,620
Do you want the answer?

34
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,340
Let me tell you.

35
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,580
Yes.

36
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,830
I like you.

37
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,300
My god!

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,180
Why did I have such a dream?

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,510
I have to find someone to open the lock.

40
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,340
You get up early.

41
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,660
Yeah, I have to go to work.

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,550
Just in time.

43
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,710
I’ve called customer service for you.

44
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,780
I’ve fixed the lock, too.

45
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,150
The password is your birthday.

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,150
Thank you.

47
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
The password is wrong.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,020
You gave me the wrong...

49
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,780
You’re acting like you have a syndrome.

50
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,190
What is that?

51
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,630
Do you want the answer?

52
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,830
Let me tell you.

53
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,310
Yes.

54
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,630
I like you.

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,270
Sleep deprivation syndrome.

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Thanks for taking me in last night.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,020
I have to wash up and go to work.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,340
He didn’t notice my messy hair, did he?

59
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,020
And the scar on my head.

60
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,900
It’s ugly.

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,340
Why would I care about him?

62
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,900
Calm down.

63
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,620
It was just a dream.

64
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,630
It was just a dream.

65
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,470
What else can I do for you?

66
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,550
After I opened the lock,

67
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,830
I found that your fridge was empty.

68
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,980
There was nothing in it.

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,510
So I bought some food for you.

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,660
No need to thank me.

71
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,430
You come over

72
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,420
to make me breakfast
on the early morning?

73
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,100
Didn’t you say
I made terrible breakfast?

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,830
I made a little improvement.

75
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,540
Try it again.

76
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,070
What would you like tomorrow?

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,270
Tomorrow?

78
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Don’t bother.

79
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,900
I’ll make my own breakfast tomorrow.

80
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,070
What do you usually have for breakfast?

81
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,060
Eggs.

82
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,830
Milk.

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,950
That’s all?

84
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,600
I’m in a hurry in the morning.

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,020
There’s no need to make a big breakfast.

86
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,780
Why don’t you consider

87
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,220
to have breakfast with me?

88
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,270
It’s easy for you to say.

89
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,820
You make a big breakfast every day.

90
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,660
Who is supposed to do the dishes,

91
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,820
wash the pans

92
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,630
and do the washing-up?

93
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,150
All you have to do is eating.

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,100
How much does it cost per month?

95
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,580
Dr. Wen.

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,660
Name your price.

97
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,020
How much does the chef charge?

98
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,310
How much does the food cost?

99
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Name a price per day.

100
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,460
I won’t take advantage of you.

101
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,660
Do I look like a breakfast seller?

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,190
It’s better to make it clear,

103
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,020
otherwise, people would think we...

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,510
We?

105
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,100
Think that I take advantage of you.

106
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,830
That’s a deal.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,580
You buy ingredients from now on.

108
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,020
I make breakfast.

109
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,150
Okay.

110
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,980
Let’s eat.

111
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,150
I usually take this seat.

112
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,070
I’m not used to other spots.

113
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,390
Good choice.

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,660
It’s more comfortable to sit here.

115
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,120
It’s more fun to eat together

116
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,540
than to eat alone.

117
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,590
It’s nice for us

118
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,470
to be together.

119
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,780
I didn’t agree to be with you.

120
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,470
Didn’t you just agree
to have breakfast with me?

121
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,390
Are you going back on your word?

122
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,590
I almost forgot an important thing.

123
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,060
What are you doing?

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,940
Just touch your head.

125
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,540
Why do you touch my head?

126
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,870
I’m not Rangyirang.

127
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,470
Let me see if the swelling is reduced.

128
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,700
It’s a normal follow-up.

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
Then, you can just watch it.

130
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,630
You don’t have to touch it.

131
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,420
Did you see it clearly?

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,990
I’m fine now.

133
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,230
End of the follow-up.

134
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,700
I feel that you’re nervous.

135
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,150
I’m not nervous.

136
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,780
I’m not.

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,270
No.

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,200
From the early morning till now,

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,020
your behavior has been weird.

140
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,150
When you grabbed my hand just now,

141
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,420
your hand was sweating
and your heart beat faster.

142
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,150
Wasn’t it nervous?

143
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,990
I’m in weak health.

144
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,020
Weak health.

145
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,150
Then why didn’t you dare to look at me?

146
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,350
I did.

147
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,820
Then why do you lean back?

148
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,110
Dr. Wen.

149
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,380
You’ll be late for work
if you don’t leave now.

150
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,590
Is there any chance

151
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,470
that you’ve fallen in love with me?

152
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

153
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,630
How could I possibly like you?

154
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,470
Do you know the five stages of love?

155
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,870
Most patients will

156
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,780
go through five psychological phases

157
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,750
when they face their illness.

158
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,020
Just like you don’t accept of loving me,

159
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,300
now you’re going through
the first phase,

160
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,470
denial.

161
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,270
If you talk nonsense again,

162
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,240
I’ll drive you out!

163
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh, look.

164
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,350
Now it comes the second phase.

165
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,420
Anger.

166
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,150
All right.

167
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,350
Forget what I said.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I withdraw my words.

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,870
The third phase,

170
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,590
compromise and expectation.

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,470
If it goes on like this,

172
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,000
I think you’ll soon

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,630
go through the fourth phase.

174
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,390
Being jealous.

175
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,150
Wen Shaoqing!

176
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,540
As for the fifth phase,

177
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,900
I’ll tell you later.

178
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,150
Got to go to work.

179
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,870
See you later.

180
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,630
No.

181
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,630
I’m a good talker usually.

182
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,180
How did I become dumb
at the crucial moment?

183
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,470
Hello?

184
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,700
Don’t you think we eat too much
in the morning?

185
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,270
I’m exhausted.

186
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,300
I just find

187
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,380
that only by worrying
about the restaurant,

188
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,540
can I truly feel that it belongs to me.

189
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,750
Your level of awareness has improved.

190
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,390
Congratulations.

191
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,270
You’ve become a bourgeoise from now on.

192
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,780
That’s true.

193
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,660
I’ll make a reservation.

194
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,870
I want 100 kabobs.

195
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,110
OK.

196
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,750
Yesterday, you

197
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,900
just said half of it on the phone.

198
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,030
You and Wen Shaoqing...

199
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,870
It flashes upon me

200
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,270
that if I could borrow your concealer.

201
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,870
Concealer?

202
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
What do you use it for?

203
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,510
There’s a scar on my head

204
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,710
from a fall in my childhood.

205
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,390
Look.

206
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,900
It’s not a big deal.

207
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,940
I fell with Chubby then.

208
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,620
I don’t know how he is doing now.

209
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,940
I kind of miss him.

210
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,000
Chubby.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,820
Chubby.

212
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,230
You mentioned him a lot
when we were in college.

213
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,190
Now you are back.

214
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,540
Have you ever thought of contacting him?

215
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,510
Fatties have great potential.

216
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,780
Haven’t you heard that?

217
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,790
What if he grows up

218
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,110
and becomes a handsome guy?

219
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,300
I don’t think so.

220
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,270
Peng Yuyan is a living example.

221
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,900
I’ll help you to look for him.

222
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,350
He may be right for me

223
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,620
if he isn’t right for you.

224
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,150
Fine.

225
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,940
You look for him.

226
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,820
Boss,

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,720
you need to sign these medical records.

228
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,390
Yeah.

229
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,320
What are you looking at?

230
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,180
You’re engrossed.

231
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,300
Brain CT.

232
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,470
Whose brain CT?

233
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,720
<i>Outpatient Medical Records</i>

234
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,510
Your cousin’s.

235
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,900
My cousin’s?

236
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,230
What happened to her?

237
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,020
Is there anything wrong with her brain?

238
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,780
From the medical point of view,

239
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,110
there isn’t.

240
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,110
She has quite a beautiful skull.

241
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,180
Nice skeleton.

242
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,940
She inherited the good gene
of our family.

243
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,270
But since there’s no problem,

244
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,990
why do you study it?

245
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,200
I just want to see

246
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,940
what is on her mind.

247
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,470
My behavior is evident enough.

248
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,470
Why doesn’t she get it?

249
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,110
Nothing.

250
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,020
Why did Rong take brain CT?

251
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,020
It’s nothing.

252
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,350
She hit the back of her head

253
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,350
and had an examination.

254
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,470
Was Rong hurt?

255
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,780
How did it happen?

256
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,240
Why did you know that

257
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,230
and I didn’t know?

258
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,600
Why can’t I know a thing

259
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,990
that you don’t know?

260
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,000
I know Rong best

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,230
in the world.

262
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,110
Do you?

263
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,420
Yeah.

264
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,700
Fine.

265
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,660
Tell me how Cong Rong got hurt.

266
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
Didn’t you say her head got hit?

267
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,350
Was it serious?

268
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,630
Didn’t you say it was nothing?

269
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,540
Protecting and respecting
patients’ privacy

270
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,990
are important contents
of clinical medical ethics.

271
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,510
How could you tell me

272
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,840
a patient’s privacy carelessly?

273
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,750
You just asked me.

274
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,020
Is that an excuse
to reveal patients’ privacy?

275
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,180
Copy Medical Ethics with your hands.

276
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,660
Give it to me this week.

277
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,960
<i>Doctor-patient Relationship
and Legal Liability</i>

278
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,060
That’s weird.

279
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,420
Why can’t the thermos keep water warm?

280
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,060
Dr. Wen.

281
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,990
I’m going to look for him.

282
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,700
Did I mention Dr. Wen?

283
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,590
Come in.

284
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,060
What is it?

285
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,350
Olive oil.

286
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,940
It’s rich in Omega-3,
Vitamin D and Vitamin E.

287
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,870
It’s helpful to the recovery
of brain injury,

288
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,700
and it can delay cognitive decline.

289
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,110
It’s given by the hospital.

290
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,070
It suits you.

291
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,900
I think

292
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,020
you need it more than I do now.

293
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,630
The contest approaches.

294
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,590
You need some brain food.

295
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,390
By the way,

296
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,300
our doctor-patient relationship
is terminated.

297
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,820
Our teacher-student relationship
begins now.

298
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,300
You’re well prepared.

299
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,230
I’m your teacher from now on.

300
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,700
Please show me some respect,

301
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,080
otherwise, I’ll punish you for copying.

302
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,550
Yes.

303
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,150
Cong...

304
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,900
Teacher.

305
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,820
As my teacher,

306
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,660
should you answer my questions
anytime, anywhere?

307
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,360
OK.

308
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,590
Then I got a question now.

309
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,230
Look,

310
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,830
it says doctor-patient resources here.

311
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
<i>Dr. Liu</i>

312
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,500
Hello?

313
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,700
Got it.

314
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,590
By the way,

315
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,870
do you mind coming with me

316
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,260
to answer my questions?

317
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,940
How do you feel after the operation?

318
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,590
Much better.

319
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,180
Do you feel any discomfort in your head?

320
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
Nothing serious.

321
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,270
I just feel a little dizzy.

322
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,180
A little dizzy?

323
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,310
It’s a bit numb
in the back of my head.

324
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,070
Numb?

325
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,030
He’s quite handsome.

326
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,460
No wonder the nurses
are crazy about him.

327
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,110
No. I’m his teacher.

328
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,030
Why should I stay here waiting for him?

329
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,510
Since you’re busy,

330
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,310
I’d better highlight
the key points for you.

331

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,870
I’m about to look for you.

You’re in good mood.

340

Someone is eager to learn.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,870
It makes me pleased.

342
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,310

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,590
feel free to ask me on WeChat.

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,700
Thank you.

346
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,500
You’re in good mood, too.

347
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,590
Not bad.

348
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,980
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

349
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,150
Can I help you?

350
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,830
Wen Rang,

351
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,070
don’t you think

352
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,660
by taking only 200 steps every day,

353
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,180
you’re lacking in exercise?

354
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,220
I don’t.

355
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,260
Do you want to win the first place
in taking steps in your WeChat Moments?

356
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,240
No.

357
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,030
You don’t want it
because you’re always the last one.

358
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,300
If I have a way to let you be the first,

359
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,700
are you interested in it or not?

360
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,180
I know the way.

361
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,870
Isn’t it to unfriend all of you?

362
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,960
How could you?

363
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,920
You’re so boring.

364
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,790
You don’t respond to any jokes.

365
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,830
What can I say?

366
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,790
Just be straightforward.

367
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,180
I need you to keep my courage up.

368
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,590
No.

369
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,500
Here it is.

370
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,460
What’s this?

371
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,980
Sticks?

372
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,510
This is licorice root
used in pastries and preserves.

373
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,830
You don’t need it for kabobs.

374
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,660
Isn’t it a spice stand?

375
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,110
Why do they sell vegetables?

376
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,460
These are perilla leaves.

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,150
You know quite a lot.

378
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,350
Don’t you come to buy ingredients?

379
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,270
If you continue to waste time,

380
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,070
I won’t do you the favor for free.

381
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,030
Here. Here. Here.

383
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,900
Here. Here. Here.

384
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,070
Miss.

385
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,910
What do you want?

386
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,590
Sir,

387
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,660
can I use this to grind chili powder?

388
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Do you use it for daily cooking?

389
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,790
I run a restaurant.

390
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,900
A restaurant?

391
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,510
A restaurant.

392
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,640
Tell you what,

393
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,340
the chili is cheap

394
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,780
and its powder is delicious.

395
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,790
It saves you money.

396
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,740
Does it?

397
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,590
Great.

398
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,640
I’ll buy 2.5 kg.

399
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,220
2.5 kg.

400
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,390
Alright. Alright.

401
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,920
Let me get you a bag.

402
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,940
Do you have too much money to waste?

403
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,110
What do you mean?

404
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,110
Didn’t you ask me to embolden you?

405
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,200
If you can’t wait
to present the details,

406
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,110
how can I help you?

407
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,880
Stand by me.

408
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,350
I just need you to act.

409
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,160
Aren’t you like me?

410
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,310
With half-baked knowledge,

411
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,220
how much do you know?

412
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,830
Do you know
what a person like you is called?

413
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,150
A sucker.

414
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,460
Sir.

415
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,070
The chili gets such strong smell.

416
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,830
It’s all cracked.

417
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,980
I suppose it’s been here for long
and nobody wants it.

418
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,420
That’s not true.

419
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,630
If you think it smells strong,

420
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,230
I’ll show you another one.

421
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,260
Look, which pepper would you like?

422
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,430
I want 1.5 kg of red cluster pepper.

423
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,110
A little less of the long chili.

424
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,870
1 kg.

425
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,310
But for the chili that is soft

426
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,000
and cracked,

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,880
I don’t want any of that.

428
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,950
My restaurant is run with integrity.

429
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,980
OK. OK. OK.

430
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,150
Look.

431
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,590
What?

432
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,700
I know nothing about it anyway.

433
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,870
Yet you must act.

434
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,200
You must pretend to be a specialist

435
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,980
if you don’t want to be fooled.

436
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Put all those back in.

437
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,980
And I don’t want these.

438
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,110
These are really delicious.

439
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,480
I don’t want these.

440
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,470
I said I didn’t want these.

441
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,390
Fine. Fine.

442
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,110
Why?

443
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,030
Be smart while you’re shopping.

444
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,950
Those that are taken out by the owner

445
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,460
are usually in sufficient quantity
and good quality.

446
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,660
You’re good.

447
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,830
Come on.

448
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,390
Let me help.

449
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Thank you.

450
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,980
I’ll scan your QR code.

451
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,110
OK.

452
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,920
The money is paid.

453
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,790
Alright. Alright.

454
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,740
Welcome to come again.

455
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,310
Welcome to come again.

456
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,030
Thank you, sir.

457
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,720
Thanks to my keen intuition,

458
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,750
I find a good helper.

459
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,260
You’ve got a wealth of experience.

460
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,550
Where did you learn that?

461
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,500
Why don’t you teach me?

462
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,550
Let me get trained.

463
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,660
Next time I won’t need your help.

464
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,830
Nothing else.

465
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,350
Dexterity comes by experience.

466
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,420
What’s that?

467
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,150
Dexter?

468
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,310
Be cheated more times,

469
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,630
and you’ll get experienced.

470
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,350
Hot!

471
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,070
Would you like to try?

472
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,030
It’s really hot.

473
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,180
Refreshing and inspiring.

474
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,590
So hot.

475
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,150
It’s really refreshing

476
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,420
and a necessity for staying up late.

477
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,220
I don’t believe you.

478
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,790
Why don’t you try one of these?

479
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,460
I don’t think you can bear it.

480
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,150
It’s not as hot as the last one.

481
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,700
Keep the mere trifle for yourself.

482
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,500
Really?

483
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,550
Didn’t I say?

484
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,500
Be cheated more times,
and you’ll get experienced.

485
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,030
Wen Rang!

486
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,310
Wait and see!

487
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,260
Why don’t you cover my travel expense?

488
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,070
Even if you don’t pay me consulting fee,

489
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,220
you should hail us a taxi.

490
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,590
I must save money at the tough time.

491
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,390
When I get rich,

492
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,110
I’ll compensate you ten times.

493
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,900
During my lifetime,

494
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,830
I may not see that day coming.

495
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,900
How beautiful the scenery is!

496
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,900
It’s nice to have a walk.

497
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,300
No.

498
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,110
No.

499
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,160
It’s the second time

500
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,180
that we walk to the restaurant.

501
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,070
You’re taking revenge on me.

502
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,680
Last time I let you
carry the cart back to the restaurant.

503
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,740
This time you deliberately let me do so.

504
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,030
Help!

505
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,310
No!

506
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,030
A teacher mustn’t arrive early.

507
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,900
A student waiting for his teacher

508
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,310
is perfectly justified.

509
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,660
It’s almost the time.

510
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,590
If you dare to be late,

511
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,220
I’ll punish you for copying.

512
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,660
It’s eight o’clock.

513
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,740
Are you cramming for the quiz?

514
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,980
Don’t you know the final spurt
before an exam?

515
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,700
Miss Cong, please sit down.

516
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,830
The regulations of managing
medical accidents are...

517
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,420
The Regulations
of Managing Malpractices.

518
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,030
Judicial Interpretation
of Compensation for Personal Injury.

519
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,950
When did the Tort Law...?

520
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,260
It went into effect on July 1, 2010.

521
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,100
According to The Regulations
of Managing Malpractices,

522
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,430
if an accident isn’t caused
by medical malpractice,

523
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,460
medical institutions are not liable
for compensation.

524
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
But the regulation is contrary…

525
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,110
With the tort liability principle

526
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,500
in General Principles of the Civil Law.

527
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,580
According to
the General Principles of the Civil Law,

528
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,070
citizens and legal persons
who, through their fault, encroach upon

529
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,110
state or collective property
or property of another person

530
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,550
shall bear civil liability.

531
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,700
This question may relate to another one.

532
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,400
In judicial practice,

533
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,680
when judging whether a party
is responsible

534
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,220
for the occurrence of complications,

535
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,350
we should also consider if the party

536
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,830
has fulfilled the duty of care.

537
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,740
On page 36 of your materials,
the second to last paragraph.

538
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,420
Did you eat Doraemon’s memory bread?

539
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,790
Medical students are fearless.

540
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,150
Miss Cong.

541
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,350
If I answered all correctly,

542
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,420
all correctly,

543
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,220
would you give me a reward?

544
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,790
A reward?

545
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,940
Do you want a little red flower
or a little medal?

546
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,420
I want...

547
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,500
I’ll give you a day to think about it.

548

I can’t catch the bus anyway.

I’m busy every day.

I’m about to die from overwork.

Yeah. OK.

OK.

You’re welcome.

It’s weird.

He is neither in surgery
nor in the ward.

596
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,940
He is not in the office, either.

Can I help you?

602
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,500
My boss asked me

<i>To: Cong Rong</i>
My boss is on a business trip.

606
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,470
He surely needs me to run him errands.

607
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,260
Business trip?

608
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,830
Does he have to travel on business?

609
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,830
Of course.

610
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,390
Doctors travel a lot.

611
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,980
They either have meetings or operations.

612
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,590
My boss left no words to me,

613
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,460
but he left some words to you.

Neighbor?

621
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,700
Since when have you become neighbors?

622
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,910
They are not to watch me together,
are they?

No.

Look.

634
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,990
The next door is called Rang Kai,

635
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,510
which drives all the guests out.

636
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,870
Mine is called Burang.

Never decline to host guests.

638
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,180
So all the guests would come to me.

639
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,430
The point is…

640
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,870
How does it taste?

641
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,220
Not bad.

642
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,740
It’s delicious.

00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,990
Why don’t you eat?

644
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,550
I ate so much that I almost threw up.

645
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,220
I’ll never be like last time.

646
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,340
At least I must eat till I’m satisfied.

647
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,260
So, unconsciously,

648
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,630
I look like three-month pregnant.

Look.

650
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,820

If you want to find him,
you must be serious.

If you don’t like it,

I have a lot of alternatives.

Such a notice

Wait.

674
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,760
You’re supportive of my business.

675
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,180
It makes me happy.

676
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,480
But can you eat so much?

677
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,700
I can take the leftovers home.

678
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,110
If I can’t eat that all,

679
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,510
I will feed the dog with it.

680
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,220
Dog?

681
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,030
Where’s the dog from?

682
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,660
Nothing.

You just care about your dog.

00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,220
Don’t I matter?

736
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,300
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

What do you want me to say to you?

738
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,550
Why are you here?

739
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,820
You scared the hell out of me!

740
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,550
Didn’t he just give you the signs?

741
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,180
You have nobody to blame.

742
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,470
At least give me a clue
if you come back early.

743
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,880
Aren’t you afraid that I would

744
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,630
do something strange in your apartment?

745
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,270
I actually want to know

746
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,070
what strange things you would do.

747
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,860
You just said… Who doesn’t matter?

748
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,860
I didn’t hear it clearly.

749
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,070
Say it again.

750
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,820
I said… I said…

751
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,800
I said, since you came back,

752
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,550
I would return your precious dog to you.

753
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,300
Besides,

754
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,480
the time and energy it takes
to walk your dog

755
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,910
are beyond my expectation.

756
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,070
If you ask me to do that again,

757
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,150
I must triple the charge.

758
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,950
Fine.

759
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,070
It’s worth it, anyway.

760
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,780
It’s time to let her know.
