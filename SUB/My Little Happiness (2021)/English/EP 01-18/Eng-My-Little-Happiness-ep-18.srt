175
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,850
Get it yourself.

176
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,020
Bending down will engage
the lower back muscles.

177
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,690
It burns massive calories

178
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,410
which causes
cerebral vascular insufficiency

179
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:52,810
and then oxygen shortage...

180
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,220
Fine.

181
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,020
Shut up.

182
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,920
I’ll get it for you.

183
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,500
Come.

184
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,290
Let’s get inside.

185
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,490
Your lips are so pale.

186
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,490
Are you having a fever?

187
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,370
That is inaccurate.

188
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,680
This is.

189
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,250
That’s even more inaccurate.

190
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,250
I’ll get the thermometer.

191
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,890
It’s in the study.

192
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,070
Second drawer on the right of the desk.

193
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,300
There’s a medicine kit.

194
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,470
He’s on the verge of fainting.

195
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,660
He’s still flirting.

196
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,630
I’m going crazy.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,230
I found...

198
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,590
Wen Shaoqing,

199
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,540
don’t sleep here.

200
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,660
You may get a cold.

201
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,300
Go sleep in your bed.

202
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,470
Come on.

203
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,270
You’re awake?

204
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,990
Let’s take your temperature.

205
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,700
Open your mouth.

206
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,750
Can you not go to the law firm today?

207
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,480
I’ve meetings with my clients.

208
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,230
It’s about the Online Loans case.

209
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,720
I have to go.

210
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,420
Your mom does know you the best.

211
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,150
No wonder she doesn’t want
you to be a lawyer.

212
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,440
I can stay with you a bit longer.

213
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,820
I’ll stay for another ten minutes.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh.

215
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,910
This is for you.

216
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,150
If you wash your hands too frequently,

217
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,230
you need to apply hand cream.

218
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,870
Or your skin will crack in cold weather.

219
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,820
Apply it for me.

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,750
I’m too tired.

221
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,150
You’re taking advantage of your ill.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,540
My hands are smooth, right?

223
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,540
It’s done.

224
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,020
Give me the thermometer.

225
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,630
38.5 degrees.

226
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,660
Why is it so high?

227
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,230
Fine.

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,550
I’ll ask for a leave.

229
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,300
No, you shouldn’t.

230
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,720
My body temperature

231
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,470
is normally higher than the others.

232
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,390
Really?

233
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,390
It’s true.

234
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,300
I’m a doctor.

235
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,270
I can take care of myself.

236
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,700
I’ll be fine with
some medicine and sleep.

237
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,660
Am I really a bad girlfriend?

238
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,060
No.

239
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,430
You’re amazing.

240
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,300
You did your best.

241
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,540
How about this?

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,590
However late it is,

243
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,550
I’ll come home and cook soup for you.

244
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,390
Is that okay with you?

245
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,590
Chicken soup?

246
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,700
Chicken soup it is then.

247
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,820
I’ll leave now.

250
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,540
Hello.

251
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,700
Can you do me a favor?

It’s deadly silent today.

256

Are you going to see someone?

257
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,870
Yes.

258
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,870
You just can’t move on, can you?

259
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,110
What do you suggest?

260
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,720
Some people just can’t

261
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,480
take care of themselves.

262

Wen Rang.

263
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,510
I didn’t really know you until now.

264
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,900
I despise you.

265
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,630
What?

266
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,670
Why are you so mad at me?

267
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,390
And you despise me?

268

Yes.

You’re spineless.

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Aren’t you tough
when you turned me down?

271
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,790
Why are you suddenly spineless?

272
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,510
Wait a second?

273
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,080
Why is it spineless

274
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,150
to take care of my nephew?

275
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,990
You are...!

276
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,350
Wait. Take care of who?

277
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,110
My nephew Wen Shaoqing.

278
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,750
It’s your nephew?

279
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,390
You should say it earlier.

280
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,710
Go. Hurry up.

So you’re talking about Jiang…?

284
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,300
Nonsense.

285
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,390
Hello.

286
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,310
Rong.

287
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,070
Answer me.

288
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,230
Is Wen Shaoqing ill?

289
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,120
Yes.

290
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,720
What?

291
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,510
Great.

292
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,590
Great?

293
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,360
No. No.

294
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,470
That’s not what I mean.

295
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,070
I mean that your boyfriend

296
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,070
does me a huge favor.

297
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,270
He proves a very important thing for me.

298
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,150
What is it?

299
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,660
Wen Rang didn’t lie to me.

300
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,420
I’ll hang up now.

301
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,020
Glad that he’s not seeing Jiang Yao.

302

Keep it monitored.

308
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,720
And one art installation hasn’t arrived.

309
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,630
It’s still on the sea.

310
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,630
Okay.

Excuse me, the takeout is here.

312

I’m sorry.

313
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,590
The rain is too heavy.

314
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,110
I spent a little longer on the road.

315
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,420
Take it to the office.

316
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,150
You’re the one who ordered the takeout?

317

Yeah, it’s me.

318

your restaurant, didn’t you?

Thanks.

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,070
Let me get you a towel.

322
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,110
There’s no need for that.

323

Let’s talk about Wen Rang.

326
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,630
This is amazing.

327
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,350
My place isn’t bad, right?

328
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,310
Not bad.

329
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
My family is in
the antique art business.

330
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,700
So we’re somehow
in the same industry.

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,750
Hurry up.

332
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,700
Dry your hair.

333
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,070
Thanks.

334
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,260
Yesterday, I was like an old friend.

335
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,350
Now I’m an enemy?

336
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,420
It’s different now.

337
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,790
Because of Wen Rang?

338
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,900
He said he has a girlfriend.

339
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,110
Do you know who she is?

340
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,180
It’s…

341
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,260
It’s me.

342
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,870
What?

343
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,870
You don’t believe me?

344
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,680
Yesterday, I had dinner

345
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,070
with him and his parents at their house.

346
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,820
His dad really likes me.

347
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,720
But I remember that

348
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,350
his dad seldom asks
about his relationships.

349
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,630
People change.

350
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,480
His parents are older now.

351
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,470
They want their son to
get married sooner.

352
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,220
That’s natural.

353
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,900
Wen Rang has changed too.

354
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,700
No one will stay the same forever.

355
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,900
Have you been with him for long?

356
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,870
Yes.

357
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,700
I’m friends with his nephew
Wen Shaoqing too.

358
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,150
I even introduced my bestie to him.

359
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,150
Now, the four of us

360
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,000
visit the elders

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
together at festivals.

362
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,980
And we plan to hold weddings
together in the future.

363
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,590
It seems that I came back too late.

364
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,420
Yes, you’re late.

365
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,790
But it’s fine.

366
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,070
You can move forward.

367
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,110
You’re an extraordinary person.

368
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,070
You don’t have to look back.

369
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,900
I’m just being a bit reminiscent.

370
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,310
Does he still celebrate June 8?

371
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,460
Sure.

372
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,910
Every year, he books restaurant

373
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,390
and takes me to fine-dining.

374
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,070
It’s a special day after all.

375
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,260
Why are you laughing?

376
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,070
June 8 is the day
I left him without notice.

377
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,220
Then I must have mistaken the date.

378
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,830
In short, don’t try to win him back.

379
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,680
He won’t get back with you.

380
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,780
I came back this time

381
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,480
to hear it from him.

382
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,640
He doesn’t want to see you.

383
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,200
So,

384
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,310
you can ask him out.

385
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,310
You’re his girlfriend.

386
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,700
He will come if you ask him to.

387
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,110
But it’s raining heavily outside today.

388
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,220
So I have to keep pursuing him.

389
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,740
Wait a second.

390
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,160
Come on.

391
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,070
Eat something before you sleep.

392
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,980
How’s the taste?

393
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,790
Not bad.

394
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,700
Years of experience as a cook pays off.

395
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,150
Not bad?

396
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,870
You’re such a picky eater.

397
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,740
How dare you be so picky

398
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,150
when your girlfriend has left you?

399
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,350
You sound like you haven’t been
abandoned by your girlfriend.

400
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,870
What’s wrong?

401
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,260
I haven’t seen you like this
for a long time.

402
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,870
She’s back.

403
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,900
Who?

404
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,310
Jiang Yao?

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,960
You’re not considering
getting back with her, are you?

406
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,830
No.

407
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,940
No wonder!

408
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,070
Her name is so fitting.

409
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,390
She’s like the relentless wind that

410
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,030
stirs up everything.

411
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,590
Jiang Yao.

412
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,880
You’re still so mean

413
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,220
when you’re having a fever.

414
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,500
Doctors will shake their heads at you.

415
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,870
What do you mean?

416
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,240
You’re helpless.

417
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,590
Will you eat it or not?

418
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,590
I’ll take it away if you don’t.

419
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,110
How about Zhou Chengcheng?

420
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,150
I refused her.

421
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,660
This is going to be fun.

422
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,420
A girl you can’t let go of.

423
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,030
A girl who can’t let go of you.

424
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,980
It’s an equilateral triangle.

425
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,700
The structure is pretty stable.

426
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,390
What happened?

427
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,640
You’re a Nobel prize winner in math now?

428
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,980
Don’t try to shift the subject.

429
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,700
Who will you choose between them?

430
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,870
I choose you.

431
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,340
<i>Zhou Chengcheng</i>

432
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,980
Hello.

433
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,260
Wen Rang.

434
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,350
I was riding my e-bike.

435
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,790
And I was hit.

436
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,310
Were you injured?

437
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,110
Wait a second.

438
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,350
What are you doing in the pouring rain?

439
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,300
I’ll text you the address.

440
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,180
Can you come and pick me up?

441
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,270
I have something to attend to.

442
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,790
Have to go.

443
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,740
Lend me your car.

444
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,880
The key is at the entryway.

445
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,700
Get it yourself.

446
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,350
You just said you would choose me.

447
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,870
Zhou Chengcheng.

448
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,070
I’m here.

449
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,470
Are you injured?

450
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,270
You can’t even ride the bike properly,

451
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,500
let alone an e-bike.

452
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,440
I’m fine.

453
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,310
Wen Rang.

454
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,390
It’s me who want to see you.

455
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,460
I didn’t mean to do this.

456
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,160
I told her you’d not get back with her.

457
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,900
She didn’t believe me.

458
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,390
So you lied to me

459
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,310
and made me come all the way

460
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,870
just to answer such a trivial question?

461
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,740
If this is really a trivial question,

462
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,350
then answer me honestly.

463
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,030
Tell me that you don’t like me,

464
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,420
that you don’t care about me,

465
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,270
or don't want to see me anymore.

466
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,940
Tell me.

467
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,980
Jiang Yao.

468
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,110
This is not ten years ago

469
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,590
when I gave

470
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,220
every answer you wanted.

471
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,700
So you’ll not give me the answer.

472
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,470
You haven’t changed a bit.

473
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,900
You still like this game.

474
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,440
You threw a bait in the ocean

475
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,110
and waited for me to take it.

476
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,310
You used your own name

477
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,550
to buy my books

478
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,230
because you want me to look for you.

479
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,070
You’re so sure that I will.

480
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,590
You want this sense of accomplishment.

481
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,870
You don’t have to look for me.

482
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,390
But you still did.

483
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,870
What does that say?

484
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,500
It means that there’s still a place

485
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,830
for me in your heart.

486
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,950
That’s the answer I want.

487
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,590
What’s wrong with you?

488
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,470
You just can’t listen to people.

489
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,830
Why are you so narcissistic?

490
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,030
Why do you think
he still cares about you?

491
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,390
Because he wrote books

492
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,400
and he’s never dated anyone

493
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,310
since he broke up with you?

494
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,440
Your words just

495
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,260
further proved what I think.

496
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,350
Come out.

497
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,310
Don’t you know that you give her hope?

498
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,670
I’m such an idiot.

499
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,710
I got all the speeding tickets

500
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,440
rushing over not just to be the prize

501
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,310
of your bet.

502
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,790
That’s not what I mean.

503
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,790
You know it.

504
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,150
I don’t want you to get hurt anymore.

505
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,670
Can’t you make it clear to her?

506
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,310
I’m in a bad mood now.

507
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,110
I can’t sort things out with her.

508
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
If you’re unwilling to say it
to her face,

509
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,640
you can talk to her on phone,

510
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,100
or send her a WeChat message.

511
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,110
You can always make
things clear if you want to.

512
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,940
You can’t say it to her face,

513
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,150
or you just don’t want to?

514
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,150
You’re hesitant.

515
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,830
Yes.

516
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,780
I am hesitant.

517
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,960
I am hesitant. So what?

518
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,920
That was ten years of my time,

519
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,510
not your past,

520
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,740
nor the past of anyone else.

521
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,680
Don’t I have my right to be hesitant?

522
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,830
Who are you to me?

523
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,220
<i>Sandman Space</i>

524
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,110
Do you need refill?

525
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,700
The kitchen will close soon.

526
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,550
No, thank you.

527
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,260
Okay.

528
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,740
Let’s go.

529
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,260
They’re late for over an hour.

530
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,750
They probably won’t come.

531
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,790
I’ll wait for a bit longer.

532
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,630
Don’t have too much hope.

533
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,790
This case is at the center of
media attention right now.

534
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
The victims don’t want to subject
themselves to public debate.

535
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,830
Few will be willing to testify in court.

536
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,740
I know.

537
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,660
That’s why I need to wait a bit longer.

538
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,870
Why are you so stubborn?

539
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,980
Mr. Shangguan, do you know?

540
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,820
Some media said that
the victims got what they deserve,

541
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,720
that if they were not greedy,

542
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,310
they wouldn’t have fallen for the trap.

543
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,070
Zhang was deceived

544
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,070
because she wanted to buy meds
for her mom.

545
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,190
Is it wrong to be poor?

546
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,950
The scammers deliberately

547
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,200
chose the poor, young interns,

548
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,590
because they knew those people

549
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,750
value their future more than the others.

550
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,200
They’ll do their best
to pay off the debt.

551
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,980
They were already deceived.

552
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,740
And they also have to be accused
by the public?

553
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,550
Mr. Shangguan.

554
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,420
What’s wrong?

555
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,900
Nothing.

556
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,590
Something came up to me.

557
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,660
What is it?

558
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,830
When I was in graduate school,

559
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,750
I had four part-time jobs a week

560
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,940
to support my family.

561
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,310
There used to be a grocery market
behind the house I rent.

562
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,660
I used to study all night till 4 AM,

563
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,790
and I’d hear truck driving out, warning,

564
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,030
“Beware! I’m backing up.

565
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,870
Beware! I’m backing up.”

566
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,980
Mr. Shangguan.

567
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,790
I’ve always wanted to ask you something.

568
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,550
What is it?

569
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,070
Why were you willing to

570
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,590
recommend me to Daren Law Firm
as an intern?

571
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,720
At that time...

572
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,390
Miss Cong.

573
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,310
We’re so sorry.

574
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,460
We’re late.

575
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,550
They said that they trust you.

576
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,870
And we want to file a joinder.

577
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,870
Thank you so much for

578
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,710
coming to see us tonight.

579
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,150
Thanks for your trust.

580
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,630
But now I need you to tell us

581
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,980
every detail of your case,

582
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,350
as detailed as possible.

583
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,110
Tell us every detail accurately.

584
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,630
The thing is this.

585
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,190
That day,

586
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,630
I was playing video games in my dorm.

587
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,500
And my friend rushed in.

588
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,920
He told me that

589
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,070
he lost his mobile phone
and his ID card.

590
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,390
<i>Sandman Space</i>
Let’s call it a day.

591
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,230
Thank you.

592
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,310
Let’s keep in touch.

593
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,590
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

594
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,590
Thank you, Miss Cong.

595
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,820
Thank you.

596
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,790
Be careful on your way home.

597
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,450
Okay.

598
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,390
Bye.

599
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,150
Bye.

600
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,550
It’s unexpected that they all signed it.

601
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,240
It’s half past 9 now.

602
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,260
<i>Xiong Jingjing</i>
Let me give you a ride home.

603
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,270
Excuse me.

604
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,400
Let me answer this call.

605
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,180
Sure.

606
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,260
Hello.

607
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,460
Has Mr. Shangguan had lunch?

608
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,700
How about any snacks?

609
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,750
His stomach has just recovered a bit.

610
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,110
He needs to have small meals frequently.

611
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,390
Xiong Jingjing.

612
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,920
I’m not your pigeon.

613
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,310
Relaying messages for you isn’t my job.

614
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,670
Why don’t you just call him yourself?

615
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,680
Because you said that
I shouldn’t be too annoying.

616
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,740
So you annoy me instead.

617
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,220
Are we good friends?

618
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,500
Can you help me buy some porridge
for Mr. Shangguan?

619
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,590
No, I won’t.

620
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,440
Fine.

621
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,510
Then I’ll call your doctor boyfriend.

622
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,870
Stop bluffing.

623
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,750
13564628...

624
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,870
Where did you get that from?

625
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,940
Are you buying or not?

626
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,200
Fine.

627
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,500
Thank you, Miss Cong.

628
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,660
You’re the best.

629
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,710
Mr. Shangguan.

630
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,630
Can you wait for me a bit longer?

631
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,680
Mr. Shangguan.

632
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,590
Don’t drink too much coffee.

633
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,500
It’s not good to your stomach.

634
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,630
Have some porridge.

635
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Your scarf is stained.

636
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,870
It’s fine.

637
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,870
I’ll take the coffee.

638
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,060
Let me give you a ride home.

639
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,720
No, thank you.

640
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,830

Oh.

Mr. Shangguan.

643
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,910
May I take a day off tomorrow?

644
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,070
You’ve been working
really hard recently.

645
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,540
Take a day off.

646
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,260
Thank you.

647
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,070
Please hold on.

648
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,310
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

Hello.

650
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,390
I was just about to call you.

651
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,220
How’s Wen Shaoqing doing?

652
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,390
He took some pills and went to bed.

653
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,110
He’s fine.

654
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,830
Don’t worry.

655
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,350
Great.

656
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,910
Thank you so much.

Well.

658

Can you give Zhou Chengcheng a call?

659
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,590
What happened to her?

660
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,390
Nothing.

661
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,400
She didn’t come back
to her restaurant tonight.

662
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,660
I’m worried about her safety.

663
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,870
I’ll hang up now.

664
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,750
I am hesitant. So what?

665
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,680
That was ten years of my time,

666
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,350
not your past,

667
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,550
nor the past of anyone else.

668
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,640
Don’t I have my right to be hesitant?

669
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,260
Who are you to me?

670
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,500

672
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,880
What?

673
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,780
You miss me?

674
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,540
Yes.

675
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,350
I miss you.

I’m on my way home.

What’s up?

679
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,940
You didn’t argue with Wen Rang, did you?

680
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,660
Argue?

681
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,980
Why should I argue with him?

682
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,700
I’m not his girlfriend.

683
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,510
He just called me.

684
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,150
He said he’s worried about you.

685
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,660
Maybe he said that merely to be humane.

686
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,590
I’m home.

687
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,590
I’ll hang up now.

688
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,350
Bye.

689
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,590
However late it is,

690
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,400
I’ll come home and make soup for you.

691
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,310
Is that okay with you?

692
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,540
Chicken soup?

693
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,900
Chicken soup it is then.

694
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,460
Boss.

695
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,150
Have some water.

696
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,350
As the saying goes,

697
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
the owl doesn’t come into one’s house

698
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,790
for no reason.

699
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,550
I finally have a day off.

700
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,960
You don’t hide from me.

701
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,420
Instead, you knock on my door.

702
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,740
There’s something fishy.

703
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,590
You got me wrong.

704
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,740
The colleagues say you’re built of iron.

705
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,260
It’s rare that you’re sick.

706
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,030
So I’m sent here to solace you.

707
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,310
This is our gift to you.

708
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,260
Why does this look familiar?

709
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,150
This was your gift to me.

710
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,900
So you give back what I gave you

711
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,630
when I’m ill?

712
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,700
What’s wrong with you?

713
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,700
I have to be honest.

714
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,510
Today, we had a dissertation seminar.

715
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,320
When you were not around,

716
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,820
we recommended you as the participant.

717
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,630
I’m just here to inform you.

718
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,590
We don’t punish someone who confesses.

719
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,430
I’ll get the door.

720
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,790
Thank you.

721
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,340
You’re welcome.

722
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,630
Boss.

723
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,480
You have a package.

724
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,400
I’ll open it for you.

725
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,890
Okay.

726
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,220
The stench of romance.

727
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
You give my cousin luxury products.

728
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,910
But you gave me natural science stuff.

729
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,910
You’re so miserly.

730
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,260
What is it?

731
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,000
The scarf you’ll give my cousin.

732
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,780
Scarf?

733
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,260
I didn’t buy scarf for her.

734
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,260
Boss.

735
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,630
I don’t have a scarf as well.

736
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,950
Thank you.

737
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,910
Shangguan Yi.

738
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,070
Who is this person?

739
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,630
The brother of Shangguan Wan’er.

740
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,510
New champion of Arena of Valor?

741
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,260
Open the door.

742
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,740
Open the door.

743
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,150
Wen Shaoqing.

744
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,790
Open the door.

745
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,380
Boss.

746
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,910
I suddenly...

747
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,320
I suddenly want to study.

748
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,630
I’ll go read books in your study.

749
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,590
Open the door.

750
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,830
It’s so hot.

751
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,670
It’s so hot.

752
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,000
It’s so hot.

753
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,110
It’s so hot.

754
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,960
Listen.

755
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,590
I’m sure the soup is as good as yours.

756
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,840
It’s been stewed all night.

757
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I banged on the grocery store’s door

758
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,920
for half an hour last night
to wake up the store owner.

759
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,780
So he could sell me a Luhua chicken.

760
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,590
When did you come home?

761
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,760
Around 11 or 12 in the evening.

762
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,780
What?

763
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,070
Mr. Shangguan had you
work overtime with him?

764
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,740
I forced him to work overtime.

765
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,110
Hurry up.

766
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,150
Try the soup.

767
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,860
Come on.

768
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,660
I don’t want to drink it.

769
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,380
Are you still ill?

770
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,470
You have no appetite?

771
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,150
Mr. Shangguan

772
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,470
sent his gift to the wrong address.

773
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,590
I signed it for you.

774
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,110
It’s the scarf.

775
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Put it aside for now.

776
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,180
The soup will be less palatable
when it’s cold.

777
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,470
Why would he give you a scarf?

778
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,700
I stained mine when
I bought him porridge last night.

779
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,300
He bought me a new one instead.

780
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,750
You bought him porridge?

781
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,510
Yes.

782
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,550
What’s wrong with that?

783
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,740
Why porridge?

784
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,960
Why porridge?

785
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,440
Yes.

786
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,430
Why porridge?

787
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,700
His stomach hasn’t fully recovered.

788
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,830
So he has to drink porridge.

789
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,280
I can’t buy barbeque for him.

790
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,760
It’s fine if you buy him

791
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,300
plain noodles or gastric powder.

792
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,260
But you can’t buy porridge for him.

793
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,740
What’s wrong with you?

794
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,800
If you don’t like the fact
that he bought me a scarf,

795
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,030
I can return it.

796
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,400
But I’ve been cooking this soup
all night.

797
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,990
You can’t just decline it
without a reason.

798
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,820
Why are you being so mean?

799
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,580
Is it because of the gift,

800
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,790
or the porridge?

801
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,550
Or are you angry
that I often bail on you?

802
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,650
I had a hard time learning
to write the character, heart, as a kid.

803
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,590
In a character
with “heart” at the bottom,

804
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,230
make it shorter

805
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,460
and a little slant.

806
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,880
But I just couldn’t do it,

807
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,660
to make it shorter and tilt right,

808
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,910
I couldn’t write the character perfectly

809
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,790
because I cared too much about it.

810
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,470
Isn’t it the same with romance?

811
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,860
The one who falls in love first
is always at disadvantage.

812
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,070
You don’t trust me at all.

813
