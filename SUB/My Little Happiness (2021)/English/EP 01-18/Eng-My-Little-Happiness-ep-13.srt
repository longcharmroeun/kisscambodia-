Did you not have a good sleep

If the report can’t be delayed,

we can change to video call.

47

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,630
Hello, everyone.

172
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,670
During my internship,

173
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,480
I worked at Yun Ji Hospital

174
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,900
taking charge of mediation.

175
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,180
<i>Hospital Overview</i>

176
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,580
<i>FINISH</i>

177
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
That’s the store.

178
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,390
Profiteer.

179
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,950
Are you going in just like this?

180
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,270
You look really suspicious.

181
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,900
I need to disguise myself.

182
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,750
I’m very pretty.

183
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,420
What if the owner memorizes my face?

184
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,550
You worry too much.

185
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,300
Take them off.

186
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,780
All... All of them?

187
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,180
That’s about right.

188
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,900
You should go in there naturally.

189
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,020
Just say that you’re here
for replenishment.

190
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,510
The owner won’t give out

191
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,350
information of the cheap ones.

192
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,630
So you have to be observant.

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,900
Why does he suddenly look
so pretty?

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,390
Are you clear of the strategies?

195
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,420
Do you understand?

196
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,720
Yes, I do.

197
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,510
What do you say when you enter?

198
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,670
I’ll be frank and clear.

199
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,900
Tell him who I am.

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,720
You...

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,360
It’s such a waste of time.

202
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,020
I’ll go instead.

203
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,700
Wait... Wait...

204
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,990
I can do that.

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,700
I’ll play to the score.

206
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,900
Just wait here for me.

207
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Wait for my success.

208
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,300
Safety first.

209
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,190
Don’t be too tough.

210
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,060
Okay.

211
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,300
Mix half of this and that.

212
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,150
<i>Imported Marine Food Products</i>

213
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,990
It can’t go wrong.

214
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,750
Come back when you sell out.

215
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,940
Don’t forget.

216
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,110
Okay.

217
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,870
Great.

218
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,870
See you.

219
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,740
Miss.

220
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,590
What do you need?

221
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,750
I...

222
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,480
We... We only do wholesale

223
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,350
instead of retail.

224
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,510
Sir.

225
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,300
What you have is pretty good.

226
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,110
But I don’t need them.

227
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,540
I run a barbecue restaurant.

228
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,270
Replenishing high-class sea food

229
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,120
won’t make me money.

230
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,350
Do you have anything else?

231
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,150
That’s all I’ve got.

232
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,020
All the goods are here.

233
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,870
You don’t?

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,750
A friend told me

235
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,440
you’ve got some special goods here.

236
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,180
It’s a wasted trip.

237
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,390
A former customer introduced you here?

238
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,780
Exactly.

239
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,380
He told me

240
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,870
that frozen products here
are cheap and fine.

241
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,870
I was hoping to cut out the cost.

242
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,870
That’s why I came.

243
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,870
It’s okay if you don’t have them.

244
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,540
It’s fine.

245
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,900
I need a huge amount anyway.

246
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,020
You probably don’t have enough.

247
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,660
Wait... Wait... Wait.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,020
A huge amount?

249
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,660
How many do you want exactly?

250
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,870
I need to check the goods first.

251
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,870
Sure.

252
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,390
Come with me.

253
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,870
Come.

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
You don’t look like running a business.

255
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,900
You know the ropes though.

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,500
Listen to me.

257
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,630
Frozen products are suitable
for barbecue.

258
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,440
They’re all here.

259
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,110
Take a look.

260
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,510
Sir.

261
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,060
There’s smell here.

262
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
You get what you pay for.

263
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,670
Do you count on here

264
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,990
to be like Maldives?

265
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,110
God.

266
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,140
Pay attention.

267
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,780
Look at these.

268
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,820
Three yuan for one.

269
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,790
It’s a sliced piece.

270
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,180
Nobody will know what you’re selling.

271
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,060
No.

272
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,270
The quality is too bad.

273
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,550
Though it’s frozen,

274
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,910
it shouldn’t be a bad one.

275
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,120
Is it even edible?

276
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,510
Of course.

277
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,660
Do you run a Michelin?

278
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,060
As for these ingredients,

279
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,180
put more spices when being roasted.

280
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,020
Then fry it with garlic oil.

281
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,390
Who will be able to tell?

282
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,390
I should really learn from you.

283
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,750
But…

284
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,110
What should I do if someone

285
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,600
gets food poisoning?

286
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,660
The worst can only be diarrhea.

287
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,720
Listen to me.

288
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,480
People now eat fast food every meal.

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,270
They can’t tell which meal goes wrong.

290
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,390
Alright.

291
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,870
I get it now.

292
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,120
What you mean is to sell it

293
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,180
and shrink the responsibility.

294
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,950
I can’t believe that you

295
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,500
earn money shamelessly.

296
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,910
Do you not have any conscientiousness?

297
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,820
What did you say?

298
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,790
You’re not here for replenishment.

299
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,320
You’re here to pick on me.

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,020
The deal’s over.

301
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,790
I don’t care how much you pay.

302
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,200
Go.

303
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,670
Get out. Get out.

304
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,200
I won’t.

305
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,030
I am here to settle something with you.

306
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,480
Get out.

307
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,120
I tell you.

308
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,030
I’ve recorded everything.
I’m telling you.

309
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,020
Give me your phone.

310
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,960
No.

311
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,360
Give me it.

312
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,960
I won’t give you this,

313
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,790
but I’ll give you a big surprise.

314
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,510
My fish!

315
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,590
Oh no.

316
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,020
Stupid girl.

317
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,870
Wait and see.

318
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,510
What are you waiting for?

319
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,270
Run!

320
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,820
Don’t run!

321
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,150
Stop!

322
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,660
It’s far enough.

323
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,180
We’re good now.

324
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,900
Don’t you think

325
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,470
what happened is like

326
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,060
a Hong Kong gangster film?

327
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,350
So exciting.

328
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,470
Exciting?

329
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,540
Do you want to do it again?

330
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,870
No, thanks.

331
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,350
I told you not to be tough.

332
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,820
I couldn’t help.

333
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,320
I’ve accomplished the task.

334
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,900
Though the ending was a bit of a rush,

335
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,060
I’ve recorded everything I need.

336
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,830
It’d be helpful to the Industrial
and Commercial Bureau.

337
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,480
What’s the smell?

338
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,120
Did you step on poop?

339
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,150
No, you did.

340
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,110
Right.

341
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,790
I stole a scallop just now

342
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,020
to take it for examination.

343
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,910
Smell it.

344
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,390
Isn’t it questionable?

345
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,060
Smell it yourself.

346
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,200
I’ve lost the ability to smell now.

347
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,870
You get used to bad smell
if you smell it for long.

348
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,550
Smell it.

349
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,150
No. No. No.

350
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,390
You...

351
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,940
You and your scallop stay away from me.

352
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,110
There’s finally a time
that you’re scared.

353
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,950
Just smell it.

354
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,510
Smell it.

355
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:58,870
Don’t come near me.

356
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,360
Smell it.

357
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,550
Don’t come here.

358
00:15:59,550 --> 00:15:59,910
Don’t come near me.

359
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,480
Don’t come.

360
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,750
It smells really...

361

Have you finished your report?

364
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,830
Just finished.

365

Let me tell you the good news.

366
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,390
I haven’t got the result yet.

367
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,720
Wait.

368
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,540
I’m coming for you now.

369
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,270
We understand the situation now.

Now you’re satisfied?

373
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,020
Rong.

374
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,870
What happened to you?

375
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,060
Did you fall into a sewer?

376
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,600
You didn’t see

377
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,390
how dangerous it was.

378
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,630
It’s like a narrow escape from death.

379
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,300
Don’t take her words too seriously.

380

Let’s hug.

I’ve got new orders of collections
of poems.

383
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,110
You guys talk.

384
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,630
I’ll go back first.

385
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,150
Okay.

386
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,700
Okay. See you.

387
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,550
See you.

388
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,790
See you at night.

389
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,660
Tell me the truth.

390
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,900
What happened to you two?

391
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,830
He patted my head.

392
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,310
He held my hands, too.

393
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,030
Are you two together now?

394
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,460
No.

395
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,350
Then he’s flirting with you.

396
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,350
Not really.

397
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,030
He’s like...

398
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,740
Like this...

399
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,420
Then he dragged me and ran.

400
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,460
That’s all.

401
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,590
Miss.

402
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,630
To sum it up,

403
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,260
it’s you who think too much
all the time.

404
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,590
Body contact like this

405
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,870
can make you daydream
for an afternoon.

406
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,400
Are you having a fever?

407
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,070
Probably.

408
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,310
I think so, too.

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,100
He used to be annoying to me.

410
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,000
But I saw him playing the guitar
that day.

411
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,710
He’s suddenly attractive to me.

412
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,200
He’s perfect no matter what.

413
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,350
Isn’t it weird?

414
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,070
You’re done.

415
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
A girl who’s in love.

416
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
I’m serious this time.

417
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,110
Stop.

418
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,340
You’ve said that for...

419
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,640
One, two, three, four, five. Never mind.

420
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,590
I can’t count.

421
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,870
Genuinely speaking,

422
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,680
the difference between Wen Rang
and your ex-boyfriends is...

423
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,580
-Very...
-Huge.

424
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,100
I know, right.

425
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,830
I know.

426
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,460
He’s not your type.

427
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,550
How did you fall for him?

428
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,740
Let’s put it in another word.

429
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,830
How did I fall for

430
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,070
that many shallow men before?

431
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,470
I pronounce.

432
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,660
Starting from now,

433
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,310
only the sophisticated, generous
and talented Wen Rang

434
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,500
is my choice.

435
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,710
I’ll chase him.

436
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,700
You want to chase him?

437
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,550
Yes.

438
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,630
Seriously?

439
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,550
Why?

440
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,190
Can’t I?

441
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,030
Fine. Fine.

442
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,590
Go ahead.

443
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,510
But, be careful.

444
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,790
Don’t scare him away.

445
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,750
<i>Daren Law Firm</i>

446
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,350
Xiong Jingjing and Cong Rong’s reports
are neck and neck now.

447
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,350
Their scores are close, too.

448
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,750
I think we need to consider it again.

449
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,180
I think Cong Rong is good.

450
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,110
Among the interns we sent

451
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,480
to Yun Ji,

452
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,310
she’s probably the first
who’s finished the whole project.

453
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,710
She’s good at learning.

454
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,260
She’s mature, too.

455
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,910
Here.

456
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,720
Take a look.

457
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,270
Jingjing has got advantages, too.

458
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,750
Her educational background matches.

459
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,260
Her family has
a lot of industry contacts, too.

460
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,150
Both are good.

461
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,260
Shangguan Yi.

462
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,870
It’s for hiring your assistant.

463
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,420
What do you think?

464
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,310
I pick Cong Rong,

465
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,580
though she didn’t graduate
from relative majors.

466
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,500
She’s got some flaws, too.

467
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,310
Like she’s overly idealistic.

468
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,910
I used to think that she can’t handle
this career.

469
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,710
Because she’s not competitive enough.

470
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,830
She’s not rational enough
like a robot, either.

471
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,020
However, those are
the most precious things on her.

472
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,500
During the five or six years,

473
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,030
she kept the first inspiration
of being a lawyer.

474
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,500
I haven’t seen anyone like her
for a long time.

475
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,550
So, I’ve decided to offer her a chance.

476
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,110
Don’t you have anything to confess?

477
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,000
To confess what?

478
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,020
On the day when Xiong Jingjing got sick,

479
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,270
Wen Shaoqing came to the kitchen
to help.

480
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,350
He said with happiness

481
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,900
that he came
to pick up his girlfriend-to-be.

482
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,300
What’s going on?

483
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
Why is it developing so fast?

484
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,110
Tell me about it.

485
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,980
Lucy.

486
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,390
Okay.

487
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,550
I got it.

488
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,630
What’s the matter?

489
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,790
You didn’t pass?

490
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,310
Tomorrow,

491
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,260
I’ll be working at the law firm.

492
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,680
I know that you’re the best.

493
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,550
Hug it out.

494
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,400
Go and hug Wen Rang.

495
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,870
I’m going to hug the one I like.

496
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,590
The feeling of falling in love.

497
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,900
I want it, too.

498
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,580
<i>Have you finished work?</i>

499
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,820
<i>I just finished a surgery.
There’s a meeting later.</i>

500
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,300
<i>See you at the garden at home.
I have things to say.</i>

501
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,500
If you pass it,

502
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,750
then be my girlfriend.

503
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,880
What if I don’t?

504
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,070
I’ll admit defeat.

505
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,420
I will be your boyfriend

506
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,500
as a compensation.

507
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,550
Wen Shaoqing.

508
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,820
You’re back.

509
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,630
What’s with the rush?

510
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,500
You got sweaty from running.

511
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,940
You may catch a cold from the wind.

512
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,420
I passed.

513
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,140
♪I’m with you♪

514
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,010

You walked too fast.

532
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,420
Your boyfriend got lost.

533
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,070
Don’t trick me.

534
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,460
Aren’t you tired?

535
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,110
We’ve climbed to the eighth floor.

536
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,260
I knew that you’d set me up.

537
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,070
You offered to climb stairs
all of a sudden.

538
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,100
You thought I’d ask you
to carry me on the back if I’m tired.

539
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,830
Aren’t you tired?

540
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,070
Then you carry me on the back.

541
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,590
I can’t.

My legs feel weak.

543

You morning jog every day.

544
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,020
It’s impossible for you to get
this tired after a few stairs.

545
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,790
I didn’t say it’s because of the stairs.

546
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,740
It’s mostly because someone kissed me.

547
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,350
It tired me out.

548
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,470
Who kissed you?

549
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,310
It was you.

550
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,030
Okay. Okay. I’m wrong.

551
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,390
Now you can kiss me back.

552
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,740
You...

553
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,640
What are you doing?

554
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,350
Let me go.

555
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,310
Have you always been so passionate?

556
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,740
Let me go first.

557
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,870
Answer me first.

558
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,550
That was my first kiss.

559
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,980
Cong Rong.

560
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,830
I’m really happy.

561
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,260
Hi, Aunt.

562
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,830
Where did you go?

563
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,500
I’ve been waiting for half an hour.

564
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,880
Mom.

565
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,160
What are you doing here?

566
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,350
I’m all packed up.

567
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,630
I should go soon
before I miss the flight.

568
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,160
Aunt.

569
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,350
You’re leaving so soon.

570
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,740
Yeah.

571
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,900
I should go back.

572
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,960
Why do you come and

573
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,180
go both in such short notice?

574
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,020
Let me buy some specialties for you.

575
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,470
Take them back for Dad Jiang.

576
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,790
No need for specialties.

577
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,070
As long as you two are fine,

578
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,630
I and Dad Jiang will be glad.

579
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,180
Be careful going back by yourself.

580
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,350
Don’t worry.

581
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,790
I won’t get lost.

582
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,070
Besides,

583
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,100
Dad Jiang will pick me up at the airport

584
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,880
with flowers in his hands.

585
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,630
That’s so sweet.

586
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,680
Promise me.

587
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,150
Video call me regularly.

588
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,940
I know you’ll miss me.

589
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,180
I won’t.

590
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,160
I mean, call me when Shaoqing

591
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,710
is with you.

592
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,670
I want to be updated with
what’s going on between you.

593
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,920
You’re like a remote control.

594
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,680
Okay, Aunt.

595
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,150
I’ll report to you regularly.

596
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,830
I’ll feed her well

597
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,340
and send her back to you.

598
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,630
Sounds like you’re raising a pig.

599
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,870
Well...

600
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,790
I’m a bit hungry.

601
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,310
Why don’t you go and buy me some food?

602
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,030
Now?

603
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,350
You’re about to board.

604
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,750
There’s still time.

605
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,510
I’ll go, Aunt.

606
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,350
No, no, no.

607
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,720
She knows my preference.

608
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,510
Hurry and go.

609
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,200
Okay, goddess.

610
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,750
Wait for me.

611
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,550
I’ll be back.

612
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,150
Aunt, don’t worry.

613
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,110
I’ll keep the promise

614
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,390
to take care of Cong Rong
as much as possible.

615
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,110
Shaoqing.

616
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,700
This is the attorney note
of Cong Rong’s father.

617
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,590
It’s also his personal diary.

618
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,390
I’ve been carrying it with me for years.

619
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,940
I read it sometimes when I miss him.

620
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,350
I’m hoping that you can pass this
to Cong Rong.

621
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,420
Please tell her that

622
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,680
even deep in my heart,

623
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,900
I worry about the sense
of justice on her.

624
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,460
But I also understand

625
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,700
that’s exactly why I’m so proud of her.

626
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,550
Please take care of her for me.

627
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,900
Don’t worry.

628
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,990
I’m going now.

629
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,030
Take care.

630
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,070
See you.

631
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,660
Where’s my mom?

632
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,420
Why did she leave before I came back?

633
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,790
What’s the matter?

634
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,900
I’ll take care of you for your mother.

635
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,640
The law

636
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,470
praises virtue and punishes vice.

637
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,110
The law

638
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,510
is the most vital contract among all.

639
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,550
Most lawyers are
just dealing with cases.

640
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,110
But the good ones
are conducting themselves.

641
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,110
From a normal lawyer to a good one,

642
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,150
it’s the process of conducting oneself.

643
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,790
Dad.

644
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,390
I’m going to start my work tomorrow.

645
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,310
I’ll try and be a good lawyer.

00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,260
It’s so fast.

685
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,420
I feel that you’re a bit upset.

686
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,110
I’m not.

687
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,550
Wait a second.

688
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,460
Why?

689
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,980
Just wait for a while.

690
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,270
What are you doing?

691
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,350
People are watching.

692
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,460
So what?

693
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,630
Let them watch.

694
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,180
When you start wearing high heels,

695
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,980
they may hurt your feet.

696
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,660
Let me stick that for you.

697
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,150
By the way,

698
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,660
I’ve prepared slippers for you.

699
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,660
Take them upstairs.

700
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,150
Don’t be so stubborn when working.

701
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,830
When nobody’s watching,

702
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,110
take off your heels.

703
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,870
Take a break.

704
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,700
Got it?

705
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,980
Okay.

706
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,070
Go to work.

707
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,350
Yeah.

708
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,390
I have something to tell you.

When we readjust next week,

713
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,630
register it again in your computer.

714
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,110
Okay.

I’ll take you to your seat.

722
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,180
You’ll be working here from now on.

723
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,790
Feel free to ask me anytime.

724
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,400
Okay.

Thank you, Lucy.

726
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,300
Good luck.

727
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,150
Okay.

728
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,790
Congratulations, Cong.

Thanks.

Nice to meet you.

732

You’re welcome.

733
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,030
As a girl, you have so many
better choices.

734
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,300
Why did you choose to be a lawyer?

735
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,910
What’s wrong with being a girl?

736
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,150
Is there gender discrimination here?

737
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,300
I didn’t mean that.

738
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,150
I mean that

739
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,820
once you’ve become a lawyer,

740
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,920
you can basically say goodbye

741
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,100
to being tender and caring
like you are now.

742
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,820
You’ll head towards being independent,
bossy and brave.

743
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,550
Just like Miss Xu.

744
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,360
Ignore him.

745
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,710
Only the weak men

746
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,740
are afraid of strong women.

747
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,390
Good luck to you.

748
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,030
Okay.

749
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,110
Here you are.

750
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,470
Your notebook is too thick.

751
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,630
You’ll be out frequently.

752
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,960
You need to record a lot of things.

753
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,510
Take this.

754
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,110
It’s convenient.

755
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,550
Okay.

756
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,110

Miss Xu.

758
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,510
Wait a second.

No, thanks.

We are going on a business trip.

786
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,860
Okay.

787
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,150
When do we leave?

788
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,660
After an hour.

789
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,670
Sorry.

Yes.

794
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,840
It’s for a firm’s
intellectual property agency.

795
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,950
It must be urgent.

796
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,960
When will you come back?

797
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,630
I don’t know.

798
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,960
We’ll see.

799
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,630
At least I’ll stay for a night.

800
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,510
Are you angry?

801
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,910
Of course…

802
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,030
not.

803
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,380
Take care of yourself during the trip.

804
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,700

Why are you startled?

809

How could you do that?

810
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,860
How could you have a girlfriend
and not tell me?

811
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,150
Or what?

812
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,700
I’ll spend my life with you together?

813
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,910
I thought you liked my cousin.

814

How could you find someone new
so soon?

In this case,

816
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,230
what should my cousin do?

817
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,590
What can she do?

818
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,300
I’m not getting younger.

819
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,470
I can’t just wait for her.

820
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,780
What...? What about me?

821
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,100
That’s why you’re worrying.

822
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,780
Don’t worry.

823
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,110
I’ll still look after you

824
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,340

00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,470
Besides.

828

How about I send you there?

829
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,470
Mr. Shangguan.

830
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,780
The economy class isn’t
comfortable, right?

831
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,580
It’s alright.

832
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,550
Since it was urgent,

833
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,510
this plane’s business class
was sold out.

834
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,430

00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,670
and reference mark two
in the whole passage.

838
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,300

What do you think of this case?

841
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,070
Trade mark appraisal cases
like this happened.

842
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,140
Though the approved products are
in different categories,

843
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,510
the applicant already owned it
as reputed trademarks.

844
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,820
They’ll probably sentence the applicant
as comparative usage.

845
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,180
Yeah.

846
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,660
It’s basically that way.

847
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,030
You’ll elaborate this part later.

Me?

849
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,550
It’s not a difficult case.

850
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,700
Seize it as an exercise.

851
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,300
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

852
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,620
Mr. Shangguan.

853
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,510
Take the medicine.

854
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,110
It’s warm stomach medicine.

855
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,860
Why do you have stomach medicine?

856
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,950
Do you have a stomach trouble?

857
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,700
No.

858
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,360
I saw that you ran out of yours
at the office.

859
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,180
So I bought some
when dropping by a drugstore.

Dear passengers.

862
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,100
The plane has landed at Shanghai
Hongqiao International Airport.

863
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,260
<i>Febuxostat</i>
The surface temperature is 13 degrees.

864
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,510
The plane is taxiing.

865
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,070
For the safety of you and others.

866
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,860
Please don’t stand up
or open the luggage rack first.

867
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,980
<i>I just landed.</i>
Thank you for your cooperation.

868
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,020
<i>I just landed.</i>
