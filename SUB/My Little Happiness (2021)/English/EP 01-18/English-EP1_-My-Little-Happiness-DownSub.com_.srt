Correct.

75
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,740
But he’s only harsh on me.

76
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,780

173
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,650
These are

174
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
the five offers from the three firms.

175
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,490
It depends on your luck

176
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,650
that which firm you will be in.

177
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,250
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

178
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,460
Who got Yun Ji Hospital?

179
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,300
Me.

180
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,300
OK.

181
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,340
Go to check in tomorrow morning.

182
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,940
Last but not least,

183
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,610
one out of five during the internship,

184
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,130
which means

185
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,940
the four of you will be eliminated.

186
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,820
Good luck.

187
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,940
Ms. Lucy.

188
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,850
Thanks for your help.

189
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,180
No need. Mr. Tan has notified me.

190
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,580
That girl is really out of luck.

191
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,660
Doing an internship in Yun Ji Hospital

192
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,240
means working like a handyman.

193
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,180
Yes.

194
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,580
Dealing with medical disputes.

195
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,970
That’s hard.

196
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,130
It’s not me, luckily.

197
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,460
The last intern in Yun Ji Hospital

198
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,420
only worked less than a month.

199
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,580
The sooner, the better.

200
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,810
She isn’t a law student.

201
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,660
She’ll be eliminated anyway.

202
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,060
She didn’t hear it, did she?

203
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,130
(Nurse Station)

204
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,700
Gosh... My back...

205
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,700
I can’t stand any longer.

206
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,090
My back...

207
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,180
Hurry. Give my back a thump. Come on.

208
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,180
OK. How badly do you wanna be injured?

209
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,490
We can rarely have a day off.

210
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,730
Now you are back with a patient.

211
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,090
Were you picking up a girl or a patient?

212
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,090
You hurt my tendon!

213
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,490
Crap! Pick up the girl!.

214
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,370
901.

215
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,720
Good.

216
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,970
Surprisingly,

217
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,850
he can get such a nice apartment.

218
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,650
Hello. This is Zhong Zhen.

219
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,910
If I don’t pick your call...

220
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,400
Zhong Zhen.

221
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,450
Cousin. I’m so sorry.

222
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,060
I just called my boss

223
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,540
and taught him a good lesson.

224
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,610
He may stand me up.

225
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,490
But how can he stand you up?

226
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,130
Cut it. I know you wanna survive this.

227
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,420
I’m not calling to blame you.

228
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,500
I’m contented with the apartment
you got me.

229
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,580
So, some good news for you.

230
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,730
I’ll soon be your colleague.

231
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,700
I’m startled.

232
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,100
To be my colleague?

233
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,250
Can you use a syringe or a scalpel?

234
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,890
I’m not kidding.

235
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,580
I’ve checked in at the general reception office.

236
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,300
My life is so miserable!

237
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey...

238
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,320
Hello, Rong. I’m downstairs.

239
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,080
Give me a hug in a minute.

240
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,960
Chengcheng!

241
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,720
Rong. Come! Come!

242
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:44,890
I miss you so much.

243
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,960
I miss you so much. You’re finally back.

244
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
I miss you so much.

245
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,410
Enough. Save it.

246
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,890
You’re getting me suffocated.

247
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,770
Oh, right.

248
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,770
Look.

249
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,560
I’ve got you many daily necessities.

250
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,530
Pots and pans.

251
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,720
Toilet paper, hangers, shoehorn.

252
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,530
Back scratcher!

253
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,960
Have a scratch when it itches.

254
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,280
What’s this? A bath mate?

255
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,890
Let me introduce.

256
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,000
This is a Courage Duck.

257
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,050
I took it from my home.

258
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,090
The other one is for me.

259
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,050
Be sure to think of me when you bathe.

260
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,130
Yes.

261
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,010
Are you ready?

262
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,760
What?

263
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,550
What?

264
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,720
Let’s hang out.

265
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,050
My sweetie, you are finally back!

266
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,370
Due to the emergency today,

267
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,920
I couldn’t be with you again.

268
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,050
My bad.

269
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,370
Take the food as an apology. Alright?

270
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,330
Dig in.

271
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,280
Rangyirang.

272
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,050
I’ll be busy tomorrow night.

273
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,090
You’ll have to go to Wen Rang’s place.

274
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,370
Now?

275
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,480
You are a vulture, aren’t you?

276
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,370
Go.

277
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,090
Cheers.

278
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,280
It’s stunning!

279
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,050
Oh, right.

280
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,170
It’s for you.

281
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,130
What?

282
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,000
A crystal I prayed for you.

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,680
For love. I have one, too.

284
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,810
I come for work, not for love.

285
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,000
That’s not a conflict with your work.

286
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,130
Isn’t it good to be taken care of?

287
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,200
Look at me.

288
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,920
I’ve got gifts and flowers.

289
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,870
He says good night to me every day.

290
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,650
Instead of being taken care of,

291
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,090
I prefer someone who knows me

292
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,520
and deserves my love.

293
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,480
I won’t start a relationship casually.

294
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,130
Is love that complicated?

295
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,280
You like each other
and you fall in love.

296
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,370
Haven’t you ever had a crush?

297
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,920
Have you never loved someone

298
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,370
at the first sight?

299
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,810
You are thinking.

300
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,020
Who is it?

301
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,630
Is he handsome? What does he do?

302
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,070
Let me meet him. I’ll give you advice.

303
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,440
Just a passerby.

304
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,280
A passerby?

305
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,040
We can never meet again, I think.

306
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,610
Rong. Are you hungry?

307
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,130
Yes.

308
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,460
Shall we?

309
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,960
You came out with an empty stomach.

310
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,220
You’re hungry now, huh?

311
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,850
Come.

312
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,330
Wait for me here. Don’t move.

313
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,090
Is it the so-called feast?

314
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,960
Where did the dog come from?

315
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,180
Are you alright? Are you scalded?

316
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,850
What are you doing? Make away.

317
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,720
Get out of my way.

318
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,810
I’m ordering you! Get away right now!

319
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,810
Rangyirang. Get down.

320
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,130
Sorry. You must be scared.

321
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,770
It thought you were calling it.

322
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,020
His look is so...

323
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,660
It’s my fault.

324
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,770
I’ll pay you for it.

325
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,410
OK.

326
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:56,940
No.

327
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,060
What?

328
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,940
It’s worth little.
Do you want him to pay?

329
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,850
I’m not asking him for money.

330
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,370
It’s fate. Don’t miss this chance.

331
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,220
The phone.

332
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,450
My phone?

333
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,460
Or what?

334
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,820
I already have a boyfriend.

335
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,570
Or I’ll have him myself. You’re lucky.

336
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:11,780
You’re welcome.

337
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,730
Zhou Chengcheng. Zhou Chengcheng.

338
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,200
Give it to me.

339
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,020
What are you doing?

340
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
8.2 yuan in total.

341
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,180
Pay by WeChat. Let me friend you.

342
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,050
No. I have cash.

343
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,290
He still uses cash nowadays?

344
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,250
No. Pay by WeChat.

345
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,250
There’s a change.

346
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,250
How...How will you get the change?

347
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,660
This is 8.2 yuan. Keep the change.

Hey, is my makeup bad?

350
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,940
I got rejected for the first time.

351
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,610
Alright. Let’s go.

352
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,610
I’m clearing it up. After you.

353
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,770
I’m gonna throw this away.

362

OK. Got it.

Director Yan. What is my duty?

364
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,370
Three points mainly.

365
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,410
First,

366
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,410
the legal education for the staff here.

if any.

At this moment,

there’s a tough case to deal with.

(Administrative Building)
Medical disputes are hard to deal with.

376
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,930
We need to make a balance

377
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,330
between the patients and doctors.

378
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,850
This patient is Mr. Lin.

379
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,240
-He’s been there for two days.
-Apology and refund!

380
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,330
He said the doctor misdiagnosed

381
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
and ripped him off

382
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,740
by hospitalizing him.

383
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,580
He refuses to eat and drink,

making a scene

385
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,420
for an apology from the doctor.

386
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,570
-Did the doctor really misdiagnose?
-Sir.

387
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,660
Is he unwilling to apologize?

388
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,370
Have some water. Please calm down.

389
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,410
I claim an apology and a refund!

390
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,290
Disputes are not so simple as they seem.

391
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,740
And the doctors

392
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,220
have their own unique tempers.

393

Today,

395
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,610
go to the doctor for details,

396
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,410
and make a summary.

397
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,900
OK. Consider it done.

I just said he was out.

430
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,690
Why are you hiding from me?

431
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,330
Not hiding, but avoiding you.

432
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,220
OK. Avoiding me.

433
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,140
Tell me about the patient Mr. Lin,

434

his information
and cause of the dispute.

435

You can get all the information

436

from the hospital office.

437
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,530
I’ve checked,

only about hospitalization
and medication.

439

Patient No.6 is still unconscious.

His family requests a blood transfusion.

446
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,290
That’s risky and unnecessary.

447
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,220
Go try to convince them again.

448
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,900

458
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,330
Deal.

459
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,500
Mr. Lin complained that

460
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,930
it’s a misdiagnose of tinnitus,

461
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,170
but you got him to take CT

462
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,250
and hospitalized.

463
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,210
Miss.

464
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,260
It’s not like removing a bad part
from the whole.

465
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,340
He has tinnitus

466
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,200
because his brain tumor oppresses
the auditory nerves.

467
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,140
He wanted to be discharged and you said no.

468
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,020
Not really.

469
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,850
I didn’t agree at that moment.

470
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,770
Before he’s discharged,

471
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,370
I’m obliged to tell him the risk.

472
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,130
He said you had a bad attitude.

473
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,610
Given my limited experience
being with you,

474
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,900
that’s likely to happen.

475

Time is up.

476
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,170
Sorry, but I’d like to ask...

477
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,210
No question since you feel sorry.

478
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,940
That’s a courtesy.

479
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,330
I still have to ask.

480
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,730
Mr. Lin wants an apology from you.

481
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,530
No.

482
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,010
Dr. Wen.

483
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,090
Could you please assist with my work?

484
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,970
I’m here to mediate,

485
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,140
not looking for troubles.

486
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,410
He doesn’t eat,

487
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,540
and you don’t explain it.

488
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,810
How can I settle it?

489
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,570
Mediation is not like a handshake.

490
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,570
If it is that easy,

491
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,530
your work will be meaningless.

492
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,130
Thanks for knowing the value of my work.

493
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,980
I didn’t mean that.

494
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,400
I have a summary for you to write.

Can I come when you’re off work?

496

You can’t.

497
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
How can I come to you?

498
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,200

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,840
Are you threatening me?

516
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,000
No, I didn’t mean that.

517
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,080
I just want you to write a briefing.

518
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,560
You’d better know that

519
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,280
you’re getting a doctor occupied.

520
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,520
The outpatient service
is about to be over.

521
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,610
If not you,

522
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,880
I could’ve had one more patient.

523
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,080
I’ve registered and paid

524
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,090
for your time to talk with me.

525
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,200
I’m sorry.

526
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,370
No personal affairs during my work,

527
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,130
unless your brain has a problem.

528
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,760
(Medical casebook)

529
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,170
I’m pissed off.

530
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,050
Look at that cloud.

531
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,200
Isn’t it like a pig?

532
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,050
Sorry.

533
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,330
That’s not me just now.

534
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,570
Today, I’m just a little bit

535
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,480
crazy.

536
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,720
I’m not laughing at you.

537
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,960
It’s that one.

538
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,770
Medical casebook?

539
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,610
Um.

540
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,800
What’s funny?

541
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,450
This medicine is special,

542
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,960
not available in drugstores.

543
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,360
What is it?

544
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,850
Idiotic pills.

545
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,070
Can I have the casebook?

546
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,290
I wanna collect it.

547
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,720
Take it. You’re welcome.

548
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,810
Thanks.

549
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,090
Are you new here?

550
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,070
Actually, Dr. Wen is

551
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,840
the ideal boyfriend voted by nurses.

552
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,810
No.1.

553
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,610
Many girls like him.

554
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,480
For his good look?

555
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,920
Certainly not.

556
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,450
He graduated from a top medical school,

557
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,810
but he doesn’t pull rank at all.

558
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,570
He’s really responsible for patients.

559
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,160
I’ve seen many times that

560
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,360
he worked overtime voluntarily

561
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,130
to look after the patients.

562
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,330
Are we talking about the same guy?

563
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,170
Do you have a grudge against him?

564
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,720
How did you know it?

565
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,690
From the medicines he prescribed
for you.

566
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,090
He must be furious.

567
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,310
Doctors are the busiest
on outpatient days.

568
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,320
They can’t even

569
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,600
have a sip of water all day

570
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,520
so as to serve more patients.

571
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,400
Yet you came to him.

572
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,520
That’s a taboo.

573
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,960
Is it so?

574
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,050
He even refused his acquaintances

575
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,600
to cut in.

576
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,680
Let alone you were not sick.

577
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,480
Crap.

578
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,280
Should I apologize to him now?

579
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,760
I’m leaving.

580
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,410
He’s off work.

581
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,280
Do you know where he went?

582
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,440
Are you off work?

583
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,610
Wen Rang.

584
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,890
What brings you here?

585
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,480
I’m your uncle. Remember the hierarchy.

586
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,850
Don’t take advantage of me.

587
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,330
You’re only a few years elder than me.

588
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,890
Where is the dog?

589
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,090
At home.

590
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,480
Have a drink with me.

591
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,520
I will drive. No.

592
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,050
Scolded by my grandpa again?

593
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,520
I suppose he is living this long

594
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,240
just to scold me.

595
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,650
You asked for it.

596
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,480
If you don’t wanna be scolded,

597
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,240
then don’t be against him.

598
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,720
Start a business and get married.

599
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,480
Do as he pleases. That’s it.

600
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,360
I have a bookstore and sell poems.

601
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,290
What else should I do?

602
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,450
Only two books were sold,

603
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,920
which are paid by me for my colleagues.

604
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,240
I’ve told him today.

605
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,770
If I can’t sell 3,000 books
in half a year,

606
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,610
I’ll be at his disposal.

607
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,330
I’m in dire straits.

608
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,610
Why having wine then?

609
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,600
Go back for some tea

610
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,920
and think about how to sell books.

611
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,360
Won’t you drink with me?

612
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,240
No.

613
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,960
Why are you so stubborn?

614
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,960
As if she could come here.

615
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,640
You’ll stand here for hours

616
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,410
and then come to me for a drink.

617
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,610
It’s been years.

618
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,490
Think about it.

619
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,170
What if she would never turn up?

620
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,010
You... You are really leaving?

621
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,840
Why are you crying?

622
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,090
You are my best friend.

623
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,400
I... I don’t want you to leave.

624
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,930
Alright. Don’t cry.

625
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,530
My mom said

626
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,520
I’d stay with my grandma for a few days.

627
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,810
I’ll be back soon,

628
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,840
before the school starts.

629
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,840
Really?

630
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,480
You have my word.

631
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,090
I’ll marry you once I’m back.

632
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,490
You’re a girl.

633
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,760
I’ll propose to marry you.

634
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,280
Alright.

635
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,170
Cong Rong, time to go.

636
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,170
I’m leaving.

637
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,840
Let’s go.

638
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,240
OK.

639
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,650
See you next term! I’m waiting for you!

640
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,880
I’ll wait for you here when I’m back!

641
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,650
Even before you left,

642
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,680
I hadn’t told you

643
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,010
I was Wen Shaoqing from Class 9.

644
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,010
I’ll wait for you here when I’m back!

645
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,610
Your clothes are wet.

646
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,280
Dr. Wen. Sorry if I disturbed you.

647
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,870
It’s you.

648
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,430
I’m here to apologize.

649
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
I took the liberty to meet you.

650
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
I’ve reflected on it.

651
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,600
I was too impulsive.

652
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,310
I didn’t blame you for standing me up.

653
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,830
Whoever has the sense of responsibility

654
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,720
would do the same.

655
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,120
And, yesterday,

656
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,470
you left the pen at the airport.

657
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,390
Here it is.

658
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,350
I wanna turn a new leaf by this chance.

659
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,790
I’m an intern here from Daren Law Firm.

660
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,680
Nice to meet you.

661
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,760
My name is Cong Rong.

662
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,500
What’s your name again?

663
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,720
Cong Rong!

664
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,120
You’re finally here.

665
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,830
I’ve been waiting for you.

666
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,080
I thought he hugged me mistakenly.

667
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,430
Actually not.

668
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,040
He just came a long way here

669
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,760
and reached the destination

670
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,680
one step ahead before me.

671
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,570
To meet again

672
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,280
is nothing incidental.

673
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,490
It’s because

674
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,720
someone has been waiting there

675
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
all the time.
