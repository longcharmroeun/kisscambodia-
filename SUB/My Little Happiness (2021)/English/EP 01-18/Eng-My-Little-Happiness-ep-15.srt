I’m gonna give you a heads-up.

The court of first instance,
however, ruled otherwise.

53
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,730
The court of first instance applied
double standards

in the requirement of burden of proof.

55

Second, the court of first instance
applied the wrong legal procedure.

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,130
It’s still warm.

174
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,290
Your face is swollen.

175
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,050
What’s going on?

176
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,890
Tell him to turn around.

177
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,530
Wen.

178
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,250
Your girlfriend is asking you
to turn around.

179
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,010
She’s embarrassed.

180
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,890
Alright.

181
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,920
Wen’s girlfriend.

182
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,410
Open your mouth wider.

183
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,730
My name is Cong Rong.

184
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,960
Just call me that.

185
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,010
Sure,

186
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,410
Wen’s girlfriend.

187
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,650
Keep your head up.

188
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,530
All done.

189
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,010
I'll prescribe some medicine.

190
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,320
When the inflammation goes down,

191
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,560
we’ll see if we want to pull the tooth.

192
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,250
Hold on.

193
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,330
The position and shape of your tooth

194
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,440
is very characteristic.

195
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,200
I can draw on from this case.

196
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,530
Wen’s girlfriend.

197
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,680
Do you mind if we take a picture
of your tooth?

198
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,770
No, I don’t.

199
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,050
How is she?

200
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,170
Em.

201
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,440
A pretty woman.

202
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,490
Very ladylike.

203
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,200
Even with her swollen face.

204
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,650
I’m asking about her situation.

205
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,730
Not a big problem.

206
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,650
It’s just an inflamed tooth.

207
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,800
We’ll just remove it.

208
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,810
Eating will be a problem these days.

209
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,410
Eat more cold and soft food.

210
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,650
OK.

211
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,410
Got it.

212
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,130
Thanks.

213
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,290
I’ll buy you a juice later.

214
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,280
Alright, alright.

215
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,130
No more pictures.

216
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,770
Watching her is enough.

217
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,300
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

218
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,610
Good morning.

219
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,770
You’re here early.

220
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,450
The orders keep coming lately.

221
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,130
So I came to see if I could help.

222
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,610
You’re out of tape,

223
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,560
and you don’t have a spare.

224
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,770
I just bought two new rolls.

225
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,440
And the box cutter.

226
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,960
Yours was rusty.

227
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,170
I replaced the blade.

228
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,370
And... this!

229
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,200
Here.

230
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,680
What is this?

231
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,130
I don’t want you to get cold.

232
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,600
I didn’t realize how thin
your clothes were

233
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,680
until I put your coat on yesterday.

234
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,970
It costs all my savings.

235
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,010
You have to wear it.

236
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,840
Are you busy lately?

237
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,050
Yeah.

238
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,170
I need to pack up these books.

239
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,920
I mean your own business.

240
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,890
Aren’t you going to reopen your store?

241
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,960
Why you keep coming here?

242
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,010
It’s not reopened yet.

243
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,170
So I take my time and come here.

244
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,720
I’ll come back there
when it’s reopened.

245
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,490
I’ll leave the clothes here.

246
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,680
I don’t need any more clothes.

247
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,320
Take it back.

248
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,980
I brought it in your size.

249
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,490
Who else can wear it?

250
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,010
Well, just give me a second.

251
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,720
The money for the clothes
and your work here.

252
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,920
Tell me if it’s not enough.

253
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,200
Why are you treating me like a stranger?

254
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,930
You’re as poor as a church mouse.

255
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,170
It’s better to make it clear.

256
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,770
It’s not busy here today.

257
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,170
You can go back to work.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,770
Is… Is it because
I saw the video yesterday?

259
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,960
Are you still mad?

260
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,290
It still hurts?

261
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,490
A… A little.

262
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,250
Anything else bothering you?

263
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,490
It’s OK.

264
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,840
You haven’t eaten yet.

265
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,960
You must be starving.

266
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,290
Come and eat.

267
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,920
I’m not hungry.

268
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,010
I’ll just go back.

269
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,410
Eat something before you go.

270
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,760
Careful, it’s hot.

271
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,320
If you want to eat,

272
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,890
just take the mask off.

273
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,720
I know your face is swollen.

274
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,960
Stop looking.

275
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,370
Why can’t I look?

276
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,800
Because I’m ugly.

277
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,920
You are?

278
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,960
Why do I feel the same way?

279
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,720
So you’re saying I’m ugly.

280
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,320
I mean you’re pretty as before.

281
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,930
It’s like when Rangyirang
got stung by a bee.

282
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,650
I don’t think it’s much different.

283
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,650
Good,

284
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,010
now you’re saying I’m like a dog.

285
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,770
You…

286
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,960
What I’m saying is,

287
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,250
in my eyes,

288
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,930
no matter what you’ve become,

289
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,120
you’re still my Cong Rong.

290
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,040
Wen Shaoqing.

291
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,490
Are you asleep?

292
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,530
Wen Shaoqing?

293
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,800
How about

294
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,050
go sleep on the bed?

295
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,600
You mean we’re going to bed together?

296
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,210
You rogue.

297

<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

298
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,380
Wait.

299
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,820
Wait.

300
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,530
Wait.

Why are you here?

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,360
I’m here to see your cousin.

305
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,600
Look at you.

306
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,250
Did you piss her off again?

Chengcheng.

308
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,840
You and my cousin are close.

309
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,120
Do you know she’s in love?

310
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah.

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Do you know who her boyfriend is?

Isn’t it Wen Shaoqing?

313
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,840
Oh, my God!

314
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,050
I’m the only person in the world
who doesn’t know.

315
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,160
But you have your cousin.

316

As long as she got your back,

317
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,450
you’ll be fine.

318

You’re right.

319
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,770
So you’re here to ask her for help, too?

320
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,360
I heard you’re working for
my boss’s uncle.

321
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,600
Is he a tough one?

322
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,050
Yeah.

323
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,800
How can someone be so unromantic?

324
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,360
We’re the same.

325
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,320
Boss’s uncle.

326
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,250
That just sounds like
an even harder problem.

327
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,080
I could feel your desperation
when you’re around him.

328
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,880
But you’ll be out of your misery
in a few days.

329

I, however,

330
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,050
may never see the light of day.

331
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,880
Zhong Zhen.

332
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,120
You do care about me, don’t you?

333
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,640
Of course.

334
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,050
Why are you dragging my ear?

335
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,210
Why are you like my mom?

336
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,210
You pervert.

337
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,410
You dare to say I’m like your mom?

338
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:02,900
No…

339
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,450
Are you tired of living?

340
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,920
It hurts.

341
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,010
Just hold it a little longer.

342
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,820
It hurts.

343
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,250
No, I can’t. Too painful.

344
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,560
Just hold it a little longer.

345
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,880
It hurts.

346
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,770
Hang in there.

347
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,130
I can’t.

348
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,160
Too painful.

349
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,690
How about I buy you some pain-killers?

350
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,120
Should we knock

351
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,560
or leave?

352
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,120
Just wait.

353
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,080
It’s gonna take ten minutes or so.

354
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,300
So you’re fast, Zhong Zhen.

355
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,450
No. I’m just using
medical common sense.

356
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,600
If my cousin and boss are happy,

357
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,800
maybe she could forget about me.

358
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,210
Em.

359
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,080
It’s better if she does.

360
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:06,930
Relax…

361
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,010
Boss!

362
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,290
You are… Fast.

363
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,170
Why are you here

364
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,050
if you’re not gonna knock?

365
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,340
Zhong Zhen.

366
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,600
Since when were you a paparazzi?

367
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,640
No.

368
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,450
Boss.

369
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,810
I mean, brother-in-law.

370
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,720
I’m here to see my cousin.

371
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,770
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>
And I brought some medicine.

372
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,080
Make sure you tell my cousin

373
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,770
that I gave it to you.

374
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,360
And I care about her.

375
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,050
See you.

376
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,600
Bye, boss.

377
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,010
I just put some medicine on it.

378
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,010
Don’t talk now.

379
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,880
Rong.

380
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,080
What happened to you?

381
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,880
It makes me sad.

382
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,160
Come here. Come here.

383
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,250
Take a picture.

384
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,880
You look like a pig now.

385
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,370
Please.

386
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,250
Save it.

387
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,880
I can’t understand

388
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,690
a word you’re saying.

389
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,290
She said “Why are you here?”

390
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,450
"Leave."

391
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,560
You got all that?

392
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,930
It’s nice to have a boyfriend

393
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,690
who’s thoughtful and understanding.

394
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,120
She said
“Why do you sound so jealous?”

395
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,210
“Aren’t you chasing Wen Rang?”

396
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,530
Wen Rang?

397
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,300
My uncle?

398
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,930
Yeah.

399
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,840
So you’re here to see me?

400
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,120
Well, tell me about it.

401
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,290
What’s going on?

402
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,560
Can you help me?

403
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,930
He’s a hard one.

404
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,400
I don’t like easy ones.

405
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,930
And I don’t like those who like me.

406
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,320
Your uncle is perfect.

407
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,640
He is not a simp,

408
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,930
and he has characters.

409
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,120
I think he’s perfect for me.

410
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,120
He is quite a catch.

411
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,690
All his suitors have been turned down.

412
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,210
Are you sure about this?

413
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,730
Of course.

414
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,800
I only care about one question now.

415
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,000
Is his girlfriend still in the picture?

416
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,930
No, she’s definitely not.

417
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,800
Well, that’s a relief.

418
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,290
I have confidence.

419
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,160
As a friend,

420
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,850
can’t you give me

421
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,400
some hints?

422
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,530
Like your home address.

423
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,850
What does your mother…?
No, no, no,

424
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,490
what your grandma

425
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,860
or grandpa like?

426
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,540
So I can have targets.

427
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,770
You’re wasting your time

428
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,010
on Wen Rang

429
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,690
for nothing.

430
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,060
So you won’t help me?

431
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,780
Do you have any idea

432
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,970
what I went through

433
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,730
to get you and Cong Rong together?

434
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,850
Like last time with the soup,

435
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,860
after you left,

436
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,690
I said a lot of nice things about you.

437
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,250
And… And that time
she was jealous of Dr. Qin.

438
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,360
She was furious.

439
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,970
She... She said she wanted
to end with you immediately.

440
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,290
I was the one who convinced her

441
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,900
that a good man like Wen Shaoqing

442
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,370
would never cheat.

443
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,050
I had a hard time convincing her.

444
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,530
It’s OK.

445
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,370
These things are in the past.

446
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,860
Wen Shaoqing won’t mind.

447
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,600
Is that so?

448
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,570
No.

449
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,490
No.

450
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,050
That is not the point now.

451
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,360
The point is that

452
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,960
I really worked hard
for your relationship.

453
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,600
Can’t you help me now?

454
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,080
OK. Alright.

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,690
Thank you.

458
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,690
Rong.

459
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,160
I never thought I could be
not only your friend,

460
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,290
but your relative.

461
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,530
Wait to call me Auntie.

462
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:51,860
See you.

463
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,170
I’ll leave you two love birds alone.

464
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,860
Goodbye, nephew.

465
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,930
Bye-bye, nephew’s wife.

466
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,450
I’ve been demoted.

467
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,450
So at that time,

468
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,530
you were jealous?

469
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,290
I’m done chatting.

470
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,120
I’m gonna read.

471
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,530
Working so hard?

472
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,730
There are things I don’t understand.

473
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,970
I’m new to the job.

474
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,050

bad habit of skipping lunch?

486

Stop.

487
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,900

Having lunch?

Uh-huh.

494
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,690
Porridge for lunch?

495
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,160
Uh-huh.

496
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,210
I have a toothache,

497
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,080
so I have to eat porridge.

498
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,730
Well, you need to eat healthier
and take more rest.

499
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,840
Mr. Shangguan.

500
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,340
Didn’t you say I could always

501
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,690
ask you questions?

502
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,800
You got any?

503
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,770
Uh-huh.

504
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,210
Being a lawyer is quite different
from what I expected.

505
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,210
I thought I’d be dealing with

506
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,690
the big cases,

507
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,690
but actually it’s more

508
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,170
of family matters.

509
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,050
These civil disputes require
the preparation of lots of materials.

510
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,980
They take a lot of time.

511
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,040
So you think

512
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,320
it’s not what you want?

513
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,650
Uh-huh.

514
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,320
Let me ask you something.

515
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,040
What is a lawyer?

516
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,940
How to communicate with the client,

517
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,590
and the People’s Procuratorate?

518
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,720
How to keep in mind the proceedings,

519
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,390
avoid errors that may
affect the right to sue,

520
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,740
be familiar with the writing
of various texts,

521
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,990
and try to do the best you can
with each copy?

522
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,480
Though you’re doing small things,

523
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,030
you can learn a lot

524
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,220
by doing them well.

525
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,260
I see.

526
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,390
Mr. Shangguan.

527
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,230
Do we have a trademark case to present?

528
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,460
Let me help you with that.

529
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,390
There’s still a part left.

530
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,590
I’ll leave it to you, then.

531
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,900
Give it to me by the end of the day.

532
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,530
OK.

533
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,780
It gives me time to see a client.

534
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,170
Uh-huh.

535
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,380
Guess what I saw.

536
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,780
For the first time ever, Shangguan

537
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,060
is comforting the younger generation.

538
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
<i>Miss Xu</i>
He’s Cong Rong’s advisor.

539
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,490
Isn’t that normal?

540
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,300
Why do you like to gossip?

541
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,380
No, no, no.

542
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,970
From what I know of Shangguan,

543
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,580
when has he ever been
so gentle with his subordinates?

544
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,250
As a man,

545
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,250
I think there’s something

546
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,780
going on here.

547
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,540
Let’s make a bet.

548
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,100
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

549
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,300
<i>Cong Rong</i>

550
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,660
<i>I just got out of surgery.Are you
still working? I’ll pick you up now</i>

551
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,180
<i>I just got out of surgery.Are you
still working? I’ll pick you up now</i>

552
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,770
Great!

553
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,210
Yes!

554
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,120
Come on.

555
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,160
Give me a ride.

556
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,010
Give me a ride.

557
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,530
Drive.

558
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,400
Excuse me.

559
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,400
My right seat is only for my girlfriend.

560
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,400
Who are you?

561
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,540
Why don’t you just pretend

562
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,010
I’m your girlfriend now?

563
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,490
No, no, no.

564
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,900
Don’t you see the hospital benefits?

565
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,960
These are Sanbao’s and

566
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,340
nurses’ benefits which
they didn’t want.

567
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,560
I have to take them all.

568
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,690
I’ve been on my feet all day.

569
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,730
I can’t take another step.

570
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,360
Where’s your car?

571
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,690
Sanbao is driving it.

572
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,340
The hospital finally gave her holidays.

573
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,730
I have to let her go and enjoy it.

574
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,570
No wonder the nurses say

575
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,450
Dr. Chen loves his wife so much.

576
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,720
They’re right.

577
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,450
Of course.

578
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,540
Then I must learn from Dr. Chen.

579
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,400
I have to pick up
my girlfriend from work.

580
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,360
Good-bye.

581
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,240
No… Wen Shaoqing.

582
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,120
No, no, no!

583
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,320
Wen Shaoqing.

584
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,120
How can you do this?

585
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,930
I just wanted a ride and
you showed off right in my face.

586
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,640
Qin Chu.

587
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,250
Chen Cu.

588
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,080
Did you drive?

589
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,210
I took a cab.

590
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,690
Let me give you my rice.

591
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,530
Here.

592
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,600
I can’t take them.

593
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,930
No need to thank me.

594
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,490
Bye-bye.

595
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,100
I’ll see you around.

596
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,540
Wait.

597
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,210
Qin Chu.

598
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:45,890
You’re not listening to me.

599
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,560
Qin Chu.

600
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,490
I…

601
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,490
What are these people?

602
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,840
Don’t give them to me!

603
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,210
No one likes you!

604
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,090
Yes!

605
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,580
Stop eating.

606
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,210
Come here.

607
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,900
My life savior.

608
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,560
Go!

609
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,410
My steamed buns.

610
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:05,820
I’ll get them for you.

611
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,330
Go.

612
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,840
Go.

613
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,530
Oh, savior!

614
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,770
Cong Rong.

615
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,250
Mr. Shangguan.

616
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:29,930
Mr. Shangguan.

617
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,320
I still have a little left.

618
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,540
But rest assured,

619
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,530
I’ll sort things up.

620
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,780
I won’t delay your work.

621
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,640
How much is left?

622
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,450
I got…

623
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,080
Mr. Shangguan.

624
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,200
I offered to help.

625
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,880
I promise I can handle it.

626
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,890
But according to your way of doing it,

627
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,930
you might not be able to
make it clear before the hearing.

628
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,490
Am I causing you any trouble?

629
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,560
Let me ask you.

630
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
How many types of evidence here?

631
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,970
And which is the most important?

632
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,290
I think there are seven parts.

633
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,360
Company profile of the applicant.

634
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,210
The origin of the trademark,
the design draft and so on.

635
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,770
Trademark publicity materials.

636
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,160
I’m not talking about them.

637
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,640
I’m asking you,

638
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,210
do you know about evidence permutation?

639
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,320
Evidence permutation?

640
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,010
The first tier is the most important.

641
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,560
Evidence that directly affects
the outcome of a verdict.

642
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,210
The second tier is the evidence

643
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,560
submitted by the parties,

644
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,300
which may not determine
the outcome of the case,

645
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,860
<i>Civil Ruling</i>

646
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,290
but will have a certain impact
on the judge's judgment.

647
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,970
For instance, these.

648
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,730
Screenshots on the website.

649
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,800
Pictures from the company.

650
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,850
Business information.

651
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,580
The management team.

652
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,050
And recharging records.

653
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,540
Credit card bills.

654
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,200
A printed bill from ATM.

655
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,360
Screenshots of the total amount.

656
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,640
Screenshots of messages.

657
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,010
And the third-party transactions.

658
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,900
<i>The first tier</i>

659
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,970
And then the third tier evidence.

660
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,530
And then the fourth tier.

661
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,490
It goes on like this.

662
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,120
Got it?

663
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,120
I got it.

664
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,730
Thank you for your instruction.

665
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,970
Time is precious for lawyers.

666
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,770
If I’m not here,

667
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,320
you can ask another lawyer.

668
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,320
I understand.

669
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,900
<i>Girlfriend</i>

670
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,970
Oh, my God!

671
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,530
It’s so late already.

672
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,160
My eyes are glued to
the chain of evidence.

673
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,720
I didn’t even notice.

674
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,160
How much longer is it gonna take?

675
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,290
It’s gonna be a while.

676
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,820
However,

677
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,050
thanks to Mr. Shangguan
guiding me personally,

678
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,170
otherwise,

679
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,720
I don't think I can finish it today.

680
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,970
Personally?

681
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,970
I’m not approving it.

682
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,950
You keep making jokes. I’m hanging up.

683
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,550
Are you home yet?

684
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,310
I’m gonna be up pretty late today.

685
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,710
Go to bed early when you get home.

686
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,880
Don’t wait up for me.

687
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,220
How late is it gonna be?

688
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,030
You have to rest.

689
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,340
Article 520 of the labor law
clearly stipulates

690
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,220
that no one may occupy
the time of another’s girlfriend’s love.

691
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,300
Then you must not have read Article 521.

692
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,150
Doctors and lawyers are not

693
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,220
covered by labor law.

694
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,660
You’re getting more like my girlfriend.

695
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,470
You can follow my stupid talks.

696
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,030
You’re getting more like my boyfriend.

697
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,300
You can make up terms.

698
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,780
I’m getting old and forgetting things.

699
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,070
What is the number I just made up?

700
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,990
520. <i>Means I love you</i>

701
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,990
520.

702
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,910
All right.

703
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,950
I should get back to work.

704
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,510
Go get some rest.

705
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,380
Off you go.

706
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,950
Text me when you’re done.

707
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,740
<i>Daren Law Firm</i>

708
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,110
Mr. Shangguan.

709
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,030
Aren't you hungry?

710
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,660
I ordered takeout.

711
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,360
Take a break.

712
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,220
Let's eat something.

713
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,340
It’s so late already?

714
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,950
I completely forgot about dinner.

715
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,980
<i>Daren Law Firm</i>

716
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,380
Thanks.

717
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,030
You really don’t know
what you’re eating.

718
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,340
Pardon me.

719
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,300
I’m used to it.

720
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,630
Mr. Shangguan.

721
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,880
The health of a lawyer
is also very important,

722
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,150
otherwise, it would be
irresponsible to the client.

723
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,510
I’m just saying maybe we should

724
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,180
focus on the food.

725
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,470
This time, you won the case.

726
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,380
Dig in.

727
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,300
<i>Are you still at work?
I’ll wait for you downstairs</i>
