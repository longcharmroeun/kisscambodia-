Dr. Wen is ready.

(Surgery powerhouse. No admittance.)

33

(Patient Access)

35
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,630
(Beijing Time)
The encephalic angioma has ruptured

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,870
which caused the patient
a serious intracranial hemorrhage.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,000
I’m worried it may cause
a cerebral hernia.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,830
An immediate craniotomy is necessary
for finding the hemorrhagic spot

39
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,870
and clearing away the extravasated blood.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,710
The cerebroma has twined
with the blood vessels.

41
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,000
When looking for the hemorrhagic spot,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,750
be careful.

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,260
Find the hemorrhagic spot first.

44
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,660
Hurry up.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,220
We’ve stopped the bleeding.

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,760
Transfer the blood now.

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,820
Get ready to take out the tumor.

48
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,300
(Clock Beijing Time)

49
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,350
Why aren’t you home yet?

50
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,160
Did the surgery go well?

51
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,030
How’s the old man?

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,980
He needs to stay in ICU for observation
for a few days.

53
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,220
When can he wake up?

54
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,190
It doesn’t help to blame yourself.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,940
It’ll only tire yourself out.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,470
Listen to me.

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:16,910
It’s weekend time.

58
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,790
Go and have some sleep.

59
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,660
What about you?

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,230
Don’t you know

61
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,390
that doctors don’t need sleep?

62
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,270
Boss.

63
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,830
Though doctors don’t need sleep.

64
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,390
The young and helpless trainees do.

65
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,000
Can I...?

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,860
Sure.

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,780
Isn’t the trolley waiting for you?

68
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,980
(Medical Waste)

69
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,660
Fine.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,710
Losers don’t deserve to sleep.

71
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,590
You want to sleep?

72
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,420
Help me first.

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,070
Rong!

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,300
You’re back.

75
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,910
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,320
I had a feeling that

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,020
you’re not happy today.

78
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,920
I need to come personally
to comfort you.

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,470
You can try my cooking, too.

80
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,460
(Get Mr. Lin down.)

81
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,910
Don’t move.

82
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,150
Follow the order.

83
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,180
Help!

84
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,150
Don’t move!

85
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,430
Everyone follows the order!

86
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,830
It’s too hard.

87
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,510
Who are you talking to?

88
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,390
Oil.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,760
Lady.

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,710
The way you get all dressed up

91
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,000
makes it feel like you’re
about to set a fire.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,660
Set the fire of love?

93
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,680
Say that you love me.

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,230
I’ve never tried this hard on men.

95
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,000
I’ve received your love.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,620
I got it.

97
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
You, you, you. Be careful.

98
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,470
The oil may splash.

99
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,590
I don’t want to startle firefighters.

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,100
How come I am eating the night snack?

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,310
I’m here to take care of you.

102
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,150
It’s fine.

103
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,060
Enjoy it.

104
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,270
I have no appetite.

105
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,510
Do you still feel guilty
about the old man?

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,300
Actually, I know what Wen Shaoqing
said is correct.

107
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,740
I did cross the line.

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,980
If I didn’t blow up the affair,

109
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,680
the man may be sitting in the hospital
safe and sound now.

110
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,390
Don’t be silly.

111
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,320
Don’t take all the blame
on yourself.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,470
You’re full.

113
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
Sorry.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,070
It’s too hard.

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,070
What I mean is

116
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,390
that even you didn’t follow up today,

117
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,620
the old man would have the surgery
sooner or later.

118
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,740
Here’s an example.

119
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,360
Like if I break up with someone.

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,880
Another example.

121
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,740
This one is unlucky.

122
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,830
What if I break up for real?

123
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,590
For real?

124
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,710
Why?

125
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,000
I thought things were fine
a few days ago.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,670
Never mind.

127
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,540
It doesn’t matter.

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,260
My feelings come and go fast anyway.

129
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,230
That’s right.

130
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,150
I’ve seen it.

131
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,310
I think

132
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,030
these two things are similar.

133
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,030
Look,

134
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,820
if the bastard keeps hiding from me,

135
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,680
I’m probably happy now.

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,460
But how long can it last?

137
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,560
Do you mean that

138
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
the old man will find
out the truth sooner or later?

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,510
So, it’s meaningless
to pretend everything is fine?

140
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
Exactly.

141
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,070
That’s what I mean.

142
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,220
An unqualified boyfriend is
like a tumor.

143
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,630
It’ll blast anyway.

144
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,470
Realize early, break up early.
Blast early and get treatment early.

145
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,440
What a fallacy.

146
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,620
How is it a fallacy?

147
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,150
Rong.

148
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,950
If I were the old man,

149
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,320
I’d appreciate you.

150
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,920
I know that you’ve done

151
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,390
everything you could.

152
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,420
I’m proud of you.

153
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,670
Boss.

154
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,740
Chengcheng sent a message.

155
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,950
Your cousin is finally asleep.

156
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,230
Don’t worry.

157
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,180
I didn’t know a brat can be so caring.

158
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,820
She means I’m the brat.

159
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,630
The brat is me.

160
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,120
Not you.

161
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,070
Are there more?

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,660
There’s one more picture.

163
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,150
Though I don’t know
why I should show you,

164
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,660
my survival instinct made me do it.

165
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,150
Boss.

166
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,660
I feel that

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,430
you care a lot about my cousin.

168
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,980
W... Why?

169
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,830
Give it a guess.

170
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,900
If you’re wrong, then redo the essay.

171
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,790
Well. It must be that you care
about your students.

172
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,350
You care about me.

173
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,950
You care about my family, too.

174
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,740
Enough.

175
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,950
Go and take a sleep.

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,190
Why are you here?

177
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,140
I’m here for you.

178
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,020
I guess you’ve never wanted
to see me this much.

179
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,220
That’s true.

180
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,900
How’s Mr. Lin?

181
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,430
He left the ICU.

182
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,070
But he’s still in a coma.

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,590
I’d like to go to the supermarket
for hospitalization necessities.

184
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,380
In case he needs them when he’s awake.

185
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,470
Perfect timing.

186
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,860
I’m off today.

187
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,980
I’ll go with you.

188
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,020
Sure.

189
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,620
Cong Rong.

190
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,980
May I ask you something?

191
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,260
What?

192
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,020
Why don’t you wear the clothes I bought?

193
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,470
Are they ugly?

194
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,020
Are you rolling your eyes?

195
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Don’t take it wrong.

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,550
I’m just doing eye exercise.

197
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,070
Patient’s meal requires
self-prepared tableware.

198
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,790
No shower after surgery.

199
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,590
Prepare more disposable clothes.

200
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,830
And basin, towel, toothbrush,
and napkin.

201
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,740
Prepare them all.

202
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,670
I got them all.

203
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,440
I also got a sippy cup.

204
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,070
He can drink while laying down.
And a table board

205
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,800
for him to watch some videos.

206
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,740
It’ll make him happier.
You take care of the urinal.

207
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
What else do we need?

208
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,830
In case we miss something important.

209
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,140
Get this, too.

210
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,340
Is a night-robe necessary for him?

211
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,500
This is not for Mr. Lin.

212
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,860
Take it back.

213
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,220
XXXL.

214
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
This isn’t my size.

215
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,790
It’s for myself.

216
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,190
The one at your home doesn’t fit me.

217
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,860
Do you think you still have a chance
to wear it again?

218
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,980
Maybe.

219
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,310
I didn’t volunteer to go last time.

220
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,790
Eye exercise isn’t like this.

221
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,830
Too frequent exercise
of superior rectus and infrarectus

222
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,260
may cause you a facial paralysis.

223
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,950
What a petty man.

224
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,550
I want to be independent.

225
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,980
Okay, okay.

226
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,560
Chengcheng.

227
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,670
What are you doing?

228
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,670
Be gentle, okay?

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,140
This is the rudraksha your father

230
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,950
bought last week.

231
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,220
In your eyes,

232
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,310
am I just like the rudraksha?

233
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,380
Not even close.

234
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,340
You always find us troubles.

235
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,620
Rudraksha doesn’t.

236
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,790
Chengcheng.

237
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,140
Think about it.

238
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,710
No matter what you do,

239
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,590
we always support you.

240
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,380
We spend money to make you happy.

241
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,550
Doesn’t it show our love for you?

242
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,260
Stop being wayward.

243
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,500
I’m wayward?

244
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,310
Let’s be honest.

245
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,830
You just want me to join

246
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,980
your self-pity, don't you?

247
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,100
Should I be grateful and kneel down?

248
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,860
What else do you want?

249
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,790
You cry to be independent.

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,340
Maybe you should give back

251
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,110
what I gave you first.

252
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,710
That’s why I’m here.

253
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,560
I drove the car.

254
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,590
It’s downstairs.

255
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,590
And these, too.

256
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,060
Take them back.

257
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,980
The apartment…

258
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,740
I can’t give it back to you now.

259
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,680
I can pay you rent according
to the market price though.

260
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,070
No, no, no!

261
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,520
Chengcheng.

262
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,700
Your dad was mad.

263
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,520
He didn’t mean what he said.

264
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,630
He wasn’t serious.

265
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,790
But I am.

266
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,550
I’m not kidding.

267
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,100
What do you want?

268
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,100
What are you doing?

269
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,980
Don’t cut the cards.

270
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,830
Are you crazy?

271
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,830
I want to be on my own.

272
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,500
I’ll live

273
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,500
my own life.

274
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,040
She left.

275
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Aren’t you gonna chase her?

276
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,900
Let her go.

277
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,100
You spoiled her too much.

278
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,310
Hello? Who’s this?

279
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,070
Mr. Wen Rang?

280
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,590
I’m Wang.

281
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,830
Our chief editor finds
your poem incredibly good.

282
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,020
Thank you.

283
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,630
However,

284
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,520
the publishing industry
is experiencing a hard time, too.

285
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,680
Collections of poems don’t make money.

286
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,150
We have families to support, too.

287
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,070
In this case,
the publication fees may...

288
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,620
Hello?

289
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,220
Mr. Wen Rang?

290
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,260
Hello?

291
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,550
Mr. Wen Rang?

292
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,830
Hello?

293
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,380
It’s fine.

294
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,380
Just thank him for me.

295
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,310
I’m thirsty.

296
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,980
I can’t afford water.

297
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,900
Am I gonna be exhausted to death here?

298
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,620
It’s so hard to be on my own.

299
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,980
(Walking steps)
Twenty-eight thousand!

300
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,900
How about

301
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,740
calling a cab?

302
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,950
No.

303
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,670
I won’t spend his money no matter what.

304
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,310
Wen Rang.

305
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,550
Wen Rang.

306
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,710
Wen Rang.

307
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,140
Help me. Wen Rang.

308
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,380
Don’t you know it’s dangerous?

309
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,430
Sorry.

310
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,590
It wasn’t on purpose.

311
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,020
Where are you going?

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,390
Back to the store.

313
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,100
Great.

314
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,380
I’m going back, too.

315
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,830
Give me a ride.

316
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,740
I want to be alone.

317
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,590
You can take the bus.

318
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,860
No.

319
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,590
I only have one car.

320
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,430
Bus 11.

321
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,070
I’m too tired.

322
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,500
Please.

323
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,140
Just take me back.

324
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,590
My step number has reached
the top in WeChat.

325
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,400
My back seat is only available for dogs.

326
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,310
Not for people.

327
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,140
Never mind.

328
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,700
Just pretend that I’m a dog.

329
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,830
I don’t care about which breed I am.

330
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,270
I just changed my opinions
on you a bit yesterday.

331
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,080
I didn’t expect you can be

332
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,380
so troublesome.

333
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,620
It’s okay.

334
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,460
Hate me all you want.

335
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,550
The giant has said it.

336
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,030
People ought

337
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,940
to have the courage
to be hated by others.

338
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,030
Which giant?

339
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,790
Me.

340
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,600
Bicycle’s back seat doesn’t

341
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,790
carry people older
than twelve years old.

342
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,940
Do you have any common sense?

343
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,750
How about this?

344
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,180
If we got caught,

345
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,230
it’s on me.

346
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,310
Illegally manned

347
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,430
will be fined 50 yuan.

348
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,310
Who’ll pay for it?

349
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,510
You will.

350
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,180
No, I can’t.

351
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,310
Go ahead.

352
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,550
People should be honest.

353
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,870
Sure.

354
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,830
I gave you my promise.

355
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,700
I will pay for it.

356
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,840
But can you spot me first?

357
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,620
No.

358
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,840
Just this one time.

359
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,420
A good neighbor is better
than a brother far off.

360
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,680
Being your neighbor

361
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,310
is the biggest waterloo of my life.

362
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,310
You...!

363
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,920
Fine.

364
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,790
I have no shame.

365
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,550
I have no money.

366
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,070
You don’t have what?

367
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,030
I don’t have money!

368
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,070
You dressed like this.

369
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,180
And you have no money?

370
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,790
How about

371
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,270
I give you my bag as a pledge?

372
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,390
Lend me five thousand first.

373
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,030
If I don’t know you,

374
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,180
I’d think you’re a fraud.

375
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
That’s ridiculous.

376
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,660
This is a limited-version.

377
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,480
Well... How about four thousand?

378
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,420
It couldn’t go less.

379
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,510
What are you doing?

380
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,190
Penalty

381
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,030
is for you to realize your mistake.

382
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,600
Are you bargaining?

383
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,590
Who will pay?

384
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,180
He will.

385
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,400
ID and your ticket.

386
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,030
Put them away.

387
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,550
Within 15 days,

388
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,140
fix the problem at the traffic brigade.

389
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,700
Where are you going?

390
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,590
What else?

391
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,070
What about me?

392
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,790
Are you gonna leave me here?

393
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,830
There’s still a long way to go.

394
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,550
Jesus.

395
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,420
Hold the bike.

396
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,510
I don’t want it.

397
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,830
Don’t go.

398
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,990
Don’t go.

399
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,070
Come back!

400
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,270
Why are you still here?

401
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,460
Are you staying with me
for my night shift?

402
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,990
I stop by to deliver things for Mr. Lin.

403
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,750
Is his condition stable?

404
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,680
Everything goes well.

405
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,830
Dr. Wen checked on him
couple of times every day.

406
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,840
Unluckily he’s got no children.

407
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,360
He expects nobody even he’s awake.

408
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,310
Quite poor.

409
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,440
Well.

410
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
You can call me if anything comes up.

411
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,750
I’ll come.

412
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,360
Okay.

413
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,030
Don’t worry.

414
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,180
I’ll be off now.

415
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,380
Mr. Lin.

416
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,790
I went to the police station today.

417
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
They got all your money back.

418
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,230
Are you happy?

419
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,860
I know that you don’t have children.

420
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,070
Well, I can count as one.

421
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,140
My number will be

422
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,900
your exclusive hotline in the future.

423
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,860
Hurry and wake up.

436
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:27,100
(Rang Kai Bookstore)

437
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,180
You are back?

438
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,070
I can’t ride.

439
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,180
My fifty yuan was worth it then.

440
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,550
You don’t deserve to be an intellectual.

441
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,550
You’re no gentleman.

442
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,790
I learned and applied immediately.

443
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,900
People ought to

444
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,160
have the courage to be hated by others.

445
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,830
You...

446
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,180
You really don’t have any money?

447
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,140
You’re broke?

448
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,700
Or what?

449
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,550
It’s not performance art.

450
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,600
Slow down.

451
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,620
Nobody’s rushing you.

452
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,750
I’ve made my decision.

453
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,510
I want to open a barbecue restaurant.

454
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,310
Are you sure?

455
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,590
Everybody comes to dinner tonight.

456
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,790
We can also talk
about this month’s work.

457
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,180
Roger.

458
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,950
How come it feels like

459
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,460
bad students are taking a final exam?

460
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,550
Come in, please.

461
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,750
This necklace

462
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,030
is a small present from the four of us.

463
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,880
It took me long to choose this.

464
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,830
Just try it on.

465
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,120
This will

466
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,160
definitely fit you.

467
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,870
Yeah.

468
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,180
You didn’t have to do this.

469
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,660
Hello.

470
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,600
Have a sit.

471
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,460
We all waited for you.

472
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,680
I’m sorry.

473
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,070
I didn’t know to prepare a present.

474
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,830
You don’t have to.

475
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,440
I’d like to take this opportunity

476
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,270
to make my point again.

477
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,880
I’m very grateful

478
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,900
for what you’ve done.

479
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,550
But the presents

480
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,030
are not necessary.

481
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,380
Thank you.

482
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,750
Okay.

483
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,470
Lucy.

484
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,220
What are you doing?

485
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,860
Come on.

486
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,790
Congratulations for completing
part of your internship successfully.

487
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,750
Cheers.

488
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,920
Thank you.

489
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,460
Here.

490
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,830
Good luck to you.

491
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,750
Let’s chat while eating.

492
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,990
Actually, I have

493
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,870
received all of your internship feedback

494
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,380
from your units.

495
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,750
But I’m still interested

496
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,860
in your personal feelings.

497
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,900
Who’s first?

498
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,070
I’ll go first.

499
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,400
Last month,

500
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,680
we finished three contract verification

501
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,550
following the seniors
of the law department.

502
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,830
We aborted an improper
acquisition project.

503
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,990
It went well in general.

504
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,120
Not bad.

505
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,840
Keep up the good work.

506
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,350
Okay.

507
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,830
Good.

508
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,740
What about others?

509
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,360
Well. I didn’t quite fit in
the first two weeks.

510
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,470
Jingjing was helping me a lot.

511
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,550
She’s really good.

512
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,460
The head office
has received the message.

513
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,990
Do you know?

514
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,460
Jingjing has not only

515
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,510
finished her own part of intern work,

516
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,350
but also signed a major client in film
and television for the company.

517
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,990
Actually,

518
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,900
I learned a lot from the seniors.

519
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,620
It’s better to actively
approach the market

520
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,550
than waiting for opportunities to come.

521
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,990
That’s pretty good.

522
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,990
How about Cong Rong?

523
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,030
I heard your internship
was quite exciting.

524
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,510
Did it go well?

525
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,750
My situation was simple.

526
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,460
It’s still in mediation.

527
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,550
Chengcheng.

528
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,100
I was defeated in today’s work report
as expected.

529
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,230
There’s an axiom in my head now.

530
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,900
It’s hard to take the first step.

531
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,070
The second step, too.

532
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,140
As well as the last step.

533
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,900
Cong Rong.

534
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,990
We decided to go
to karaoke after dinner.

535
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,230
Hurry up for dinner.

536
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,700
Okay.

537
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,600
Talk later.

538
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,790
I’m going to the karaoke.

539
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,750
It’s late.

540
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,790
Where are you going?

541
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,940
Wen Shaoqing?

542
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,540
(Febuxostat)

543
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,070
Stupid hand.

544
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,550
Why did you do that?

545
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,300
(Accident)

546
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,830
Cheers.

547
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,990
Who chose the song for me?

548
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,790
She did.

549
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,860
Let’s welcome a song from Lucy!

550
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,430
Alright.

551
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,310
I’ll give it a try.

552
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,070
I’ll give it a try.

553
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,580
(Wen Shaoqing)

554
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,510
How come

555
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,140
you are drinking by yourself?

556
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,550
You’ve really brought shame
on Mr. Shangguan.

557
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,640
What the top winning-rate lawyer

558
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,790
recommended is just a rookie like you.

559
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,550
A guy who’s never majored in law.

560
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,420
What are you even doing here?

561
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,790
Who says being a lawyer needs
to have majored in law?

562
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,910
First of all,

563
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,380
I did great in the judicial exam.

564
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,680
Secondly,

565
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,270
recommendation is a legit
selection system.

566
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,110
Plus,

567
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,830
I trust Mr. Shangguan’s judgment.

568
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,940
Are you two close?

569
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,670
Why do you care?

570
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,660
I like him.

571
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,590
I’m here because of him.

572
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,230
You can be the one who likes him.

573
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,750
I’ll be the one who stays.

574
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,100
Fine.

575
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,870
Have a great time singing
and playing here.

576
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,400
I’ve already paid the bill.

577
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,150
There’s something at the company.

578
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,020
See you.

579
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,700
Bye-bye.

580
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,460
Bye-bye.

581
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,700
Pour less.

582
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,140
Whose song is it?

583
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,070
It’s mine.

584
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,700
Who chose the song?

585
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,830
“The Chill” for Cong Rong.

586
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,420
My situation was simple.

587
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,830
It’s still in mediation.

588
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,100
And then?

589
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,180
The litigant is still in a coma.

590
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,940
You’re worse than being inconsiderate.

591
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,460
You are just reckless.

592
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,910
You’ve really brought shame
on Mr. Shangguan.

593
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,440
What the top winning-rate lawyer

594
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,550
recommended is just a rookie like you.

595
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,030
Wen Shaoqing.

596
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,750
I don’t need any bad news.

597
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,860
Mr. Lin is awake.

598
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,030
Really?

599
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,990
It’s true.

600
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,520
Cong Rong.

601
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,800
Thank you for saving Mr. Lin.

602
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,890
Thank you for what you’ve done.

603
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,360
Why did you drink so much?

604
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,650
Mr. Lin is awake.

605
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,650
I’m glad.

606
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,360
If you could have saved my dad,

607
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,410
it’d be great.

608
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,650
Wen Shaoqing.

609
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,050
Yes.

610
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,040
You are a good doctor.

611
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:27,930
I know.

612
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,890
It’s an honor to be your colleague.

613
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,970
I am honored, too.

614
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,450
Me too.

615
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,130
Have a good sleep.

616
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,360
How could I fall sleep like this?

617
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
What’s wrong with me?

618
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,930
Why did you hang on his neck?

619
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,280
Are you a sloth?

620
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,820
(Wen Shaoqing)

621
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,140
(Hint: Today’s Monday. Don’t oversleep.)

622
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,970
A small hint.

623
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,210
Is... Is... Is...

624
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,800
There must be a mistake.

625
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,840
Morning. Boss.

626
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,650
Large...

627
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,840
Large latte.

628
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,410
The bill has been paid.

629
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,400
Have a great day.

630
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,400
How much?

631
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,250
You don’t need to pay.

632
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,170
Someone paid for you already.

633
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,570
Good luck with work.

634
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,730
Paid again?

635
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,440
Thank you.

636
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,170
There’s nobody here.

637
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,380
(Inpatient Department)

638
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,160
Thank you, sir.

639
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,880
How can I pay?

640
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,890
It’s...

641
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,880
Already paid?

642
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:07,980
Miss.

643
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,960
You’ve known?

644
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,960
What do I know?

645
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,650
You’re about to meet a good marriage.

646
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,280
What’s going on exactly?

647
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,240
How come it doesn’t happen on me?

648
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,170
I’m jealous.

649
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,320
Don’t you find it weird?

650
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,650
It’s probably those who sell beds
stalked me and revenged.

651
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,900
I don’t dare to drink coffee

652
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,280
either eat sandwiches.

653
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,530
I’m afraid I may become the victim.

654
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,440
I think you’re just being suspicious.

655
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,020
Maybe you won a prize.

656
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,170
Or you became a koi fish.

657
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,370
You just don’t know.

658
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,440
No way.

659
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,500
I’ve seen people paying
for koi fish.

660
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,130
But nobody wishes the koi fish
a good marriage.

661
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,320
Maybe... The company is distributing
boyfriends for us?

662
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,170
That would be great.

663
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,050
Congratulations to you in advance.

664
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,280
Hello?

665
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,250
Hello?

666
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,680
Talk to you later.

667
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,360
I’m fighting for my dignity now.

668
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,280
Bye.

669
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,730
Morning.

670
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:07,960
Morning.

671
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,090
You look good.

672
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,400
White touched with red.

673
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,880
Any good news happened?

674
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,050
Or maybe bad news?

675
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,530
Here’s the shirt I smudged last time.

676
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,360
Check it.

677
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,530
I washed it.

678
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,690
For a couple of times.

679
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,690
What are you smelling for?

680
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,280
I thought you asked me to check.

681
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,880
So I’m checking

682
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,530
if it smells like liquor.

683
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,610
Dr. Wen.

684
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,960
Don’t get me wrong.

685
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,280
I hugged you because I was drunk.

686
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,650
There’s a common-sense mistake.

687
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,360
In medical definition,

688
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,530
people get drunk when more
than 20 milligrams alcohol is found

689
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,320
in each 100 milligrams of blood.

690
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,880
What you were last night

691
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,610
can only be described as tipsy.

692
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,530
A correction.

693
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,530
I hugged you because I was tipsy.

694
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,650
Then I do care about it.

695
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,540
Why do you care?

696
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,050
Alcohol is a nerve inhibitor.

697
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,130
Its function is to inhibit

698
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,170
the neural centers which control senses.

699
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,440
It maximizes the emotions.

700
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,960
Let me put it in an easier way.

701
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,730
You hugged me last night

702
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,810
is because...

703
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,960
I like you?

704
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,610
I said it following your logic.

705
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,610
What’s the big deal?

706
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,850
It was just a hug.

707
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,170
It’s no big deal.

708
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,210
It’s not the first time anyway.

709
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,540
Well. What happened last night

710
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,400
is over.

711
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,500
(Work)

712
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,090
Aren’t you gonna answer?

713
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,280
I said aren’t you gonna answer the call?

714
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,900
Hello?

715
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,440
Is this Mr. Lin’s exclusive hotline?

716
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,690
A warm and kind couple.

717
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,280
Magically brought the dying
back to life.

718
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,720
What do you think, Mr. Lin?

719
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,880
Are you satisfied with it?

720
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,330
Mr. Lin.

721
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:17,920
Isn’t it great?

722
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,050
You’re awake.

723
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,690
Mr. Lin asked me

724
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,690
to get this for you,
the exclusive hotline.

725
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,690
A silk banner for a couple.

726
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,760
You three are just like a family.

727
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,240
I’m no longer a fan.

728
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,610
I quit officially.

729
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,320
Mr. Lin.

730
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,240
Was it your math teacher
who taught you Chinese?

731
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,690
This isn’t the right way
to use the word couple.

732
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,570
Mr. Lin.

733
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,400
I love it.

734
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,650
I’ll take it.

735
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,280
Mr. Lin.

736
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,760
Do you feel a lot better?

737
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,940
Let’s go eat something nice

738
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,010
after you’re fully recovered.

739
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,020
Do you want a picture together?

740
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,760
Yes.

741
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,530
Reasonable requests from patients

742
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,730
cannot be refused by doctors.

743
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,770
Let’s take a picture then.

744
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,450
No big deal.

745
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,900
Okay.

746
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,290
Go.

747
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,130
Take one for us.

748
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,280
Come on.

749
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,280
What’s wrong again?

750
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,360
What Mr. Lin said is

751
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,770
me joining you together.

752
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,440
Yes.

753
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,480
You want me to hold her?

754
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,980
Lower.

755
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,960
Put Mr. Lin at the bottom.

756
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,050
Three. Two. One.

757
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,650
I always dream about Dad
going in the surgery room.

758
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,840
When the door opens again,

759
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,760
it’s empty behind.

760
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,480
After this day,

761
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,760
the dream never happens again.

762
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,690
It’s probably because

763
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:42,050
this picture shines like an award.

764
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,920
It’s a perfect period for Dad’s pity.

765
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,690
Or it’s...

766
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,440
Because of you.

767
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,250
(Cong Rong.
I forgot to tell you last night.)

768
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,140
(The hospital’s first month
job evaluation for you is “Excellent”. )

769
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,520
(Cong Rong.
I forgot to tell you last night.)

770
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,300
(The hospital’s first month
job evaluation for you is “Excellent”. )

771
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,210
Why is the light broken?

772
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,760
A short-circuit?

773
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,530
Is this the new neighbor?

774
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,400
You’re about to meet a good marriage.

775
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:13,340
(Qi Hao Dang Pu)

776
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,420
(Husband)

777
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,050
Hello. Rong.

778
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:16,930
Chengcheng.

779
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,130
I think I met the guy.

780
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,850
What guy?

781
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,050
The guy who paid all my bills.

782
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,450
Seems like he moved
to my opposite.

783
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,530
I’m afraid he’s a stalker.

784
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,730
Don’t panic.

785
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,770
Talk clearly.

786
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,210
My legs are shaking because
of your panic.

787
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,050
I saw a bunch of bones at the entrance.

788
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,380
I didn’t dare to look carefully.

789
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,480
I don’t know whether they’re
from humans or animals.

790
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,130
I’m scared now being alone.

791
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,210
Can you pick me up?

792
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,610
Don’t... Don’t be afraid.

793
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,760
I’m coming now.

794
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,880
Mm. Okay.

795
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,330
How about

796
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,800
you go downstairs first and wait for me?

797
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,380
Okay.

798
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,170
Got it.
