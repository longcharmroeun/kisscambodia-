It’s a little messy at home.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,280
Just give me a minute.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,070
Let me tidy it up.

The owner is my boss.

52
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,580
He rented to her for my sake.

53

Now you can stop worrying.

62

I’ve decorated the apartment carefully.

63
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,780
It’s a comfortable place to live.

To Cong Rong,

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,390
the rent isn’t a big problem.

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,900
She doesn’t order take-outs often.

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,740
There is enough food
in the refrigerator.

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,620
I sometimes cook for her, too.

69
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,270
Sure.

70
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,350
We feel relieved.

71
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,580
Of course we do.

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,030
Currently I am.

75
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,120
Cong Rong is single, too.

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
What a coincidence.

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,870
You don’t say.

78
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,670
Mom.

79
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,240
Aren’t you sending me back to Australia?

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,510
Don’t interfere in our relationship.

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,120
I’ve changed my mind.

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Can’t I?

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,830
Fine.

84
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,230
You really do have principles.

85
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:01,840
Sure.

86
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,300
Since what’s done is done.

87
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,030
I am not

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,910
someone who’s old-fashioned.

89
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,860
Right?

90
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,310
I’ve checked your living
and working environment.

91
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,180
Both are satisfying.

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,740
More importantly,

93
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,550
you’ve got such a great boy... neighbor.

94
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,990
So I’ve decided

95
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,580
to let you stay.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,870
Really?

97
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,310
You have my word.

98
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,630
My dear mother.

99
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,390
I love you so much.

100
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,510
That’s great. That’s great.

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,310
In this case,

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,310
how about we celebrate together?

103
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,340
You can stay for dinner.

104
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,190
I’ll cook.

105
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,390
We are good.

106
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,950
I’ll leave you three, the family

107
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,390
to celebrate.

108
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,560
I’ll go and check Zhong Zhen’s dorm.

109
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,270
Let’s go.

110
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,000
Wait, Mom.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,070
I’ve got more to say.

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,340
You.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,980

Why do you ask?

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,550
Didn’t you say that there’s someone

119
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,430
you like during camp?

120
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,270
And for many years.

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,510
The family misunderstood you just now.

122
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,630
This isn’t right.

123
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,000
Why can’t your cousin be the one I like?

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,830
No way.

125
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,240
You’ve just met.

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,870
It seems like
you don’t know her well, either.

127
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,420
I don’t know her well?

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,920
I even know she had a crush on someone

129
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,310
in the primary school.

130
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,310

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,100
I just do.

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,580
I respect you a lot,

134

but if you’re planning to take her
as a back-up,

135
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,660
I won’t let you get off easily.

136
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,420

138
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,020
But your mother is correct.

139
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,310
There is something wrong with your head.

140
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,510
Something wrong?

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,580
I think I’m pretty clever.

142
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,310

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,680
and I didn’t hold it.

175
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,610
To celebrate your two-year crush on me,

176
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,530
here’s a present for you.

177
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,170
Can... Can I see it?

178
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,000
Get out.

179
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,850
I didn’t mean it.

180
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,290
I said get out!

181
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,940
It’s just a guitar.

182
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,770
Does it deserve you to get this mad?

183
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,000
It’s not up to you whether it does
or not.

184
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,440
Fine.

185
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,770
I got it.

186
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,610
Guitar matters more than people, right?

187
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,000
I will not come back unless I fix it.

188
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,650
Look at this.

189
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,130
It’s pure wisdom.

190
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,490
Look at his home.

191
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,490
There are so many books.

192
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,050
They’re either medical books
or pharmacopeias.

193
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,290
You see.

194
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,170
It’s so admiring.

195
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,220
Mom.

196
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,650
He was just being polite.

197
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,840
No one expects you to come for real.

198
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,650
If you mind,

199
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,690
I’ll give a dinner tomorrow at home.

200
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,080
We can call it even.

201
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,600
You win.

202
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,690
Mom, what are you doing?

203
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,800
Why did you go through his shoe cabinet?

204
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,370
Aunt.

205
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,290
You can take a look around.

206
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,020
There’s a soup coming.

207
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,650
It’ll be ready soon.

208
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,850
Just do your thing.

209
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,770
Don’t care about us.

210
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,560
I’m just looking around.

211
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,920
Are you silly?

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,900
Details determine quality.

213
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,010
Look at all the male shoes
in the cabinet.

214
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,920
Each pair is polished clean and well.

215
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,720
Clean shoes

216
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,250
can’t represent the person.

217
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,560
What do you mean?

218
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,170
Here’s even a photo of you two.

219
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,140
It’s not just us.

220
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,490
There are other people as well, okay?

221
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,840
Who’s the girl next to Wen?

222
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,490
She’s pretty.

223
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,800
Her name is pretty, too.

224
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,170
Chu State as the junction
of Qin and Jin State.

225
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,860
Chu also stands for delicate
and attractive.

226
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,680
Qin Chu.

227
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,200
They’ve been close friends for years.

228
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,720
She’s pretty.

229
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,720
But Wen doesn’t like her.

230
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,440
You know it again.

231
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,800
How can you tell that?

232
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,290
Young girls like you see things
from the eyes.

233
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,010
I see things from heart.

234
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,140
Look.

235
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,410
Wen’s body movement clearly

236
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,920
leaned to you.

237
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,930
What’s more,

238
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,770
isn’t it true his eyes were on you?

239
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,410
It’s impossible for him
to like anyone else.

240
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,140
We are just neighbors and co-workers.

241
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,500
Mom.

242
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,440
Don’t wrongly interpret him.

243
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,250
Soup is ready.

244
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,650
Let’s have dinner.

245
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,370
We are coming.

246
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,720
What a feast.

247
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,050
Mom.

248
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,600
Eat some vegetables.

249
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,290
That’s right.

250
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,200
Go ahead and eat.

251
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
It tastes not so good once cooled.

252
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,650
Okay.

253
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,440
Eat, eat, eat.

254
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,440
Shaoqing.

255
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,130
Shaoqing?

256
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,850
Yes, Aunt.

257
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,690
I saw many books on the shelf.

258
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,090
Have you read them all?

259
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,080
Those on the right side

260
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,970
are medical books from my father.

261
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,410
I’ve nearly read them all
when I was young.

262
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,720
Your family…?

263
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,080
A medical family.

264
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,890
My grandfather was a doctor of TCM.

265
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,170
My father learned western medicine.

266
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,250
I sort of stepped into their shoes.

267
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,600
By the way, Aunt.

268
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,570
Let me pour you a bowl of soup.

269
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,320
Sure.

270
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,490
Thank you.

271
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:03,920
Here, Aunt.

272
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,570
Taste this.

273
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,170
Okay, okay.

274
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,130
Fresh and salted pork
with bamboo shoot soup.

275
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,680
I put bamboo shoot of this year.

276
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,250
Yeah. It’s very good.

277
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,340
Then have some more.

278
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,250
It’s so fresh.

279
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,100
Let me pour one for you, too.

280
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,810
It’s okay.

281
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,720
I’ll do it myself.

282
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,530
Shaoqing.

283
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,040
You’re such a great guy.

284
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,010
Good family background
and good looking.

285
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,530
You cook, too.

286
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,650
There must be many girls
liking you, right?

287
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,890
To be honest,

288
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,020
I’ve been busy with studying years ago.

289
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,220
I’ve been busy with work recent years.

290
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,410
I never have time for dating.

291
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,560
Plus,

292
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,130
I haven’t met the one I like.

293
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,260
What kind of girls do you like?

294
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,900
Just tell me,

295
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,410
I’ll give you some advice.

296
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,410
She’s medium-length hair,
double-fold eyelids and an oval face.

297
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,490
She’s also stubborn, too.

298
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,100
She wears a yellow top

299
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,650
and a pair of jeans?

300
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,410
Exactly.

301
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,410
That kind of girl.

302
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,980
I... I’m full.

303
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,080
I... I’ll wash the dishes.

304
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,600
It’s already enough for you?

305
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,600
What’s the magic of Wen Shaoqing?

306
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,260
My mom changed her side

307
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,600
at the first time of meeting him.

308
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
Shaoqing, Shaoqing.

309
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,920
She called his name so smoothly.

310
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,010
Shaoqing.

311
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,410
Be honest with me.

312
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,680
To my girl Cong Rong, are you...?

313
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,080
Honestly,

314
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,840
Cong Rong is the one I like.

315
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,410
But it seems like Cong Rong has got

316
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,720
some opinions on you.

317
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,490
Aunt.

318
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,160
There may be some misunderstandings.

319
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,380
Conflicts and misunderstandings

320
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,010
are normal for young people like you.

321
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,050
I understand it.

322
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,320
I won’t interfere.

323
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,220
But there’s a point

324
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,770
which I need to make clear.

325
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,290
Cong Rong

326
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,920
is simple, short-tempered and stubborn.

327
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,890
So, if you do like her,

328
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,730
treat her nicely.

329
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,760
Don’t ever break her heart.

330
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,800
Don’t worry.

331
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,130
I will never upset her.

332
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,090
Good.

333
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,050
Hearing this

334
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,560
makes me feel relieved.

335
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,770
Go and comfort her.

336
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,010
Girls always need comfort.

337
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,010
The cleanser essence isn’t disposable.

338
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,650
I know.

339
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,680
I ran out of it.

340
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,490
I just bought this today.

341
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,740
We washed a lot of things today.

342
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,600
But it wouldn’t cost a whole new bottle.

343
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,530
I may have used it too much.

344
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,450
Isn’t it great to wash them thoroughly?

345
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,290
It’s just a bottle of cleanser essence.

346
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,130
Is it worth it?

347
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,440
I’ll buy you a new one.

348
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,130
Is it the cleanser essence
what I talked about?

349
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,970
I’ve paid you the water rate, too.

350
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,620
What else?

351
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,770
I’ll pay them all.

352
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,680
Am I so good to look at?

353
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,290
No, you aren’t.

354
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,440
I just worry about your hands.

355
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,530
Shaoqing,

356
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,530
how to turn the TV on?

357
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,100
Put it here.

358
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,840
I got it.

359
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,290
Turn it on.

360
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,380
Mom.

361
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:42,980
When are you leaving?

362
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,920
I’ll buy the tickets for you.

363
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,140
I haven’t taken my injection yet.

364
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,280
What’s the rush?

365
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,130
Besides,

366
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,220
you’re back home.

367
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,040
I have to stay and take care of you.

368
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,810
You?

369
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,770
Take care of me?

370
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
You’ve been living a pretty easy
and comfortable life.

371
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,010
How will you take care of me?

372
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,720
Interesting.

373
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,370
Look at your disapproving face.

374
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,680
You don’t want me here

375
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,200
but Shaoqing does.

376
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,170
Isn’t it, Shaoqing?

377
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,140
I’m not welcomed at my daughter’s.

378
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,450
I’m welcomed somewhere else.

379
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,010
Maybe I can stay at...

380
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,780
Exactly.

381
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,450
Aunt.

382
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,970
I’ll clean up the guestroom right now.

383
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,820
Stay... Just stay

384
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,210
at my place.

385
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,860
Stay at my place.

386
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,490
Let’s go.

387
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,170
Don’t interrupt Dr. Wen.

388
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,930
Hurry up.

389
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,290
Bye.

390
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,010
Goodbye, Aunt.

391
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,640
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore Burang Barbecue</i>
Coming. Coming.

392
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,780
Just wait a second.

393
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,620
Let’s drink together.

394
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,920
Come on. Come on.

395
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,490
Here.

396
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,370
Together, come on.

397
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:36,620
Here.

398
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,210
Guys.

399
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:37,820
Thank you, guys.

400
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,640
Thank you all.

401
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,600
This barbecue restaurant is really nice.

402
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,840
Come often, please.

403
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,560
Enjoy yourselves.

404
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,530
You’re back.

405
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,380
They are my rock-climbing friends.

406
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,490
They drop by to have a drink.

407
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,250
It’s your treat, right?

408
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
No.

409
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,120
You don’t normally invite people here.

410
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,010
You don’t like owning favors.

411
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,080
Your guitar is fixed.

412
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,250
Try it.

413
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,560
It’s an important guitar to you.

414
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,490
Sorry that I broke it.

415
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,970
I’m really sorry.

416
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,250
It’s alright.

417
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,210
It’s just a guitar.

418
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,640
Then... Do you know how to play?

419
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,880
Are you kidding?

420
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,050
I used to earn money by it.

421
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,900
Can you play something for me?

422

You can sleep whenever you want.

I’m sleepy.

477
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,420
Shaoqing has been waiting
for you for long.

478
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,590
Morning.

479
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,230
Mom.

480
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,030
Why did you invite the stranger over

481
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,830
early in the morning?

482
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,310
Shaoqing is not a stranger.

483
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,740
I don’t have plans these days.

484
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,260
I want to break the yellow sweater.

485
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,720
I’m planning

486
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,350
to knit a pair of scarves for you.

487
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
Is it necessary?

488
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,470
It’s not cold.

489
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,510
It’s very necessary.

490
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,740
I’m going to take the injection now.

491
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,000
You two,

492
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,720
twine the woolen yarn.

493
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,030
Mom.

494
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,070
I’ll come back and check.

495
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,400
Mom.

496
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,110
Don’t worry, Aunt.

497
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,030
We’ll accomplish the task.

498
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,880
She was being nice.

499
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,830
You promised her.

500
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,740
Do it yourself.

501
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,030
I’m busy today.

502
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,550
I. Have. A. Date.

503
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,870
A date?

504
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,630
With whom?

505
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Anyone I know?

506
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,870
Why should I tell you?

507
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,310
Too many details on this suit.

508
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,630
The skirt is too short, okay?

509
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,350
The pattern looks like the duodenum.

510
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,110
It doesn’t match your skin tone.

511
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,790
Dr. Wen.

512
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,220
Have I asked for your opinion?

513
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,500
I’m just offering tips
as a kind neighbor.

514
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,220
Don’t go.

515
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,110
There’re no suitable outfits

516
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,870
for dates in your closet.

517
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,870
Thanks.

518
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,960
I’m determined to find one

519
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,390
that’s suitable for me today.

520
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,390
Chengcheng.

521
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,870
I need a set of clothes for date.

522
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,900
Immediately.

523
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,870
Now.

524
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,700
<i>Burang Barbecue</i>

525
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,980
Do I look good?

526
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,470
Yeah, you do.

527
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,190
It’s such an attention catcher.

528
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,030
Great.

529
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,900
How come I’m a bit nervous?

530
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,470
What are you nervous about?

531
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,420
You are pretty.

532
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,590
I’d fall for you at the first sight

533
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,900
if I were him.

534
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,180
I’m curious what he looks like now.

535
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,920
His profile photo isn’t like before.

536
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,480
See.

537
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:47,830
Yeah.

538
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,830
Let me see.

539
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,920
Here.

540
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,790
<i>Chubby</i>
Wow.

541
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,590
Is he this handsome?

542
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,310
Handsome?

543
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,030
Yeah.

544
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,590
Show me what you talked about.

545
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,240
See.

546
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,460
He said you’re pretty.

547
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,030
Hey, nephew.

548
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,870
That’s a pretty warm pair of handcuffs.

549
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,180
You’ve talked a lot.

550
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,420
Did you stay up late to talk?

551
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,590
She’s staying up late to talk
to someone else.

552
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,310
Hurry up and tell her you like her.

553
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,150
I’ve done it obviously enough.

554
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,310
Besides.

555
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,550
Telling her that requires good timing.

556
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,180
Good timing?

557
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,900
Aren’t you afraid she is taken
by another man?

558
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,590
I don’t believe she’ll let it happen
that easily.

559
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,960
Your cab is arriving.

560
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,590
There’s half an hour left.

561
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,550
Hurry up.

562
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,900
Based on my experience,

563
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,390
chasing girls is...

564
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,660
Cong Rong!

565
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,220
I worry about you dressing up like this.

566
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,700
Who are you meeting with exactly?

567
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,830
You have an old friend for years.

568
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,880
I do, too.

569
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,630
Now I’m going to meet him.

570
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,740
Is... Is it the one that you like?

571
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,350
Yes.

572
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,790
Sir, let’s go.

573
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,590
When the car left,

574
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,180
I didn’t realize that leaving him today

575
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,980
was actually heading to him.

576
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,830
Between us,

577
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,940
it’s actually an incredible closed loop.

578
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,070
I was cautious that time.

579
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,350
I like summer.

580
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,980
I like the wind.

581
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,150
I like the neon at night.

582
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,300
You can tell the world
about what you like.

583
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,660
But liking him

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,460
makes you speak insincerely.

585
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,790
Why are you staring at me?

586
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,700
I didn’t tell her to go on a date.

587
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,150
Wen Rang.

588
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,390
Control your nephew.

589
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,070
I can’t help.

590
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,260
Cong Rong said she’s meeting
an old friend.

591
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,350
Who’s that exactly?

592
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,220
Why?

593
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,920
So you are allowed

594
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,590
to be close and intimate

595
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,350
with that Qin Chu.

596
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,070
And Cong Rong is not allowed
to have a childhood sweetheart?

597
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,990
I’ve made it clear with her

598
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,550
that Qin Chu isn’t the one I like.

599
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,220
Are you telling me it’s Cong Rong?

600
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,590
Bingo.

601
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,660
No, no, no.

602
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,070
I was on your side.

603
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,400
But Cong Rong is already

604
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,430
on a date with his Chubby boy.

605
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,220
Who?

606
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,870
Nanshan primary school.

607
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,440
Fourth grade, class nine.

608
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,030
Chubby.

609
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,270
I worried that you couldn’t recognize me.

610
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,790
You know, I did change a lot.

611
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,920
Your profile photo is handsome.

612
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,260
I was worried, too.

613
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,720
But after meeting you in person.

614
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,590
You look like a bigger version
of the boy when you were young.

615
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,900
Exactly the same.

616
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,480
Was... Was I

617
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,940
a stupid tall guy when I was little?

618
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,350
You were hungry all the time.

619
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,110
Knowing you for long,

620
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,740
I still don’t know the limit
of the food you can eat.

621
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,270
When we were little,
you guys gave me everything

622
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,420
that you couldn’t finish eating.

623
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,590
You’ve contributed a lot

624
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,900
to my weight.

625
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,240
It happens!

626
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,500
A mouthful of food!

627
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,980
I’m carrying out the tradition

628
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,710
and continuing the good habit.

629
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,420
They used to give me nicknames

630
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,550
like “food pulverizer”

631
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,260
or “leftover container”.

632
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,030
They were all

633
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,420
related to food anyway.

634
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,630
You had these nicknames?

635
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,180
I only remember they called you
“little spinning top”.

636
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,420
Yes.

637
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,740
Spinning top!

638
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,740
They said I could only spin in place

639
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,310
and couldn’t roll forward.

640
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,630
They chased me and laughed
at me all the time.

641
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,350
They didn’t know

642
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,790
if they chased me too hard,

643
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,990
I’d be mad, too.

644
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,700
Really?

645
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,960
I chased you a lot holding an umbrella.

646
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,150
Did you hate me, too?

647
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,720
That’s true.

648
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Why did you join them to bully me?

649
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,350
If it weren’t for my feelings for you,

650
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,920
I’d be mad at you.

651
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,870
I didn’t bully you.

652
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,880
Without me,

653
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,310
you wouldn’t pass the running test.

654
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,640
That’s why we are different,

655
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,390
right?

656
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,750
Ever since we knew each other,

657
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,030
you’ve become the swordswoman

658
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,920
in my heart.

659
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,460
I’d agree for you

660
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,350
to chase me for hundreds of blocks.

661
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,200
How did we know each other?

662
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,150
I forgot.

663
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,420
Well, it’s...

664
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,750
It’s because of the time
when I got bullied.

665
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,740
Then you showed up all of a sudden

666
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,220
just like a swordswoman.

667
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,180
I remember.

668
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
Those guys forced you to climb the tree.

669
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,920
You were trapped and couldn’t get off.

670
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,590
They threw rocks at you under the tree.

671
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,200
I was angry about it,

672
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
so I drove them away.

673
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,550
Yes, yes.

674
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,350
That time.

675
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,310
They bullied me every day.

676
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,960
It was so annoying.

677
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,150
Thanks to your help.

678
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,350
Come on.

679
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,390
Eat, eat it.

680
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,510
After I left,

681
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,160
did they continue to call you Fatty?

682
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,980
They drew two moons
to make fun of you.

683
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,220
How dare they do that?

684
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,350
I’d draw ten suns

685
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,200
to eliminate them.

686
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,640
The thing about two moons
is a secret between us.

687
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,660
How did others know?

688
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,310
We didn’t know each other
like that, either.

689
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,910
I made it up.

690
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,660
You’re not Chubby.

691
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,660
You... Listen to me.

692
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,880
Don’t... Don’t go.

693
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,260
Listen, listen to me.

694
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,700
Does the past matter?

695
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,440
It’s the present that matters, right?

696
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,110
We’ve known each other accidentally.

697
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,670
There’s a Chubby in your heart.

698
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,440
I happen to be a chubby.

699
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,030
What is this?

700
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,000
This is fate, right?

701
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,150
It’s also called destiny.

702
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,110
Let’s follow it

703
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,070
and see how things go.

704
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,740
Right?

705
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,880
Listen to me.

706
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,790
Listen to me.

707
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,880
Let me go.

708
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,590
What are you doing?

709
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,270
You’ve agreed to meet for lunch.

710
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,580
Aren’t you prepared?

711
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,310
Prepared for what?

712
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,350
Come on.

713
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,830
Swordswoman.

714
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
We’re both adults here.

715
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,150
Don’t you understand what I mean?

716
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,790
Listen to me.

717
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,310
Either me or Chubby.

718
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,590
Let go of me.

719
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,180
We’re both fat.

720
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,630
You don’t know what you’re doing, do you?

721
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,880
Judging by your behavior,

722
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,640
you’ve probably cheated
many innocent girls.

723
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,030
How dare you?

724
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,260
I’d like to teach you a lesson
for them today.

725
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,310
Don’t... Don’t make me punch girls!

726
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,920
Then what?

727
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,980
You want to fight back?

728
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,630
It’s kind enough for me
to not call the police.

729
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,590
How dare you to compare yourself
with Chubby?

730
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,740
You don’t deserve to mention his name.

731
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,900
Don’t you dare to come out
and cheat again.

732
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,790
Great.

733
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,660
I’ll send you to the police station now.

734
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,870
By the way,

735
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,180
I forgot to introduce myself.

736
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
I am about to become a lawyer.

737
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,160
I’m teaching you a lesson for free.

738
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,180
You’re welcome.

739
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,900
I didn’t know you could be this tough.

740
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,420
Watch out.

741
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,500
Are you okay?

742
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,900
You’re not bad, either.

743
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,830
Let’s go.

744
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,740
Are you okay?

745
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,590
You didn’t meet Chubby

746
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,420
but a fat bastard.

747
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,990
The pure memory in your heart

748
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,700
got stained by others without a reason.

749
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,790
Actually, I can understand it well.

750
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,900
If it were me,

751
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,700
I’d be more likely to lose control.

752
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,550
We are different.

753
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,510
Between Chubby and me,

754
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,870
it’s more than friendship in childhood.

755
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,700
Have you ever thought about

756
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,110
this Chubby in your heart

757
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,220
has become totally different
from when he was young.

758
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,830
Even if he’s standing in front of you,

759
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,740
you couldn’t recognize him.

760
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,350
Maybe your way of looking for him

761
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,630
was wrong originally.

762
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,420
Maybe.

763
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,470
I’d like to take a walk by myself.

764
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,030
Please stop the car at the front.

765
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,150
Aren’t you curious why I came?

766
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,260
Didn’t you come to laugh at me?

767
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,830
Are you satisfied today?

768
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,310
Zhou Chengcheng is such a traitor.

769
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,550
I’ll settle it with her later.

770
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,830
Don’t you want to know

771
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,510
what Chubby looks like now?

772
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,030
No matter what,

773
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,710
he wouldn’t look like you.

774
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,550
Stop the car.

775
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,700
What else do you want to say?

776
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,180
You want to find Chubby, right?

777
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,740
I’ll take you there.

778
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,510
Do you remember here?

779
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,430
Isn’t this the place where you hugged me

780
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,630
for no reason on my first day?

781
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,150
Things happen for a reason.

782
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,820
Didn’t you take me to find Chubby?

783
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,910
Why are we here?

784
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,070
Because the person you are looking for
is right in front of you.

785
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,910
When I hugged you that day,

786
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,550
I was pretty sure

787
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,150
that you are Cong Rong
who I’ve been waiting for.

788
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,550
The Swordswoman I’ve been waiting
for so long.

789
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,380
You finally came.

790
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,630
I’ve been waiting for you for long.

791
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,990
Cong Rong.

792
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,260
I’m saying that I’m Chubby.

793
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,750
It’s a terrible joke.

794
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,070
Do you want to be punched, too?

795
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,030
When we first met,

796
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,700
I got bullied.

797
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,260
You said

798
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,750
“what’s the big deal about it?”

799
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,870
The worse it tastes,

800
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,260
the harder you should try to conquer it.

801
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,070
That time, you told me

802
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,880
you’re Cong Rong from Class Eleven.

803
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,260
You can call me Swordswoman.

804
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,340
Ever since that time,

805
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,220
you’ve rooted in my heart.

806
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,590
When your father passed away,

807
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,380
you were really sad.

808
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,860
You said if two moons appeared
at the same time,

809
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,470
your father wouldn’t disappear.

810
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,860
So I used the luminous tape

811
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,070
to make a big moon

812
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,110
to make you happy.

813
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,180
Two moons are appearing together.

814
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,070
Your father will never leave you.

815
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,150
You said that you'd stay
at your grandma’s for days.

816
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,220
You’d be back when school started.

817
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,660
We’ll meet at school.

818
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,860
I’ll wait for you!

819
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,590
I’ll wait for you here when I’m back.

820
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
So I came here to wait for you

821
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,820
when a new semester began.

822
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,430
Year after year.

823
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,380
Time flies.

824
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,590
So many years have passed.

825
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,760
Now you know that I wasn’t joking

826
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,380
when I said I’ve been having a crush

827
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,990
on you for twenty years.

828
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,300
We are actually childhood sweethearts.

829
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,380
I’ve liked her secretly for many years.

830
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,150
During that game,

831
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,110
I said I had a crush
on someone for so long.

832
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,070
It’s not Qin Chu.

833
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,550
It’s you who I like.

834
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,910
Cong Rong.

835
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,180
Hopefully this memory

836
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,070
can make our relationship better.

837
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,740
Cong Rong.

838
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,990
I want you to be my girlfriend.

839
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,660
Don’t treat me like
an old-time classmate.

840
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,430
I... I need to chill.

841
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:22,860
It’s okay.

842
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,150
I’ve waited for these years.

843
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,110
I don’t care about a few more days.

844
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,070
You can’t escape from me anyway.

845
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,470
Welcome back.

846
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,030
My Swordswoman.

847
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:35,904
