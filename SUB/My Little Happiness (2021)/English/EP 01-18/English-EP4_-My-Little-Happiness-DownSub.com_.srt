In fact, only a few interns

can get used to the hospital's work.

32

You’ve done well enough.

33
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,270
You are special.

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,880
Get me a blanket in the closet.

35
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,770
How can you sleep on the floor?

36
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,210
What is it?

37
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,340
(Mom)

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,440
What is it?

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:40,940
My…!

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,650
My…!

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,720
Who is it?

42
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,050
My…

43
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,610
So noisy.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,220
Mom.

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,150
What’s up?

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,380
What are you doing?

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,150
Why is there a man in your room?

48
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,780
There isn’t.

49
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,790
No way.

50
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,000
My eyesight is 5.2.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,880
Even the hair on a woolen sweater,

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,060
I can see it very clearly.

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,150
Open the closet.

54
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,870
Hurry! Open the closet!

55
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,190
Who is this?

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,870
You saw her, Mom.

57
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,860
It’s Zhou Chengcheng.

58
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,460
Who’s calling my name?

59
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,660
Quiet.

60
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,350
Zhou Chengcheng?

61
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,830
Looks like she’s put on weight.

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,350
And why is she hiding in the closet?

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,590
She likes hiding everywhere
when she’s drunk.

64
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,390
She’s like a cat.

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,560
I thought there was a thief
in your dormitory.

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,950
Good to know it’s not a man.

67
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,590
Wait.

68
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,150
This is not your dormitory.

69
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,620
Where are you now?

70
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,950
Chengcheng came to see me.

71
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,030
I didn’t want to trouble others.

72
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,350
So, we came to a homestay.

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,510
Mom,

74
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,100
why did you call me at this late hour?

75
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,880
I’m telling you,

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,030
to get ready for our life in Australia,

77
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,150
I’m learning English now.

78
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,240
You are so diligent, aren’t you?

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,710
Of course!

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,200
I have a question for you.

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,100
What’s the difference between
past perfect and present perfect?

82
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,860
Mom,

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,940
about that…

84
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,710
I can’t make it clear in a few words.

85
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,910
I’ll get you a list later.

86
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,950
I have the list.

87
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,220
But I can’t understand.

88
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,950
I need your help.

89
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
In short,

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,030
the differences are…

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,830
Are you clear now?

92
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,060
Yes, I’m clear about this question now.

93
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,910
But I’ve got new questions.

94
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,270
Actually, the grammar

95
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,620
doesn’t matter that much in daily life.

96
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,350
You only need to master
some daily conversations.

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,980
You’re still a young girl.

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,830
Overuse of the brain
may make you age faster.

99
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,620
Really?

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,670
Then I’d better let my brain rest now.

101
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,420
Good night.

102
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,220
When Shaoqing!

103
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,270
Sorry.

104
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,860
I almost forgot you were here.

105
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,220
You can come out now.

106
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,910
Dr. Wen?

107
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,590
Wen Shaoqing?

108
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,470
An interesting medical phenomenon
occurred to me.

109
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,070
What is it?

110
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,710
Obstruction of venous reflux.

111
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,910
When the nerve is pressed
and stimulated for a long time,

112
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,030
some kind of retention occurs.

113
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,350
Which in short is?

114
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,740
Leg numbness.

115
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,720
I see.

116
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,980
So now you want me to help,

117
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,660
but you are embarrassed to ask.

118
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,610
Am I right?

119
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,900
When a tiger gets down to level ground,

120
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,930
he may be bullied by a dog.

121
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,220
When you scared me at the hospital
during the day,

122
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,520
did you anticipate that
you would need my help sometime?

123
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,570
Give me your hand.

124
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,450
Come on.

125
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,320
One, two, three.

126
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,050
Put me down!

127
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,320
I want…

128
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,320
Want what?

129
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,970
I want you to feel the same numbness!

130
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,930
You…!

131
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,320
Cousin.

132
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,250
It’s Zhong Zhen.

133
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,410
Don’t come out.

134
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,360
I don’t want to be the talk
at the hospital again.

135
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,980
Please.

136
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,840
Don’t come out.

137
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,120
Don’t come out!

138
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,570
The men’s clothes you asked for.

139
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:46,970
Thanks.

140
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,810
I’ll treat you to dinner.

141
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,380
What do you need men’s clothes for

142
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,480
in the middle of the night?

143
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,360
The less you know, the better for you.

144
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,570
I ran my legs off here.

145
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,930
At least give me some water to drink.

146
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,360
Forget it. Forget it.

147
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,570
I told you not to come out.

148
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,960
Did I agree?

149
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,090
I’m still an innocent boy.

150
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,690
Why do I always see this kind of scenes?

151
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,120
I’m going to be silenced.

152
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,290
What are you talking about?

153
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,600
Our relationship isn’t like that.

154
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,810
Then... What’s it like?

155
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,240
He and I can never get along well.

156
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,080
Sounds like you want us
to get along well.

157
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,080
Boss,

158
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,250
I’m just a walking corpse.

159
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,330
For what happened between you two,

160
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,530
I heard nothing, saw nothing,

161
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,960
and cared nothing.

162
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,240
After all, you are both adults.

163
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,450
I swear I’ll be tight-lipped.

164
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,320
Please spare my life.

165
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,240
Okay.

166
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,570
That simple?

167
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,930
She and her mom have a bad relationship?

168
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,650
Why does she hide her return
from her mom?

169
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,570
The relationship isn’t bad.

170
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,240
My aunt is like a sweet burden
to her daughter.

171
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,480
She doesn’t want her daughter
to return to Shenzhen,

172
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,790
or to be a lawyer in particular.

173
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,350
Why?

174
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,830
It’s a long story.

175
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,470
In short, it’s not easy for my cousin.

176
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,320
When she was in primary school…

177
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,430
She changed schools once.

178
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,500
She even told you that?

179
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,860
Are you two… really a couple?

180
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,500
Impossible.

181
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,040
You think I can’t like her?

182
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,020
Wrong.

183
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,470
She can’t like you.

184
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,950
She has her ideal type.

185
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,190
And you are totally different from that.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,350

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,070
“First. Tall and big.”

189
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,670
I’m not enough?

190
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,670
“Second. Mature, sexy

191
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,900
and scholarly.”

192
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,740
That’s me.

193
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,380
“Third. Gentle and caring.”

194
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,070
You are neither of them.

195
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,590
“Fourth. Willing to feed me
and brave to save me.”

196

Where did you get these?

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,980
I copied them from
her high school diary.

198
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,750
Don’t keep other people’s privacy.

199
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,640
It’s confiscated.

200
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,380
Get off.

201
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,100

202

204
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,670

212
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,700

217

Will that doctor come or not?

221
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,740
Big hospitals are really good at
keeping patients waiting.

222
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,980
Mr. Lin,

223
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,830
you must have misunderstood.

224
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,750
Dr. Wen

225
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,470
must be making rounds in the wards
at this time.

226
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,100
He’ll be here soon.

227
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Please, drink some water.

Mr. Lin wants to talk with Dr. Wen.

230
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,070
Can you go hurry him up?

231
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,750
Okay.

232
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,590
I’ll go.

233
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,430
Mr. Lin, drink some water.

234
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,980
I’m here.

235
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,350
I happen to have something
to talk with Mr. Lin.

236
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,070
Now,

237
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,590
I have only one request.

238
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,020
Your hospital must

239
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,900
refund my hospitalization fee.

240
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,920
Mr. Lin,

241
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
based on your previous complaint,

242
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,900
we’ve made a thorough investigation.

243
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,440
Dr. Wen didn’t have any

244
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,070
diagnostic errors
or procedural irregularities.

245
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,110
In general,

246
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,020
the hospital doesn’t need to refund.

247
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,670
You investigated yourselves?

248
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,790
How would that be fair?

249
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,140
Look how young Dr. Wen is.

250
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,190
He doesn’t look competent at all.

251
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,220
He must’ve pulled some strings.

252
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,230
Mr. Lin,

253
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,590
you’ve misunderstood our Dr. Wen.

254
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,400
Everyone here knows…

255
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,020

256
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,220
Mr. Lin.

257
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,350
Last time you were here,

258
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,260
we didn’t arrange an operation for you
in the first place,

259
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,190
firstly because the operating rooms
were too full,

260
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,470
and secondly because there was really

261
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,020
no appropriate operation method.

262
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,430
These few days,

263
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,860
I’ve consulted with
international experts

264
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,590
and worked out several plans.

265
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,320
Please take a look.

266
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,350
I won’t.

267
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,860
No need.

268
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,430
You think only you have plans?

269
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,220
I have too.

270
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,950
Look by yourself.

271
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,860
There’re foreign languages on the cover.

272
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,260
They say

273
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,500
my body

274
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,030
has nothing wrong at all.

275
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,140

Mr. Lin,

278
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,640
there’s no such an organization
in the world.

279
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
Who said that?

280
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,860
Just because you don’t know it?

281
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,740
This organization is to serve Dubai’s

282
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,220
crown princes and oil tycoons.

283
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,260
Only a small number of people know it.

284
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,820
Mr. Lin,

285
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,590
calm down.

286
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,520
Sit down. Sit down.

287
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,990
Don’t be angry.

288
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,030
Drink some water.

289
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,990
I don’t need water.

290
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,020
Don’t waste my time.

291
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,620
Answer me directly.

292
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,620
Refund or not?

293
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,020
Come in.

294
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,160

is anxious to see you,

296
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,830
claiming not leaving without seeing you.

297
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,590
See?

298
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,560
I told you he’s incompetent

299
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,900
and I’m not the only one.

300
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,990
Go ahead.

301
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,950
Cong Rong and I will take care of this.

302
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,740
Don’t worry.

303
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,430
Mr. Lin.

304
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,320
As a responsible doctor,

305
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,510
I still have to remind you.

306
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,620
Get surgery as soon as possible.

307
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,260
Your tumor may rupture at any time.

308
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,470
Dr. Wen!

309
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,140
Here.

310
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,440
Sir, you are leaving the hospital?

311
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,220
Yes.

312
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,870
Grandpa said that

313
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,070
we must thank you in person.

314
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,380
Am I interrupting you?

315
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,550
Of course not.

316
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,350
Sir,

317
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,550
do strictly control your blood pressure
when you go back

318
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,020
and come here for rehabilitation often.

319
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,860
Alright?

320
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,430
I heard there was a girl
at the airport that day.

321
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,350
Yeah.

322
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,790
She also helped a lot.

323
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,430
Are you a doctor?

324
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,190
Do you have any tissues?

325
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,860
Yes.

326
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,460

Come on.

Help me hold him.

329

Keep this position,

330
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,550
or vomit will block his airway.

Thank you, sir.

334
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,790
Then we’re leaving.

335

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,590
No.

345
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,270
I’ve tried every way.

346
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,940
They just refused.

347
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,140
But that bed,

348
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,510
you must keep it for me.

349
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,310
Try to

350
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,310
think of other ways.

351
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,630
I… I’ll put my face aside
and ask for a discount.

352
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,030
That’ll be my gift for you.

353
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,030
Pay as much money as you have.

354
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,080
Okay.

355
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Okay. No problem.

356
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,790
Keep it for me.

357
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,420
I’ll be there this afternoon.

358
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,470
Drink some water.

359
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,350
It has anions.

360
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,180
It can make you longevous.

361
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,360
The treatment bed you want to buy

362
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,230
is also anion bed, isn’t it?

363
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
How did you know I wanted to buy a bed?

364
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,990
I read that royal report, which says

365
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,900
the treatment plan is to buy a bed.

366
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,860
That bed

367
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,510
is so good.

368
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,380
When I was lying on it,

369
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,590
I was feeling warm.

370
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,990
It can cure all diseases.

371
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,830
Yes!

372
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,990
But 38,000 yuan

373
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,350
isn’t a little money, is it?

374
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,830
You don’t understand.

375
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,030
Be stingy with little money

376
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,670
and be generous

377
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,100
with great money.

378
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,070
I understand.

379
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,380
I can pay ten thousand yuan
without hesitation when buying a bag.

380
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,230
But when I order a takeout,

381
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,550
even five yuan for delivery
would make me hesitate for long.

382
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,510
Your attitude is much better

383
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,190
than Dr. Wen’s.

384
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,350
Fully agree.

385
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,030
Mr. Lin,

386
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,100
I saw many people saying online that

387
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,350
Xihuantong is a cheating company.

388
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,510
How could you say that?

389
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,790
Cheaters have their own tricks.

390
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,990
They told you they could cure
all your diseases

391
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,100
only to let you pay.

392
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,550
That’s true.

393
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,990
Think it over, will you?

394
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,900
You are just cheaters!

395
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,900
I was in hospital once,

396
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,660
and now you want me in again.

397
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,840
I’m well,

398
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,270
but you claimed that I had a tumor.

399
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,830
Aren’t you cheating me for my money?

400
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,990
No. We’re concerned about you.

401
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,880
Concerned?

402
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,460
Then personally give me my money back.

403
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,590
After I buy that bed,

404
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,180
we can discuss about
me being in hospital.

405
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,420
Your logic is really unusual.

406
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,470
How about this?

407
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,140
Give me your family’s number.

408
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,230
I’ll call your family

409
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,460
to accompany you to buy it.

410
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,870
The one selling the bed

411
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,180
is my son.

412
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,310
He accompanies me to the park

413
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,230
and brings me breakfast.

414
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
Even if he cheats me,

415
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,070
I won’t regret.

416
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,030
I’m determined

417
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,420
to buy the bed!

418
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,350
I don’t want to face the day!

419
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,460
If there are really few customers,

420
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,380
how embarrassed I will be!

421
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,350
Don’t worry.

422
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,620
It will be okay.

423
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,620
Everything will be okay.

424
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,550
God bless it will be busy as usual.

425
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,100
Crowded!

426
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,640
Be careful.

427
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,550
Don’t break anything.

428
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,150
Stop, stop, stop!

429
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,460
What are you doing?

430
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,360
I was only absent for half a day.

431
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,420
How did it come to this?

432
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,640
Who told you to do this?

433
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,860
A man told us to,

434
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,380
saying this place is closed.

435
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,660
Closed?

436
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,230
Why didn’t I know that?

437
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,070
Who told you that?

438
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,360
A vice-president

439
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,140
surnamed Lu.

440
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,750
You can call him and ask.

441
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,750
Sorry,

442
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,940
the number you dialed is powered off.

443
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,900
Sorry…

444
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,310
Kaide Hotel?

445
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,580
(Your credit card’s sub-card has
generated a purchase at Kaide Hotel)

446
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,860
(A Castle in the Clouds)

447
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,990
Excuse me.

448
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,750
Mr.…?

449
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,440
Mr. Wen.

450
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,510
Wen Rang.

451
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:46,990
Nice to meet you.

452
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,700
Okay, okay.

453
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,620
Sit down, sit down.

454
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,660
What are you doing?

455
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,270
You are my boyfriend!

456
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,030
How can you do this to me?

457
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,920
How did you find this place?

458
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,100
I didn’t want to be this smart.

459
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,880
But next time when you disappear,

460
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,100
don’t use my card to pay, okay?

461
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,030
Who is she?

462
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,510
Haven’t you recognized her yet?

463
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,700
She’s my canteen’s…

464
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,390
Yeah, it’s me.

465
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,070
The reception girl.

466
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,180
Let me do it.

467
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,740
You two have gone too far!

468
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,940
You’ve been sneaking around
under my nose!

469
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,350
Sneaking around?

470
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,900
We’re aboveboard.

471
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,420
Exactly.

472
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,310
The reason you can’t see us is simple.

473
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,540
Because you can only

474
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,510
see yourself.

475
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,380
Alright.

476
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,860
I gotta go.

477
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,350
Go ahead.

478
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,120
Sorry to

479
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,830
keep you waiting.

480
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,790
It’s okay.

481
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,750
I’m the editor of the publisher
who made an appointment with you.

482
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,180
Time is limited.

483
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,550
Let’s go directly to
your book about garret.

484
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,180
Castle.

485
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,070
Both are fine.

486
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,040
On the whole,

487
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,690
this collection of poems

488
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,450
lacks propagation power.

489
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,560
“I travel through half a century,
waiting for wind.”

490
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,830
What’s the meaning?

491
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,180
Nothingness.

492
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,030
What people spend their entire lives

493
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,590
waiting for may be an illusion.

494
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,080
The meaning doesn’t matter.

495
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,900
The meaning doesn’t matter.

496
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,310
What matters is that

497
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,750
compared with “I travel through
the whole world to sleep with you.”,

498
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,990
it’s nothing exciting.

499
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,550
But being exciting is not an
essential element of serious literature.

500
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,990
Then you were born in a wrong age.

501
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,100
Serious literature was a little popular
two decades ago.

502
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,310
People nowadays

503
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,990
don’t need serious literature.

504
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,790
What they need are symbols.

505
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,830
They want to be catered to.

506
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,740
How to cater to them?

507
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,380
That’s what I want to focus on
with you today.

508
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,510
Don’t you think… there’s nothing

509
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,180
pleasing on you?

510
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,910
You are always bossy and arrogant.

511
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,750
Who do you think you are?

512
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,940
No wonder.

513
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,420
You always feel good about yourself.

514
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,100
After all,

515
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,940
you’re silly.

516
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,440
Then you don’t have to
say such harsh words

517
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,620
to sneer at me, do you?

518
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,750
At least I’ve been nice to you.

519
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,620
Even if I were really that bad,

520
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,190
you still pestered me
to be your girlfriend, didn’t you?

521
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,670
That’s because you have a rich dad!

522
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,840
Now the relationship
between you two is broken.

523
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,180
No one would tolerate you anymore.

524
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,070
Without your dad,

525
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,510
you

526
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,070
are a totally loser.

527
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,270
After being polished, these poems

528
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,940
are really not bad.

529
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,990
If I wanted to sell my books like this,

530
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,230
I could’ve done that ten years ago.

531
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,420
No need to wait till today.

532
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,100
Nice to meet you.

533
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,030
I won’t give you any money
from selling those tables and chairs.

534
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,550
I won’t ask for break-up fees.

535
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,830
Fine.

536
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,680
I get it. I get it.

537
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,150
Just a minute.

538
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,310
I’m just done here.

539
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,550
I’ll be right there.

540
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,550
Bro!

541
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,600
There… There is a button there.

542
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,680
Help me push it.

543
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,380
Well… The door got stuck somehow.

544
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,540
Got stuck?

545
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,350
Yeah.

546
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,310
Who pushed the button?

547
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,230
I also wonder.

548
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,420
Help me with it.

549
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,270
I remember.

550
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,620
I pushed it.

551
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,150
Who are you?

552
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,990
Come back!

553
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,420
Oh my!

554
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,660
I…!

555
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,310
Where is your
overbearing manner last night?

556
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,600
Can you block me for a while?

557
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,940
I don’t want others to see me like this.

558
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,100
I’m done crying.

559
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,790
Feeling much better.

560
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,380
You had a good cry.

561
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,550
So what?

562
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,750
They all say that
girls are made of water.

563
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,620
You are made of a reservoir.

564
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,380
I warn you.

565
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,070
About what happened just now,

566
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,180
you mustn’t pity me.

567
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,900
I accept no one’s sympathy.

568
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,420
You think too much.

569
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,460
People all have their own misery

570
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,900
and aren’t qualified
to sympathize each other.

571
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,590
You talk like an elder.

572
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,700
My coat!

573
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,030
That’s my coat.

574
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,030
What happened to your arm?

575
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,790
Got bitten by a dog?

576
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,620
Yeah.

577
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,750
By a dog.

(Administrative Building)

579
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,030
“Willing to feed me.”

580
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,260
(Cong Rong’s Ideal Type
He’s willing to feed me and brave...)

581
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,460
What’s the big deal about being fed?

582
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,990
Shallow.

583
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,510
Open your mouth.

584
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,180
That won’t do.

585
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,380
I’m not feeding a dog.

586
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,550
Yummy!

587
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,660
Once more.

588
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,990
Are all married men as greasy as you?

589
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,350
I’m being sexy.

590
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,460
Whose is it?

591
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,830
Not yours.

592
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,160
No one’s eating it.

593
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,140
I’ll finish it.

594
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,270
I heard that

595
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,080
there’s been a lot of talk about

596
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,420
you and that girl in the general office.

597
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,660
I’ve told them that I like her,

598
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,030
but no one believed.

599
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,990
Look, you’re acting like a rogue.

600
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,830
Don’t sully her reputation.

601
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,830
Okay?

602
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,230
Wait, man.

603
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,440
Do you love me secretly

604
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,750
and use that girl as a guise?

605
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,940
Come on, baby.

606
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,100
Eat more.

607
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,100
It’s good for your brain.

608
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,940
What are you talking about

609
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,660
that makes you so happy?

610
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,230
Chen Cu said

611
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,460
it’s his treat.

612
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,140
When did I say that?

613
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,590
Wen Shaoqing!

614
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,270
Qin Chu.

615
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,940
Don’t you think

616
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,190
Wen Shaoqing has been
acting strange lately?

617
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,900
Has he?

618
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,230
Yeah.

I’ll treat you to lunch.)

Boss.

622
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,100
Where’s your cousin?

623
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,620
My cousin…

624
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,940
You’re asking me?

625
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,070
I’m just a poor outsider.

626
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,790
Go back to work.

Dr. Wen.

630
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,460
What’s up?

631
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,550
Someone wanted to give Cong Rong
a silk banner.

632
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,940
I took it for her.

633
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,350
Where is she?

634
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,990
She asked me for leave,

635
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,900
saying it was urgent.

636
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,350
Then she left in a hurry.

637
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,700
Her laptop is still on.

639
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,830
Xihuantong?

640
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,790
I suspect he has other motives
for asking for the refund.

641
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,230
That company doesn’t seem to be
a legit company.

the food market near our hospital.

644
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,180
is there a food market nearby?

645

This product of ours

646
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,990

647

687
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,150
Good. Okay.

688
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,940
(Transaction failed.
Please check network connection.)

689
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,540
(Transaction failed.
Please check network connection.)

690
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,960
Not plugged in?

691
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,350
What’s on this?

692
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,110
It’s all black.

693
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,580
(WeChat Pay)

694
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,710
I don’t know

695
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,310
what this thing is.

696
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,110
It’s broken.

697
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,390
There’s no electricity.

698
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,230
How can we pay?

699
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,520
Hello, everyone.

700
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,900
I am a lawyer.

701
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,310
I found the record of
this health product company

702
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,780
through the public information of
the Bureau of Industry and Commerce.

703
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,390
This is a fraud company

704
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,750
that has changed its name many times
for the purpose of defrauding pension.

705
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,830
Please don’t give them any money.

706
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,020
How could this be?

707
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,230
What’s going on?

708
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,750
Maintain order.

709
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,080
Maintain order.

710
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,750
Follow me.

711
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,150
Maintain order.

712
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,870
Last year,

713
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,000
after the company was shut down,

714
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,790
it changed its name to Xihuantong.

715
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,040
-Their 38,000 royal physiotherapy bed
-Please calm down.

716
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,430
-costs less than 1,000 yuan
-I’ll explain more about that.

717
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,610
and is produced in a small workshop

718
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,000
-with no qualifications at all.
-I’ll give you a satisfactory answer.

719
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,710
Besides, the massage pad
and footbath bucket

720
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,390
are unbranded and dateless products
by nameless factories.

721
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,460
Turn off the speaker!

722
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,190
Are they really swindlers?

723
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,830
Search!

724
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,350
Refund!

725
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:06,860
Give our money back!

726
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,750
Refund! Refund!

727
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,310
Refund!

728
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,670
Refund!

729
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,380
We won’t buy it!

730
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,460
It’s you.

731
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,030
We’ve met before.

732
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,680
Come!

733
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,350
Come here!

734
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,940
Get in!

735
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,270
You think you’re lucky enough

736
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,910
to mess with my business

737
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,630
and then still escape?

738
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,310
According to the Law on Penalties
for Administration of Public Security,

739
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,160
a person who beats up another person,

740
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,990
or intentionally hurts
the body of another person

741
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,270
shall be detained for not less than
five days but not more than ten days.

742
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,390
If the circumstances are serious

743
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,480
and the crime of intentional injury
is constituted, he may be sentenced.

744
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,200
What did you say?

745
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,910
I didn’t hear you.

746
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,420
I said I had called the police.

747
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,000
Then you’d better hurry up!

748
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,150
Or it will be too late!

749
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,910
A tough guy?

750
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,310
Aren’t you ashamed
of using force to a girl?

751
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,270
I’m a doctor.

752
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,940
I know where makes you suffer the most.

753
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,420
(Police)

754
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,750
They’ve all been arrested.

755
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,430
Mr. Lin.

756
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,270
You’ll get your money back.

757
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,390
If you feel any discomfort

758
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,200
or feel dizzy and want to vomit,

759
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,000
please let me know at once.

760
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,540
Okay?

761
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,710
Dr. Wen.

762
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,710
I’ve bought alcohol pads

763
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,750
and ointment.

764
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,120
Don’t let your wound get infected.

765
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,380
Let me take care of it for you.

766
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,390
Why did you come here alone

767
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,710
without telling me?

768
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,710
Your time is precious.

769
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,600
I didn’t want to trouble you.

770
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,710
You troubled me at last, didn’t you?

771
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,190
What if I didn’t find you?

772
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,120
What if the police were late?

773
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,860
What if you got hurt?

774
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,390
I was being unthoughtful…

775
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,540
Much worse than that.

776
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,350
You were being reckless!

777
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,830
Have I ever told you

778
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,980
not to put yourself in danger

779
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,110
and not to cross the line
and interfere with the patient’s life?

780
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,790
You have.

781
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,300
Then why did you follow here?

782
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,420
I couldn’t stand by.

783
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,350
Knowing that there was a trap

784
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,790
and people were falling into it,

785
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,750
if it were you,

786
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,900
would you have stood by?

787
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,380
Cong Rong,

788
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,980
what is your job?

789
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,160
Conciliation.

790
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,630
You haven’t forgotten.

791
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,750
You work for the hospital.

792
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,900
Your work should be within
Yun Ji Hospital.

793
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,270
Outside the hospital,

794
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,910
people all have troubles.

795
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,960
Are you able to help them all?

796
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,150
I’m not.

797
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,950
But you’re just the same.

798
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,500
Pot calling the kettle black.

799
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,790
What about me?

800
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,870
You also crossed the line
and interfered with my life.

801
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,830
And you put yourself in danger.

802
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,960
I’m the one who’s being well now.

803
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,160
It’s you who got hurt.

804
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,110
You told me to stay within the hospital

805
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,540
but you came outside to save me.

806
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,560
By your standards,

807
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,060
you were minding other’s business.

808
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,310
I was minding your business.

809
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,750
Not others’.

810
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,420
What’s it to you that I was in danger?

811
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,060
Who am I to you?

812
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,960
You came all the way here

813
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,750
only to scold me.

814
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,820
(A Castle in the Clouds)

815
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,230
Time is limited.

816
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,200
Let’s go directly to
your book about garret.

817
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,310
On the whole,

818
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,830
this collection of poems
lacks propagation power.

819
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,230
People nowadays…
What they need are symbols.

820
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,110
They want to be catered to.

821
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,630
Our publisher has
a complete set of templates

822
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,670
which I guarantee can package
a writer like you

823
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,430
well

824
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,830
and put you to the market.

825
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,750
We want to turn you
into desireless type.

826
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,310
You will have longer hair.

827
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,420
You will dress more antiquely.

828
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,000
We will go somewhere
with a nice natural view

829
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,750
and take your pictures.

830
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,640
You will attend some lectures

831
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,830
and become more popular.

832
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,940
When did you sit there?

833
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,150
It’s been a while.

834
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,510
I didn’t follow you.

835
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,200
I was out to relax

836
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,580
and happened to run into you.

837
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,860
Though you were a gentleman to me
during the day,

838
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,670
I’m not interested in you.

839
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,790
Glad to hear that.

840
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,940
Me either.

841
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,830
Anyway,

842
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,270
I remember now.

843
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,790
The “clock” on your arm was left by me.

844
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,700
Far more than that.

845
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,000
You also broke my door

846
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,230
and dirtied my bed.

847
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,710
You bear grudges easily.

848
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,480
I accidentally tore it that night.

849
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,370
Have a good count.

850
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,580
Forget it.

851
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,630
I broke up anyway.

852
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,470
A Castle in the Clouds.

853
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,270
That’s a good name.

854
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,230
Next time when you encounter
this kind of situation,

855
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,270
call the police first.

856
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,750
Wait until the police arrive.

857
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:17,990
I get it.

858
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,420
Yeah.

859
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,740
(Police)

860
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,500
My wound hurts.

861
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,420
Help me with it.

862
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,600
I don’t want to cross the line.

863
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,790
Do it by yourself.

864
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,870
Fine, stop.

865
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,540
I’ll do it.

866
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,270
Does it hurt?

867
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,230
No.

868
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,600
Then why did you make that sound?

869
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,540
To see if you care about me.

870
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,710
What’s the truth
of people’s relationships?

871
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,110
We keep building boundaries,

872
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,350
but we can’t help testing
and demolishing them.

873
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,310
The one taking the initiative

874
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,190
strikes a match in the air,

875
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,060
hoping that the faint light

876
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,110
would help see the other one’s heart.

877
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,190
Mr. Lin!

878
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,980
What’s wrong with you?

879
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,630
Wake up. Wake up!
