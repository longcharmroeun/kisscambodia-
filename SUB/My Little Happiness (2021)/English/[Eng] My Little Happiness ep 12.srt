Cong Rong.

33

Shaoqing.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,910
Mom.

35
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,830
You’re off work?

36
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,500
Aunt.

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,000
You both work so hard.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,750
I’ve bought you

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,430
two film tickets.

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,740
Go watch the film later.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,150
Get some relaxation.

42
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,780
Mom.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,230
We’re in the 21st century now.

44
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,120
Do you really believe that

45
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,710
we’ll hold on to each other
when we’re scared

46
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,950
like the heroes and heroines
in Korean dramas?

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,950
As long as the movie is great.

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:12,990
Right?

49
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,960
Have fun.

50
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,670
Enjoy yourselves.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,020
I’ll leave now.

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,180
Bye.

53
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,510
Are we going or not?

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,180
Are we?

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,580
Let’s go.

56
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,230
Aunt has left.

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,950
Should we still watch this?

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,670
Let me take you to a place.

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,180
Come.

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,990
Hurry up.

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,840
No.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,300
I can’t run any farther.

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,830
Why do you take me here?

64
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,110
Don’t you think this is like
when we were kids?

65
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,110
At that time, you ran ahead of me.

66
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,580
And I always followed you.

67
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,270
When I couldn’t run any farther,
you would lend me a hand.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,860
Now it’s my turn.

69
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,660
So,

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,540
is this our first date?

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,870
Or course, it is.

72
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,070
It’s our first date

73
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,020
as a fake couple.

74
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,510
Why don’t we become a real couple?

75
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,420
You still need time to think about it?

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
What’s most important for me right now

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,660
is my report to the law firm.

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,260
Can we wait till I pass it…?

79
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,420
Considering your capability,

80
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,150
it must be easy for you to pass.

81
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,870
The competition at the law firm
is so fierce.

82
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,780
It’s not as easy as you think.

83
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,780
Let’s make a bet.

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,220
If you pass it,

85
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,070
you’ll be my girlfriend.

86
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,780
What if I fail?

87
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,780
I’ll admit my defeat.

88
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,830
I’m the stake then.

89
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,420
I’ll be your boyfriend.

90
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,630
You...

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,190
win either way.

92
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,980
If you have no objections,
I’ll take that as a yes.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,830
I’m home.

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,870
You’re home.

95
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,510
It’s quite late.

96
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,220
Are you tired?

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,310
I still have to work.

98
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,920
Mom.

99
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,660
Go to bed early.

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,220
I have to hurry and prepare my PPT.

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,430
It’s so late now.

102
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,620
You should rest.

103
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,720
Let’s talk.

104
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,900
Let’s chitchat.

105
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,230
Mom.

106
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,430
You’re as beautiful as
an eighteen-year-old girl.

107
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,070
But chitchatting late at night

108
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,510
still makes you age faster.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
My daughter is in a relationship.

110
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,710
How could I not know the details?

111
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,580
I’ve prepared my seat and snacks.

112
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,020
I’m waiting for your story.

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,600
I’ve been reporting to you all day.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,460
Can’t I keep the details to myself?

115
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,460
How’s your progress?

116
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,830
Have you held hands?

117
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,780
Have you kissed?

118
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,460
It’s not that fast.

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Aren’t you in hurry?

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,000
When do you plan to

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,830
make that your priority?

122
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,470
When I think about

123
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,800
how you’re so old and have never had
a romantic relationship,

124
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,020
I’m so worried that I can’t sleep.

125
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,990
Mom.

126
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,190
Don’t worry.

127
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,790
Just let nature take its course.

128
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,470
How can you let nature take its course?

129
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,070
Back then,

130
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,710
I started to date your dad in college.

131
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,380
We got married the moment we graduated.

132
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,830
We just couldn’t be apart.

133
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,980
We stayed with each other
until the dorm curfew…

134
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,180
What happened?

135
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,140
Why isn’t it responding?

136
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,870
You go ahead with your work.

137
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,430
I’ll enjoy my beauty sleep.

138
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,510
Mom. Wait a minute.

139
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,870
What happened to my laptop?

140
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,390
That day I saw the news

141
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,460
about your heroic deed.

142
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,270
I got so angry.

143
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,020
And I slammed the laptop close.

144
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,340
The computer screen went black.

145
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,680
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

146
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,100
What should I do now?

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,220
Shaoqing has a laptop.

148
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,540
You can use his.

149
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,020
Go. Hurry up. Go.

150
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,830
Go.

151
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,420
Don’t come home too early.

152
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,560
Take your time.

153
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,070
Don’t rush.

154
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,660
Go to bed early.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,190
I’ll wait for you.

156
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,870
Can you stop staring at me?

157
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,820
Don’t get me wrong.

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,510
I’m here to borrow your computer.

159
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,830
Are you really here only to
borrow my computer?

160
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,990
Are you lending me or not?

161
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,270

172
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,500
<i>Zhong Zhen</i>

173
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,230
It jumped out by itself.

174
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,270
This...

175
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,180
It seems that
you’re keenly following my update.

176
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,080
No…

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,590
Is Zhong Zhen giving you
his daily report?

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,550
No, he’s not.

179
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,270
I have no idea why he sent these.

180
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,900
Really?

181
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,670
You’re quite a distraction here.

182
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,550
You’d better go away.

183
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,310
Move. Go.

184
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,700
Go away. Go. Go.

185
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,110
Zhong Zhen.

186
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,180
Zhong Zhen.

187
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,820
Zhong Zhen!

188
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,060
Why did you send these?

189
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,270
Why should you tell me

190
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,910
what your boss wore

191
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,300
and what he did?

192
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,940
<i>Cousin</i>

193
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,110
I’m sorry.

194
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,230
I sent these to the wrong person.

195
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,270
I was supposed to send these
to boss’s fan group.

196
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,480
They ask me to do daily update.

197
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,300
And I should send photos as well.

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,870
You’d better keep yourself

199
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,900
out of my sight for a while.

200
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,300
<i>One Palace Home</i>

201
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,510
I forgot to buy yogurt.

202
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,390
Aunt, don’t go.

203
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,470
There’s yogurt in the fridge.

204
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,270
Great.

205
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,990
Thank you.

206
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,420
Aunt?

207
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,790
Watch out.

208
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,700
Be careful with your fingers.

209
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,180
What’s going on?

210
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,470
What are you standing there for?

211
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,540
Go brush your teeth and wash your face.
It’s time for breakfast.

212
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,750
Go sit there.

213
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,780
Shaoqing has already put
your chopsticks and bowl there.

214
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,590
If I’m not mistaken,

215
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,630
this is our first breakfast together

216
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,700
after we said
we would have breakfast together.

217
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,660
When did we say
we would have breakfast together?

218
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,940
Have you forgotten?

219
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,470
That time you stayed at my place.

220
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,240
You lived together?

221
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,590
It’s not what you think.

222
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,270
Nonsense.

223
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,390
What is it then?

224
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,820
Cong Rong doesn’t want me to say it.

225
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,590
It’s really nothing.

226
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,030
Mom.

227
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,790
It’s really nothing.

228
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,820
There seems to be more stories.

229
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,590
Why did you bring this up?

230
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,540
It’s just a causal talk.

231
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,150
Then why didn’t you make it clear?

232
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,020
Because you didn’t let me
finish the speech.

233
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,750
You did it on purpose.

234
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,020
Rangyirang.

235
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,670
Rangyirang.

236
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,120
Sit.

237
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,780
Come here.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,060
Don’t be rude.

239
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,910
Fine.

240
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,710
You can have it.

241
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,840
You’re just like your master.

242
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,630
You act so shamelessly.

243
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,750
It depends on who we’re with.

244
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,710
Rangyirang is not interested in

245
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,270
whom I don’t like.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,390
Cong Rong, Shaoqing, look over here.

247
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,270
Mom.

248
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,070
What are you doing?

249
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,260
I finally have a photo

250
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,780
that I can send to my relatives’ group
and boast.

251
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,700
My son-in-law is so handsome.

252
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,630
They’ll be so jealous.

253
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,270
Mr. Shangguan.

254
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,990
I’m here to submit the evaluation form.

255
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,230
Lucy is in the office.

256
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,180
What else?

257
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,900
My internship will be over soon.

258
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,750
My dad wants to invite you and Mr. Tan

259
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,390
to dinner after the report.

260
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,750
You shouldn’t have.

261
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,720
Everyone is busy.

262
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,200
You don’t have to make time for me.

263
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,240
Thank you for your kindness.

264
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,390
No.

265
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,670
Thanks to your help,

266
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,200
I was able to pass the exams.

267
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,240
And you helped me a lot
during my internship.

268
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,630
This invitation didn’t
only come from my father.

269
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,510
I want to express my gratitude
to you too.

270
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,320
I was just doing my job.

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,390
Besides, Lucy did most of the work
about your internship.

272
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,720
You should thank her instead of me.

273
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,750
Of course.

274
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,510
I must invite Lucy as well.

275
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,600
If you accept the invitation,

276
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,750
I’ll invite her immediately.

277
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,990
Excuse me.

278
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,320
Can you tell me the way
to Zejiang Tower?

279
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,630
There’s a China Merchants Bank.

280
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,750
Zejiang Tower is right behind it.

281
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,150
Okay.

282
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,780
Thank you.

283
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,600
Since I returned,

284
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,700
I haven’t taken you to dinner.

285
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,350
How about this?

286
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,120
Tomorrow, I’ll take you to dinner.

287
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
I’ll invite Lucy, you and the interns

288
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,510
to dinner together.

289
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,390
Okay. Great.

290
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,420
Cong Rong.

291
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,020
Good morning, Mr. Shangguan.

292
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,870
Get off work earlier tomorrow.

293
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,510
I’ll invite Lucy, you
and the other interns

294
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,550
to dinner.

295
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,700
Just pick a causal place.

296
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,820
But...

297
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,270
In this case, we won’t take up

298
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,870
the precious time
of your dad’s and Mr. Tan’s.

299
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,390
And the atmosphere can be more casual.

300
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,660
Okay, Mr. Shangguan.

301
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,510
Find a nice restaurant.

302
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,990
All right.

303
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,030
Let’s call it a day.

304
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,070
You’re dismissed.

305
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,870
Okay.

306
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,300
Zhong Zhen, stay for a while.

307
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,940
Give me your phone.

308
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,590
Why have you been taking photos
of me stealthily?

309
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,880
My cousin asked me to.

310
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,420
Don’t use her as an excuse.

311
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,900
Do you want to transcribe books again?

312
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Give me a few seconds.

313
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
Let me think which book is the thickest.

314
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,420
I sent these photos to your fan group
in exchange of figures.

315
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,590
Lots of figures.

316
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,870
Why did you send them to your cousin?

317
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,940
I sent them by mistake.

318
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,790
You saw them?

319
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,900
Gosh.

320
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,030
No wonder she was so angry.

321
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,240
Gosh. I’m screwed.

322
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,030
She’ll get back at me for sure.

323
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,350
Wait a second.

324
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,030
Why were you staying together

325
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,670
when it was so late?

326
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,590
Do you have any objection?

327
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,980
No. No.

328
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,180
How dare I object?

329
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,390
But, boss...

330
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,260
Do you really like my cousin?

331
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,110
Although I quite like you,

332
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,830
if my cousin doesn’t,

333
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,000
you can’t win her over even if you
follow her everywhere 25 hours a day.

334
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,260
I can’t...?

335
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,750
But rest assured.

336
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,960
With me on your side,

337
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,790
I can make sure you get together,

338
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,500
as long as you show me your sincerity.

339
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,070
What sincerity?

340
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,680
For example,
letting my dissertation pass.

341
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,160
Or, if the student makes a mistake,

342
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,630
boss has to transcribe 50 copies first.

343
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,980
Fine.

344
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,700
But you’d better not forget
what you said just now.

345
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,870
I’ll look into her tonight’s schedule
for you immediately.

346
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,550
<i>Burang Barbeque</i>

347
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,030
Rong.

348
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,180
You’re so incredible!

349
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,910
Save your drama.

350
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,680
Seven people can’t contribute
too much to your sales revenue.

351
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,900
Why are you so exited?

352
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,100
Having customers means that
the business is staying afloat.

353
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,310
Having customers means that
I need a helping hand.

354
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,180
Wen Shaoqing and you are my Cupid.

355
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,030
What did you just say?

356
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,150
No.

357
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,550
Wen Shaoqing and you are
my God of Wealth.

358
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,940
Welcome.

359
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,630
Mom?

360
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,550
Why are you here?

361
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,830
You don’t come home.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,870
And I’m also not allowed to visit you?

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,950
Find a place to sit first.

364
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,940
I’ll get you a cup of water.

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,870
Rang!

366
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,990
You live in such a place?

367
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,160
You must have been through so many
hardships living on your own.

368
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,920
That’s not true.

369
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,150
I feel so at ease living on my own.

370
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,350
I just saw that your place
is filled with takeout boxes.

371
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,480
You can’t always eat takeout.

372
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,940
Takeout is not nutritious.

373
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,950
It’s fine.

374
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,180
I don’t have high standards
for food anyway.

375
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,510
My heart broke
when I saw you live like this.

376
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,790
You’re willing to
leave your family behind

377
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,830
just because you threw a tantrum
with your dad?

378
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,990
Do you really have to give yourself
a hard time?

379
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,200
No, not at all.

380
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,060
I’m fine.

381
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,240
The space is a bit cramped.

382
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,150
But I’m a free spirit here.

383
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,550
No one is nagging around me.

384
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,200
My hair is growing faster now.

385
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,700
You...

386
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,660
You’re so garrulous.

387
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,590
How’s dad’s health?

388
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,590
Ever since you left,

389
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,300
your dad has never mentioned you.

390
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,960
But every time he has a chance,

391
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,000
he will try to inquire about
you stealthily.

392
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,110
If his intentions are exposed,

393
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,350
he pretends he doesn’t care about you.

394
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,740
You’re so alike.

395
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,030
Rang.

396
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,260
Your bet will be over soon.

397
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,510
Come home with me.

398
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,300
No.

399
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,260
I can’t admit defeat
until the last moment.

400
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,500
I had been standing outside the store
for over ten minutes.

401
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,920
And I saw no guest coming in.

402
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,440
How could you win the bet?

403
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
I have customers.

404
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,980
Where are they?

405
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,220
Where?

406
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,640
I can stay here for another ten minutes.

407
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,480
If no customer comes,
you have to go home with me.

408
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,070
You can’t sleep well or eat well here.

409
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,880
Sir.

410
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,940
I want to buy books.

411
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,260
She wants to buy books.

412
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,740
Mom, I have a customer.

413
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,180
I have to greet my customer now.

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,030
Which books do you want?

415
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,440
I’ve finished The Wealth of Nations

416
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,710
you recommended to me last time.

417
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,020
It’s an amazing book.

418
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,240
Adam Thmith...

419
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,740
Adam Smith.

420
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,700
Economics books are over here.

421
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,350
Right.

422
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,500
My memory is so bad.

423
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,900
His book talks about systematic
economics in such a way that

424
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,960
a layman like me is able to understand.

425
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,030
So I’m very interested in economics now.

426
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,900
Can you recommend
a few more books to me?

427
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,880
This one is good for you.

428
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,510
It talks about the development
of American capital market.

429
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,460
<i>The Great Game</i>
It’s quite fun to read.

430
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,720
And the book Story I recommended to you

431
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,310
was too professional.

432
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,720
The Story of Art talks about

433
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,830
the history of art.

434
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,390
It’s on the professional side.

435
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,550
But it’s rather enjoyable.

436
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,070
It explains different eras
of art history

437
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,310
in a way that’s profound
but also easy-to-understand.

438
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,790
It’s worth reading.

439
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,350
Why don’t you read
a piece of literature too?

440
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,030
This.

441
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,590
Walden is a nice book.

442
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,350
These three books
will take quite a while.

443
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,700
Do you have any question?

444
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,980
No.

445
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,550
Thank you.

446
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,150
Rang.

447
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,110
Rang.

448
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,110
I’ll go back since you have a customer.

449
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,480
Are you in a hurry?

450
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,990
Mom.

451
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,550
I’ll leave now.

452
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,660
Fine. Let me walk you out.

453
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,180
Aunt, goodbye.

454
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,460
Goodbye.

455
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,630
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>
I’ll leave now.

456
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,790
Mom.

457
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,200
It’s raining.

458
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,220
Let me call a taxi for you.

459
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,960
No.

460
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,670
There’s no need for that.

461
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,670
The rain is light.

462
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,300
Walking in this rain is soothing.

463
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,350
Don’t bury yourself in this small place.

464
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,820
Come home now and then,

465
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,150
even if it’s just for dinner.

466
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,260
You’re father and son after all.

467
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,700
The bitterness will go away soon.

468
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,310
I see. I see.

469
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,980
It’s been seven years since you ended
your relationship with Jiang, right?

470
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,460
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

471
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,310
You can’t always live in the past,

472
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,160
right?

473
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,740
If there’s a nice girl around you,

474
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,220
you must grab the chance.

475
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,790
What do you think of that girl?

476
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,590
Stop kidding.

477
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,230
That girl.

478
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,400
She has long legs.

479
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,030
Are you drawing lots?

480
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,830
You’re always so naughty.

481
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,700
You

482
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,940
should learn from Shaoqing.

483
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,980
I’ll go now.

484
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,500
Come home sometime.

485
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,590
Mom, be careful on your way home.

486
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,460
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

487
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,440
Thank you.

488
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,150
You really helped me out.

489
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,790
I totally freaked out.

490
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,030
I thought I was going to goof.

491
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,150
That Adam Smith.

492
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,630
I thought it was a film actor’s name.

493
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,070
Why haven’t you left?

494
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,180
I almost forgot!

495
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,150
Shouldn’t you…

496
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,390
reciprocate my kindness?

497
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,150
What do you mean?

498
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,740
I helped you.

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,180

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,920
Just tell me if you need anything.

503
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,310
I hope you can enjoy your meal here.

504

Have fun.

He’s nice.

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,750
He’s very stylish.

511
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,310
What?

512
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,700
Are you interested in him?

513
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,830
Chicken wings for table No. 3.

514
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,940
Your new chef is quite nice too.

515
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,310
He’s not bad.

516
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,260
Just average.

517
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,590
Go. Go.

518
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,500
Stop talking about me.

519
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,700
That’s how my boyfriend
successfully pursued me.

520
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,900
Cong Rong.

521
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,640
How about you?

522
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,390
Are you in a relationship?

523
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,270
Right.

524
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,790
Last time, we saw you

525
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,900
hugging with a handsome guy.

526
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,830
No.

527
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,150
That’s… That’s a misunderstanding.

528
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,750
Don’t try to shift the subject.

529
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,440
Tell us more about

530
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,070
your story.

531
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,700
I...

532
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,820
She doesn’t want to tell more.
Let her be.

533
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,110
Why don’t we

534
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,630
talk about Mr. Shangguan’s girlfriend?

535
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,030
You all know

536
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,030
Mr. Shangguan’s girlfriend.

537
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,870
And you’re all familiar with her.

538
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,510
Who?

539
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,160
Who is she?

540
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,720
Who?

541
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Who?

542
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,630
His work.

543
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,880
Lucy.

544
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,390
You’re so humorous.

545
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,310
I’m finally here.

546
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,790
Cong Rong.

547
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,900
The restaurant you booked
is so hard to find.

548
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,340
You’re all waiting for me.

549
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,110
I’m really sorry.

550
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,400
Let me order for you.

551
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,030
Waiter.

552
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,640
Jingjing.

553
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,670
We’ve already ordered.

554
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,940
You can take what you want over there.

555
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,340
This is a buffet.

556
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,000
Grab what you want

557
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,260
over there.

558
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,030
Okay.

559
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,630
You look very relaxed.

560
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,070
Have you fixed your family problem?

561
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,880
Yes, I have.

562
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,960
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

563
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,720
My mom is very stubborn.

564
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,030
But she still wants what’s best for me.

565
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,460
So she gave up very soon.

566
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,350
That’s great.

567
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,670
Then I’ll be looking forward to
your report tomorrow.

568
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,870
I’ve witnessed your journey these years.

569
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,180
Tomorrow is the final step.

570
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,480
I really wish to see
your dream comes true.

571
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,110
Sure.

572
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,440
I won’t let you down.

573
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,310
You can do it.

574
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,830
Thank you.

575
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,680
If you have any question,
don’t hesitate to ask me.

576
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,420
Sure.

577
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,550
Try this. This is good.

578
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,180
Thank you.

579
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,550
Coming.

580
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,680
No scallions.

581
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,070
No vermicelli.

582
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,300
Less garlic.

583
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,830
If the taste is bad,

584
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,260
I’ll give you a one-star review.

585
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,440
Do you want some lemon juice

586
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,460
so you can eat it raw in the sour way?

587
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,220
You’re sour!

588
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,200
Yes.

589
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,830
These are the two sides...

590
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,310
So she is the spoilt Lady Jingjing

591
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,350
that Cong Rong talks about.

592
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,350
Hurry up.

593
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,310
I’m fast enough.

594
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,920
I’ve heard about

595
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,070
your recent performance.

596
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,420
And we’ve witnessed

597
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,020
your amazing success.

598
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,870
Tomorrow is the final test.

599
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
No matter what the outcome is,

600
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,880
I hope I can work with you

601
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,150
in this profession in the future.

602
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,660
And I want to cheer for you too.

603
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,480
Have an amazing performance.

604
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,110
Thank you.

605
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,790
Thank you, teachers.

606
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,260
I’ll do my best.

607
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,310
Maybe you think studying law,
passing National Judicial Examination,

608
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,550
and finishing the internship

609
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,070
are exhausting enough.

610
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,940
What I want to tell you is that

611
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,870
this is just the beginning.

612
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,870
Every case in the future

613
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,110
will be as tough as hell.

614
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,740
You need to give your best effort
to every one of them.

615
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,310
You need to fight to defend justice.

616
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,550
The biggest challenge for a lawyer

617
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,720
is not the overtime,

618
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,420
or losing the case.

619
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,750
It’s the choice you make

620
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,310
when you’re confused
or faced with temptation.

621
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,420
Can you still be on the justice’s side?

622
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,460
I hope you can

623
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,110
still remember the aspiration
you have at this moment

624
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,070
no matter how far you go in the future.

625
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,460
Remain true to
your original aspirations.

626
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,550
Move forward bravely.

627
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,230
Mr. Shangguan is right.

628
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,270
We’ll do our best.

629
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,940
Come.

630
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,190
Cheers.

631
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,750
You can do it.

632
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,350
We can do it.

633
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,070
Enjoy the food.

634
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,740
Sure.

635
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,160
Mr. Shangguan.

636
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,100
This one is for you.

637
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,980
Thank you.

638
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,500
People all say that
there are many temptations for lawyers.

639
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,880
Many people left this profession

640
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,180
because of some incidents.

641
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,550
Mr. Shangguan,

642
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,960
have you ever faced

643
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,980
this kind of things?

644
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,220
Of course.

645
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,150
How did you deal with them?

646
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,420
I figured them out myself.

647
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,830
Your dad is also a lawyer.

648
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,870
You can ask him.

649
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,630
What is this?

650
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,430
Pig nose tendon.

651
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,070
Don’t tell me
you’ve never tried this before.

652
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,180
Is this edible?

653
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,220
It’s quite nice.

654
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,500
I’ll have one more.

655
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,870
Give me pepper powder.

656
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,340
<i>Cumin</i>

657
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,920
<i>Pepper Powder</i>
What’s wrong with you today?

658
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,790
Are you blind?

659
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,900
I gave you the wrong one?

660
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,700
Why are you always staring at me?

661
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,740
I’m just curious.

662
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,030
About what?

663
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,180
You seem to know a lot.

664
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,660
Where did you learn these?

665
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,870
You said you were once a cook.

666
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,550
Why did you become a cook?

667
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,980
My college friend asked me to.

668
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,480
What about playing instrument?

669
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,880
You learned during college as well?

670
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,420
Yes.

671
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,150
What did you learn the instrument for?

672
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,260
To pursue a girl?

673
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,240
The girl your mom talked about
last time?

674
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,070
Is there a story?

675
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,680
Can you tell me?

676
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,400
Deliver these now.

677
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,310
Why do you have so many questions?

678
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,500
Barbecue man.

679
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,030
Give me what I often order.

680
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,920
Why don’t you help me when you’re here?

681
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Although I’m here to

682
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,310
pick up my girlfriend-to-be from work,

683
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,580
I can help you

684
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,940
before I pick her up.

685
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,550
Girlfriend?

686
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,030
Look how happy he is.

687
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,980
Wash your hands and do the dishes.

688
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,400
Wu Dazhuang

689
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,780
asked the presiding judge directly.

690
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,790
“Tell me which item and which chapter

691
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,000
of the Criminal Law this is?”

692
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,390
The presiding judge had to say,

693
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,550
“Attention, public prosecutor.

694
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,640
We’re in the middle of a court,

695
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,660
not the middle of a lecture.

696
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,510
Besides, Mr. Wu,

697
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,900
I’ve graduated.”

698
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,030
So,

699
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,190
when you’ve stayed in this profession
long enough,

700
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,440
every face will be familiar.

701
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,220
Thank you.

702
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,150
It’s fine.

703
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,070
Here.

704
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,700
Your boyfriend is here.

705
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,220
<i>I’m here to pick you up.</i>

706
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,260
What is it?

707
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,440
I’m here to remind you that

708
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,630
you shouldn’t be so greedy.

709
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,900
You might choke.

710
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,940
What do you mean?

711
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,030
I’m asking you to stay away
from my Mr. Shangguan.

712
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,350
You’re so boring.

713
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,550
Don’t go.

714
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,510
I haven’t finished yet.

715
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,590
Kitchen area is restricted.

716
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,590
Please do not enter.

717
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,310
I’m sorry.

718
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,640
Ask her to come out.

719
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,070
I haven’t finished
my conversation with her.

720
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,310
You’re going to ask her to

721
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,440
stay away from

722
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
your Mr. Shangguan.

723
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,880
Am I right?

724
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,000
It’s none of your business.

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,500
It was none of my business at first.

726
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,920
But you’re being so catty
in my restaurant.

727
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,830
That’s your fault.

728
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,070
Should I help you

729
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,740
out of kindness?

730
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,820
Let me confess your love for you?

731
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,550
How dare you!

732
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,390
Stay out of my business.

733
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,710
I’ve said that we shouldn’t come
to a restaurant like this.

734
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,350
Indeed...

735
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,390
What… What are you doing?

736
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,030
My stomach...

737
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,660
My stomach hurts too.

738
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,240
Tang Shuo.

739
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,020
Xu Rou.

740
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,680
Are you all right?

741
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,400
Are you all right?

742
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,830
Hurry up.

743
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,590
Take care of her.

744
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,160
Are you all right?

745
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,260
Is the food unsanitary?

746
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,830
Tang Shuo.

747
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,920
Why are you having a stomachache?

748
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,940
What did you eat?

749
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,150
Are you all right?

750
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,740
Dr. Wen!

751
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,740
What happened?

752
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,350
I don’t know.

753
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,150
It hurts so much.

754
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,940
Hang in there.

755
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,720
What happened?

756
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,270
Hang in there. Hang in there.

757
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,880
Can you still move?

758
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,440
Can you?

759
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,350
Hang in there.

760
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,590
It hurts so badly.

761
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,260
What’s going on?

762
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,240
Send them to the hospital right now.

763
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,980
I’ll drive.

764
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,110
Send them to the hospital.

765
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,110
Lucy.

766
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,740
Can you still move?

767
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,700
<i>Emergency</i>

768
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,100
<i>Liu Ying</i>

769
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,310
Food poisoning caused

<i>Food poisoning

771
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,310
Hello.

772
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,750
Hello.

773
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,590
I’m here to pay the fees.

774
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,500
870 yuan in total.

775
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,300
The report has come out.

776
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,740
It’s food poisoning
caused by bacterial infection.

777
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,110
The symptoms are mild.

778
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,630
So the problem is not very serious.

779
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,110
Taking medications as prescribed

780
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,430
will lessen the symptoms.

00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,630
Xiong Jingjing.

782
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,910
Your symptoms are more severe.

783
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,030
You need to be put on a drip
for three days.

784
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,280
Come to the hospital on time.

785
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,660
For three days?

786
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,300
What about my report tomorrow?

787
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,510
I haven’t finished my PPT.

788
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,060
I said a small restaurant
like yours is not safe.

789
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,860
You really screwed me up.

790
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,430
Cong Rong,

791
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,380
did you do this on purpose?

792
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,990
I’m really sorry.

793
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,150
This is my fault.

794
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,670
I’ll take full responsibility for this.

795
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,790
And I’ll give you
a satisfactory solution.

796
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,380
No.

797
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,440
I’m the owner of the restaurant.

798
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,480
I should be the one accountable to you.

799
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,360
I’ll compensate for your losses.

800
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,760
I’ll try my best to make you satisfied.

801
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,820
Satisfied?

802
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,380
How could we be satisfied?

803
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,800
For us, tomorrow

804
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,340
is even more important
than the day of College Entrance Exam.

805
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,550
What can you possibly offer
to compensate for our losses?

806
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,780
Okay.

807
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,480
Nobody wanted this to happen.

808
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,820
This is an accident.

809
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,700
There’s no need to blame anyone.

810
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,470
The report will be deferred

811
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,260
till you recover.

812
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,630
I’ll notify you later.

813
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,340
But, Mr. Tan...

814
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,700
I’ll talk to Mr. Tan.

815
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,180
Okay.

816
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,470
Thank you so much.

817
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,950
I’m really sorry.

818
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,710
Since it’s not severe,

819
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,820
you can go home and take some rest.

820

821
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,860
Your condition is severer.

822
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,380
Come back to work when you’ve recovered.

823
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,860
Let’s go.

824
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,580
Take Chengcheng home first.

825
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,110
Okay.

00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,820
Give me your files.

832
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,030
What files?

833
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,550
Your internship files.

That’s my duty.

Dr. Wen, do you have something else
you want to say?

841
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,950
Cong Rong performed very well

842
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,470
during her stay at the hospital.

Mr. Shangguan, I really hope

845
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,150
you won’t let the incident affect

846

your evaluation of her.

847
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,360

850
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,070
Get in the car.

851

Do you know where I’m going?

852
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,700
I know.

853
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,260
I’ll take you to the place
you want to go.

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,860
I’ll take care of it. Don’t touch.

855
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,260
What are you doing?

856
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,430
It doesn’t hurt for me.

857
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,190
Why do you look like you’re in pain?

858
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,800
How could this not hurt?

859
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,660
You’re not a vegetable.

860
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,110
I can’t succeed in anything in life.

861
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,320
I’d rather be a vegetable.

862
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,190
Nonsense!

863
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,910
Spit it out.

864
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,860
Stand up.

865
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,470
Sit down.

866
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,950
Let me get you some bandages.

867
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,340
I told the truth.

868
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,030
I opened a steak house.

869
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,920
The food was so horrible
that people all hated it.

870
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,380
And my dad paid to
keep my restaurant going.

871
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,990
I tried so hard to prove
that I’m not a loser.

872
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,070
But the only thing I’ve proved
is that I am a loser.

873
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,380
I’ve ruined my restaurant.

874
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,550
What’s worse, I implicated my bestie.

875
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,740
My life is a complete failure.

876
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,860
Do I still have any hope?

877
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,550
People tend to

878
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,990
think too much when they’re sad.

879
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,190
When they think too much,

880
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,800
they only see things
in a negative light.

881
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,430
If they do so,

882
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,740
they’ll get even more upset.

883
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,220
That’s an infinite loop.

884
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,950
How about this?

885
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,110
Get some sleep now.

886
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,150
I’ll take care of this.

887
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,590
When you wake up,

888
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,260
the world will be beautiful again.

889
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,430
No.

890
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,220
I’m so depressed now.

891
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,670
How can I possibly fall asleep?

892
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,790
You can’t fall asleep here, of course.

893
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,000
You should go back to your room.

894
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,510
Lie in your fluffy bed.

895
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,920
Close your eyes.

896
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,030
Listen to some music.

897
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,760
And you may

898
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,550
later...

899
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,220
Wen Rang.

900
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,470
I’m so sad.

901
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,820
I know.

902
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,430
You can have the bed for tonight.

903
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,220
When you’re tired,

904
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,180
I can be your massage machine
and mopping robot.

905
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,510
Nephew.

906
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,590
Your uncle’s waist and back hurt too.

907
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,000
My muscles are sore.

908
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,220
Give me a massage too.

909
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,320
You sound so full of life.

910
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,550
You seem to be just fine.

911
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,060
Discrimination

912
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,030
hurts people the most.

913
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,660
What else do you expect?

914
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,780
My nephew’s future wife,

915
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,300
won’t you discipline him?

916
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,430
He doesn’t respect the old
or care for the young.

917
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,990
You sound so full of life.

918
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:23,740
You guys… You guys are so good to me.

919
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,950
Rong.

920
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,950
I’m so sorry.

921
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,590
I’m so afraid that I may drag you down.

922
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,030
I’ve been guilty all night.

923
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,840
She went to bed the moment she got back.

924
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,070
She’s been guilty all night?

925
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,070
She’s been guilty in her dreams.

926
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,590
Right.

927
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,430
Can’t I?

928
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,630
All right.

929
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,830
Don’t worry about me.

930
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,910
Think about what to do
with your restaurant.

931
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,780
What can I do?

932
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,150
I’ve given up.

933
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,470
Just let it be.

934
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,470
No matter what the outcome is,

935
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,910
I can handle it now
with my tough spirit.

936
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,030
It’s the same with you.

937
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,380
Don’t worry too much.

938
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,180
When the sky falls,
our life goes on as usual.

939
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,550
So, you’ve revived so easily?

940
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,430
I’ve never been defeated.

941
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,110
Who said she wanted to be a vegetable?

942
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,380
I’ve come back to life.

943
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,800
Fine. Fine.

944
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,550
I’d love to see
how cheerful you’re tomorrow.

945
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,780
Can you please not try
to undermine my confidence?

946
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,860
You sound so full of life.

947
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,590
You seem to be all right.

948
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,590
You all right?

949
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,480
Did I really hurt you?

950
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:43,920
No. No. No.

951
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,360
Don’t come any closer.

952
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,760
Don’t come any closer.

953
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,230
I’m sorry.

954
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,670
Don’t come any closer.

955
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,000
Don’t come any closer.

956
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,360
Keep your distance.

957
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,760
Keep your distance.

958
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,280
My foot.

959
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,840
Does it hurt?

960
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,550
Don’t come any closer.

961
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,910
Tinderbox.

962
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,700
I want to drink freshly-ground coffee.
