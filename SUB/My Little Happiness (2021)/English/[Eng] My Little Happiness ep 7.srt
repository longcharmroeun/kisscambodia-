Wen Shaoqing,

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,100
do you

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,020
like me?

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,620
Do you want the answer?

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,340
Let me tell you.

36
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,580
Yes.

37
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,830
I like you.

38
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,300
My god!

39
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,180
Why did I have such a dream?

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,510
I have to find someone to open the lock.

41
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,340
You get up early.

42
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,660
Yeah, I have to go to work.

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,550
Just in time.

44
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,710
I’ve called customer service for you.

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,780
I’ve fixed the lock, too.

46
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,150
The password is your birthday.

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,150
Thank you.

48
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
The password is wrong.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,020
You gave me the wrong...

50
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,780
You’re acting like you have a syndrome.

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,190
What is that?

52
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,630
Do you want the answer?

53
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,830
Let me tell you.

54
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,310
Yes.

55
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,630
I like you.

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,270
Sleep deprivation syndrome.

57
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Thanks for taking me in last night.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,020
I have to wash up and go to work.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,340
He didn’t notice my messy hair, did he?

60
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,020
And the scar on my head.

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,900
It’s ugly.

62
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,340
Why would I care about him?

63
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,900
Calm down.

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,620
It was just a dream.

65
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,630
It was just a dream.

66
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,470
What else can I do for you?

67
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,550
After I opened the lock,

68
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,830
I found that your fridge was empty.

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,980
There was nothing in it.

70
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,510
So I bought some food for you.

71
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,660
No need to thank me.

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,430
You come over

73
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,420
to make me breakfast
on the early morning?

74
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,100
Didn’t you say
I made terrible breakfast?

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,830
I made a little improvement.

76
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,540
Try it again.

77
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,070
What would you like tomorrow?

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,270
Tomorrow?

79
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Don’t bother.

80
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,900
I’ll make my own breakfast tomorrow.

81
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,070
What do you usually have for breakfast?

82
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,060
Eggs.

83
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,830
Milk.

84
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,950
That’s all?

85
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,600
I’m in a hurry in the morning.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,020
There’s no need to make a big breakfast.

87
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,780
Why don’t you consider

88
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,220
to have breakfast with me?

89
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,270
It’s easy for you to say.

90
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,820
You make a big breakfast every day.

91
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,660
Who is supposed to do the dishes,

92
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,820
wash the pans

93
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,630
and do the washing-up?

94
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,150
All you have to do is eating.

95
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,100
How much does it cost per month?

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,580
Dr. Wen.

97
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,660
Name your price.

98
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,020
How much does the chef charge?

99
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,310
How much does the food cost?

100
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Name a price per day.

101
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,460
I won’t take advantage of you.

102
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,660
Do I look like a breakfast seller?

103
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,190
It’s better to make it clear,

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,020
otherwise, people would think we...

105
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,510
We?

106
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,100
Think that I take advantage of you.

107
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,830
That’s a deal.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,580
You buy ingredients from now on.

109
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,020
I make breakfast.

110
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,150
Okay.

111
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,980
Let’s eat.

112
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,150
I usually take this seat.

113
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,070
I’m not used to other spots.

114
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,390
Good choice.

115
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,660
It’s more comfortable to sit here.

116
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,120
It’s more fun to eat together

117
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,540
than to eat alone.

118
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,590
It’s nice for us

119
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,470
to be together.

120
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,780
I didn’t agree to be with you.

121
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,470
Didn’t you just agree
to have breakfast with me?

122
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,390
Are you going back on your word?

123
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,590
I almost forgot an important thing.

124
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,060
What are you doing?

125
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,940
Just touch your head.

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,540
Why do you touch my head?

127
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,870
I’m not Rangyirang.

128
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,470
Let me see if the swelling is reduced.

129
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,700
It’s a normal follow-up.

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
Then, you can just watch it.

131
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,630
You don’t have to touch it.

132
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,420
Did you see it clearly?

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,990
I’m fine now.

134
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,230
End of the follow-up.

135
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,700
I feel that you’re nervous.

136
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,150
I’m not nervous.

137
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,780
I’m not.

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,270
No.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,200
From the early morning till now,

140
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,020
your behavior has been weird.

141
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,150
When you grabbed my hand just now,

142
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,420
your hand was sweating
and your heart beat faster.

143
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,150
Wasn’t it nervous?

144
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,990
I’m in weak health.

145
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,020
Weak health.

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,150
Then why didn’t you dare to look at me?

147
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,350
I did.

148
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,820
Then why do you lean back?

149
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,110
Dr. Wen.

150
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,380
You’ll be late for work
if you don’t leave now.

151
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,590
Is there any chance

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,470
that you’ve fallen in love with me?

153
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

154
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,630
How could I possibly like you?

155
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,470
Do you know the five stages of love?

156
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,870
Most patients will

157
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,780
go through five psychological phases

158
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,750
when they face their illness.

159
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,020
Just like you don’t accept of loving me,

160
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,300
now you’re going through
the first phase,

161
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,470
denial.

162
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,270
If you talk nonsense again,

163
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,240
I’ll drive you out!

164
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh, look.

165
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,350
Now it comes the second phase.

166
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,420
Anger.

167
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,150
All right.

168
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,350
Forget what I said.

169
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I withdraw my words.

170
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,870
The third phase,

171
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,590
compromise and expectation.

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,470
If it goes on like this,

173
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,000
I think you’ll soon

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,630
go through the fourth phase.

175
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,390
Being jealous.

176
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,150
Wen Shaoqing!

177
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,540
As for the fifth phase,

178
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,900
I’ll tell you later.

179
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,150
Got to go to work.

180
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,870
See you later.

181
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,630
No.

182
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,630
I’m a good talker usually.

183
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,180
How did I become dumb
at the crucial moment?

184
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,470
Hello?

185
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,700
Don’t you think we eat too much
in the morning?

186
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,270
I’m exhausted.

187
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,300
I just find

188
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,380
that only by worrying
about the restaurant,

189
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,540
can I truly feel that it belongs to me.

190
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,750
Your level of awareness has improved.

191
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,390
Congratulations.

192
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,270
You’ve become a bourgeoise from now on.

193
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,780
That’s true.

194
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,660
I’ll make a reservation.

195
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,870
I want 100 kabobs.

196
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,110
OK.

197
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,750
Yesterday, you

198
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,900
just said half of it on the phone.

199
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,030
You and Wen Shaoqing...

200
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,870
It flashes upon me

201
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,270
that if I could borrow your concealer.

202
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,870
Concealer?

203
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
What do you use it for?

204
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,510
There’s a scar on my head

205
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,710
from a fall in my childhood.

206
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,390
Look.

207
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,900
It’s not a big deal.

208
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,940
I fell with Chubby then.

209
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,620
I don’t know how he is doing now.

210
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,940
I kind of miss him.

211
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,000
Chubby.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,820
Chubby.

213
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,230
You mentioned him a lot
when we were in college.

214
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,190
Now you are back.

215
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,540
Have you ever thought of contacting him?

216
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,510
Fatties have great potential.

217
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,780
Haven’t you heard that?

218
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,790
What if he grows up

219
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,110
and becomes a handsome guy?

220
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,300
I don’t think so.

221
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,270
Peng Yuyan is a living example.

222
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,900
I’ll help you to look for him.

223
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,350
He may be right for me

224
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,620
if he isn’t right for you.

225
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,150
Fine.

226
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,940
You look for him.

227
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,820
Boss,

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,720
you need to sign these medical records.

229
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,390
Yeah.

230
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,320
What are you looking at?

231
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,180
You’re engrossed.

232
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,300
Brain CT.

233
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,470
Whose brain CT?

234
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,720
<i>Outpatient Medical Records</i>

235
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,510
Your cousin’s.

236
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,900
My cousin’s?

237
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,230
What happened to her?

238
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,020
Is there anything wrong with her brain?

239
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,780
From the medical point of view,

240
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,110
there isn’t.

241
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,110
She has quite a beautiful skull.

242
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,180
Nice skeleton.

243
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,940
She inherited the good gene
of our family.

244
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,270
But since there’s no problem,

245
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,990
why do you study it?

246
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,200
I just want to see

247
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,940
what is on her mind.

248
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,470
My behavior is evident enough.

249
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,470
Why doesn’t she get it?

250
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,110
Nothing.

251
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,020
Why did Rong take brain CT?

252
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,020
It’s nothing.

253
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,350
She hit the back of her head

254
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,350
and had an examination.

255
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,470
Was Rong hurt?

256
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,780
How did it happen?

257
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,240
Why did you know that

258
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,230
and I didn’t know?

259
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,600
Why can’t I know a thing

260
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,990
that you don’t know?

261
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,000
I know Rong best

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,230
in the world.

263
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,110
Do you?

264
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,420
Yeah.

265
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,700
Fine.

266
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,660
Tell me how Cong Rong got hurt.

267
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
Didn’t you say her head got hit?

268
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,350
Was it serious?

269
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,630
Didn’t you say it was nothing?

270
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,540
Protecting and respecting
patients’ privacy

271
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,990
are important contents
of clinical medical ethics.

272
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,510
How could you tell me

273
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,840
a patient’s privacy carelessly?

274
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,750
You just asked me.

275
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,020
Is that an excuse
to reveal patients’ privacy?

276
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,180
Copy Medical Ethics with your hands.

277
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,660
Give it to me this week.

278
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,960
<i>Doctor-patient Relationship
and Legal Liability</i>

279
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,060
That’s weird.

280
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,420
Why can’t the thermos keep water warm?

281
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,060
Dr. Wen.

282
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,990
I’m going to look for him.

283
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,700
Did I mention Dr. Wen?

284
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,590
Come in.

285
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,060
What is it?

286
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,350
Olive oil.

287
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,940
It’s rich in Omega-3,
Vitamin D and Vitamin E.

288
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,870
It’s helpful to the recovery
of brain injury,

289
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,700
and it can delay cognitive decline.

290
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,110
It’s given by the hospital.

291
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,070
It suits you.

292
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,900
I think

293
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,020
you need it more than I do now.

294
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,630
The contest approaches.

295
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,590
You need some brain food.

296
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,390
By the way,

297
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,300
our doctor-patient relationship
is terminated.

298
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,820
Our teacher-student relationship
begins now.

299
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,300
You’re well prepared.

300
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,230
I’m your teacher from now on.

301
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,700
Please show me some respect,

302
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,080
otherwise, I’ll punish you for copying.

303
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,550
Yes.

304
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,150
Cong...

305
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,900
Teacher.

306
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,820
As my teacher,

307
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,660
should you answer my questions
anytime, anywhere?

308
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,360
OK.

309
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,590
Then I got a question now.

310
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,230
Look,

311
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,830
it says doctor-patient resources here.

312
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
<i>Dr. Liu</i>

313
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,500
Hello?

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,700
Got it.

315
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,590
By the way,

316
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,870
do you mind coming with me

317
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,260
to answer my questions?

318
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,940
How do you feel after the operation?

319
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,590
Much better.

320
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,180
Do you feel any discomfort in your head?

321
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
Nothing serious.

322
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,270
I just feel a little dizzy.

323
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,180
A little dizzy?

324
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,310
It’s a bit numb
in the back of my head.

325
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,070
Numb?

326
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,030
He’s quite handsome.

327
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,460
No wonder the nurses
are crazy about him.

328
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,110
No. I’m his teacher.

329
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,030
Why should I stay here waiting for him?

330
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,510
Since you’re busy,

331
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,310
I’d better highlight
the key points for you.

It makes me pleased.

00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,310
Take this.

344
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,350
If you have any questions,

345
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,590
feel free to ask me on WeChat.

346
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,700
Thank you.

347
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,500
You’re in good mood, too.

348
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,590
Not bad.

349
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,980
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

350
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,150
Can I help you?

351
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,830
Wen Rang,

352
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,070
don’t you think

353
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,660
by taking only 200 steps every day,

354
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,180
you’re lacking in exercise?

355
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,220
I don’t.

356
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,260
Do you want to win the first place
in taking steps in your WeChat Moments?

357
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,240
No.

358
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,030
You don’t want it
because you’re always the last one.

359
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,300
If I have a way to let you be the first,

360
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,700
are you interested in it or not?

361
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,180
I know the way.

362
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,870
Isn’t it to unfriend all of you?

363
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,960
How could you?

364
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,920
You’re so boring.

365
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,790
You don’t respond to any jokes.

366
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,830
What can I say?

367
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,790
Just be straightforward.

368
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,180
I need you to keep my courage up.

369
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,590
No.

370
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,500
Here it is.

371
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,460
What’s this?

372
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,980
Sticks?

373
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,510
This is licorice root
used in pastries and preserves.

374
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,830
You don’t need it for kabobs.

375
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,660
Isn’t it a spice stand?

376
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,110
Why do they sell vegetables?

377
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,460
These are perilla leaves.

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,150
You know quite a lot.

379
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,350
Don’t you come to buy ingredients?

380
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,270
If you continue to waste time,

381
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,070
I won’t do you the favor for free.

382
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

383
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,030
Here. Here. Here.

384
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,900
Here. Here. Here.

385
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,070
Miss.

386
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,910
What do you want?

387
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,590
Sir,

388
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,660
can I use this to grind chili powder?

389
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Do you use it for daily cooking?

390
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,790
I run a restaurant.

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,900
A restaurant?

392
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,510
A restaurant.

393
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,640
Tell you what,

394
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,340
the chili is cheap

395
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,780
and its powder is delicious.

396
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,790
It saves you money.

397
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,740
Does it?

398
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,590
Great.

399
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,640
I’ll buy 2.5 kg.

400
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,220
2.5 kg.

401
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,390
Alright. Alright.

402
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,920
Let me get you a bag.

403
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,940
Do you have too much money to waste?

404
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,110
What do you mean?

405
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,110
Didn’t you ask me to embolden you?

406
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,200
If you can’t wait
to present the details,

407
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,110
how can I help you?

408
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,880
Stand by me.

409
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,350
I just need you to act.

410
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,160
Aren’t you like me?

411
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,310
With half-baked knowledge,

412
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,220
how much do you know?

413
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,830
Do you know
what a person like you is called?

414
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,150
A sucker.

415
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,460
Sir.

416
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,070
The chili gets such strong smell.

417
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,830
It’s all cracked.

418
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,980
I suppose it’s been here for long
and nobody wants it.

419
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,420
That’s not true.

420
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,630
If you think it smells strong,

421
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,230
I’ll show you another one.

422
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,260
Look, which pepper would you like?

423
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,430
I want 1.5 kg of red cluster pepper.

424
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,110
A little less of the long chili.

425
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,870
1 kg.

426
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,310
But for the chili that is soft

427
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,000
and cracked,

428
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,880
I don’t want any of that.

429
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,950
My restaurant is run with integrity.

430
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,980
OK. OK. OK.

431
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,150
Look.

432
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,590
What?

433
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,700
I know nothing about it anyway.

434
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,870
Yet you must act.

435
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,200
You must pretend to be a specialist

436
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,980
if you don’t want to be fooled.

437
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Put all those back in.

438
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,980
And I don’t want these.

439
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,110
These are really delicious.

440
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,480
I don’t want these.

441
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,470
I said I didn’t want these.

442
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,390
Fine. Fine.

443
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,110
Why?

444
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,030
Be smart while you’re shopping.

445
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,950
Those that are taken out by the owner

446
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,460
are usually in sufficient quantity
and good quality.

447
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,660
You’re good.

448
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,830
Come on.

449
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,390
Let me help.

450
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Thank you.

451
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,980
I’ll scan your QR code.

452
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,110
OK.

453
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,920
The money is paid.

454
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,790
Alright. Alright.

455
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,740
Welcome to come again.

456
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,310
Welcome to come again.

457
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,030
Thank you, sir.

458
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,720
Thanks to my keen intuition,

459
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,750
I find a good helper.

460
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,260
You’ve got a wealth of experience.

461
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,550
Where did you learn that?

462
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,500
Why don’t you teach me?

463
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,550
Let me get trained.

464
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,660
Next time I won’t need your help.

465
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,830
Nothing else.

466
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,350
Dexterity comes by experience.

467
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,420
What’s that?

468
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,150
Dexter?

469
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,310
Be cheated more times,

470
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,630
and you’ll get experienced.

471
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,350
Hot!

472
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,070
Would you like to try?

473
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,030
It’s really hot.

474
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,180
Refreshing and inspiring.

475
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,590
So hot.

476
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,150
It’s really refreshing

477
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,420
and a necessity for staying up late.

478
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,220
I don’t believe you.

479
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,790
Why don’t you try one of these?

480
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,460
I don’t think you can bear it.

481
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,150
It’s not as hot as the last one.

482
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,700
Keep the mere trifle for yourself.

483
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,500
Really?

484
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,550
Didn’t I say?

485
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,500
Be cheated more times,
and you’ll get experienced.

486
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,030
Wen Rang!

487
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,310
Wait and see!

488
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,260
Why don’t you cover my travel expense?

489
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,070
Even if you don’t pay me consulting fee,

490
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,220
you should hail us a taxi.

491
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,590
I must save money at the tough time.

492
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,390
When I get rich,

493
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,110
I’ll compensate you ten times.

494
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,900
During my lifetime,

495
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,830
I may not see that day coming.

496
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,900
How beautiful the scenery is!

497
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,900
It’s nice to have a walk.

498
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,300
No.

499
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,110
No.

500
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,160
It’s the second time

501
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,180
that we walk to the restaurant.

502
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,070
You’re taking revenge on me.

503
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,680
Last time I let you
carry the cart back to the restaurant.

504
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,740
This time you deliberately let me do so.

505
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,030
Help!

506
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,310
No!

507
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,030
A teacher mustn’t arrive early.

508
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,900
A student waiting for his teacher

509
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,310
is perfectly justified.

510
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,660
It’s almost the time.

511
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,590
If you dare to be late,

512
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,220
I’ll punish you for copying.

513
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,660
It’s eight o’clock.

514
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,740
Are you cramming for the quiz?

515
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,980
Don’t you know the final spurt
before an exam?

516
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,700
Miss Cong, please sit down.

517
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,830
The regulations of managing
medical accidents are...

518
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,420
The Regulations
of Managing Malpractices.

519
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,030
Judicial Interpretation
of Compensation for Personal Injury.

520
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,950
When did the Tort Law...?

521
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,260
It went into effect on July 1, 2010.

522
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,100
According to The Regulations
of Managing Malpractices,

523
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,430
if an accident isn’t caused
by medical malpractice,

524
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,460
medical institutions are not liable
for compensation.

525
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
But the regulation is contrary…

526
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,110
With the tort liability principle

527
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,500
in General Principles of the Civil Law.

528
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,580
According to
the General Principles of the Civil Law,

529
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,070
citizens and legal persons
who, through their fault, encroach upon

530
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,110
state or collective property
or property of another person

531
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,550
shall bear civil liability.

532
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,700
This question may relate to another one.

533
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,400
In judicial practice,

534
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,680
when judging whether a party
is responsible

535
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,220
for the occurrence of complications,

536
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,350
we should also consider if the party

537
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,830
has fulfilled the duty of care.

538
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,740
On page 36 of your materials,
the second to last paragraph.

539
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,420
Did you eat Doraemon’s memory bread?

540
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,790
Medical students are fearless.

541
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,150
Miss Cong.

542
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,350
If I answered all correctly,

543
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,420
all correctly,

544
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,220
would you give me a reward?

545
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,790
A reward?

546
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,940
Do you want a little red flower
or a little medal?

547
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,420
I want...

548
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,500

He is not in the office, either.

Can I help you?

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,500

My boss is on a business trip.

00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,470
He surely needs me to run him errands.

608
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,260
Business trip?

609
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,830
Does he have to travel on business?

610
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,830
Of course.

611
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,390
Doctors travel a lot.

612
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,980
They either have meetings or operations.

613
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,590
My boss left no words to me,

614
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,460
but he left some words to you.

Neighbor?

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,700
Since when have you become neighbors?

No.

Look.

635
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,990
The next door is called Rang Kai,

636
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,510
which drives all the guests out.

637
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,870

Never decline to host guests.

So all the guests would come to me.

640
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,430
The point is…

641
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,870
How does it taste?

642
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,220
Not bad.

Why don’t you eat?

645
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,550
I ate so much that I almost threw up.

646
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,220
I’ll never be like last time.

647
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,340
At least I must eat till I’m satisfied.

648
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,260
So, unconsciously,

You’re supportive of my business.

676

It makes me happy.

677
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,480
But can you eat so much?

678
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,700
I can take the leftovers home.

679
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,110
If I can’t eat that all,

680
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,510
I will feed the dog with it.

681

Dog?

682

Why are you here?

740
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,820
You scared the hell out of me!

741
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,550
Didn’t he just give you the signs?

742
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,180
You have nobody to blame.

743
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,470
At least give me a clue
if you come back early.

744
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,880
Aren’t you afraid that I would

745
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,630
do something strange in your apartment?

746
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,270
I actually want to know

747
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,070
what strange things you would do.

748
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,860
You just said… Who doesn’t matter?

749
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,860
I didn’t hear it clearly.

750
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,070
Say it again.

751
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,820
I said… I said…

752
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,800
I said, since you came back,

753
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,550
I would return your precious dog to you.

754
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,300
Besides,

755
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,480
the time and energy it takes
to walk your dog

756
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,910
are beyond my expectation.

757
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,070
If you ask me to do that again,

758
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,150
I must triple the charge.

759
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,950
Fine.

760
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,070
It’s worth it, anyway.

761
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,780
It’s time to let her know.
