What’s your name again?

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,950
Cong Rong.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,630
You are finally here.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
I’ve been waiting for you.

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,310
I’m sorry.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
For so long.

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,830
Are you alright?

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,510
Yeah.

39
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,860
Of course.

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,390
I… I’m good.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,180
Although I’m here to make peace,

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,830
you don’t have to be so passionate.

43
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,080
Is this how doctors

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,780
welcome their new colleagues?

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,860
I’m specifically here to wait for you.

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,990
Nobody told me this.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,020
Sorry.

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,800
Next time you want to see me,

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,710
you can tell me directly.

51
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,990
We don’t need a messenger between us.

52
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,860
Are you here today

53
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,860
to just talk about business?

54
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,900
Not exactly.

55
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,710
If it’s not convenient for you now,

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,460
we can meet another time.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,950
I know

58
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,110
you have your own pride.

59
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,430
But do you know who I am?

60
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,710
I do.

61
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,900
Wen Shaoqing, the God of Craniotomy.

62
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,150
Sorry, I forgot.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,230
That nurse told me

64
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,740
that you don’t like
flatulent compliment.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,670
You are Wen Shaoqing, a young doctor
from neurosurgery department.

66
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,550
Did I say something wrong again?

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,020
This guy is hard to get along with.

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,300
I’d better go now.

Boss.

71
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,950
The meeting is over.

72
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,580
And the task is accomplished.

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,780
Any reward for me?

74
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,660
That’s unfair!

75
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,150
I can understand if there’s no reward,

76
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,070
but I’m not a punchbag.

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,100
You stood my cousin up,

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,750
and I took the blame for you.

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,460
I attended those meetings for you,

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,270
and now you beat me up!

81
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,430

82
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,020
Why?

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,980
What did I do wrong?

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,750
You must explain it to me!

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,500
Never mind.

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,660
You are always right.

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,460
If they bully you again,

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,750
just tell me.

You can also call me Swordswoman.

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,830
I’ll marry you when I’m back.

92

Mr. Liang made this

96
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,100
especially for you, Swordswoman.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,720
If I didn’t see it with my own eyes,

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
I would never believe it.

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,310
Right?

100
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,900
Aren’t I a business genius?

101
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,110
Look at this store.

102
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,070
I just randomly took it over.

103
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,120
The cook.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,150
I randomly hired him.

105
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,120
The name.

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,420
I just randomly
opened a dictionary and found it.

Isn’t that amazing?

110
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,340
Life.

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,540
What?

112
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,190
Why do you look so down?

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,430
Some problem at work?

114
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,380
More than that.

115
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,180
My career is collapsing

116
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,270
right at the beginning.

117
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,860
Look at them.

118
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,230
We’re all interns.

119
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,510
But they signed big contracts,

120
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,070
and are appreciated by their boss.

121
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,220
And look at me.

122
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,150
You are not bad either.

123
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,950
You have your own special advantage.

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
Tell me about it.

126
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,070
Me, of course.

127
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,270
I’m a perfect BFF.

128
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,300
Don’t be afraid of losing your job.

129
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,430
This place will always be

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,020
It’s OK.

134
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,270
Do you remember that 8.2?

135
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,870
I have 8.2.

136
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,750
No need to give me change.

137
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,150
That extremely cute guy?

138
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,710
Tell me about it.

139
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,780
He’s really unbelievable.

140
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,580
My first task

141
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,070
in the hospital

142
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,540
is about him.

143
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,540
There’s a patient in our hospital...

<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,900
It looks like

147
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,660
you two were bound to meet.

148
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,550
Do you know what that means?

149
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,460
It means you two are destined
to be together.

150
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,340
You mean I’m destined
to be bullied by him?

151
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,630
If I cannot deal with him,

152
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,100
how will I go back to the law firm?

153
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,720
Don’t go back then.

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,740
No way.

155
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,020
I want to be a lawyer.

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,900
I really don’t understand you.

157
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,350
You’ve got a master’s degree of finance

158
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,870
in Australia.

159
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,270
And you’ve got a great job offer.

160
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,270
Why do you come back to suffer?

161
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,100
I’m not afraid of difficulties.

162
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,830
The thing I’m afraid of is

163
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,020
unable to do what I want to.

164
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,020
That’s the difference
between you and me.

165
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,550
Look at me.

166
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,460
When I play games, I choose easy mode.

167
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,340
That makes me feel relaxed and happy.

168
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,120
But you

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,460
are serious about everything.

170
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,070
People like you

171
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,830
are destined to always be tired.

172
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,060
But you

173
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,220
are serious about everything.

174
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,580
People like you

175
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,390
are destined to always be tired.

176
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,320
Dad,

177
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,470
what’s a lawsuit?

178
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,780
That’s like fighting against monsters.

179
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,900
So you are a hero?

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,350
Like Peter Pan?

181
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,260
Like Spider Man?

182
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,900
Can you protect good people?

183
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,700
Of course.

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,510
But Lawsuit Man
should conceal his identity.

185
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,720
Please keep this secret for me.

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,240
OK.

187
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,470
You promise?

188
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,150
I promise.

189
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,820
This secret will be safe
for a hundred years.

190
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,150
Courage Duck.

191
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,540
The Lawsuit Man shall never lose!

192
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,510
Tomorrow,

193
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,870
I’ll turn on hard mode again.

194
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,590
Fighting!

195
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,660
I don’t mean to start it now!

196
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,940
You are suddenly so nice to me.

197
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,540
I’m a little afraid.

198
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,710
Give it back then.

199
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,700
No.

200
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,110
I’ll fill myself up first.

201
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,590
Zhong Zhen.

202
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,420
Yeah?

203
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,700
Let me ask you.

204
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,140
You rent that apartment
for your cousin?

205
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,940
Yeah.

206
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,470
What’s her name?

207
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,660
Cong Rong.

208
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,540
What’s wrong?

209
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,420
When you introduce someone next time,

210
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,060
say their names first.

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,060
My cousin’s name is Cong Rong.

212
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,590
Boss,

213
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,590
do you have other questions?

214
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,060
Let’s make it clear
before it’s too late.

215
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,150
I don’t accept multiple tenants.

216
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,230
Don’t worry.

217
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,070
She just returned from abroad.

218
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,310
She’s not local

219
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,540
and doesn’t have friends here.

220
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,660
She’ll live alone.

221
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,900
And she can’t put
other people up for the night.

222
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,110
Other people?

223
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,830
Like her boyfriend?

224
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,590
Does she have one?

225
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,350
She does…

226
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,900
not have one.

227
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,540
She grew up

228
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,940
with a lot of girls around her.

229
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,470
None of her friends are boys.

230
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,300
It’s my bad luck

231
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,270
that she doesn’t have a boyfriend.

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,300
If she could have a boyfriend,

233
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,870
I’d like to offer incense
to Guanyin Buddha for three years.

234
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,990
That’s for praying for a child.

235
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,700
Is it?

236
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,270
Rong.

237
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,000
Zhong Zhen! Come to my place!

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,270
The power is off!

239
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,990
Quickly!

240
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,150
Rong.

241
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,110
It’s me.

242
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,510
Coming.

243
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,910
My dear cousin is here!

244
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,270
It’s such a bad day for me!

245
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,590
You brat.

246
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,870
It’s just been a year,

247
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,110
and you’ve got some
great dorsal muscles.

248
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,180
Rong.

249
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,780
I’m here.

250
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,820
So...

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,350
It’s me.

252
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,590
It’s fixed.

253
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,590
It’s the first surgery I did
on circuits.

254
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,940
I’m pretty good, huh?

255
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,230
Come on, you two.

256
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,390
One is my cousin,

257
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,350
and the other is my boss.

258
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,900
Don’t be so shy like this.

259
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,660
Do you

260
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,660
want something to eat?

261
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,060
I can go out to buy something.

262
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,390
The atmosphere
is even colder than Siberia.

263
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,180
Zhong Zhen didn’t tell me

264
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,080
that the apartment was yours.

265
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,660
You are pretty nice
to the landlord though.

266
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,900
You even hugged me.

267
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,020
That’s an accident.

268
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,440
I didn’t know you’d come too.

269
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,020
You always hug your cousin like that?

270
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,990
You are...

271
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,750
Although you are pretty harsh,

272
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,070
your apartment is really good.

273
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,710
And thank you

274
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,820
for coming to help.

275
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,750
As for other things,

276
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,270
don’t bother to worry about them.

277
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,350
To avoid trouble,

278
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,780
we can communicate directly
in the future.

279
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,390
Friend me on WeChat.

280
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,870
I don’t think it’s necessary.

281
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,060
It’ll be easier for you to pay rent,

282
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,440
and to call me for help.

283
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,700
You are a doctor who’s always busy.

284
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,830
I won’t bother you
with my trivial things.

285
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,790
Zhong Zhen can help me.

286
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,230
Zhong Zhen has his things to do.

287
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,820
Also,

288
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,020
you are his family

289
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
and I am his tutor.

290
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,820
It’s necessary for us to keep in touch,

291
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,750
so he can progress faster.

292
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,710
Dr. Wen,

293
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,230
you are pretty funny.

294
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,840
Why don’t you keep in touch

295
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,270
with your patients instead?

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,230
talk about Mr. Lin’s case?

299
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,750
OK.

300
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,390
The summary is not
that complicated actually.

301
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,020
I was going to send it
to you through WeChat.

302
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,350
Now that you don’t want to friend me,

303
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,420
just forget it.

My name is Cong Rong.

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,110
You can also call me Swordswoman.

Let me figure out

351
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,700
what’s up your sleeve.

352
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,350
Where’s the summary?

353
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,700
I knew it.

354
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,070
So,

355
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,460
you want to take me out
for a walk so early?

356
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,980
Put these on.

357
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,920
What on earth do you want?

358
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,220
Do you want the summary or not?

359
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,390
Not bad.

360
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,550
Let’s go.

361
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,680
Don’t tell me

362
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,870
you just want me to jog with you.

363
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,830
That’s right.

364
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,590
Is there a problem?

365
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,310
Yes!

366
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,550
I can sacrifice my sleep

367
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,150
for my work.

368
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,500
That doesn’t mean

369
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,030
you can order me around.

370
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,030
Please stop wasting
my feeling and energy.

371
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,870
Remember

372
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,230
to send me the summary.

373
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,110
Thank you.

374
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,030
Wait.

375
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,030
That’s a deal.

376
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,500
If you trip and hurt yourself,

377
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,070
that doesn’t count as
an occupational injury.

378
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,420
This guy

379
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,940
is really weird.

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,070
You are pretty good.

381
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,590
If I ran behind you,

382
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,150
it would look like
I was being walked by you.

383
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,310
I’m not your dog.

384
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,580
You’re wrong.

385
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,240
My dog

386
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,390
always runs ahead of me.

387
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,110
My legs just had their own ideas.

388
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,400
This is the right position.

389
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,460
Don’t you know

390
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,260
the position is not fixed?

391
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,310
Dr. Wen,

392
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,830
running backwards is pretty dangerous.

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,980
It seems that she didn’t change much.

394
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,460
What did you say?

395
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,260
I said, a good doctor
calls for a healthy body.

396
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,550
I’m not being a doctor.

397
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,030
What are you doing?

398
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,880
It hurts!

399
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,070
You are too slow.

400
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you want to pass your sports test?

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,510
Do you want to get rid of your nickname

402
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,740
“Little Spinning Top”?

403
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,660
Faster!

404
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,070
Does this count as a pass?

405
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,420
You want to cheat?

406
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,220
Another kilometer then.

407
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,150
Get up!

408
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,110
Come on!

409
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,670
I can’t.

410
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,420
Come on!

411
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,670
No.

412
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,500
I’m done.

413
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,460
I’m done.

414
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,180
All right.

415
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,830
Can you give me the summary now?

416
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,550
I didn’t say I’d give it to you
after the jog, did I?

417
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,900
Wen Shaoqing!

418
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,150
If you really want to do your work well,

419
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,390
come with me and try
to experience the life as a doctor.

420
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,420
How about that?

421
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,420
But...

422
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,030
I really... I...

423
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,780
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

424
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,580
Judging from the CT scan,

425
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,150
<i>Inpatient Department</i>
the patient needs a surgery ASAP.

426
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,590
Do any of you have a plan?

427
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,870
Zhong Zhen.

428
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,420
Tell us about the possible risks
of this surgery.

429
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,500
There might be a hemorrhage,

430
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,740
which would cause
an intracranial hypertension.

431
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,030
At which part?

432
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,870
The foramen magnum.

433
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,110
Copy the formation
of cerebral hernia for 50 times.

434
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,500
You are not allowed to get off work
before you finish.

435
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,460
50 times?

436
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,500
Director! Director!

437
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,900
However hard it is,

438
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,660
the surgery needs to be done.

439
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,150
Gentlemen,

440
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,590
work out a operation plan today,

441
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,830
and take every possible risk

442
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,420
into consideration.

443
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,150
I want to see it on my desk
before you get off work.

444
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,220
That’s all.

445
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,740
Shaoqing,

446
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,030
I was going to ask you just now.

447
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,790
Who…Who’s this?

448
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,110
Is she a new intern of our department?

449
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,350
General reception office.

450
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,200
Good.

451
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,220
Good.

452
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,030
You are something, Wen Shaoqing.

453
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,240
You are with a girl
from general reception office.

454
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,070
What are you playing?

455
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,220
Minesweeper?

456
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,980
I volunteered to come to experience.

457
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,400
Experience?

458
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,960
Some people say

459
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
I should know my subject well.

460
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,710
So I came.

461
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,260
Hello.

462
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,000
I’m Cong Rong.

463
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Nice to meet you.

464
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,590
Hello.

465
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,660
I’m Chen Cu.

466
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,750
Nice.

467
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,660
Cong Rong.

468
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,880
It sounds peaceful

469
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,920
and calm.

470
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,830
Nice name.

471
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,720
Come on.

472
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,790
Let’s go make the rounds.

473
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,590
50 times.

474
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,070
50 times.

475
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,540
What’s going on?

476
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,260
Why do I feel
he has a problem with me?

477
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,780
Isn’t it obvious?

478
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,420
When you are close
to general reception office,

479
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,980
you are close to trouble.

480
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,870
Of course he has a problem.

481
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,980
I loathe you for knowing nothing.

482
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,590
I’m already miserable enough,

483
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,430
and you still hit me.

484
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,310
What are you waiting for?

485
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,700
That’s enough!

486
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,150
Your despondent face

487
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,500
is going to scare the patients.

488
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Rong,

489
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,550
do you get why 30-year-old doctors

490
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,540
look like they are 50 now?

491
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,500
Why?

492
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,400
It’s all because of tutors like him

493
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,940
who like seeing people suffer.

494
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,660
If your logic is right,

495
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,590
she’s only 10-year-old?

496
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,020
Dr. Qin Chu?

497
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,070
She’s different.

498
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,900
She enjoys equal popularity
with my boss.

499
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,100
Equal popularity?

500
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,310
In our hospital,

501
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,820
their operation abilities

502
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,000
are among the top two.

503
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,550
Thank you.

504
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,590
Wen Shaoqing is the best.

505
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,790
Qin Chu is the second best.

506
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,240
Their faces are blessed

507
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,680
by the God of Youth.

508
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,830
And their hands are kissed
by the God of Surgery.

509
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,870
They are favored by the creator.

510
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,000
That classmate of ours

511
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
has become a medical representative.

512
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
And he wants to treat
all our classmates to dinner.

513
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,960
Do you want to go?

514
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,590
It’ll be a social dinner.

515
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,230
I’m not going.

I’m not sure yet.

Doctor, when is my surgery?

529
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,030
This afternoon.

530
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,310
But I don’t know the specific time.

531

How do you feel after the surgery?

536
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,900
You are recovering well.

537
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,790
But you still can’t drink tea or coffee.

538

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,720
If there’s no exceptional case,

540
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,830
you can be discharged in three days.

541
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,950
But you still need to watch
what you eat.

542
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,880
Have a good rest.

543
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,550
OK.

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,150
OK, goodbye.

545

We’ve been to so many wards,

546
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,260
but the questions are all the same.

547
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,310
Those who didn’t have a surgery

548
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,100
would ask about the surgery time.

549
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,960
And for those who had their surgeries,

550
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,660
we’d tell them the do’s and don’ts.

551
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,340
I’ll be able to recite those lines

552
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,540
in a few days.

553
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,220
You understand the difficulties
to be a doctor now?

554
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,790
The patients always have questions.

555
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
They ask questions

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,110
anytime and anywhere.

Humans are repeaters in nature.

560
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,310
But I’m special.

I have to ask you again

566
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,980
about the surgery time.

567
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,070
Be patient, please.

568
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,830
We don’t know.

569
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,750
It depends on
the operating room arrangements.

570
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,640
If the surgery can’t be arranged today,

571

that I have done
a thorough self-reflection.

And this half-day experience
made me realize

that you are really busy

648
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,030
and tired.

649
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,350
When you gave me only 1 minute,

650
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,900
there was nothing personal.

651
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,420

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,870
And now you are telling me
you didn’t write it?

665
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,030
Does my face say “lie to me” to you?

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,740
Do you think I have time
to write it in the daytime?

Why don’t you save some
for the general reception office?

Writing a letter?

671

It could mean the difference

a surgery could go
from a success to a failure.

that after you identified yourself,

701
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,550
those brats were scared off immediately.

702
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,710
That’s when I realized
our status in this hospital.

703
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,550
We are just like Voldemort.

704
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,870
They even don’t dare to talk about us.

706
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,500

707
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,740

you trying to walk into

Mediation

711
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,630
is to bring different opinions
into agreement.

712
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,550
And you

713
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,390
are the bond which links the two ends.

714
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,070
I’m that important?

715
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,460
Even more important than that.

There was a man named Cao Shang
in ancient Song State.

768
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,180
You know that?

769
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,510
Who?

770
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,220
The kings of Song and Qin
awarded many carriages to him.

771
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,070
So he came to Chuang Tzu to show off.

772
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,380
Do you know
what Chuang Tzu said to him?

773
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,510
What?

774
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,740
Chuang Tzu said,

775
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,860
“Out you go.”

776
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,340
What?

777
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,550
Get out.

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,590
Get out!

779
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,030
He told that damn story
to let me get out!

780
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,630
Nobody ever talked to me like that!

781
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,390
For the past years,
I opened the restaurant

782
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,400
without the help from my family.

783
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,110
I got where I am from scratch.

784
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,630
I just want to prove myself.

785
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,630
But now,

786
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,440
my loyal guests

787
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,590
were scared away by him.

788
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,540
Since they are loyal guests,

789
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,960
they won’t abandon you so easily.

790
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,990
Just apologize to them
and give them a discount and that’s it.

791
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,070
Is that the point?

I’m so depressed now.

796
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,920
Who told me not to be so serious,

797
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,150
to relax a little bit

798
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,320
and not to be so tired?

799
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
You don’t know

800
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,430
how he sounded and looked like.

801
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,260
Get out.

802
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,910
Could you stand that?

803
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,660
He won over you
with a smile on his face.

804
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,550
This man is something.

805
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,590
Right?

806
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,150
Right?

00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,340
He’s something, huh?

808
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,150
Are you my friend or his?

809
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,590
Why are you complimenting him?

810
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,230
Come on.

No need for that.

like he knew everything.

816
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,990
Then I did the same to him.

817
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,030
The way that I took was powerful

818
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,470
and the influence would be profound.

819
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,020

840
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,550
he gave me these shoes.

Does he want me
to run around behind him every day?

He just wants to scare me off.

How is my uncle now?

Relax.

859
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,920
Sit there and have a rest.

860

After a while,

861
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,550
when the surgery is finished,

862
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,030
we’ll inform you about it.

863
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,000
Don’t worry.

864
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,580
It’s going to be all right.

That day,

869
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,340
I finally learned another side of him.

870
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,540
On the battleground of life and death,

871
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,960
he’s like Kratos, the God of War,

872
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,960
who carries people’s trust,

873
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,660
fighting against death with his life.

behind the door

877
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,340
finally realize
the taste of long waiting.
