Sure. How badly do you wanna be injured?

166

You finally got a day off, and then you picked up a patient and returned.

176

You're becoming my colleague?

185
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,750
Are you good at using a syringe or a scalpel?

186

Go drink some tea and think about how to sell books.

484
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,559
- You really aren't planning on drinking? 
 - Correct.

485
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,349
Why are you so stubborn?

486
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,449
As if she could come here.

487
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:22,559
You'll stand there like an idiot for a few more hours, and then you'll come to me looking very gloomy and ask to drink with me.

488
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,600
It's been years.

489
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,089
Haven't you thought she might never show up?

490
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,610
You... You are really leaving?

491
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,040
Why are you crying?

492
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,390
You're my best friend!

493
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,520
I... I don't want you to leave!

494
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,330
All right. Don't cry.

495
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,419
My mom said I'd stay with my grandma for a few days.

496
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,840
I'll be back soon. At latest, it would be before school starts.

497
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,240
Really?

498
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,679
You have my word. I'll marry you once I'm back.

499
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,090
What kind of girl proposes to a boy?

500
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,960
I should be the one doing the proposal.

501
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,079
- That's fine, too. 
 - Cong Rong, time to go!

502
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,170
I'm leaving.

503
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,380
Let's go!

504
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,130
Okay.

505
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,510
See you next term! I'll be waiting for you!

506
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,480
I'll wait for you here when I'm back!

507
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,280
You left before I could tell you

508
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,010
that I was Wen Shao Qing from Class 9.

509
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,810
I'll wait for you here when I return!

510
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,610
Your clothes are wet.

511
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,180
Dr. Wen. Did I disturb you?

512
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,039
It's you.

513
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,730
I'm here to apologize.

514
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,639
I took liberties to see you. It was rude.

515
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,140
I've reflected on it.

516
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,400
I was too impulsive today.

517
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,309
I don't blame you for standing me up.

518
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,320
Anyone with a sense of responsibility would do the same.

519
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,069
Also, I'll return the ballpoint pen you left at the airport yesterday.

520
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:33,649
I want to use this opportunity to start a new beginning.

521
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,689
I'm an intern from Daren Law Firm.

522
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,720
Nice to meet you! My name is Cong Rong.

523
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,800
What did you say your name was?

524
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,520
Cong Rong!

525
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,320
You're finally here.

526
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,630
I've been waiting for you for so long.

527
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,069
At that time, I thought he hugged the wrong person.

528
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:50,579
Actually, that wasn't true.

529
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,059
He just came a long way here and reached the destination

530
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,579
one step ahead of me.

531
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,980
Reunions don't happen by chance.

532
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,220
They happen because there's always someone unwilling to let go,

533
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,960
waiting.

534
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,080
