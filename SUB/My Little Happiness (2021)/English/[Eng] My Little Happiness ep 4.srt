31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,790
In fact, only a few interns

32
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,190
can get used to the hospital's work.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,500
You’ve done well enough.

34
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,070
You are special.

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,680
Get me a blanket in the closet.

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,570
How can you sleep on the floor?

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,010
What is it?

38
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,140
<i>Mom</i>

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,240
What is it?

40
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,740
My…!

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,450
My…!

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,520
Who is it?

43
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,850
My…

44
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,410
So noisy.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,020
Mom.

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,950
What’s up?

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,180
What are you doing?

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,950
Why is there a man in your room?

49
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,580
There isn’t.

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,590
No way.

51
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,800
My eyesight is 5.2.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Even the hair on a woolen sweater,

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,860
I can see it very clearly.

54
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,950
Open the closet.

55
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,670
Hurry! Open the closet!

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,990
Who is this?

57
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,670
You saw her, Mom.

58
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,660
It’s Zhou Chengcheng.

59
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,260
Who’s calling my name?

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
Quiet.

61
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,150
Zhou Chengcheng?

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,630
Looks like she’s put on weight.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,150
And why is she hiding in the closet?

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,390
She likes hiding everywhere
when she’s drunk.

65
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,190
She’s like a cat.

66
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,360
I thought there was a thief
in your dormitory.

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,750
Good to know it’s not a man.

68
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,390
Wait.

69
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,950
This is not your dormitory.

70
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,420
Where are you now?

71
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,750
Chengcheng came to see me.

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,830
I didn’t want to trouble others.

73
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,150
So, we came to a homestay.

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,310
Mom,

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,900
why did you call me at this late hour?

76
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,680
I’m telling you,

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,830
to get ready for our life in Australia,

78
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,950
I’m learning English now.

79
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,040
You are so diligent, aren’t you?

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,510
Of course!

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
I have a question for you.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,900
What’s the difference between
past perfect and present perfect?

83
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,660
Mom,

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,740
about that…

85
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,510
I can’t make it clear in a few words.

86
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,710
I’ll get you a list later.

87
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,750
I have the list.

88
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,020
But I can’t understand.

89
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,750
I need your help.

90
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,480
In short,

91
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,830
the differences are…

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,630
Are you clear now?

93
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,860
Yes, I’m clear about this question now.

94
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,710
But I’ve got new questions.

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,070
Actually, the grammar

96
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,420
doesn’t matter that much in daily life.

97
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,150
You only need to master
some daily conversations.

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,780
You’re still a young girl.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,630
Overuse of the brain
may make you age faster.

100
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,420
Really?

101
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,470
Then I’d better let my brain rest now.

102
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,220
Good night.

103
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,020
When Shaoqing!

104
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,070
Sorry.

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,660
I almost forgot you were here.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,020
You can come out now.

107
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,710
Dr. Wen?

108
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,390
Wen Shaoqing?

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,270
An interesting medical phenomenon
occurred to me.

110
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,870
What is it?

111
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,510
Obstruction of venous reflux.

112
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,710
When the nerve is pressed
and stimulated for a long time,

113
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,830
some kind of retention occurs.

114
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,150
Which in short is?

115
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,540
Leg numbness.

116
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,520
I see.

117
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,780
So now you want me to help,

118
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,460
but you are embarrassed to ask.

119
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,410
Am I right?

120
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,700
When a tiger gets down to level ground,

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,730
he may be bullied by a dog.

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,020
When you scared me at the hospital
during the day,

123
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,320
did you anticipate that
you would need my help sometime?

124
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,370
Give me your hand.

125
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,250
Come on.

126
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,120
One, two, three.

127
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,850
Put me down!

128
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,120
I want…

129
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,120
Want what?

130
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,770
I want you to feel the same numbness!

131
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,730
You…!

132
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,120
Cousin.

133
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,050
It’s Zhong Zhen.

134
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,210
Don’t come out.

135
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,160
I don’t want to be the talk
at the hospital again.

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,780
Please.

137
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,640
Don’t come out.

138
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,920
Don’t come out!

139
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,370
The men’s clothes you asked for.

140
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,770
Thanks.

141
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,610
I’ll treat you to dinner.

142
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,180
What do you need men’s clothes for

143
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,280
in the middle of the night?

144
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,160
The less you know, the better for you.

145
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,370
I ran my legs off here.

146
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,730
At least give me some water to drink.

147
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,160
Forget it. Forget it.

148
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,370
I told you not to come out.

149
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,760
Did I agree?

150
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,890
I’m still an innocent boy.

151
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,490
Why do I always see this kind of scenes?

152
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,920
I’m going to be silenced.

153
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,090
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,400
Our relationship isn’t like that.

155
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,610
Then... What’s it like?

156
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,040
He and I can never get along well.

157
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,880
Sounds like you want us
to get along well.

158
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,880
Boss,

159
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,050
I’m just a walking corpse.

160
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,130
For what happened between you two,

161
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,330
I heard nothing, saw nothing,

162
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,760
and cared nothing.

163
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,040
After all, you are both adults.

164
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,250
I swear I’ll be tight-lipped.

165
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,120
Please spare my life.

166
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,040
Okay.

167
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,370
That simple?

168
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,730
She and her mom have a bad relationship?

169
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,450
Why does she hide her return
from her mom?

170
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,370
The relationship isn’t bad.

171
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,040
My aunt is like a sweet burden
to her daughter.

172
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,280
She doesn’t want her daughter
to return to Shenzhen,

173
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,590
or to be a lawyer in particular.

174
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,150
Why?

175
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,630
It’s a long story.

176
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,270
In short, it’s not easy for my cousin.

177
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,120
When she was in primary school…

178
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,230
She changed schools once.

179
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,300
She even told you that?

180
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,660
Are you two… really a couple?

181
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,300
Impossible.

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,840
You think I can’t like her?

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,820
Wrong.

184
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,270
She can’t like you.

185
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,750
She has her ideal type.

186
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,990
And you are totally different from that.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,150
Let me check.

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,750
“Cong Rong’s ideal type.”

189
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,870
“First. Tall and big.”

190
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,470
I’m not enough?

191
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,470
“Second. Mature, sexy

192
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,700
and scholarly.”

193
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,540
That’s me.

194
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,180
“Third. Gentle and caring.”

195
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,870
You are neither of them.

196
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,390
“Fourth. Willing to feed me
and brave to save me.”

197
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,780
Where did you get these?

198
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,780
I copied them from
her high school diary.

199
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,550
Don’t keep other people’s privacy.

200
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,440
It’s confiscated.

201
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,180
Get off.

202
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,900
Boss.

203
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,590
I haven’t arrived.

204
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
You task this week…

205
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,470
Boss,

206
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,300
goodnight.

209
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,900
I will tear you off.

210

211
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,300
I’m going to work.

212
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,380
Have a good rest

213
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,500
and don’t force yourself.

214
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,150
Drink some milk if your head aches.

215
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,990
It’s on the nightstand.

216

<i>Royal physiotherapy bed…</i>
38,000 yuan?

218
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,230
What bed is this?

219
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,660
Braggarts?

220
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,820
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

221
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,110
Will that doctor come or not?

222
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,540
Big hospitals are really good at
keeping patients waiting.

223
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,780
Mr. Lin,

224
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,630
you must have misunderstood.

225
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,550
Dr. Wen

226
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,270
must be making rounds in the wards
at this time.

227
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,900
He’ll be here soon.

228
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
Please, drink some water.

229
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,820
You’re just in time.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,750
Mr. Lin wants to talk with Dr. Wen.

231
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,870
Can you go hurry him up?

232
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,550
Okay.

233
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,390
I’ll go.

234
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,230
Mr. Lin, drink some water.

235
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,780
I’m here.

236
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,150
I happen to have something
to talk with Mr. Lin.

237
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,870
Now,

238
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,390
I have only one request.

239
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,820
Your hospital must

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,700
refund my hospitalization fee.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
Mr. Lin,

242
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
based on your previous complaint,

243
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,700
we’ve made a thorough investigation.

244
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,240
Dr. Wen didn’t have any

245
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,870
diagnostic errors
or procedural irregularities.

246
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,910
In general,

247
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,820
the hospital doesn’t need to refund.

248
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,470
You investigated yourselves?

249
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,590
How would that be fair?

250
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,940
Look how young Dr. Wen is.

251
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,990
He doesn’t look competent at all.

252
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,020
He must’ve pulled some strings.

253
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,030
Mr. Lin,

254
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,390
you’ve misunderstood our Dr. Wen.

255
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,200
Everyone here knows…

256
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,820
Cong Rong.

257
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,020
Mr. Lin.

258
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,150
Last time you were here,

259
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,060
we didn’t arrange an operation for you
in the first place,

260
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,990
firstly because the operating rooms
were too full,

261
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,270
and secondly because there was really

262
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,820
no appropriate operation method.

263
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,230
These few days,

264
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,660
I’ve consulted with
international experts

265
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,390
and worked out several plans.

266
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
Please take a look.

267
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,150
I won’t.

268
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,660
No need.

269
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,230
You think only you have plans?

270
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,020
I have too.

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,750
Look by yourself.

272
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,660
There’re foreign languages on the cover.

273
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,060
They say

274
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,300
my body

275
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,830
has nothing wrong at all.

276
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,940
I’m quite good.

277
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,150
“International royal specialized
medical organization.”

278
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,110
Mr. Lin,

279
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,440
there’s no such an organization
in the world.

280
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
Who said that?

281
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,660
Just because you don’t know it?

282
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,540
This organization is to serve Dubai’s

283
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,020
crown princes and oil tycoons.

284
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,060
Only a small number of people know it.

285
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,620
Mr. Lin,

286
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,390
calm down.

287
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,320
Sit down. Sit down.

288
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,790
Don’t be angry.

289
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,830
Drink some water.

290
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,790
I don’t need water.

291
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,820
Don’t waste my time.

292
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,420
Answer me directly.

293
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,420
Refund or not?

294
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,820
Come in.

295
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,960
Dr. Wen,

296
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,750
a family member of a patient
is anxious to see you,

297
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,630
claiming not leaving without seeing you.

298
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,390
See?

299
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,360
I told you he’s incompetent

300
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,700
and I’m not the only one.

301
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,790
Go ahead.

302
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,750
Cong Rong and I will take care of this.

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,540
Don’t worry.

304
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,230
Mr. Lin.

305
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,120
As a responsible doctor,

306
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,310
I still have to remind you.

307
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,420
Get surgery as soon as possible.

308
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,060
Your tumor may rupture at any time.

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,270
Dr. Wen!

310
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,940
Here.

311
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,240
Sir, you are leaving the hospital?

312
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,020
Yes.

313
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,670
Grandpa said that

314
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,870
we must thank you in person.

315
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,180
Am I interrupting you?

316
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,350
Of course not.

317
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,150
Sir,

318
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,350
do strictly control your blood pressure
when you go back

319
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,820
and come here for rehabilitation often.

320
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,660
Alright?

321
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,230
I heard there was a girl
at the airport that day.

322
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,150
Yeah.

323
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,590
She also helped a lot.

324
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,230
Are you a doctor?

325
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,990
Do you have any tissues?

326
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,660
Yes.

327
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,260
Here.

328
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,590
Come on.

329
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,460
Help me hold him.

330
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,830
Keep this position,

331
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,350
or vomit will block his airway.

332
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,110
Please take this silk banner.

333
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,390
Thanks a lot.

334
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,870
Thank you, sir.

335
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,590
Then we’re leaving.

336
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,310

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,230
have you got
the hospitalization fee back?

345
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,390
No.

346
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,070
I’ve tried every way.

347
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,740
They just refused.

348
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,940
But that bed,

349
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,310
you must keep it for me.

350
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,110
Try to

351
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,110
think of other ways.

352
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,430
I… I’ll put my face aside
and ask for a discount.

353
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,830
That’ll be my gift for you.

354
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,830
Pay as much money as you have.

355
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,880
Okay.

356
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
Okay. No problem.

357
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,590
Keep it for me.

358
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,220
I’ll be there this afternoon.

359
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,270
Drink some water.

360
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,150
It has anions.

361
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,980
It can make you longevous.

362
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,160
The treatment bed you want to buy

363
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,030
is also anion bed, isn’t it?

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
How did you know I wanted to buy a bed?

365
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,790
I read that royal report, which says

366
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,700
the treatment plan is to buy a bed.

367
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,660
That bed

368
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,310
is so good.

369
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,180
When I was lying on it,

370
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,390
I was feeling warm.

371
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,790
It can cure all diseases.

372
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,630
Yes!

373
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,790
But 38,000 yuan

374
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,150
isn’t a little money, is it?

375
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,630
You don’t understand.

376
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,830
Be stingy with little money

377
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,470
and be generous

378
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,900
with great money.

379
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,870
I understand.

380
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,180
I can pay ten thousand yuan
without hesitation when buying a bag.

381
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,030
But when I order a takeout,

382
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,350
even five yuan for delivery
would make me hesitate for long.

383
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,310
Your attitude is much better

384
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,990
than Dr. Wen’s.

385
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,150
Fully agree.

386
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,830
Mr. Lin,

387
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,900
I saw many people saying online that

388
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,150
Xihuantong is a cheating company.

389
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,310
How could you say that?

390
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,590
Cheaters have their own tricks.

391
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,790
They told you they could cure
all your diseases

392
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,900
only to let you pay.

393
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,350
That’s true.

394
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,790
Think it over, will you?

395
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,700
You are just cheaters!

396
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,700
I was in hospital once,

397
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,460
and now you want me in again.

398
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,640
I’m well,

399
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,070
but you claimed that I had a tumor.

400
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,630
Aren’t you cheating me for my money?

401
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,790
No. We’re concerned about you.

402
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,680
Concerned?

403
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,260
Then personally give me my money back.

404
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,390
After I buy that bed,

405
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,980
we can discuss about
me being in hospital.

406
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,220
Your logic is really unusual.

407
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,270
How about this?

408
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,940
Give me your family’s number.

409
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,030
I’ll call your family

410
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,260
to accompany you to buy it.

411
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,670
The one selling the bed

412
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,980
is my son.

413
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,110
He accompanies me to the park

414
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,030
and brings me breakfast.

415
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
Even if he cheats me,

416
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,870
I won’t regret.

417
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,830
I’m determined

418
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,220
to buy the bed!

419
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,150
I don’t want to face the day!

420
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,260
If there are really few customers,

421
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,180
how embarrassed I will be!

422
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,150
Don’t worry.

423
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,420
It will be okay.

424
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,420
Everything will be okay.

425
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,350
God bless it will be busy as usual.

426
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,900
Crowded!

427
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,440
Be careful.

428
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,350
Don’t break anything.

429
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,950
Stop, stop, stop!

430
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,260
What are you doing?

431
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,160
I was only absent for half a day.

432
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,220
How did it come to this?

433
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,440
Who told you to do this?

434
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,660
A man told us to,

435
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,180
saying this place is closed.

436
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,460
Closed?

437
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,030
Why didn’t I know that?

438
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,870
Who told you that?

439
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
A vice-president

440
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,940
surnamed Lu.

441
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,550
You can call him and ask.

442
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,550
Sorry,

443
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,740
the number you dialed is powered off.

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,700
Sorry…

445
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,110
Kaide Hotel?

446
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,380
<i>Your credit card’s sub-card has
generated a purchase at Kaide Hotel</i>

447
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,660
<i>A Castle in the Clouds</i>

448
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,790
Excuse me.

449
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,550
Mr.…?

450
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,240
Mr. Wen.

451
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,310
Wen Rang.

452
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:41,790
Nice to meet you.

453
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,500
Okay, okay.

454
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,420
Sit down, sit down.

455
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,460
What are you doing?

456
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,070
You are my boyfriend!

457
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,830
How can you do this to me?

458
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,720
How did you find this place?

459
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,900
I didn’t want to be this smart.

460
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,680
But next time when you disappear,

461
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,900
don’t use my card to pay, okay?

462
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,830
Who is she?

463
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Haven’t you recognized her yet?

464
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,500
She’s my canteen’s…

465
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,190
Yeah, it’s me.

466
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:08,870
The reception girl.

467
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,980
Let me do it.

468
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,540
You two have gone too far!

469
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,740
You’ve been sneaking around
under my nose!

470
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,150
Sneaking around?

471
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,700
We’re aboveboard.

472
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,220
Exactly.

473
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,110
The reason you can’t see us is simple.

474
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,340
Because you can only

475
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,310
see yourself.

476
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,180
Alright.

477
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,660
I gotta go.

478
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,150
Go ahead.

479
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,920
Sorry to

480
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,630
keep you waiting.

481
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,590
It’s okay.

482
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,550
I’m the editor of the publisher
who made an appointment with you.

483
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,980
Time is limited.

484
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,350
Let’s go directly to
your book about garret.

485
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,980
Castle.

486
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,870
Both are fine.

487
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,840
On the whole,

488
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,490
this collection of poems

489
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,250
lacks propagation power.

490
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,360
“I travel through half a century,
waiting for wind.”

491
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,630
What’s the meaning?

492
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,980
Nothingness.

493
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,830
What people spend their entire lives

494
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,390
waiting for may be an illusion.

495
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,880
The meaning doesn’t matter.

496
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,700
The meaning doesn’t matter.

497
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,110
What matters is that

498
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,550
compared with “I travel through
the whole world to sleep with you.”,

499
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,790
it’s nothing exciting.

500
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,350
But being exciting is not an
essential element of serious literature.

501
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,790
Then you were born in a wrong age.

502
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,900
Serious literature was a little popular
two decades ago.

503
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,110
People nowadays

504
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,790
don’t need serious literature.

505
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,590
What they need are symbols.

506
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,630
They want to be catered to.

507
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,540
How to cater to them?

508
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,180
That’s what I want to focus on
with you today.

509
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,310
Don’t you think… there’s nothing

510
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,980
pleasing on you?

511
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,710
You are always bossy and arrogant.

512
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,550
Who do you think you are?

513
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,740
No wonder.

514
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,220
You always feel good about yourself.

515
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,900
After all,

516
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,740
you’re silly.

517
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,240
Then you don’t have to
say such harsh words

518
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,420
to sneer at me, do you?

519
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,550
At least I’ve been nice to you.

520
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,420
Even if I were really that bad,

521
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,990
you still pestered me
to be your girlfriend, didn’t you?

522
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,470
That’s because you have a rich dad!

523
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,640
Now the relationship
between you two is broken.

524
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,980
No one would tolerate you anymore.

525
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,870
Without your dad,

526
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,310
you

527
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,870
are a totally loser.

528
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,070
After being polished, these poems

529
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,740
are really not bad.

530
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,790
If I wanted to sell my books like this,

531
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,030
I could’ve done that ten years ago.

532
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,220
No need to wait till today.

533
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,900
Nice to meet you.

534
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,830
I won’t give you any money
from selling those tables and chairs.

535
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,350
I won’t ask for break-up fees.

536
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,630
Fine.

537
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,480
I get it. I get it.

538
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,950
Just a minute.

539
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,110
I’m just done here.

540
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,350
I’ll be right there.

541
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,350
Bro!

542
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,400
There… There is a button there.

543
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,480
Help me push it.

544
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,180
Well… The door got stuck somehow.

545
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,340
Got stuck?

546
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,150
Yeah.

547
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,110
Who pushed the button?

548
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,030
I also wonder.

549
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,220
Help me with it.

550
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,070
I remember.

551
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,420
I pushed it.

552
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,950
Who are you?

553
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,790
Come back!

554
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,220
Oh my!

555
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,460
I…!

556
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,110
Where is your
overbearing manner last night?

557
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,400
Can you block me for a while?

558
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,740
I don’t want others to see me like this.

559
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,900
I’m done crying.

560
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,590
Feeling much better.

561
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,180
You had a good cry.

562
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,350
So what?

563
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,550
They all say that
girls are made of water.

564
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,420
You are made of a reservoir.

565
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,180
I warn you.

566
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,870
About what happened just now,

567
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,980
you mustn’t pity me.

568
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,700
I accept no one’s sympathy.

569
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,220
You think too much.

570
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,260
People all have their own misery

571
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,700
and aren’t qualified
to sympathize each other.

572
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,390
You talk like an elder.

573
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,500
My coat!

574
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,830
That’s my coat.

575
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,830
What happened to your arm?

576
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,590
Got bitten by a dog?

577
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,420
Yeah.

578
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,550
By a dog.

579
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,460
<i>Administrative Building</i>

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,830
“Willing to feed me.”

581
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,060
<i>Cong Rong’s Ideal Type
He’s willing to feed me and brave...</i>

582
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,260
What’s the big deal about being fed?

583
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,790
Shallow.

584
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,310
Open your mouth.

585
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,980
That won’t do.

586
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,180
I’m not feeding a dog.

587
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,350
Yummy!

588
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,460
Once more.

589
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,790
Are all married men as greasy as you?

590
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,150
I’m being sexy.

591
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,260
Whose is it?

592
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,630
Not yours.

593
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,960
No one’s eating it.

594
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,940
I’ll finish it.

595
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,070
I heard that

596
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,880
there’s been a lot of talk about

597
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,220
you and that girl in the general office.

598
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,460
I’ve told them that I like her,

599
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,830
but no one believed.

600
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,790
Look, you’re acting like a rogue.

601
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,630
Don’t sully her reputation.

602
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,630
Okay?

603
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,030
Wait, man.

604
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,240
Do you love me secretly

605
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,550
and use that girl as a guise?

606
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,740
Come on, baby.

607
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,900
Eat more.

608
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,900
It’s good for your brain.

609
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,740
What are you talking about

610
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,460
that makes you so happy?

611
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,030
Chen Cu said

612
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,260
it’s his treat.

613
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,940
When did I say that?

614
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,390
Wen Shaoqing!

615
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,070
Qin Chu.

616
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,740
Don’t you think

617
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,990
Wen Shaoqing has been
acting strange lately?

618
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,700
Has he?

619
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,030
Yeah.

623
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,900
Where’s your cousin?

624
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,420
My cousin…

625
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,740
You’re asking me?

626
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,870
I’m just a poor outsider.

627
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,590
Go back to work.

Dr. Wen.

631
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,260
What’s up?

632
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,350
Someone wanted to give Cong Rong
a silk banner.

633
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,740
I took it for her.

634
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,150
Where is she?

635
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,790
She asked me for leave,

636
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,700
saying it was urgent.

637
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,150
Then she left in a hurry.

638
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,500
Her laptop is still on.

Xihuantong?

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,590
I suspect he has other motives
for asking for the refund.

642
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,030
That company doesn’t seem to be

00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,480
I have it on me.

687
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,070
Find it.

688
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,950
Good. Okay.

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,150
What’s on this?

693
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,910
It’s all black.

<i>WeChat Pay</i>

695
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,510
I don’t know

696
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,110
what this thing is.

697
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,910
It’s broken.

698
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,190
There’s no electricity.

699
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,030
How can we pay?

700
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,320
Hello, everyone.

701
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,700
I am a lawyer.

702
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,110
I found the record of
this health product company

703
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,580
through the public information of
the Bureau of Industry and Commerce.

704
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,190
This is a fraud company

705
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,550
that has changed its name many times
for the purpose of defrauding pension.

706
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,630
Please don’t give them any money.

707
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,820
How could this be?

708
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,030
What’s going on?

709
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,550
Maintain order.

710
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,880
Maintain order.

711
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,550
Follow me.

712
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,950
Maintain order.

713
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,670
Last year,

714
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,800
after the company was shut down,

715
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,590
it changed its name to Xihuantong.

716
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,840
-Their 38,000 royal physiotherapy bed
-Please calm down.

717
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,230
-costs less than 1,000 yuan
-I’ll explain more about that.

718
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,410
and is produced in a small workshop

719
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,800
-with no qualifications at all.
-I’ll give you a satisfactory answer.

720
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,510
Besides, the massage pad
and footbath bucket

721
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,190
are unbranded and dateless products
by nameless factories.

722
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,260
Turn off the speaker!

723
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,990
Are they really swindlers?

724

We won’t buy it!

731
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,260
It’s you.

732
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,830
We’ve met before.

733
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,480
Come!

734
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,150
Come here!

735
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,740
Get in!

736
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,070
You think you’re lucky enough

737
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,710
to mess with my business

738
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,430
and then still escape?

739
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,110
According to the Law on Penalties
for Administration of Public Security,

740
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,960
a person who beats up another person,

741
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,790
or intentionally hurts
the body of another person

742
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,070
shall be detained for not less than
five days but not more than ten days.

743
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,190
If the circumstances are serious

744
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,280
and the crime of intentional injury
is constituted, he may be sentenced.

745
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,000
What did you say?

746
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,710
I didn’t hear you.

747
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,220
I said I had called the police.

748
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,800
Then you’d better hurry up!

749
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,950
Or it will be too late!

750
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,710
A tough guy?

751
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,110
Aren’t you ashamed
of using force to a girl?

752
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,070
I’m a doctor.

753
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,740
I know where makes you suffer the most.

754
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:04,220
<i>Police</i>

755
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,550
They’ve all been arrested.

756
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,230
Mr. Lin.

757
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,070
You’ll get your money back.

758
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,190
If you feel any discomfort

759
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,000
or feel dizzy and want to vomit,

760
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
please let me know at once.

761
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,340
Okay?

762
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,510
Dr. Wen.

763
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,510
I’ve bought alcohol pads

764
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,550
and ointment.

765
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,920
Don’t let your wound get infected.

766
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,180
Let me take care of it for you.

767
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,190
Why did you come here alone

768
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,510
without telling me?

769
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,510
Your time is precious.

770
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,400
I didn’t want to trouble you.

771
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,510
You troubled me at last, didn’t you?

772
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,990
What if I didn’t find you?

773
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,920
What if the police were late?

774
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,660
What if you got hurt?

775
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,190
I was being unthoughtful…

776
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,340
Much worse than that.

777
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,150
You were being reckless!

778
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,630
Have I ever told you

779
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,780
not to put yourself in danger

780
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,910
and not to cross the line
and interfere with the patient’s life?

781
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,590
You have.

782
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,100
Then why did you follow here?

783
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,220
I couldn’t stand by.

784
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,150
Knowing that there was a trap

785
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,590
and people were falling into it,

786
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,550
if it were you,

787
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,700
would you have stood by?

788
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,180
Cong Rong,

789
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,780
what is your job?

790
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,960
Conciliation.

791
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,430
You haven’t forgotten.

792
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,550
You work for the hospital.

793
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,700
Your work should be within
Yun Ji Hospital.

794
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,070
Outside the hospital,

795
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,710
people all have troubles.

796
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,760
Are you able to help them all?

797
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,950
I’m not.

798
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,750
But you’re just the same.

799
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,300
Pot calling the kettle black.

800
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,590
What about me?

801
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,670
You also crossed the line
and interfered with my life.

802
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,630
And you put yourself in danger.

803
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,760
I’m the one who’s being well now.

804
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,960
It’s you who got hurt.

805
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,910
You told me to stay within the hospital

806
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,340
but you came outside to save me.

807
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,360
By your standards,

808
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,860
you were minding other’s business.

809
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,110
I was minding your business.

810
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,550
Not others’.

811
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,220
What’s it to you that I was in danger?

812
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,860
Who am I to you?

813
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,760
You came all the way here

814
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,550
only to scold me.

815
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,620
<i>A Castle in the Clouds</i>

816
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,030
Time is limited.

817
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,000
Let’s go directly to
your book about garret.

818
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,110
On the whole,

819
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,630
this collection of poems
lacks propagation power.

820
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,030
People nowadays…
What they need are symbols.

821
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,910
They want to be catered to.

822
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,430
Our publisher has
a complete set of templates

823
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,470
which I guarantee can package
a writer like you

824
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,230
well

825
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,630
and put you to the market.

826
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,550
We want to turn you
into desireless type.

827
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,110
You will have longer hair.

828
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,220
You will dress more antiquely.

829
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,800
We will go somewhere
with a nice natural view

830
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,550
and take your pictures.

831
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,440
You will attend some lectures

832
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,630
and become more popular.

833
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,740
When did you sit there?

834
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,950
It’s been a while.

835
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,310
I didn’t follow you.

836
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,000
I was out to relax

837
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,380
and happened to run into you.

838
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,660
Though you were a gentleman to me
during the day,

839
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,470
I’m not interested in you.

840
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,590
Glad to hear that.

841
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,740
Me either.

842
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,630
Anyway,

843
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,070
I remember now.

844
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,590
The “clock” on your arm was left by me.

845
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,500
Far more than that.

846
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,800
You also broke my door

847
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,030
and dirtied my bed.

848
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,510
You bear grudges easily.

849
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,280
I accidentally tore it that night.

850
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,170
Have a good count.

851
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,380
Forget it.

852
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,430
I broke up anyway.

853
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,270
A Castle in the Clouds.

854
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,070
That’s a good name.

855
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,030
Next time when you encounter
this kind of situation,

856
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,070
call the police first.

857
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,550
Wait until the police arrive.

858
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,790
I get it.

859
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,220
Yeah.

860
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,540
<i>Police</i>

861
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,300
My wound hurts.

862
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,220
Help me with it.

863
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,400
I don’t want to cross the line.

864
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,590
Do it by yourself.

865
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,670
Fine, stop.

866
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,340
I’ll do it.

867
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,070
Does it hurt?

868
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,030
No.

869
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,400
Then why did you make that sound?

870
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,340
To see if you care about me.

871
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,510
What’s the truth
of people’s relationships?

872
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,910
We keep building boundaries,

873
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,150
but we can’t help testing
and demolishing them.

874
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,110
The one taking the initiative

875
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,990
strikes a match in the air,

876
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,860
hoping that the faint light

877
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,910
would help see the other one’s heart.

878
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,990
Mr. Lin!

879
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,780
What’s wrong with you?

880
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,430
Wake up. Wake up!
