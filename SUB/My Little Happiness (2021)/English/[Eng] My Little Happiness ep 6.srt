<i>Episode 6</i>

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,710
Why are you here?

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,950
Rong, don’t be scared. It’s me.

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
So you’re the one

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,080
who bought me sandwiches and coffee,

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,840
and called a taxi for me earlier today?

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,550
Right.

37
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,230
So you’re my new next door neighbor.

38
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,990
Yes.

39
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,230
But why did you move here?

40
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,670
Because it’s close.

41
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,060
Close to where?

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,020
The hospital.

43
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,510
The hospital?

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,950
How could that be the hospital?

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,070
He’s here because it’s close to you.

46
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,620
Don’t talk too much.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,750
This is a chance.

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,360
You must grab it.

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,150
Be serious.

50
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,560
Okay.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,230
Don’t eat too much.

52
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,360
I’ll be serious.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,060
I’ll be serious.

54
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,950
I’ll deal with it.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,470
Say no more.

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,080
Okay. Okay. Okay.

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,800
I know. I know.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,390
I know.

59
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,270
Thank you.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,750
So, this is why you shocked her?

61
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,620
Shock?

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,550
This is the housewarming gift
I prepared.

63
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,360
If it’s a gift,

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,700
just give it to me directly.

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,580
Why do you have to act like a stalker?

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,620
That memo.

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,430
That sign.

68
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,400
What does it mean?

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,550
It’s the molecular formula of dopamine.

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,620
Dopamine

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,710
is a neurotransmitter.

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,150
When a human brain emits dopamine,

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,830
it means that he’s happy and excited.

74
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,390
I’m saying that

75
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,710
I’m glad to be your neighbor.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,310
Next time please just say it.

77
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,580
Don’t beat around the bushes.

78
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,950
This soup is so delicious.

79
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,150
Dr. Wen.

80
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,900
You’re such an amazing cook.

81
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,870
Do you aspire to be an ideal
stay-at-home boyfriend?

82
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,950
Well.

83
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,150
It’s acceptable.

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,870
Acceptable?

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,990
What’s your zodiac sign?

86
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,020
Why are you so romantic?

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,020
Pisces?

88
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,630
Scorpio.

89
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,540
Scorpio.

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,460
Cherish your life and stay away from...

91
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,630
No, no, no!

92
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,920
Scorpios are fine.

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,630
They’re stately and thoughtful.

94
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,870
What’s your ascendant sign?

95
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you a census enumerator?

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,870
I’m just asking.

97
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,360
Do your parents urge you to get married?

98
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
What’s your type like?

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Let’s go home.

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,190
Go home.

101
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,000
I don’t want to.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,120
I haven’t finished it yet.

103
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
You’ve not only finished.

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,560
You’re pretty full too.

105
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,870
I packed this for you.

106
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,680
Take it.

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,040
I don’t need this.

108
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,630
You...

109
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,480
Thank you.

110
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,270
Thanks a lot, Dr. Wen.

111
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,110
You really beat me.

112
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,270
You ate and then you took it home.

113
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,430
Dr. Wen

114
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,220
acted a bit like a straight science guy.

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,580
But he’s quite crafty.

116
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,310
It’s not bad.

117
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,950
Though he expresses himself oddly,

118
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,350
it’s clear that

119
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,190
you’re important to him.

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,660
Come on!

121
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,750
Seriously.

122
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,100
What do you think of him?

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,190
He’s a good doctor.

124
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,510
He’s also a good man.

125
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,710
Is it possible that...?

126
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,660
What?

127
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,020
Are you having a cramp in your hands?

128
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,100
Don’t play stupid.
Is it possible that you get together?

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,260
Sure enough.

130
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,780
Gifts blind the eyes.

131
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,260
I’m serious.

132
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,870
He talked about dopamine,

133
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,670
and how happy he is to be your neighbor.

134
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,870
I think he’s confessing his love to you.

135
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,390
The scent of romance.

136
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,060
Give me a break.

137
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,190
We only just met.

138
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,100
How could he possibly love me?

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,660
I don’t believe you.

140
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,860
Let’s go through everything together.

141
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,980
What happened between you?

142
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,910
Make way.

143
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,630
Don’t move.

144
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,790
I’m the intern sent from Daren Law Firm.

145
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,720
I hope to get along well with you.

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,580
My name is Cong Rong.

147
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,660
You’re finally here.

148
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,550
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

149
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,000
If you fall down later,

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,270
I won’t take it as work-related injury.

151
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
We are childhood sweethearts.

152
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,500
I’ve been loving her for decades.

153
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,390
Unfortunately,

154
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,780
my love was not reciprocated.

155
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,120
I’m minding your business.

156
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,770
It’s my business too.

157
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,870
I want to see if you’ll care for me.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,190
Gosh.

159
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,190
Do you really believe that

160
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,660
these are just coincidences?

161
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,750
You’ve just met.

162
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,710
And how many times you’ve hugged?

163
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,720
One, two, three, four.

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,830
Four times.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,310
I’ve been in so many relationships.

166
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,070
I’ve never hugged so many times
in one relationship.

167
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,870
Hearing you say that...

168
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,540
Maybe... Possibly...

169
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,110
Maybe, there’s one percent probability.

170
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,460
One percent?

171
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,070
This is so obvious.

172
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,680
You’re the only one still doubting it.

173
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,710
Is this obvious?

174
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,710
Of course, it is.

175
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,510
Wait.

176
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,750
If a man loves a woman,

177
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,710
isn’t a confession the most direct way?

178
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,100
Why does he have to beat around
the bushes and make me guess?

179
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,060
If he tells you directly,

180
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,270
how will you react?

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,980
I’ll probably say no.

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,460
That’s it then.

183
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,680
He’s so confident and smart.

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,540
He won’t do something that
he’s not 100 percent sure about.

185
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,660
I’ve figured out the rest of
the story for you.

186
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,900
What is it?

187
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,080
You’ll accidentally meet
on your way to work.

188
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,630
And he’ll give you the breakfast
he prepared for you with love.

189
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,110
When you’re at the hospital,

190
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,900
he will use work as excuses
to get close to you.

191
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,110
And he’ll try to make you
his responsibility.

192
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,720
And then you...

193
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,270
Stop!

194
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,150
Stop your Mary Sue fantasies.

195
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,480
I’ve been selling my used items all day.

196
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,780
I’m so tired.

197
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,110
I’ll sleep first.

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,750
Milk and bread are on the desk.

199
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,720
Oatmeal is in the cupboard.

200
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,940
Look for it yourself.

201
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,720
Good morning.

202
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,820
Which cupboard?

203
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,320
Go to work with Dr. Wen.

204
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,060
Don’t mind me.

205
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,180
Good morning.

206
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,060
Do you want breakfast?

207
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,870
I’ve figured out the rest of the story
for you.

208
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,650
You’ll accidentally meet
on your way to work.

209
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,480
And he’ll give you the breakfast he
prepared for you with love.

210
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,870
Is it good?

211
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,150
It’s hot.

212
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,660
The taste…

213
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,540
How is it?

214
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,140
It’s not as good as the 5-yuan pancakes
sold by the uncle at the gate.

215
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,510
You should learn from him.

216
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,030
Dr. Wen,

217
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,300
aren’t you driving today?

218
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,420
What a coincidence!

219
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,150
I’m taking the bus to work today too.

220
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,200
Great.

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,920
Let’s go together.

222
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,320
I’m sorry.

223
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,410
It’s too crowded.

224
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,650
You just had breakfast.

225
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,440
Standing up is good for digestion.

226
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,570
Dr. Wen.

227
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,930
You’d better drive next time.

228
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,650
The bus is not suitable for you.

229
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,330
There’s nothing I can hold here.

230
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,490
Go somewhere else.

231
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,080
Fine.

232
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,920
I’m sorry.

233
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,770
It’s fine.

234
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,280
We still have time.

235
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,440
Let’s go get a cup of coffee.

236
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,570
Sorry.

237
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,080
I’m busy today.

238
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,290
Bye.

239
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:34,740
<i>Administrative Building</i>

240
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,770
Are you looking for trouble?

241
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,650
What?

242
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,170
Did I hurt you?

243
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,010
I’m sorry.

244
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,320
What do you want me for?

245
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,530
Cousin.

246
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,960
You should be proud of me.

247
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,600
I was selected!

248
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,260
<i>Outpatient</i>

249
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,900
<i>Outpatient</i>
This year’s competition will revolve

250
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,500
<i>Medical Knowledge Contest</i>
around basic knowledge evaluation,

251
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,900
<i>Contest content</i>
nursing, hospital infection control,

252
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,210
rescue, medical safety control,
and doctor-patient relationship.

253
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,680
You okay with so many aspects?

254
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,330
Why not?

255
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,640
We have Dr. Chen and Dr. Qin this year.

256
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,500
And we have Boss
to increase our average score.

257
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,810
As long as I don’t mess up,

258
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,650
the championship is surely ours.

259
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,440
Where did you find the courage
to join this team?

260
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,920
Did you get in by pulling the strings?

261
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,410
Pulling the strings?

262
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,610
That’s too nasty.

263
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,010
I got in with my own effort.

264
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,010
Our Boss said that

265
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,720
I need to be put to the test.

266
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,680
So I can stand up before big challenges.

267
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,890
My Boss also said that...

268
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,620
Why are you always talking about him?

269
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,530
Why do you admire him so much?

270
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,010
Haven’t I told you?

271
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,650
When I was in university,

272
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,770
I didn’t know Boss.

273
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,890
One day, there was
a patient’s family member.

274
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,050
He was in such a hurry.

275
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,250
He ran to the operation room.

276
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,410
Since we wore white robes, he grabbed
on to us asking questions nonstop.

277
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,010
I didn’t know anything.

278
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,320
I was so scared.

279
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,850
At the time, Boss had just finished
an operation that lasted over ten hours,

280
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,490
and didn’t get the time to change.

281
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,530
There was blood on his clothes.

282
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,960
That day

283
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,770
he explained the patient’s conditions

284
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,370
to the family devotedly and patiently.

285
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,200
I think he’s so incredible.

286
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,320
Later, he opened lectures.

287
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,920
He talked about being a good doctor.

288
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,600
And he said that to be a good doctor,

289
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,720
one must learn to be a decent man first.

290
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,800
"You have to live up to your conscience,

291
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
and must not disappoint your patients."

292
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,250
He also said,

293
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,560
if there’s a cause,

294
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,020
a thousand foe won’t bend my will.

295
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,250
If there’s a cause...

296
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,020
My will...

297
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,960
A thousand foe won’t bend my will.

298
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,490
Cousin.

299
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,440
Before that,

300
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,410
I had never felt that

301
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,200
studying medicine is such
an important cause for me.

302
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,090
On that day,

303
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,770
I was suddenly inspired by him.

304
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,130
I want to be a good doctor

305
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,050
like him.

306
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,770
Cousin.

307
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,170
Why are you so interested in Boss?

308
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,490
I’m not interested in him.

309
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,740
If I had known how much you would talk,

310
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,600
I wouldn’t have asked you.

311
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,650
You blame me for telling everything?

312
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,840
This knowledge contest.

313
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,440
Take Qin Chu, Chen Cu

314
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,200
and the intern

315
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,810
to attend it.

316
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,250
Our chance of winning will be high.

317
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,200
Fine.

318
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,890
Director Yan.

319
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,010
I have a question about
doctor-patient dispute

320
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,170
that I’d like to ask you.

321
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,890
Okay.

322
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,320
Just in time.

323
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,650
What do you want for me, director?

324
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,730
Do you know

325
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,600
the knowledge contest?

326
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,320
Dr. Wen

327
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,650
is here to ask us a question about

328
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,010
doctor-patient dispute.

329
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,920
You’re a specialist in this area.

330
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,170
So I’ll hand it over to you.

331
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,260
I have a few cases at hand.

332
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,370
I’ll take care of those first.

333
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,050
What took you so long?

334
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,080
I’ve been waiting for you.

335
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,680
Are you really going to
attend the contest?

336
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,410
You’d better not.

337
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,800
Your job is busy.

338
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,890
Even I feel tired for you.

339
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,720
Are you worried about me?

340
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,090
I’ve thought it through.

341
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,370
Our lecture can be arranged

342
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,220
at any time after work.

343
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,080
You can pick the location.

344
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,520
We live close to each other anyway.

345
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
So from tonight on,

346
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,130
you are my teacher.

347
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,810
When you’re at the hospital,

348
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,490
he will use work as excuses
to get close to you.

349
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,920
How about the others?

350
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,490
I have to decline private lectures.

351
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,560
Plus,

352
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,560
depriving me of my time off work
is not acceptable.

353
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,020
Anyway, my work time is

354
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,490
fully occupied by operations.

355
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,290
You can arrange the rest of the time.

356
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,440
So you will still take up my off time.

Did you have any progress today?

360
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,300
Maybe.

361
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,100
Or maybe not.

362
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,920
What?

363
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,900
Speak louder.

364
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,990
He asked me doctor-patient disputes.

365
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,980
Well.

366
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,980
Is this work content?

367
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,920
Say that again.

368
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,940
I didn’t hear you clearly.

369
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,910
Why is your place so noisy?

370

Don’t mind it.

371
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,910
I’m at the renovation site.

Tell me the progress.

373

I’m so anxious to know.

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,270
Forget it.

375

Let’s talk later.

376
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,270

Does he have anyone he likes?

You’re not his type.

Yes, he has.

So does he have one he loves or not?

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,530
You’d better do a CT scan

515
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,450
at the hospital, just in case.

516
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,800
I’m still worried.

517
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,880
I’m a doctor.

518
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,800
You have to listen to me now.

519
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,580
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

520
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,400
Hello, Dr. Qin.

521
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,250
Hello.

522
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,730
Hello, Dr. Qin.

<i>Who’s at the hospital tonight?</i>

524
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,860
<i>Wen Shaoqing</i>

525
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,160
Hello.

526
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,340
I’m on duty tonight.

527
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,210
What?

528
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,800
Zhang.

529
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,170
Help me queue up.

530
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,800
Dr. Qin, why are you here?

531
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,800
Thanks.

532
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,000
I’m sorry to bother you this late.

533
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,730
It’s fine.

534
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,050
Is your patient all right?

535
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,770
She’s fine.

536
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,580
But she needs an inspection,

537
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,530
just in case.

538
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,160
Sure.

539
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,720
Who was hurt?

540
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,690
Your family member?

541
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:22,970
It’s all taken care of.

542
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,120
Let’s go.

543
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,730
Is your head really okay?

544
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,970
Does it still hurt?

545
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,930
If it hurts, you have to let me know.

546
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,160
It seems all right.

547
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,010
Yes.

548
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,160
What a coincidence.

549
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,290
How did you meet each other?

550
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,800
I live next to her.

551
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,770
You moved?

552
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,090
When did this happen?

553
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,640
Not long ago.

554
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,600
She needs to be supervised.

555
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,530
Why hadn’t you invited us to
your housewarming party?

556
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,840
The more people, the merrier.

557
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,210
Let’s talk about this later.

558
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,540
<i>CT Examination Room</i>

559
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,880
How’s the result?

560
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,690
Do you want to eat something?

561
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,290
Is it really so serious?

562
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,160
The hindbrain connects skull
and cervical vertebra.

563
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,880
Compared with the rest of
the skull and brain,

564
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,210
the size of hindbrain is rather small.

565
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,490
If it’s hurt and bleeds,

566
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,410
it’s likely to suppress the brainstem.

567
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,360
Wait a minute.

568
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,080
I don’t understand.

569
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,530
What do you mean?

570
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,490
You have to be supervised for a night.

571
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,050
So, you have to sleep

572
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,800
under my supervision at my place tonight.

573
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,300
Supervision for a night.

574
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,410
Don’t I have to be hospitalized?

575
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,530
Why do I have to stay in your house?

576
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,410
You know well about

577
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,490
the shortage of hospital beds.

578
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,370
If you stay at my place,

579
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,530
I can send you to the hospital at once

580
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,000
if you have any discomfort.

581
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,930
If I feel ill,

582
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,100
I can go to the hospital myself.

583
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,170
I don’t need to sleep at your place.

584
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,780
When a person realizes he’s ill,

585
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,930
it’s often too late.

586
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,120
I’m the expert.

587
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,850
I can give you emergency treatment.

588
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,320
Can you do emergency treatment yourself?

589
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,450
Also,

590
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,320
Rangyirang is the culprit.

591
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,800
I need to be responsible to you.

592
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,800
And he’ll try to make you
his responsibility.

593
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,770
I can invite Zhong Zheng to my house.

594
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,160
I’ll be just fine if he watches over me.

595
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,080
Fine.

596
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,970
When you ask him to come over,

597
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,970
ask him to bring his textbooks.

598
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,610
I can highlight key points for him

599
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,080
in case he panics

600
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,160
and can’t find the information he needs

601
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,800
when he goes through

602
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,080
his thick medical books.

603
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,170
I’ve thought it over.

604
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,800
I don’t like staying
at a stranger’s house.

605
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,170
I can go to your house then.

606
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:01,930
What I mean is that

607
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,120
we’d better not stay at
each other’s place.

608
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,650
I don’t care.

609
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,580
I want to go home.

610
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,850
Don’t follow me.

611
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,360
I’ll take care of myself.

612
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,460
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

613
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,010
I’m sorry.

614
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,730
The renovation

615
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,970
must have caused you some disturbance.

616
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,360
This is my compensation.

617
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,620
I’m sorry.

618
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,840
The renovation will be over soon.

619
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,050
One cup for me.

620
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,450
How dare you drink liquor again?

621
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,840
Drink this.

622
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,930
I didn’t expect that

623
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,250
one day we’ll be drinking together.

624
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,930
I thought that you’ll be
forever distant and reserved.

625
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,880
When was I distant?

626
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,800
You never finish your words.

627
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,250
Or you say something I can’t understand.

628
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,320
Let me ask you.

629
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,080
Do you always speak in
such a refined manner?

630
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,880
Are you always so casual?

631
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,360
So what?

632
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,730
Do I have to be crying
all day and night?

633
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,800
Nobody cares about me if I cry.

634
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,690
Don’t your parents care about you?

635
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,000
If you ask them

636
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,050
when golden dragon seal was made,

637
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,600
they can give you a perfect answer.

638
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,960
But if you ask them which grade
their daughter is in,

639
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,080
they have no idea.

640
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,730
They threw me in the boarding school

641
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,370
and flew around the world
with Jun porcelain.

642
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,320
I don’t get to see them often.

643
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,880
I’m used to it.

644
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,820
You said you’re used to it.

645
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,050
But I think you quite take it to heart.

646
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,620
It’s a miracle that I’ve grown up healthily

647
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,620
without mental problems.

648
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,640
Right?

649
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,730
Really?

650
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,620
Do you know why I’m best friends

651
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,250
with Cong Rong?

652
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,050
When we were in Australia,

653
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,400
I lived with her.

654
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,210
Whenever I go home,

655
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,840
I can smell dinner.

656
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,560
I thought

657
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,320
that’s the smell of home.

658
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,640
Now, my parents care about me.

659
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,840
But I think

660
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,690
it’s not as good as

661
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,290
Cong Rong’s home.

662
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,690
They never spent time with us before.

663
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,360
Now they try to make up to us
in their own ways.

664
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,080
Why do the elders believe they can do
whatever they want?

665
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,400
That’s what I think.

666
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,100
Well.

667
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,770
I’ve passed the rebellion phase.

668
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,400
My parents are old too.

669
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,080
Maybe we can sit down and try to
clear the misunderstandings.

670
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,690
But why is this

671
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,450
a luxury for me?

672
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,930
They now try to blame me.

673
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,120
They say I’m unreasonable.

674
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,360
Just random chat.

675
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,320
I don’t expect you to get me.

676
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,400
I understand you.

677
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,490
A family should defend you.

678
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,400
But now it’s the knife that stabs you.

679
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,210
Right.

680
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,530
That’s what I mean.

681
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,640
A bookstore owner like you is really
good at expressing yourself.

682
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,050
Here.

683
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,490
Cheers.

684
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,300
Sir.

685
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,860
My code lock has run out of batteries.

686
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,560
Can you come and take a look?

687
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,860
Look what time it is.

688
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,600
How about tomorrow?

689
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,400
Do you have a spare key?

690
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,900
I’m the landlord.

691
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,360
I’m responsible for
the power failure of the lock.

692
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,840
To compensate you,

693
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,080
you’re welcome to sleep
at my house tonight.

694
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,250
Stay at your place?

695
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,250
Choose one. The bed or the corridor.

696
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,010
Come in.

697
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,600
Don’t you know that you’ve messed up?

698
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,960
As a punishment,

699
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,360
you won’t have any cookies today.

700
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,530
Reflect on yourself.

701
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
<i>Password</i>

702
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,530
By my guest.

703
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,600
If you’re bored,

704
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,010
you can use the Wi-Fi.

705
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,970
<i>Password</i>
These are just random numbers.

706
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,120
What?

707
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,560
There is a rule.

708
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,840
Where’s the rule?

709
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,490
How did you come up with these numbers?

710
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,930
<i>Password</i>

711
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,730
Wait.

712
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,010
Have you forgotten your own password?

713
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,210
I forgot to tell you that

714
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,970
the colon and the full stop
are both parts of the password.

715
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,730
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

716
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,450
Are you really so scared that
people hack into your Wi-Fi?

717
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,660
<i>Password</i>

718
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,560
Here.

719
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,050
Have a cup of honey passion-fruit drink.

720
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,320
It relieves thirst, clears phlegm, eases
inflammation, and relieves headache.

721
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,880
Is it really so magical?

722
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,080
It’s just the placebo effect
of sweet things.

723
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,010
Am I using its cup?

724
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,930
No.

725
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,260
You’re having nice treat.

726
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,080
But he doesn’t have any.

727
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,120
He’s upset.

728
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,490
You.

729
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,930
Stop staring at her.

730
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,050
Have you had dinner?

731
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,720
Yes.

732
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,370
I had lunch.

733
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,930
Wait a second.

734
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,660
<i>Brain structure</i>

735
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,280
Impressive!

736
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,420
<i>Jugular notch</i>

737
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,340
Listen.

738
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,050
Your reckless action has injured others,

739
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,600
which is punishable by the criminal law.

740
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,240
Since you turned in yourself willingly,

741
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,410
I’ll let it pass.

742
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,560
I won’t charge you.

743
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,680
You’re really Wen Shaoqing’s dog.

744
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,050
You really know how to push your luck.

745
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,810
Cong Rong.

746
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,050
Come here.

747
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,260
You’re truly a family man.

748
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,530
Zhou Chengcheng is correct.

749
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,330
I’ll take that as a compliment.

750
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,010
That’s the truth.

751
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,780
If I take a photo of you right now

752
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,170
and post it on the hospital’s forum,

753
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,970
many girls will be crazy for you.

754
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,530
You mean,

755
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,490
I make your heart

756
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,120
leaps?

757
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,530
If my heart doesn’t leap, I’m dead.

758
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,450
Oh.

759
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,970
Bring me the apron.

760
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,930
I mean put it on for me.

761
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,680
You’re insane.

762
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:08,930
Is it done?

763
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,530
It’s too late.

764
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,080
We don’t have much time to cook.

765
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,050
Just make do with this.

766
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,490
Does it want to eat this?

767
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,680
No.

768
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,370
You’re sitting on its seat.

769
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,240
Why don’t you sit next to me?

770
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:00,810
This is so delicious.

771
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,120
You can create a style of cooking
on your own with your skills.

772
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,280
I can advertise for you.

773
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,810
And I can get you an apprentice.

774
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,560
Is that you?

775
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,450
I’ll have to decline if it’s you.

776
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,640
Why do you look down upon me?

777
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,760
If I’ve taught you everything,

778
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,200
will you still come to eat at my house?

779
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,890
These chopsticks are pretty.

780
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,490
They’ve got carvings on them.

781
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,400
Where did you get those?

782
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,080
These are just average chopsticks
from the market.

783
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,640
But I carved them myself.

784
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,810
You can have those if you like them.

785
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,210
I’ve finished.

786
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,300
In a family, if one cooks,

787
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,280
the other one will wash the dishes.

788
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:49,920
Fine.

789
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,160
I’ll wash the dishes for you.

790
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,080
Who’s his family?

791
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,640
I’ve changed new sheets and
quilt cover for you.

792
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,690
This is the key.

793
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,850
If you’re worried,

794
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,080
you can lock the door from inside.

795
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,080
I’ll sleep on your bed.

796
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,850
What about you?

797
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,120
I’ll sleep here.

798
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,050
If you’re feeling dizzy or ill,

799
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,010
call me immediately.

800
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,370
It’s not right for me to
seize your room for myself.

801
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:42,680
All right.

802
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,760
Take my quilt.

803
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,970
Sleep on the coach.

804
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,330
Remember to sleep on your stomach.

805
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,280
Don’t put pressure on your injury.

806
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,410
I see.

807
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,120
Different encounters

808
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,200
nurture different relations,

809
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,720
and breed different emotions.

810
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,680
At that moment,

811
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,330
I seemed to have grasped

812
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,530
the emotions beyond
the friendship as neighbors.

813
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,450
Confused, I tried to pull it out,

814
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,410
but then I found its roots were
deeply connected to my heart beat.

815
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,050
So in that moment,

816
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,760
my heart beats with it.

817
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,680
Wen Shaoqing,

818
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,600
are you asleep?

819
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,330
I said I’ll be there for you.

820
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,370
You...

821
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,930
Do you like me?

822
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,600
Do you want to know the answer?

823
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,050
I’ll tell you.

824
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,680
Yes.

825
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,890
I like you.
