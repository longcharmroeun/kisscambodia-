Do you have anything else to say?

32

Well, if you dare
blab it in the hospital,

Though you’re a cutie,

your sudden appearance

69

saying “important day”.

Why is today an important day?

It was just a gathering of old friends.

90

00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,440
Your poems are caviar to the general.

172
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,190
They’re too esoteric,
too difficult to understand.

173
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,350
Take this sentence for example.

174
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,180
From the peak...

175
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,900
The book is not suitable for you
if you don’t understand it.

176
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,870
Pick another one.

177
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,510
Which one?

178
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,670
There’re lots of books in my store.

179
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,750
Just pick one.

180
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,350
What else can I do for you?

181
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,470
Where are you going?

182
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,830
Go to rock climbing.

183
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,700
Rock climbing?

184
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,870
I’m a master.

185
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,820
I’m going, too.

186
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,750
It’s so hard.

187
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Why is there such difficult sport

188
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,470
in the world?

189
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,110
Climbing so high,
would I get killed if I slipped?

190
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,270
No way.

191
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,510
I choose to commit suicide.

192
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,240
Come on!

193
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,660
Come on!

194
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,020
Come on!

195
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,230
Come on!

196
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,110
Come on! Come on!

197
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,470
Come on!

198
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,150
Speed up!

199
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,180
He is actually good at rock climbing.

200
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,790
Everyone gets only 24 hours a day.

201
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,270
He does more things in 24 hours

202
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,390
than I do in 48 hours.

203
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,470
I admire him.

204
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,020
Good! Come on!

205
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,540
Good!

206
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,510
Great!

207
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,220
Let me help you.

208
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,980
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

209
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,180
Tired of reading the files?

210
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
Why do all of you

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,590
like to crop up?

212
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,780
What?

213
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,080
When the eyeball is compressed
or pulled by eye muscle,

214
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,590
mechanical stimulation

215
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,270
can cause excessive excitation
of the vagus nerve,

216
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,020
further leading to slow heart rate.

217
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,510
This is called oculocardiac reflex.

218
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,660
My heart rate isn’t slow.

219
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,820
Tachycardia is also a result
of stimulation.

220
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,150
Shall I find you a good doctor?

221
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,940
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

222
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,350
I come to get some water.

223
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,230
You two continue.

224
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,060
I’m back to work.

225
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,470
Don’t forget to have dinner with me.

226
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,060
Rong.

227
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,230
I venture to ask.

228
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,360
What’s your relationship with my boss?

229
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,350
I have no relationship with him.

230
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,110
Does that mean you’re together?

231
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,600
No.

232
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,060
Then you two are flirting
with each other.

233
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,060
Do you like my boss?

234
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,120
Though he likes someone else,

235
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,060
we can gain advantage
by striking first.

236
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,700
The situation is a bit complicated.

237
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,990
Although we’ve known each other
for a long time,

238
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,390
we’ve only just...

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,150
Why do you care so much?

240
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,660
Of course I care about
your lifelong happiness.

241
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,670
If you like my boss,

242
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,260
I’ll watch him
from all angles with secrecy,

243
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,060
helping you capture him.

244
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,350
I’ve been weighing it again and again.

245
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,990
I think he really likes you.

246
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,870
But if I find out

247
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,270
he does anything wrong to you,

248
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,000
I’ll throw caution to the wind.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,510
Benefits like my boss should always

250
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,990
be kept for our own.

251
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,630
I’ve picked you a couple name.

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,270
It’s Shallot Couple.

253
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,390
What do you think?

254
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,060
I think Garlic Couple is better.

255
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,420
Garlic is more expensive than shallot.

256
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Don’t be flip!

257
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,590
Go back to work.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,900
Shallot Couple.

259
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,940
Actually, I can do some housework.

260
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,390
I have no problem
changing the quilt cover,

261
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,350
right?

262

<i>Warm-hearted beautiful couple

Yes, Auntie Chen.

275
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,350
I remember.

276
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,870
No problem.

Don’t hesitate to come to the hospital
if you don’t feel well.

280
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,540
Goodbye.

281

Yeah.

285

But it’s a pity

286
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,110
that I’m about to leave.

343
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,210
You got time to go back
to the firm today?

344
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,530
Mr. Shangguan gained a complete victory.

345
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,320
I’m sure the firm
will throw a celebration party.

346
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,770
Sure.

347
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,490
He did great in winning the case

348
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,600
about the multinational payment
of claims.

349
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,490
<i>Daren Law Firm Shangguan Yi</i>
He’s like a golden walking billboard.

350
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,250
Mr. Shangguan will certainly

351
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,640
become the ace of our firm this time.

352
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,210
Mr. Shangguan is always good.

353
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,970
Besides, he has a
down-to-earth attitude.

354
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,900
Now, people have to wait in long lines

355
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,370
in order to consult him.

356
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,490
Interns have to wait in long lines

357
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,050
in order to be his assistants, too.

358
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,210
You got a favorable position.

359
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,170
It’s a rare opportunity.

360
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,120
You must seize it.

361
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,570
Rest assured.

362
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,490
I’ll try my best.

363
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,100
Yeah.

Good morning!

Do you have an appointment?

370
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,970
I want to see Shangguan…

371
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,120
Mr. Shangguan,
you’re young and promising.

372
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,850
I don’t worry about it.

373
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,820
I’m flattered.

374
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,770
The evidence is conclusive.
The case is solid enough.

375
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,290
I believe we’ll get a fair verdict.

376
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,120
I want to see him.

377
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,570
Do you have an appointment?

378
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,560
Mr. Shangguan.

379
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,400
Who are you?

380
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,250
I’m Cong Rong’s mother.

381
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,290
How do you do?

382
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,050
Shall we go upstairs?

383
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,210
Please come in.

384
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,340
Hello.

385
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,250
Have some water.

386
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,930
Please let us talk alone.

387
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,690
Oh.

388
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,120
Cong Rong’s mother.

389
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,680
Sorry to bother you.

390
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,930
I come over to hand in
Cong Rong’s resignation.

391
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,630
In case there’s liability
for contract breach,

392
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,730
I’ll make compensation.

393
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,320
Did Cong Rong ask you to do this?

394
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,360
It doesn’t matter.

395
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,530
What matters
is that she can’t be a lawyer.

396
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,800
Auntie.

397
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,450
I don’t know why you made
such a decision.

398
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,530
In my opinion,

399
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,840
Cong Rong has great potential
and capability.

400
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,100
She took the self-study examination

401
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,240
amid busy study

402
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,770
and achieved high scores.

403
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,160
As you can imagine,

404
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,400
how eager she is to become a lawyer!

405
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,530
No matter how hard she tries,

406
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,530
she just can’t be a lawyer!

407
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,090
Auntie,

408
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,160
please calm down.

409
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,820
I met Cong Rong when I was

410
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,800
on an exchange visit to Australia.

411
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,320
It was in a big classroom.

412
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,560
She elbowed her way to me

413
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,210
and said she wanted to be a lawyer.

414
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,730
I didn’t take it seriously.

415
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,360
But she continued to email me,

416
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,880
talking about her views on cases
and her experiences of review.

417
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,350
Gradually, I changed my mind about her.

418
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,490
In addition to taking the courses
of her own major,

419
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,080
she spent all her spare time

420
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,450
on teaching herself law.

421
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,050
Law isn’t her major.

422
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,640
She couldn’t have tutoring class, too.

423
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,840
She had to immerse herself
in reading and exercising.

424
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,050
The domestic judicial examination scope

425
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,640
includes 200 more laws

426
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,320
involving over 10,000 articles of law.

427
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,800
It’s a lot of work.

428
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,640
It took her two years.

429
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,640
During that time,

430
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,080
she went to bed at three
and got up at nine every day.

431
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,880
She didn’t have weekends
or a social life.

432
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,600
She studied really hard.

433
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,160
That’s why I know

434
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,320
how she is eager to be a lawyer.

435
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,800
We shouldn’t give up
such people like her.

436
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,690
I know.

437
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,400
I know how hard she works.

438
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,930
I also know how persistent she is.

439
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,080
But she can’t be a lawyer.

440
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,400
She should know that deep down.

441
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,730
Don’t bother.

442
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,800
I won’t let her do it!

443
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Mr. Shangguan.

444
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,050
I’m sorry.

445
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,210
Mom.

446
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:34,970
Don’t make a fuss.

447
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,410
This is the office.

448
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,290
You created a bad impression.

449
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:36,900
Come on.

450
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,560
Let’s go home.

451
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,690
Don’t pull me.

452
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,930
I can walk on my own.

453
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,120
Mr. Shangguan.

454
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,210
What does Cong Rong think she is?

455
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,690
The firm isn’t her home.

456
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,640
Let go of me!

457
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,530
You’re hurting me!

458
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,010
You made my arm red.

459
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,210
Even your dad never did this to me.

460
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,690
Mom.

461
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,970
Don’t do that.

462
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,290
Was it my fault?

463
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,250
If you hadn’t sneaked back,

464
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,300
I wouldn’t have come over here.

465
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,640
I feel humiliated too.

466
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,270
I really fear that
you follow in your dad’s footsteps.

467
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,210
Mom.

468
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,930
It was different before.

469
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,610
To be a legal aid lawyer

470
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,860
was poor and tired.

471
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,290
But I’m different with dad.

472
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,410
I’m an economic lawyer.

473
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,930
I promise not to do legal aid, OK?

474
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,480
No.

475
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
You sneaked back here.

476
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,300
I’ll let it pass.

477
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,570
You engage in financial medical care
and I have no objection.

478
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,300
But if you insist on being a lawyer,

479
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,250
I’ll never compromise.

480
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,880
Can you tell me why?

481
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,410
Just think I have a bias
against lawyers.

482
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,930
I discriminate against them.

483
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,620
To be a lawyer is my dream.

484
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
You can’t just impose

485
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,360
your ideas on me.

486
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,010
Why do you think only of yourself?

487
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,090
You said, I only think of myself?

488
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,100
Do you think I’m such a selfish mother?

489
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,340
No.

490
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,600
Enough! I got it! I see!

491
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,650
Mom.

492
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,340
Leave me alone!

493
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,370
Just think I am unreasonable!

494
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,410
Mom. I didn’t mean that.

495
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,170
Don’t be angry.

496
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,840
Mom!

497
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,400
Leave me alone!

498
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,050
Mom.

499
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,930
Do you have a minute?

500
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,120
Let’s have a talk.

501
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,640
Mr. Shangguan.

502
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,140
I’m sorry.

503
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,970
Mr. Shangguan.

504
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,800
My mom was a little irritated.

505
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,840
I hope she didn’t affect you.

506
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,360
Don’t worry about that.

507
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,250
To persuade your mom is more important.

508
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,650
I didn’t expect

509
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,320
that she would find it out at this time.

510
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,620
I was supposed to tell her

511
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,560
after I passed the internship.

512
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,290
Though it’s your own decision
to be a lawyer,

513
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,450
your parents’ support is important, too.

514
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,770
Have a good talk with her.

515
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,160
Tell her your true feelings.

516
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,640
Honestly,

517
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,970
I really hope you would stay.

518
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,840
It’s not just me.

519
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,080
Lucy has a good opinion of you, too.

520
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,280
Really?

521
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,080
Yeah.

522
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,260
Do you remember how hard you worked?

523
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,550
Finally, you’ve reached this stage.

524
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,870
I don’t want you to give up easily

525
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,070
because of anything else.

526
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,460
Cong Rong.

527
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,500
I’m optimistic about you.

528
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,510
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

529
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,240
I’ll try my best.

530
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,790
Yeah.

531
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,440
Mr. Shangguan,

532
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,310
drive carefully.

533
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,180
OK.

534
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,700
Cong Rong.

535
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,660
This is...

536
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,490
Let me introduce.

537
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,730
This is my boss,

538
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,760
Shangguan Yi.

539
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,890
This is one of my colleagues
from the hospital.

540
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,280
Dr. Wen Shaoqing.

541
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,840
See you, then.

542
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,360
Why did he take you home?

543
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,760
It’s a long story.

544
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,690
By the way,

545
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,840
did my mom contact you?

546
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,800
No.

547
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,450
What was wrong?

548
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,890
She made a fuss at the firm today.

549
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,130
Don’t worry.

550
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,450
She will be fine.

551
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,450
You both need to calm down.

552
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,360
Is Mr. Shangguan
an acquaintance of yours?

553
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,760
We’re not so acquainted.

554
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:22,980
However,

555
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,490
he is a real brain box in my mind.

556
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,130
He gave me instructions in person

557
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,520
on my judicial examination
and career planning.

558
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,170
My internship at Daren Law Firm

559
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,250
is thanks to his recommendation.

560
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,930
Yeah?

561
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,350
He is really nice to you.

562
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,230
Yeah.

563
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,340
He looks very serious.

564
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,460
But he is very kind.

565
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,150
I have a practice assessment
next month.

566
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,830
I need to practice my finger dexterity.

567
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,890
I know the words I said went too far,

568
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,890
but she doesn’t have to stay out late.

569
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,250
It’s late now.

570
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,540
The number you dialed
is not answered at present.

571
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,450
She didn’t answer the phone.

572
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,210
I don’t know where she went.

573
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,760
I’m going to look for her.

574
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,210
I’m going, too.

575
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,840
You’d better stay at home.

576
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,560
If she hasn’t cooled down,

577
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,280
you may have another fight
when you meet.

578
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,300
<i>Chengcheng: Your mom is with me.</i>

579
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,820
<i>Chengcheng: Your mom is with me.</i>

580
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,080
What are you doing?

581
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,320
Don’t tell her.

582
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,800
Yeah.

583
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,580
Auntie.

584
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,260
Come on.

585
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,100
Have some water.

586
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,770
Cool down.

587
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,490
Don’t be mad.

588
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,280
Young kids like you

589
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,360
would rather listen to a stranger

590
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,650
than listen to your old folks.

591
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,130
Look at you.

592
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,600
You managed the antique shop well,

593
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,170
yet you gave it up
and opened a barbecue restaurant.

594
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,490
It makes you too busy to eat fruits.

595
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,170
Thanks, Auntie.

596
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,250
You’re right.

597
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,600
It’s too tiring.

598
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,690
Why indeed shall we pursue our dreams?

599
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,800
I should have listened to my mom.

600
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,360
Stay at home.

601
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,930
All our dreams

602
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,800
are rubbish.

603
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,160
Can your dreams

604
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,650
take the blow of reality?

605
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,360
It can’t.

606
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,330
To stay up for nights preparing exams,

607
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,490
why did we bother?

608
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,640
Why did we bother to work our way
through college?

609
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,010
In the end, we have to find a job
and earn a small salary

610
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,490
to make a hard living.

611
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,770
How could it compare

612
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,740
with your hard life?

613
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,450
That’s right.

614
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,650
It’s not.

615
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,610
You were not flattering me.

616
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,600
You were satirizing me.

617
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,800
No.

618
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,970
I don’t dare.

619
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,100
Auntie.

620
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,130
It was my self-reflection.

621
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,050
We’re all ungrateful creatures.

622
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,040
We don’t deserve
our parents’ deep love.

623
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,690
Good.

624
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,580
I haven’t seen you for years,

625
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,880
and you got new skills.

626
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
You know how to be ironic
with me, don’t you?

627
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,170
No. You misunderstood me.

628
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,620
<i>Burang Barbeque</i>

629
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,800
Traitor!

630
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,970
Auntie.

631
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,210
I can see your heart is softened.

632
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,840
I come over to pick you up.

633
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,730
Did you come alone?

634
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,320
Cong Rong is doing self-reflection.

635
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,930
She’s preparing you an apology dinner.

636
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,210
What is she preparing?

637
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,650
Tell her.

638
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,560
I don’t like ordinary dishes.

639
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,170
What do you like?

640
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,130
Feel free to say.

641
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,560
Really?

642
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah.

643
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,210
I would like Li Hongzhang Stew.

644
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,320
As long as you like it,

645
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,600
there’s no problem.

646
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,680
She may know just what you like

647
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,580
and is cooking.

648
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,290
Is she?

649
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,320
Then I must go back
and see how she’s doing.

650
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,650
Auntie, see you.

651
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,840
Come often.

652
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,020
<i>Your mom would like Li Hongzhang Stew.</i>

653
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,080
Shaoqing.

654
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,600
Did you come to pick me up

655
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,890
in order to persuade me for Cong Rong?

656
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,800
Auntie.

657
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,930
Why do you strongly disagree

658
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,690
with Cong Rong’s idea of being a lawyer?

659
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,450
Cong Rong’s biological father

660
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,360
was a lawyer.

661
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,650
When he died,

662
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,600
Cong Rong was a pupil.

663
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,490
In order to fight for justice,

664
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,000
he got around a great deal.

665
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,360
He couldn’t take care of his family.

666
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,520
Though life was hard then,

667
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,450
I was very happy.

668
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,250
I thought I lived a happy life.

669
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,130
I just loved him being chivalrous.

670
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,040
But I never expected

671
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,650
that because of his work,

672
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,840
he got into trouble.

673
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,760
Then…

674
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,080
I really don’t want Cong Rong

675
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,930
to follow in her father’s footsteps.

676
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,130
Auntie,

677
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,250
Cong Rong wants to be a lawyer.

678
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,000
I have no right to interfere.

679
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,730
I can only promise you this.

680
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,890
I’ll take good care of her.

681
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,450
I won’t let her get into trouble.

682
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,520
I know it clearly.

683
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,930
In my opinion,

684
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,930
no matter what Cong Rong does,

685
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,970
she’ll put her heart and soul into it.

686
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,970
When she dealt with the hospital cases…

687
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,800
In the future, my phone will be

688
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,210
your family line. Please wake up.

689
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,760
She dedicated her efforts.

690
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,890
In addition to mediation,

691
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,130
she would do things
that went beyond her duties.

692
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,130
She is the same with her dad.

693
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,170
Same character.

694
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,130
Just because she is as chivalrous
as her dad was,

695
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,090
I don’t want her to be a lawyer.

696
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,970
Auntie,

697
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,890
that’s Cong Rong’s character.

698
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,320
Whether she’s a lawyer or not,

699
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,930
it doesn’t make any difference.

700
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,280
What I can do

701
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,690
is to be with her,

702
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,210
guard her

703
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,000
and be her backup.

704
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,690
Whenever she needs me,

705
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,890
I’ll be there.

706
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,040
Auntie, look.

707
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,250
Cong Rong is cooking.

708
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,650
She is very sincere.

709
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,210
How can you put it in now?

710
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,590
Look,

711
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,390
the bamboo shoot is used for freshening.

712
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,920
You must put it in first.

713
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,310
Here.

714
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,150
Put it in.

715
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:24,870
Come.

716
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,000
The soup

717
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,400
hasn’t been cooked long enough.

718
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,030
Look,

719
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,830
it isn’t thick at all.

720
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,110
Too much.

721
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,180
You do it.

722
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,540
If so,

723
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,060
how can you learn to cook?

724
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,110
You do it on your own.

725
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,920
Come on.

726
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,630
You do it.

727
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,540
You do it.

728
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,110
Here.

729
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,020
Put some sugar in.

730
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,590
Here, it won’t be too salty.

731
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,260
Have a taste.

732
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
It’s not enough. Some more.

733
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,640
Some more?

734
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,460
Some more.

735
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,830
I’m not biased against lawyers.

736
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,870
I’m afraid that you’ll be like your dad

737
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,430
and the sense of justice in your genes

738
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,870
crops up from time to time.

739
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,030
You can’t control it.

740
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,310
It can’t be true.

741
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,980
Why can’t it?

742
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,980
Seeing the news of your brave deeds,

743
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,190
I was so worried.

744
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,030
For making mediation,

745
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,830
you have to deliver justice.

746
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,390
What if you become a real lawyer?

747
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,550
Did my dad do the same?

748
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,160
Your dad was a criminal defense lawyer.

749
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,980
He was famous.

750
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,790
However,

751
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,220
the more famous he was,
the more people asked for his help,

752
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,740
and the more responsible
he felt himself was.

753
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,780
He took all the responsibility
on himself.

754
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,070
At last, the burden
became intolerably heavy.

755
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,940
He broke down from constant overwork.

756
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,390
Did he work so hard?

757
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,900
You’ve been like your dad
since you were a child,

758
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,030
overwhelmed by the sense of justice.

759
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,500
So,

760
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,310
I’ve been trying every means

761
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,550
to stop you from being a lawyer.

762
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,720
But in the end,

763
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,550
you still took the same path.

764
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,030
Maybe it’s fate.

765
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,660
We just can’t avoid it.

766
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,590
Maybe I was too deeply influenced
by dad.

767
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,950
His words have been

768
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,830
engraved on my mind since I was a child.

769
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,670
Laws

770
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,110
must advocate merits and deter violence.

771
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,000
Lawyers

772
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,150
represent the great integrity.

773
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,220
Most lawyers are working on cases.

774
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,430
A good lawyer tries to be a moral man.

775
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,620
From an ordinary lawyer to a good lawyer

776
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,180
is a process of learning to be a human.

777
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,540
Wield the sword of law.

778
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,660
Hold the scales of justice.

779
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,950
Lawyers are earthly being.

780
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,670
I don’t want you
to get hurt for justice.

781
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,510
But if you can,

782
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,260
I hope you can uphold justice
as much as possible.

783
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,630
Your dad was right.

784
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,510
But I don’t want to watch you
on that news every day.

785
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,110
Don’t try to be a justice warrior.

786
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,150
Cong Rong,

787
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,660
I just want you

788
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,340
to be safe and happy

789
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,070
all your life.

790
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,860
Then I will be content.

791
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,700
Mom.

792
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,070
Come on, tell me.

793
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,590
You were alone at the fraud scene.

794
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,760
Were you afraid?

795
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,590
Yes.

796
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,070
But when the time came,

797
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,800
if I didn’t do it,

798
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,470
who would do it?

799
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,110
You said the same words
as your dad said.

800
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,220
But Wen Shaoqing came on time.

801
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,110
When the swindler was about to hit me
with a chair,

802
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,000
Wen Shaoqing held me suddenly.

803
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,150
Then the chair fell on him.

804
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,180
He is good

805
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,110
and reliable.

806
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,300
Shaoqing is really a good kid.

807
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,800
Tell me.

808
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,510
Are you seeing each other?

809
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,300
Well...

810
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,550
Your dad at least
had me as his strong supporter.

811
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,320
What about you?

812
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,030
How can you do that alone?

813
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,320
Don’t you want to reassure me?

814
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,470
You must give me a reason
to rest assured.

815
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,030
Mom. They’re two different things.

816
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,260
I don’t care.

817
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,550
You must find yourself
a down-to-earth boyfriend,

818
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,840
so I can rest assured.

819
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,660
I’ve made up my mind.

820
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,180
I’ll stay till you get a boyfriend.

821
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,150
I… I have one.

822
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,820
I’ve got a boyfriend.

823
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,150
I’m with Wen Shaoqing now.

824
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,100
Really?

825
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,510
When did it happen?

826
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
Last night.

827
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,510
Tell me quickly.

828
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,700
What happened then?

829
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,380
Who confessed first?

830
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,510
What did he say?

831
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,380
How did you feel?

832
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
Stop gossiping.

833
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,660
It’s my privacy.

834
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,260
Get to sleep.

835
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,110
Get to sleep.

836
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,660
Don’t tell me.

837
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,910
I’ll know it anyway.

838
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,070
Tuck up.

839
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,780
Naughty girl.

840
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,460
<i>Cong Rong: I need you
to cooperate with me to put on a play.</i>

841
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,660
<i>Wen Shaoqing: With pleasure.</i>

842
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,220
<i>Cong Rong: I haven’t told you yet.</i>

843
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,970
<i>Wen Shaoqing: I guess, after a
sincere talk, your mom still feels</i>

844
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,020
<i>that she can’t rest assured until you
get a boyfriend to look after you.</i>

845
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:20,540
<i>Cong Rong: Have you bugged my room?</i>

846
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,140
<i>Wen Shaoqing: It’s called connected.</i>

847
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,280
Mom.

848
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,180
I’m going to work.

849
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,300
Are you going to work together?

850
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,990
Yes, Auntie.

851
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,590
We’re going to work.

852
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,470
I’m sorry.

853
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,590
My mom brought up a weird request.

854
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,780
So...

855
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,550
Yeah.

856
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,110
I understand.

857
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,220
Did you get into the habit?

858
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,860
Your mom is watching us.

859
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,590
Auntie.

860
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,580
We’re about to have lunch.

861
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,260
Look.

862
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,990
You must be hungry.

863
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,440
You

864
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,340
should eat more.

865
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,380
Okay?

866
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,030
Look at you.

867
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,230
You’ve grown up,

868
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,660
but you eat like a baby.

869
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,030
Aren’t you too devoted?

870
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,840
Auntie.

871
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,630
Rest assured.

872
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,710
Cong Rong,

873
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,000
look how blushed you are!

874
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,710
You’re in a relationship.

875
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,590
There’s nothing to be embarrassed about.

876
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,060
Mom.

877
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,840
We’re in public.

878
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,150
We have to work after lunch.

879
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:27,800
Bye.

880
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,660
Auntie…

881
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,190
Don’t follow me.

882
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,670
Don’t follow me.

883
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,230
Don’t follow me.

884
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,870
Don’t follow me.

885
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,950
Don’t follow me.

886
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,150
What’s going on?

887
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,550
Are they together?

888
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,950
I’ve already said that.

889
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,470
Don’t you think I have sharp eyes?

890
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,710
That’s why

891
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,950
I say you’re good.

892
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,430
Come on,

893
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,070
babe.

894
00:40:58,944 --> 00:41:13,944
