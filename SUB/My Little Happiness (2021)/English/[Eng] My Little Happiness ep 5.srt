The encephalic angioma has ruptured

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,670
which caused the patient
a serious intracranial hemorrhage.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,800
I’m worried it may cause
a cerebral hernia.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,630
An immediate craniotomy is necessary
for finding the hemorrhagic spot

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,670
and clearing away the extravasated blood.

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,510
The cerebroma has twined
with the blood vessels.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,800
When looking for the hemorrhagic spot,

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,550
be careful.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,060
Find the hemorrhagic spot first.

45
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,460
Hurry up.

46
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,020
We’ve stopped the bleeding.

47
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,560
Transfer the blood now.

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,620
Get ready to take out the tumor.

Did the surgery go well?

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,830
How’s the old man?

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,780
He needs to stay in ICU for observation
for a few days.

54
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,020
When can he wake up?

55
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,990
It doesn’t help to blame yourself.

56
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,740
It’ll only tire yourself out.

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,270
Listen to me.

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,710
It’s weekend time.

59
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,590
Go and have some sleep.

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,460
What about you?

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,030
Don’t you know

that doctors don’t need sleep?

64
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,630
Though doctors don’t need sleep.

65
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,190
The young and helpless trainees do.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,800
Can I...?

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,660
Sure.

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,580

you’re not happy today.

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,720

to comfort you.

The way you get all dressed up

92
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,800
makes it feel like you’re
about to set a fire.

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,460
Set the fire of love?

94
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,480
Say that you love me.

95
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,030
I’ve never tried this hard on men.

96
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,800
I’ve received your love.

97
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,420
I got it.

98
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
You, you, you. Be careful.

99
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,270
The oil may splash.

100
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,390
I don’t want to startle firefighters.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,900
How come I am eating the night snack?

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,110
I’m here to take care of you.

103
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,950
It’s fine.

104
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,860
Enjoy it.

105
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,070
I have no appetite.

106
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,310
Do you still feel guilty
about the old man?

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,100
Actually, I know what Wen Shaoqing
said is correct.

108
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,540
I did cross the line.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,780
If I didn’t blow up the affair,

110
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,480
the man may be sitting in the hospital
safe and sound now.

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,190
Don’t be silly.

112
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,120
Don’t take all the blame
on yourself.

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,270
You’re full.

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Sorry.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,870
It’s too hard.

116
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,870
What I mean is

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,190
that even you didn’t follow up today,

118
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,420
the old man would have the surgery
sooner or later.

119
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,540
Here’s an example.

120
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,160
Like if I break up with someone.

121
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,680
Another example.

122
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,540
This one is unlucky.

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,630
What if I break up for real?

124
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,390
For real?

125
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,510
Why?

126
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,800
I thought things were fine
a few days ago.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,470
Never mind.

128
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,340
It doesn’t matter.

129
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,060
My feelings come and go fast anyway.

130
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,030
That’s right.

131
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,950
I’ve seen it.

132
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,110
I think

133
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,830
these two things are similar.

134
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,830
Look,

135
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,620
if the bastard keeps hiding from me,

136
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,480
I’m probably happy now.

137
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,260
But how long can it last?

138
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,360
Do you mean that

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
the old man will find
out the truth sooner or later?

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,310
So, it’s meaningless
to pretend everything is fine?

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,360
Exactly.

142
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,870
That’s what I mean.

143
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,020
An unqualified boyfriend is
like a tumor.

144
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,430
It’ll blast anyway.

145
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,270
Realize early, break up early.
Blast early and get treatment early.

146
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,240
What a fallacy.

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,420
How is it a fallacy?

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,950
Rong.

149
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,750
If I were the old man,

150
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,120
I’d appreciate you.

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,720
I know that you’ve done

152
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,190
everything you could.

153
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,220
I’m proud of you.

154
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,470
Boss.

155

Don’t worry.

158
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,980
I didn’t know a brat can be so caring.

159
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,620
She means I’m the brat.

160
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,430
The brat is me.

161

Are there more?

163
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,460
There’s one more picture.

164
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,950
Though I don’t know
why I should show you,

165
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,460
my survival instinct made me do it.

166
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,950
Boss.

167
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,460
I feel that

168
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,230
you care a lot about my cousin.

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,780
W... Why?

170
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,630
Give it a guess.

171
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,700
If you’re wrong, then redo the essay.

172
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,590
Well. It must be that you care
about your students.

173
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,150
You care about me.

174
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,750
You care about my family, too.

175
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,540
Enough.

176
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,750
Go and take a sleep.

177
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,990
Why are you here?

178
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,940
I’m here for you.

179
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,820
I guess you’ve never wanted
to see me this much.

180
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,020
That’s true.

181
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,700
How’s Mr. Lin?

182
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,230
He left the ICU.

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,870
But he’s still in a coma.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,390
I’d like to go to the supermarket
for hospitalization necessities.

185
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,180
In case he needs them when he’s awake.

186
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,270
Perfect timing.

187
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,660
I’m off today.

188
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,780
I’ll go with you.

189
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,820
Sure.

190
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,420
Cong Rong.

191
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,780
May I ask you something?

192
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,060
What?

193
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,820
Why don’t you wear the clothes I bought?

194
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,270
Are they ugly?

195
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,820
Are you rolling your eyes?

196
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Don’t take it wrong.

197
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,350
I’m just doing eye exercise.

198
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,870
Patient’s meal requires
self-prepared tableware.

199
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,590
No shower after surgery.

200
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,390
Prepare more disposable clothes.

201
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,630
And basin, towel, toothbrush,
and napkin.

202
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,540
Prepare them all.

203
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,470
I got them all.

204
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,240
I also got a sippy cup.

205
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,870
He can drink while laying down.
And a table board

206
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,600
for him to watch some videos.

207
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,540
It’ll make him happier.
You take care of the urinal.

208
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
What else do we need?

209
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,630
In case we miss something important.

210
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,940
Get this, too.

211
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,140
Is a night-robe necessary for him?

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,300
This is not for Mr. Lin.

213
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,660
Take it back.

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,020
XXXL.

215
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,540
This isn’t my size.

216
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,590
It’s for myself.

217
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,990
The one at your home doesn’t fit me.

218
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,660
Do you think you still have a chance
to wear it again?

219
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,780
Maybe.

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,110
I didn’t volunteer to go last time.

221
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,590
Eye exercise isn’t like this.

222
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,630
Too frequent exercise
of superior rectus and infrarectus

223
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,060
may cause you a facial paralysis.

224
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,750
What a petty man.

225
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,350
I want to be independent.

226
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,780
Okay, okay.

227
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,360
Chengcheng.

228
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,470
What are you doing?

229
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,470
Be gentle, okay?

230
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,940
This is the rudraksha your father

231
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,750
bought last week.

232
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,020
In your eyes,

233
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,110
am I just like the rudraksha?

234
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,180
Not even close.

235
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,140
You always find us troubles.

236
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,420
Rudraksha doesn’t.

237
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,590
Chengcheng.

238
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,940
Think about it.

239
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,510
No matter what you do,

240
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,390
we always support you.

241
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,180
We spend money to make you happy.

242
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,350
Doesn’t it show our love for you?

243
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,060
Stop being wayward.

244
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,300
I’m wayward?

245
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,110
Let’s be honest.

246
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,630
You just want me to join

247
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,780
your self-pity, don't you?

248
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,900
Should I be grateful and kneel down?

249
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,660
What else do you want?

250
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,590
You cry to be independent.

251
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,140
Maybe you should give back

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,910
what I gave you first.

253
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,510
That’s why I’m here.

254
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,360
I drove the car.

255
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,390
It’s downstairs.

256
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,390
And these, too.

257
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,860
Take them back.

258
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,780
The apartment…

259
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,540
I can’t give it back to you now.

260
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,480
I can pay you rent according
to the market price though.

261
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,870
No, no, no!

262
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,320
Chengcheng.

263
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,500
Your dad was mad.

264
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,320
He didn’t mean what he said.

265
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,430
He wasn’t serious.

266
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,590
But I am.

267
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,350
I’m not kidding.

268
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,900
What do you want?

269
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,900
What are you doing?

270
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,780
Don’t cut the cards.

271
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Are you crazy?

272
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,630
I want to be on my own.

273
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,300
I’ll live

274
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,300
my own life.

275
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,840
She left.

276
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Aren’t you gonna chase her?

277
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,700
Let her go.

278
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,900
You spoiled her too much.

279
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,110
Hello? Who’s this?

280
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,870
Mr. Wen Rang?

281
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,390
I’m Wang.

282
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,630
Our chief editor finds
your poem incredibly good.

283
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,820
Thank you.

284
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,430
However,

285
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,320
the publishing industry
is experiencing a hard time, too.

286
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
Collections of poems don’t make money.

287
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,950
We have families to support, too.

288
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,870
In this case,
the publication fees may...

289
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,420
Hello?

290
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,020
Mr. Wen Rang?

291
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,060
Hello?

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,350
Mr. Wen Rang?

293
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,630
Hello?

294
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,180
It’s fine.

295
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,180
Just thank him for me.

296
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,110
I’m thirsty.

297
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,780
I can’t afford water.

298
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,700
Am I gonna be exhausted to death here?

299
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,420
It’s so hard to be on my own.

300
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,780
<i>Walking steps</i>
Twenty-eight thousand!

301
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,700
How about

302
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,540
calling a cab?

303
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,750
No.

304
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,470
I won’t spend his money no matter what.

305
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,110
Wen Rang.

306
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,350
Wen Rang.

307
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,510
Wen Rang.

308
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,940
Help me. Wen Rang.

309
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,180
Don’t you know it’s dangerous?

310
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,230
Sorry.

311
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,390
It wasn’t on purpose.

312
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,820
Where are you going?

313
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,190
Back to the store.

314
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,900
Great.

315
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,180
I’m going back, too.

316
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,630
Give me a ride.

317
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,540
I want to be alone.

318
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,390
You can take the bus.

319
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,660
No.

320
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,390
I only have one car.

321
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,230
Bus 11.

322
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,870
I’m too tired.

323
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,300
Please.

324
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,940
Just take me back.

325
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,390
My step number has reached
the top in WeChat.

326
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,200
My back seat is only available for dogs.

327
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,110
Not for people.

328
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,940
Never mind.

329
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,500
Just pretend that I’m a dog.

330
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,630
I don’t care about which breed I am.

331
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,070
I just changed my opinions
on you a bit yesterday.

332
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,880
I didn’t expect you can be

333
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,180
so troublesome.

334
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,420
It’s okay.

335
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,260
Hate me all you want.

336
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,350
The giant has said it.

337
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,830
People ought

338
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,740
to have the courage
to be hated by others.

339
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,830
Which giant?

340
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,590
Me.

341
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,400
Bicycle’s back seat doesn’t

342
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,590
carry people older
than twelve years old.

343
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,740
Do you have any common sense?

344
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,550
How about this?

345
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,980
If we got caught,

346
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,030
it’s on me.

347
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,110
Illegally manned

348
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,230
will be fined 50 yuan.

349
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,110
Who’ll pay for it?

350
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,310
You will.

351
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,980
No, I can’t.

352
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,110
Go ahead.

353
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,350
People should be honest.

354
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,670
Sure.

355
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,630
I gave you my promise.

356
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,500
I will pay for it.

357
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,640
But can you spot me first?

358
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,420
No.

359
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,640
Just this one time.

360
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,220
A good neighbor is better
than a brother far off.

361
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,480
Being your neighbor

362
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,110
is the biggest waterloo of my life.

363
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,110
You...!

364
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,720
Fine.

365
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,590
I have no shame.

366
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,350
I have no money.

367
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,870
You don’t have what?

368
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,830
I don’t have money!

369
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,870
You dressed like this.

370
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,980
And you have no money?

371
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,590
How about

372
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,070
I give you my bag as a pledge?

373
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,190
Lend me five thousand first.

374
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,830
If I don’t know you,

375
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,980
I’d think you’re a fraud.

376
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
That’s ridiculous.

377
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,460
This is a limited-version.

378
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,280
Well... How about four thousand?

379
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,220
It couldn’t go less.

380
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,310
What are you doing?

381
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,990
Penalty

382
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,830
is for you to realize your mistake.

383
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,400
Are you bargaining?

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,390
Who will pay?

385
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,980
He will.

386
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,200
ID and your ticket.

387
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,830
Put them away.

388
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,350
Within 15 days,

389
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,940
fix the problem at the traffic brigade.

390
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,500
Where are you going?

391
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,390
What else?

392
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,870
What about me?

393
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,590
Are you gonna leave me here?

394
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,630
There’s still a long way to go.

395
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,350
Jesus.

396
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,220
Hold the bike.

397
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,310
I don’t want it.

398
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,630
Don’t go.

399
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,790
Don’t go.

400
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,870
Come back!

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,070
Why are you still here?

402
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,260
Are you staying with me
for my night shift?

403
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,790
I stop by to deliver things for Mr. Lin.

404
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,550
Is his condition stable?

405
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,480
Everything goes well.

406
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,630
Dr. Wen checked on him
couple of times every day.

407
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,640
Unluckily he’s got no children.

408
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,160
He expects nobody even he’s awake.

409
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,110
Quite poor.

410
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,240
Well.

411
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,640
You can call me if anything comes up.

412
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,550
I’ll come.

413
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,160
Okay.

414
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,830
Don’t worry.

415
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,980
I’ll be off now.

416
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,180
Mr. Lin.

417
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,590
I went to the police station today.

418
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,700
They got all your money back.

419
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,030
Are you happy?

420
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,660
I know that you don’t have children.

421
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,870
Well, I can count as one.

422
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,940
My number will be

423
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,700
your exclusive hotline in the future.

424
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,660

<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

438
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,980
You are back?

439
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,870
I can’t ride.

440
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,980
My fifty yuan was worth it then.

441
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,350
You don’t deserve to be an intellectual.

442
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,350
You’re no gentleman.

443
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,590
I learned and applied immediately.

444
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,700
People ought to

445
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
have the courage to be hated by others.

446
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,630
You...

447
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,980
You really don’t have any money?

448
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,940
You’re broke?

449
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,500
Or what?

450
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,350
It’s not performance art.

451
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Slow down.

452
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,420
Nobody’s rushing you.

453
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,550
I’ve made my decision.

454
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,310
I want to open a barbecue restaurant.

455
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,110
Are you sure?

456
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,390
Everybody comes to dinner tonight.

457
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,590
We can also talk
about this month’s work.

458
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,980
Roger.

459
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,750
How come it feels like

460
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,260
bad students are taking a final exam?

461
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,350
Come in, please.

462
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,550
This necklace

463
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,830
is a small present from the four of us.

464
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,680
It took me long to choose this.

465
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,630
Just try it on.

466
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,920
This will

467
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,960
definitely fit you.

468
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,670
Yeah.

469
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,980
You didn’t have to do this.

470
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,460
Hello.

471
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,400
Have a sit.

472
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,260
We all waited for you.

473
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,480
I’m sorry.

474
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,870
I didn’t know to prepare a present.

475
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,630
You don’t have to.

476
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,240
I’d like to take this opportunity

477
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,070
to make my point again.

478
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,680
I’m very grateful

479
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,700
for what you’ve done.

480
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,350
But the presents

481
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,830
are not necessary.

482
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,180
Thank you.

483
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,550
Okay.

484
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,270
Lucy.

485
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,020
What are you doing?

486
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,660
Come on.

487
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,590
Congratulations for completing
part of your internship successfully.

488
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,550
Cheers.

489
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,720
Thank you.

490
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,260
Here.

491
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,630
Good luck to you.

492
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,550
Let’s chat while eating.

493
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,790
Actually, I have

494
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,670
received all of your internship feedback

495
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,180
from your units.

496
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,550
But I’m still interested

497
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,660
in your personal feelings.

498
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,700
Who’s first?

499
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,870
I’ll go first.

500
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Last month,

501
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,480
we finished three contract verification

502
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,350
following the seniors
of the law department.

503
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,630
We aborted an improper
acquisition project.

504
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,790
It went well in general.

505
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,920
Not bad.

506
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,640
Keep up the good work.

507
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,150
Okay.

508
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,630
Good.

509
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,540
What about others?

510
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,160
Well. I didn’t quite fit in
the first two weeks.

511
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,270
Jingjing was helping me a lot.

512
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,350
She’s really good.

513
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,260
The head office
has received the message.

514
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,790
Do you know?

515
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,260
Jingjing has not only

516
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,310
finished her own part of intern work,

517
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,150
but also signed a major client in film
and television for the company.

518
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:56,790
Actually,

519
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,700
I learned a lot from the seniors.

520
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,420
It’s better to actively
approach the market

521
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,350
than waiting for opportunities to come.

522
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,790
That’s pretty good.

523
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,790
How about Cong Rong?

524
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,830
I heard your internship
was quite exciting.

525
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,310
Did it go well?

526
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,550
My situation was simple.

527
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,260
It’s still in mediation.

528
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,350
Chengcheng.

529
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,900
I was defeated in today’s work report
as expected.

530
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,030
There’s an axiom in my head now.

531
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,700
It’s hard to take the first step.

532
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,870
The second step, too.

533
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,940
As well as the last step.

534
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,700
Cong Rong.

535
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,790
We decided to go
to karaoke after dinner.

536
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,030
Hurry up for dinner.

537
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,500
Okay.

538
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,400
Talk later.

539
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,590
I’m going to the karaoke.

540
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,550
It’s late.

541
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,590
Where are you going?

542
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,740
Wen Shaoqing?

543
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,340
<i>Febuxostat</i>

544
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,870
Stupid hand.

545
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,350
Why did you do that?

546
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,100
<i>Accident</i>

547
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,630
Cheers.

548
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,790
Who chose the song for me?

549
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,590
She did.

550
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,660
Let’s welcome a song from Lucy!

551
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,230
Alright.

552
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,110
I’ll give it a try.

553
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,870
I’ll give it a try.

554
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,380
<i>Wen Shaoqing</i>

555
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,310
How come

556
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,940
you are drinking by yourself?

557
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,350
You’ve really brought shame
on Mr. Shangguan.

558
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,440
What the top winning-rate lawyer

559
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,590
recommended is just a rookie like you.

560
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,350
A guy who’s never majored in law.

561
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,220
What are you even doing here?

562
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,590
Who says being a lawyer needs
to have majored in law?

563
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,710
First of all,

564
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,180
I did great in the judicial exam.

565
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,480
Secondly,

566
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,070
recommendation is a legit
selection system.

567
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,910
Plus,

568
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,630
I trust Mr. Shangguan’s judgment.

569
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,740
Are you two close?

570
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,470
Why do you care?

571
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,460
I like him.

572
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,390
I’m here because of him.

573
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,030
You can be the one who likes him.

574
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,550
I’ll be the one who stays.

575
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,900
Fine.

576
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,670
Have a great time singing
and playing here.

577
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,200
I’ve already paid the bill.

578
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,950
There’s something at the company.

579
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,820
See you.

580
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,500
Bye-bye.

581
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,260
Bye-bye.

582
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,500
Pour less.

583
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,940
Whose song is it?

584
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,870
It’s mine.

585
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,500
Who chose the song?

586
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,630
“The Chill” for Cong Rong.

587
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,220
My situation was simple.

588
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,630
It’s still in mediation.

589
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,900
And then?

590
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,980
The litigant is still in a coma.

591
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,740
You’re worse than being inconsiderate.

592
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,260
You are just reckless.

593
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,710
You’ve really brought shame
on Mr. Shangguan.

594
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,240
What the top winning-rate lawyer

595
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,350
recommended is just a rookie like you.

596
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,830
Wen Shaoqing.

597
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,550
I don’t need any bad news.

598
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,660
Mr. Lin is awake.

599
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,830
Really?

600
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,790
It’s true.

601
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,320
Cong Rong.

602
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,600
Thank you for saving Mr. Lin.

603
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,690
Thank you for what you’ve done.

604
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,160
Why did you drink so much?

605
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,450
Mr. Lin is awake.

606
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,450
I’m glad.

607
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,160
If you could have saved my dad,

608
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,210
it’d be great.

609
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,450
Wen Shaoqing.

610
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,850
Yes.

611
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,840
You are a good doctor.

612
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,730
I know.

613
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,690
It’s an honor to be your colleague.

614
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,770
I am honored, too.

615
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,250
Me too.

616
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,930
Have a good sleep.

617
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,160
How could I fall sleep like this?

618
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,800
What’s wrong with me?

619
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,730
Why did you hang on his neck?

620
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,080
Are you a sloth?

621
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,620
<i>Wen Shaoqing</i>

622
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,940
<i>Hint: Today’s Monday. Don’t oversleep.</i>

623
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,770
A small hint.

624
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,010
Is... Is... Is...

625
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,600
There must be a mistake.

626
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,640
Morning. Boss.

627
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,450
Large...

628
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,640
Large latte.

629
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,210
The bill has been paid.

630
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,200
Have a great day.

631
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,200
How much?

632
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,050
You don’t need to pay.

633
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,970
Someone paid for you already.

634
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,370
Good luck with work.

635
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,530
Paid again?

636
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,240
Thank you.

637
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,970
There’s nobody here.

638
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,180
<i>Inpatient Department</i>

639
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,960
Thank you, sir.

640
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,680
How can I pay?

641
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,690
It’s...

642
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,680
Already paid?

643
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,780
Miss.

644
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,760
You’ve known?

645
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,760
What do I know?

646
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,450
You’re about to meet a good marriage.

647
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,080
What’s going on exactly?

648
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,040
How come it doesn’t happen on me?

649
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,970
I’m jealous.

650
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,120
Don’t you find it weird?

651
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,450
It’s probably those who sell beds
stalked me and revenged.

652
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,700
I don’t dare to drink coffee

653
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,080
either eat sandwiches.

654
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,330
I’m afraid I may become the victim.

655
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,240
I think you’re just being suspicious.

656
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,820
Maybe you won a prize.

657
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,970
Or you became a koi fish.

658
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,170
You just don’t know.

659
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,240
No way.

660
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,300
I’ve seen people paying
for koi fish.

661
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,930
But nobody wishes the koi fish
a good marriage.

662
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,120
Maybe... The company is distributing
boyfriends for us?

663
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,970
That would be great.

664
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,850
Congratulations to you in advance.

665
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,080
Hello?

666
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,050
Hello?

667
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,480
Talk to you later.

668
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
I’m fighting for my dignity now.

669
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,080
Bye.

670
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,530
Morning.

671
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,760
Morning.

672
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,890
You look good.

673
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,200
White touched with red.

674
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,680
Any good news happened?

675
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,850
Or maybe bad news?

676
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,330
Here’s the shirt I smudged last time.

677
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,160
Check it.

678
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,330
I washed it.

679
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,490
For a couple of times.

680
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,490
What are you smelling for?

681
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,080
I thought you asked me to check.

682
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,680
So I’m checking

683
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,330
if it smells like liquor.

684
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,410
Dr. Wen.

685
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,760
Don’t get me wrong.

686
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,080
I hugged you because I was drunk.

687
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,450
There’s a common-sense mistake.

688
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,160
In medical definition,

689
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,330
people get drunk when more
than 20 milligrams alcohol is found

690
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,120
in each 100 milligrams of blood.

691
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,680
What you were last night

692
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,410
can only be described as tipsy.

693
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,330
A correction.

694
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,330
I hugged you because I was tipsy.

695
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,450
Then I do care about it.

696
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,340
Why do you care?

697
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,850
Alcohol is a nerve inhibitor.

698
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,930
Its function is to inhibit

699
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,970
the neural centers which control senses.

700
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,240
It maximizes the emotions.

701
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,760
Let me put it in an easier way.

702
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,530
You hugged me last night

703
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,610
is because...

704
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,760
I like you?

705
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,410
I said it following your logic.

706
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,410
What’s the big deal?

707
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,650
It was just a hug.

708
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,970
It’s no big deal.

709
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,010
It’s not the first time anyway.

710
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,340
Well. What happened last night

711
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,200
is over.

712
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,300
<i>Work</i>

713
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,890
Aren’t you gonna answer?

714
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,080
I said aren’t you gonna answer the call?

715
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,700
Hello?

716
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,240
Is this Mr. Lin’s exclusive hotline?

717
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,490
A warm and kind couple.

718
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,080
Magically brought the dying
back to life.

719
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,520
What do you think, Mr. Lin?

720
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,680
Are you satisfied with it?

721
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,130
Mr. Lin.

722
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,720
Isn’t it great?

723
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,850
You’re awake.

724
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,490
Mr. Lin asked me

725
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,490
to get this for you,
the exclusive hotline.

726
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,490
A silk banner for a couple.

727
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,560
You three are just like a family.

728
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,040
I’m no longer a fan.

729
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,410
I quit officially.

730
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,120
Mr. Lin.

731
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,040
Was it your math teacher
who taught you Chinese?

732
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,490
This isn’t the right way
to use the word couple.

733
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,370
Mr. Lin.

734
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,200
I love it.

735
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,450
I’ll take it.

736
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,080
Mr. Lin.

737
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,560
Do you feel a lot better?

738
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,740
Let’s go eat something nice

739
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,810
after you’re fully recovered.

740
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,820
Do you want a picture together?

741
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,560
Yes.

742
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,330
Reasonable requests from patients

743
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,530
cannot be refused by doctors.

744
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,570
Let’s take a picture then.

745
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,250
No big deal.

746
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:58,700
Okay.

747
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,090
Go.

748
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,930
Take one for us.

749
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,080
Come on.

750
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,080
What’s wrong again?

751
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,160
What Mr. Lin said is

752
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,570
me joining you together.

753
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,240
Yes.

754
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,280
You want me to hold her?

755
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,780
Lower.

756
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,760
Put Mr. Lin at the bottom.

757
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,850
Three. Two. One.

758
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,450
I always dream about Dad
going in the surgery room.

759
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,640
When the door opens again,

760
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,560
it’s empty behind.

761
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,280
After this day,

762
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,560
the dream never happens again.

763
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,490
It’s probably because

764
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,850
this picture shines like an award.

765
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,720
It’s a perfect period for Dad’s pity.

766
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,490
Or it’s...

767
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,240
Because of you.

768
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,050
<i>Cong Rong.
I forgot to tell you last night.</i>

769
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,940
<i>The hospital’s first month
job evaluation for you is “Excellent”. </i>

770
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,320
<i>Cong Rong.
I forgot to tell you last night.</i>

771
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,100
<i>The hospital’s first month
job evaluation for you is “Excellent”. </i>

772
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,010
Why is the light broken?

773
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,560
A short-circuit?

774
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,330
Is this the new neighbor?

775
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,200
You’re about to meet a good marriage.

776
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:08,140
<i>Qi Hao Dang Pu</i>

777
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,220
<i>Husband</i>

778
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,850
Hello. Rong.

779
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,730
Chengcheng.

780
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,930
I think I met the guy.

781
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,650
What guy?

782
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,850
The guy who paid all my bills.

783
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,250
Seems like he moved
to my opposite.

784
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,330
I’m afraid he’s a stalker.

785
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,530
Don’t panic.

786
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,570
Talk clearly.

787
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,010
My legs are shaking because
of your panic.

788
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,850
I saw a bunch of bones at the entrance.

789
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,180
I didn’t dare to look carefully.

790
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,280
I don’t know whether they’re
from humans or animals.

791
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,930
I’m scared now being alone.

792
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,010
Can you pick me up?

793
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,410
Don’t... Don’t be afraid.

794
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,560
I’m coming now.

795
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,680
Mm. Okay.

796
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,130
How about

797
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,600
you go downstairs first and wait for me?

798
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,180
Okay.

799
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,970
Got it.
