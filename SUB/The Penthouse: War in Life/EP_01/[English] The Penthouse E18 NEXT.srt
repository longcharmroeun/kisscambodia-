00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:06,538
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:07,838
AND BACKGROUND OF THIS
DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,179
EPISODE 18

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,159
Where is Joo Hye In?

5
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:31,960
Where did you hide her?

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,600
Somewhere you'll never find.

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,370
You'll never be able
to kill her again.

8
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,779
Tell me. Where did you hide
that brat?

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,010
How dare you treat me like a fool?

10
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,909
You're not even a human being.

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,949
You're a piece of trash
and a murderer!

12
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,120
You little...

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,159
That doesn't matter at all.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,800
Since we know
more about each other now,

15
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:07,459
we can become a happier couple.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,000
You're crazy.

17
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,269
You've been too sophisticated,

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,340
elegant, and classy all this time.

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,940
A woman like you must be punished.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,819
Punished for deceiving
your husband and thinking of...

21
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,379
backstabbing him.

22
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,060
After you're punished,

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,230
everything will return
to its normal state.

24
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:55,909
Where are you going?

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,019
We're not done talking.

26
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,100
You must get out of here now!

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,399
I can't leave my kids here.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,510
Ma'am, Mr. Joo will kill you.

29
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:24,779
You must leave now!

30
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,279
I need to take my kids.

31
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,249
Shim Su Ryeon!

32
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,320
Where are you, Shim Su Ryeon!

33
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,149
Shim Su Ryeon!

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Ms. Yang, I promise I'll come back
for my kids.

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,130
Please take care of Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung until then.

36
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,429
Where is she?

37
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,980
Secretary Cho, bring me
Shim Su Ryeon now!

38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,749
Seok Hoon? You brat!

39
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,089
Let go of me!

40
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,189
Leave Mom alone.

41
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,820
If you go after her,
I'll tell everyone.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,160
The fact that Min Seol A...

43
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,660
died here, in Hera Palace.

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,689
You little...

45
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,839
Hit me if you want. Here.

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,610
Go ahead and hit me all you want!

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,209
I am not...

48
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,450
afraid of you anymore.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,269
Hye In just left.

50
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:06,010
She'll call you
when she arrives in the US.

51
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:10,779
Thank you.

52
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm making up
for what I couldn't do for Seol A.

53
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,760
Mr. Hong will take her
to a hospital in the US.

54
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,920
Don't worry too much.

55
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:26,300
Are you all right? You didn't get
to say goodbye to her.

56
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,369
I don't think...

57
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,369
I'd be able to let her go
if I saw her.

58
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,239
Both Seol A and Hye In,

59
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,550
and even Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

60
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,850
If they had a better person
as their mom,

61
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,020
then none of this
would have happened.

62
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm a mess.

63
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,059
Because of me...

64
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,829
I feel like I made
all of their lives miserable.

65
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,739
It's driving me crazy.

66
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,590
Once we're done here,

67
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,619
I'll take you to Hye In.

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,499
Let's go to the US together.

69
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,629
I'll help you...

70
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:35,829
get away from Dan Tae
and live a new life.

71
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,639
Do you think...

72
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,879
I deserve to live a new life?

73
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm not a victim.

74
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,150
My Seol A...

75
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,889
I'm also the mom of the kids
who tormented her to death.

76
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,360
My other kids...

77
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,759
tortured my now-dead child.

78
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,739
I can't forgive myself.

79
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,210
No.

80
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,980
I'll make you happy.

81
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,410
I must keep the last promise
I made with Seol A.

82
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,179
I'll see to it.

83
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,929
HUSBAND

84
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,170
HUSBAND

85
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,999
The number you dialed cannot...

86
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,300
DETAILS OF JOO DAN TAE VILLAGE

87
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,179
I'll kill you, Shim Su Ryeon!

88
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,749
You dare raid my safe?

89
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,449
Mr. Joo. Sir.

90
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,389
Did you find her?

91
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,460
Joo Hye In just left for the US.

92
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,929
What? Do you think
that's something to brag about?

93
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,199
What about Shim Su Ryeon?
Where is she?

94
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,069
I don't know yet.
I have men looking for her.

95
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,600
You moron.

96
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,910
If you have the time to say that,
get out and look for her!

97
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,619
OH YOON HEE

98
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,819
Sorry for calling late at night.
It's Joo Dan Tae.

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,429
Let's meet up right now.

100
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,619
SU RYEON

101
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,189
I don't have to feel guilty.

102
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,089
Su Ryeon also used me...

103
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,359
to get revenge for her daughter.

104
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,689
Now, I just have to protect
my own daughter.

105
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,449
You look a bit different.

106
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:12,679
Do I?

107
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,420
Why did you want to see me?

108
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,199
We share a special secret.

109
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,300
Can't we share a drink too?

110
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,569
Still, we're not meant to meet
this late at night.

111
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,969
Have you forgotten
that Su Ryeon and I are close?

112
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:40,439
If that bothered you,
you wouldn't be here.

113
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,050
Am I wrong?

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,900
SU RYEON

115
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,510
Take it. Unless you want
to start keeping secrets from her.

116
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,290
Hello?

117
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,319
Why are you so hard to reach?

118
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,359
I called you many times today.

119
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm sorry, Su Ryeon.
A lot happened today.

120
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,699
I left the penthouse.

121
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,640
What do you mean?

122
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,870
Dan Tae's involved
with my daughter's death.

123
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,339
Come with me to the police tomorrow
and testify about Seol A.

124
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,640
You're the only person
I trust right now.

125
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:51,109
I must catch her killer.

126
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,150
Please help me, Yoon Hee.

127
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,990
Yoon Hee. Are you listening?

128
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Yoon Hee.

129
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,059
Do you know...

130
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,530
where my wife is right now?

131
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,640
If I tell you,

132
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,179
what can you do for me?

133
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,650
I can do whatever it is you want.

134
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,829
SU RYEON

135
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,339
What have I done?

136
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,679
I'll be in the lounge.

137
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,140
Let's have breakfast.

138
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,579
- I'll have a coffee first.
- Sure.

139
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,920
Ask me what you want to know.

140
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,660
There must be a reason
you waited for me.

141
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,160
Yes.

142
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,130
It's more like you to be so direct.

143
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,530
I thought about it, and I wonder...

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,199
what made you suddenly change
your attitude toward me.

145
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,809
I think it will be
a fantastic reason.

146
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,880
If you think about it,

147
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,449
I'm the husband
of your good friend...

148
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,650
who is also having an affair
with the woman...

149
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,750
you hate the most.

150
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,890
Didn't your marriage with Su Ryeon
fall apart a long time ago?

151
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:21,990
I believe your relationship
with Seo Jin is near the end too.

152
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,630
Why do you think so?

153
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,760
I got the impression at the villa.

154
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,429
The way you treated Cheon Seo Jin.

155
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,569
You had the look of a sickened man
who wanted her gone.

156
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,740
That's what I thought.

157
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
So?

158
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:42,709
That means the seat next to you
is currently vacant.

159
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,650
And you started to fall for me.

160
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,449
Do we need another reason?

161
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,589
You become
more and more interesting.

162
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:00,729
I especially like the fact
that you betrayed my wife.

163
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:02,599
I never betrayed her.

164
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,469
She's the one who betrayed me first.

165
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,910
She pretended to help
and care for me,

166
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,240
but it was an act.

167
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,550
Now, I know all that was a lie.

168
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,050
She used me
just so she could bring...

169
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,849
you down.

170
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,790
So, what will you do?

171
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,030
Will you try to get back at her?

172
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,429
Whatever it is.

173
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,199
If it's for my protection,
I'll do anything.

174
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,400
I like that about you.

175
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,609
You're honest and gutsy.

176
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:45,740
And beautiful.

177
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,709
Why don't you use me?

178
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,750
I might be able to tell you
what you want to know.

179
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,260
I'd like to know where Su Ryeon is.

180
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,329
I want to know who's helping her.

181
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,800
Also, on what she's planning to do.

182
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,579
It's me, Ms. Cheon.

183
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,449
How did it go?
Do you know who sent the video?

184
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,349
I can't trace the sender.

185
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,459
You said you dealt with everything
on that night.

186
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,790
Why did this happen?

187
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,589
Someone was there that night.

188
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,630
Someone saw me!

189
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,929
We destroyed
all the footage from that day.

190
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:43,069
So we can't identify
who was at school then.

191
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,800
Stop repeating there's nothing
you can do and figure it out.

192
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,939
Do whatever it takes
to find who it is.

193
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,380
Find out who took that video,

194
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,609
and who would dare
to blackmail me like this.

195
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,250
I will find out.

196
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,859
If I get my hands on you,
I will kill you.

197
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,909
Where were you so early
in the morning dressed like that?

198
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,349
Did you sleep out last night?

199
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,119
Why do you look like
you didn't sleep a wink?

200
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,089
Why? Is something bothering you?

201
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,129
Don't tell me...

202
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,030
your lover is impossible to reach.

203
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,669
That's none of your business.

204
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,470
This is my last warning.

205
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:01,780
Quit leeching off Chairman Joo
and walk yourself out.

206
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,950
Don't you have any sense of pride?

207
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,950
The one who's leeching off him
without any sense of pride.

208
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,290
Don't you think that's you, not me?

209
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,190
I'm giving you some advice
because Chairman Joo seems to be...

210
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,559
suffering up close.

211
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,559
- What?
- Don't trust men too much.

212
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,500
The most shallow
and useless thing in the world is...

213
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,230
a man's love.

214
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:26,770
Watch what you say.

215
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,470
Now, that I'm the director
of Cheong A Arts High School,

216
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,940
your daughter won't graduate,
let alone get into a university.

217
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,379
I wonder. Shouldn't we wait
and see about that?

218
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:41,649
I doubt you'd be able
to keep that position though.

219
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,089
That video.
It can't be from Yoon Hee, right?

220
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,450
Why won't you pick up my calls?

221
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:12,879
You called?

222
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,349
Where are you coming from?

223
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,220
I just returned
from a business trip.

224
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:20,990
I must shower and get to work.

225
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,059
I'll call you later.

226
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,829
She's become such a hassle.

227
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,409
Joo Dan Tae.

228
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,139
You're becoming
more and more impolite.

229
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,950
- The kids?
- I sent them to school.

230
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,359
You still haven't found Su Ryeon?

231
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,530
Her phone's turned off
and she hasn't come to work.

232
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,000
You idiot.

233
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:09,669
You were helping Su Ryeon
behind my back?

234
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:13,740
I looked after you for over 10 years
and is this what I get in return?

235
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,550
This so sad, Ms. Yang.

236
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,079
I have nothing to say, sir.

237
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,849
My kids liked you a lot.

238
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,990
Since when?

239
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:33,829
When did you start working for her?

240
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,930
I never betrayed you.

241
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,869
How would I dare...

242
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,270
Don't make excuses.

243
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,240
You dressed as Su Ryeon
and pretended to be her.

244
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,339
Did she secretly ask you
to shake me off her tail?

245
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,780
I'm sorry, sir.

246
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:53,919
Please forgive me this once.

247
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,450
I will make it up to you
if you let me live.

248
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,220
I will serve only you
until the day I die.

249
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,319
Take her away.

250
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,829
Sir. Chairman. Please, sir!

251
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,659
No. Forgive me just this once!

252
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,599
I can't leave this house.

253
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,930
I'd rather have you kill me!

254
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,270
Sir!

255
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:15,470
The truth is, Gu Ho Dong had
something on me. I had no choice.

256
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,569
- Sir.
- Wait.

257
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:20,809
"Gu Ho Dong"?

258
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,349
What did he have on you?

259
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,559
You all did well,
surviving the midterm exams.

260
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,430
Don't waste time
just because the exams are over.

261
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,099
Starting today, take your time
and study for the finals.

262
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,899
- Oh, come on.
- No way.

263
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:49,510
My dad and your mom
are having an affair.

264
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,369
They're also committing adultery.

265
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:56,579
Now that you know,
stop causing a scene...

266
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,550
before we both end up
humiliating ourselves.

267
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:01,050
No. No!

268
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,419
No!

269
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:04,250
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

270
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,190
Did the midterms take a toll on you?

271
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,460
Did you ruin today's exam too?

272
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,530
Why are you upbraiding her?

273
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,389
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

274
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,829
Is something wrong?

275
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,329
I have a headache.
I need to see the nurse.

276
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,700
Okay.

277
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,099
WRONG PATTERN

278
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,450
Why are you in here?

279
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,389
What are you doing with my phone?

280
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:13,419
Mom.

281
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:15,490
Are you...

282
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,760
Are you...

283
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,599
No, never mind.

284
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,669
What is it? What's going on?

285
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,300
Take your dirty hands off me!

286
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,069
What?

287
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
"Dirty"?

288
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,180
How dare you say that to your mom?

289
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:41,119
I am so disappointed in you.

290
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:48,190
Eun Byeol! Ha Eun Byeol!

291
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,609
What's making her act like that?

292
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,010
- You're here.
- Yes.

293
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,619
I'm sorry for avoiding your calls.

294
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,889
My head was all jumbled up
after hearing what you said.

295
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,829
I needed time to sort things out.

296
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,300
And I've decided to believe
that our friendship...

297
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,300
was real.

298
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,500
Thank you...

299
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:08,899
for understanding.

300
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,569
You told me before...

301
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,480
that a mom could do anything...

302
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,050
for her child.

303
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,819
And at times,
she can even become evil.

304
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,520
I want to know who's helping her.

305
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,720
Also, on what she's planning to do.

306
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,129
Did my husband call you?

307
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,700
He's probably losing his mind
trying to find me.

308
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,669
Not yet.

309
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,240
Don't worry.

310
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:45,169
I won't tell him that I met you.

311
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:47,780
Of course, I believe you.

312
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:53,780
I'm just concerned you might be
in a bind because of me.

313
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,389
Don't worry about me.

314
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,720
Why did you suddenly leave
your home?

315
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,960
What about your kids?

316
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,329
I'm really going to end it with him.

317
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:07,530
It's about time.

318
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,899
Are you...

319
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,139
trying to find Min Seol A's killer?

320
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:21,940
The people who killed my Seol A
must be punished.

321
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,050
Joo Dan Tae, Cheon Seo Jin,

322
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,750
and everyone else at Hera Club.

323
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,589
I'll crush them,
just like how they crushed Seol A.

324
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,159
What if you get hurt?

325
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,629
You know how powerful the people
at Hera Palace are.

326
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,899
Especially Joo Dan Tae
and Cheon Seo Jin.

327
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,930
They shouldn't be underestimated.

328
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,569
Do you think they'll let you
have your way?

329
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,839
They killed my daughter.

330
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,839
How could I do nothing
when I know that?

331
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,940
What about you?
If Ro Na died like that,

332
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,050
would you do nothing?

333
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,520
Seol A's death...

334
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,450
really breaks my heart,

335
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,859
but I'm worried
you might get hurt too.

336
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,800
On top of that, you don't even have
any critical proof.

337
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,359
All you know is that you saw
Cheon Seo Jin's ruby ring.

338
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,700
Will the police believe you?

339
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,440
Please say you'll stop here.

340
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,639
Please don't do anything.
Then I'll stop too.

341
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,609
Please, Su Ryeon.

342
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,879
People shouldn't live on...

343
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:34,849
as if nothing happened
after committing a sin.

344
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,389
I've bet my life on this.

345
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,389
I'm sure the truth
will be revealed somehow.

346
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,559
If you just...

347
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,899
tell the police what happened
that night,

348
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,470
the truth will eventually
reveal itself.

349
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,540
I told you!

350
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,000
I have nothing to say.

351
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,339
That night, I was too drunk...

352
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,809
and I fell asleep
as soon as I came home.

353
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:07,180
Are you sure...

354
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:11,149
you didn't see anything?

355
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,730
You have nothing to tell me?

356
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,669
I should've seen something
for your sake,

357
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,200
but I really didn't see anything.

358
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,109
So even if I go to the police,
I won't be of any help.

359
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I see.

360
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,020
Where are you staying then?

361
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,889
How could you do something alone
when no one is helping you?

362
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,859
Don't worry.
I'm staying somewhere safe.

363
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,000
Where is that?

364
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,069
I'll tell you once I get adjusted.

365
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,210
Hold on.

366
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,879
Yes, Ro Na.
I'm a bit busy right now.

367
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,149
The exams? You did really well?

368
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,319
Of course.

369
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:15,319
I aced two of the exams today...

370
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,819
and got one wrong
for social studies.

371
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,290
I think Ha Eun Byeol messed up
big time again.

372
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:22,389
I told you no one can beat you
fair and square.

373
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,829
Ro Na, what do you want to eat?

374
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,760
I'll make anything you want...

375
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,240
Okay, then. I'll see you at home.

376
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:35,700
I love you.

377
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,879
You made up with Ro Na.

378
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,680
I'm glad.

379
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,480
Yes. Thanks to you.

380
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,690
You look happy, Yoon Hee.

381
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:52,649
I'm sorry...

382
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,859
when you're suffering so much now.

383
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:56,889
It's okay.

384
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,399
I feel better seeing you smile
like this.

385
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,899
You know how much I like you.

386
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,869
You're a really cool person.

387
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:12,839
Su Ryeon, let's be friends forever.

388
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:16,409
Let's never fight
or betray each other.

389
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,879
Whatever dreadful thing you do,
I won't ever hate you.

390
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,389
What will she do
if she finds out the truth?

391
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,990
She'll throw me into jail.

392
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:32,260
No, she might even kill Ro Na.

393
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,230
Get a grip, Oh Yoon Hee.

394
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,669
She thinks Cheon Seo Jin
is the killer.

395
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,569
You can't let her find out.
Just think of Ro Na.

396
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:48,139
You met her?
Where is she staying?

397
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,750
I don't think she has decided
where to stay yet.

398
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,319
Why didn't you tell me?
You should've called me first.

399
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:55,980
We're going to meet again soon.

400
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,490
What about the person who's
helping her? Did she say anything?

401
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,790
She was the same as usual.

402
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,760
She was elegant as always
and unfazed.

403
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,800
She didn't even take her stuff.

404
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,869
I'm sure someone is helping her.

405
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,609
She can't be doing this alone.

406
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,680
There is someone I suspect.

407
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:29,849
I'll tell you when I become
more certain.

408
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,790
It seems like I've finally met
a decent partner.

409
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,319
Good work.

410
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,389
If you need anything,
you can always tell me.

411
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:42,659
Can I ask you a favor now?

412
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:45,470
Of course. Anything.

413
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:48,540
Even something regarding
my daughter Ro Na?

414
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:03,520
How dare you come back here?
No one here will welcome you back.

415
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,290
Do you think
this is some orphanage or what?

416
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,059
What will you do
if I'm recording this?

417
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,460
Are you threatening me now?

418
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,129
I'm pleading you.

419
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:18,300
You annoy me so much,

420
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,629
so could you please just leave?

421
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:22,669
For the peace and prosperity
of our school. Please?

422
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,710
Did Ms. Cheon tell you to do this?

423
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:27,010
To torment me
and make me drop out?

424
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:30,649
Or are you the type
that just succumbs to power?

425
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,750
Gosh, how gutsy of you.

426
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,520
This is why I hate you.

427
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,050
You don't know your place,
and you're fearless.

428
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,659
You're not the type
that students love either.

429
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,659
What do you know about love?

430
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,530
You will never graduate
from this school.

431
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:51,500
I can guarantee that on my name!

432
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,300
Do you know that? Do you?

433
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,669
That brat.

434
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,639
CHAIRMAN JOO DAN TAE

435
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:06,180
Yes, sir. This is Ma Doo Ki,
your loyal servant.

436
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:07,849
Yes, sir.

437
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,329
What brings you all the way here?

438
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:24,829
I'm sorry to come unannounced
when you're resting.

439
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,740
I know how rude I've been to you
all this time.

440
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,740
Can you be more specific?

441
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,440
Are you talking about the time
when you deceived us...

442
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,010
while giving Ro Na lessons
for Cheong A's admissions?

443
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,750
Or when you shamelessly came back...

444
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,419
as a teacher at Cheong A?

445
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,589
Or is it about
when you discriminated Ro Na...

446
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:50,690
and gave her penalty points?

447
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,659
I'd like to know specifically
on what you're sorry for.

448
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,430
Come to think of it,
I was really a piece of trash.

449
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,309
I sincerely apologize.

450
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,409
I don't know why
you're suddenly doing this,

451
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,010
but it's uncomfortable
to see you apologizing like this.

452
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,919
I didn't know what kind of person
you were all this time.

453
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,419
Especially, if I had known
you were close with Chairman Joo,

454
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,450
I would never have made
this kind of mistake.

455
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,629
I knew you were swayed easily
by power,

456
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:27,430
but you're just too predictable.

457
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm just naive.

458
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,399
I hope you understand.

459
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,870
Since we're on the subject,
let me be straight with you.

460
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,769
From now on,
Ro Na will be specially cared for.

461
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,310
No, she already is.

462
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,780
Chairman Joo ordered me to do so.

463
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,580
"Specially cared for"?

464
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,850
She'll be treated just like
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

465
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,819
Your eyes are sparkling.

466
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,060
From now on, if you need anything...

467
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,359
regarding Ro Na's school life,

468
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,430
don't hesitate to ask me.

469
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,729
I'll take care of everything...

470
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,569
so you'll be perfectly at ease
as you are now.

471
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,200
To prove that Ro Na is being
specially taken care of,

472
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,640
I'm thinking of introducing
a private educational institute.

473
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,140
What kind of place is that?

474
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,580
They have the most references
on Cheong A's exams.

475
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,680
It's a secret even the parents
don't share with each other.

476
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:23,649
All the kids in Hera Palace
already go there.

477
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:26,919
I will show you myself.

478
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,310
Oh, gosh.

479
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,439
My goodness.

480
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,280
A dense fog keeps blocking
your sight.

481
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:55,149
It's full of dark energy.

482
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,890
It's full of someone's hatred.

483
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,819
"Hatred"? Whose hatred?

484
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,260
How would I know that?

485
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,459
You should know.

486
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,430
What if...she means Min Seol A?

487
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,269
Why would you mention that name?

488
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,039
Please show us the last card.

489
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,249
There's going to be a bloodbath.

490
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:32,319
Someone...

491
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,959
might die soon.

492
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:43,060
This feels so creepy.

493
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,870
I wanted to ask if Jenny was going
to make it to Seoul University.

494
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,669
But what? "Hatred"?
"Someone might die"?

495
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
She's just spewing nonsense.

496
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,039
I heard she was one of the best
fortune tellers and even paid extra.

497
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:12,689
"Specially cared for"?

498
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,600
Specially cared for...

499
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,510
Ro Na has become special now.

500
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,539
If only I could provide more
for Ro Na...

501
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,350
I have a favor to ask too.

502
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,120
Can you go to my place?

503
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,490
The penthouse?

504
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:41,359
Call my wife and tell her
you'll get her stuff.

505
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,089
She left urgently,
so she'll need this and that.

506
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,999
No one will be home...

507
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,129
at seven o'clock.

508
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:36,222
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

509
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:03,169
How beautiful.

510
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,919
I'm sorry. I'll take it off.

511
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,930
I told you...

512
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,029
that I'll let you have
anything you want.

513
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,669
Even if it's this penthouse.

514
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,839
Then get rid of...

515
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,569
your wife Shim Su Ryeon first.

516
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,180
Send her somewhere
no one knows.

517
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:20,879
To a place she can never return.

518
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Can you do that?

519
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,989
That's exactly what I want.

520
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,310
Hye In called me.

521
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,520
She's at a hospital in the US.

522
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:01,919
They ran some tests,
and fortunately, she's okay.

523
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,549
Don't worry about her.

524
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,259
She's being treated by the best team
at the most prestigious hospital.

525
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,759
Thank you.

526
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:12,899
How's the contract
with Joo Dan Tae going?

527
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,930
We'll seal the deal tomorrow.

528
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:18,540
It's time to begin.

529
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:21,239
I've decided when.
It's three days from now.

530
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:22,509
Three days from now?

531
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:26,210
Do you think they'll admit...

532
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,649
to their sins?

533
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,549
We'll make that happen.

534
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,350
By making them take the bait.

535
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,519
2020 SOPRANO GRACE JO'S
PRIVATE SOLO RECITAL FOR CHILDREN

536
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,879
APRIL 25, 2020, 7 P.M.

537
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,960
They need to suffer
the exact same way.

538
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,370
Then, they'll realize their sins.

539
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,910
You come to see me
every night in my dreams

540
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,410
And whisper in my ear

541
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,350
- Come here.
- What's going on?

542
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:07,750
He hasn't told me yet.
He wanted to wait for you.

543
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,160
I bet you were startled
to hear from me at such a late hour.

544
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,460
But this is very critical
for the both of you.

545
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:16,790
Take a look.

546
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:22,529
She sued me for damages
due to adultery?

547
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,370
She wants 10 million dollars?

548
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,870
Su Ryeon must be out of her mind.

549
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,009
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

550
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,509
A petition for divorce?

551
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:38,120
I feel uneasy
caught in the middle of all this.

552
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,020
Why did she have to ask me?

553
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,950
You guys should've known
when to stop.

554
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,089
But I know. Love can be like that.

555
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,730
If you give her what she wants,
you can get a divorce by consent.

556
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,790
- She wants you to...
- "Give up the penthouse"?

557
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,799
She also wants me
to give up custody...

558
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,259
and parental rights,

559
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,299
and a restraining order
to keep me away from the kids?

560
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,430
Plus, 90 percent of my wealth?

561
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,500
What kind of nonsense is this?

562
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:03,210
She pretty much did
everything she could...

563
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,379
to get back at you guys.

564
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,410
Do you think this is funny?

565
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,549
You must be enjoying this.

566
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,350
How could you make me
get involved in this?

567
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,750
You should've made sure
nothing like this happened.

568
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,219
I already have enough on my mind.

569
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:19,859
Why did you have to get me
involved in this mess?

570
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,359
I don't want to hear you say
another word.

571
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:24,899
I'm not in the mood to deal
with your nasty temper.

572
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:43,580
UNIDENTIFIED NUMBER

573
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,790
Did you enjoy the video
I sent you, Ms. Cheon?

574
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,620
Who is this jerk?

575
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:56,430
Stop hiding and just show yourself!

576
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,410
The receiver cannot be reached...

577
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:46,609
Why can't I reach her?

578
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,919
SU RYEON

579
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:53,080
Su Ryeon.

580
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,989
I packed some of your clothes
and makeup from the penthouse.

581
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:58,319
If you tell me where you are,
I'll go see you.

582
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:08,169
Hey, Logan.

583
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,370
You wish to proceed
with the contract?

584
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,040
Today?

585
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:18,080
JOINT INVESTMENT CONTRACT

586
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,049
I didn't know you'd make
such a quick decision.

587
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:30,620
No, there was plenty of time
to think about it.

588
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:34,089
Besides, I was mainly convinced
by the fact that you, Mr. Joo...

589
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:37,290
You yourself showed interest in
establishing an investment company.

590
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,560
Even with your Myeongdong land
as collateral.

591
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,399
That was all the commitment
I needed to see.

592
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,169
The problem is, we need to decide
on the president of the company.

593
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,339
It's right that you get the position
considering the investment you made.

594
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,239
But in order to convince
the other investors,

595
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:53,339
it might be better for me
to become the president.

596
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:57,750
Oh, yes. Ms. Oh did mention
something about that.

597
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:02,149
Not a problem.

598
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,319
Things like that shouldn't get in
the way of our contract, should it?

599
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,589
I have faith in you, Mr. Joo.

600
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:11,359
Then I'll fix a date next week
for the investment briefing.

601
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,600
All right.
I'm already looking forward to it.

602
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,169
Oh, and in celebration
of our successful contract,

603
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:19,000
I've prepared a special
little gift for you.

604
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,710
Here you go.

605
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,379
What's this?

606
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,080
Let's just say I have some
acquaintance with Soprano Grace Jo.

607
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,480
"Soprano Grace Jo"?

608
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,649
Isn't she scheduled to perform
a solo recital in Korea?

609
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,560
That's right. Your daughter...
She's studying opera, right?

610
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:41,859
- Yes.
- So when Grace found out about it,

611
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:43,430
she wanted to hold
a concert for her.

612
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:46,299
So then I thought it'd be a good
idea to invite your daughter...

613
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:47,660
and all of her friends as well.

614
00:46:49,399 --> 00:46:51,100
The kids will love it.

615
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:52,870
It's all going to happen
this weekend.

616
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,339
Oh, and another thing.

617
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:57,009
The adults will be invited
to a separate dinner party.

618
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:58,739
We'll send you a limousine.

619
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,580
"A dinner party"?

620
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:04,919
This is such an amazing gift.
I don't know how to thank you.

621
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:08,489
Mr. Joo, now that we're
officially partners,

622
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:10,549
there's no need
for such formalities.

623
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,890
Your daughter.
She's also studying opera, right?

624
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:16,029
Yes.

625
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:18,160
This one's for her.

626
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,000
Thank you, Logan.

627
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Sure thing.

628
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,279
You guys!
Let's take a photo together!

629
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,489
Look at how beautiful Jenny looks.

630
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:45,759
Grace Jo might want you
to be her pupil.

631
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,359
1, 2, 3. Say "cheese".

632
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,700
They look so happy.

633
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,960
My goodness, look at them.

634
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:58,040
Grace Jo isn't someone
whom we can easily meet.

635
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,169
On top of that, she invited
no one else but our kids.

636
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,339
It's a private performance.

637
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:05,480
That ticket is worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

638
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,879
Logan Lee is very generous.

639
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,149
He even invited the adults
to a dinner party.

640
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,350
This is why I love Americans
who were born with silver spoons.

641
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:18,390
Honey, did you bring the gift?

642
00:48:18,419 --> 00:48:20,759
Don't worry. It's right here.

643
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,689
What? You guys prepared a gift?

644
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:26,830
To win him over?
You should've told me about it too.

645
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,669
What is it? Tell me.

646
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,469
Gosh, tell me what you got.

647
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:33,140
By the way, where's Seo Jin
and Chairman Joo?

648
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,169
Are they just openly
seeing each other now?

649
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:41,810
You don't know
what you're talking about.

650
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,149
That's not how things are going
these days.

651
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:56,989
I don't think things are
going well between...

652
00:48:57,029 --> 00:48:58,859
Ms. Cheon and Chairman Joo.

653
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,629
What do you mean?

654
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,239
I heard some stuff
and even witnessed something.

655
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,600
"Why didn't you answer
any of my calls today?"

656
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,009
"You haven't given me
a proper explanation about why..."

657
00:49:09,669 --> 00:49:11,169
"you were with Yoon Hee
at the villa that night."

658
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,509
"I told you already
that I went there to get some rest."

659
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,910
"And she just happened to come
with me after the team dinner."

660
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,710
"She was wearing my clothes."

661
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,980
- "The outfit you got me as a gift."
- Cut! Cut!

662
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:23,120
What does Oh Yoon Hee
have anything to do with this?

663
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,359
Exactly. Why are you suddenly
mentioning her name?

664
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,390
Will you let me finish?

665
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,930
Apparently, she got changed
because her clothes got ruined.

666
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,029
Must I explain everything to you?

667
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,230
I heard you signed a deal
with Logan Lee.

668
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,339
So now, I want her fired.

669
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,239
Logan Lee wants her, and so do I.

670
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:43,609
What?

671
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:46,080
Be careful. Many eyes are watching.

672
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:48,080
Don't change the subject.

673
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,750
I don't know what you're thinking,
but mark my words.

674
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,750
The promise we made
when we got back together.

675
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,719
I decide our relationship.

676
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:56,689
Whether we meet or break up.

677
00:49:58,489 --> 00:49:59,689
"Everything's up..."

678
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,890
"to me."

679
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,029
- My gosh.
- You see what I mean?

680
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,629
This means it's over, right?
They've broken up, right?

681
00:50:10,169 --> 00:50:13,870
I thought Oh Yoon Hee was kind
and innocent.

682
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:17,370
But it looks like she gets
everything she wants...

683
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,410
if she puts her mind to...

684
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,819
Seo Jin must've had
a really hard time.

685
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:26,649
That's nonsense.

686
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,250
Yoon Hee and Su Ryeon
are really close.

687
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:32,660
She'd never have an affair
with Su Ryeon's husband.

688
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,430
She's right.
Yoon Hee hates Chairman Joo.

689
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,489
Right, Dr. Ha?

690
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:39,899
You know how they hate each other.

691
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:43,330
If so, why would they work together?

692
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:47,469
I could already tell that they have
something going on already.

693
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,080
Imagine how lonely she must've been
living all alone as a single mother.

694
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:53,609
Will you please...

695
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,850
Will you please stop?

696
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,020
Gosh, you startled us.

697
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,259
What's the matter with you?

698
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,290
Here's what I think.

699
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:10,859
I don't think it's bad for you
to hear this as her ex-husband.

700
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,529
You know, some foreign cultures
are cool about these kinds of stuff.

701
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,669
Why don't you ask them yourself?

702
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:25,779
My goodness.

703
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:28,680
Hello, Director Cheon.

704
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:30,779
Seo Jin, you look...

705
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,020
No, wait. Director Cheon,
you look like an actress today.

706
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,489
That color looks fabulous on you.

707
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:42,529
I agree. I've never seen
that dress before. Is it new?

708
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,600
You look beautiful,
Director Cheon.

709
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,200
You should let me
go shopping with you.

710
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,399
I need to learn how to have
a better taste like you.

711
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:57,939
I'm Logan Lee's secretary.

712
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,080
Your ride is here.

713
00:52:00,379 --> 00:52:02,279
Are we going now?

714
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:05,450
I'll take you to the party.

715
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:09,250
Your kids will be enjoying the
performance at the community hall.

716
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,620
- See you later, Eun Byeol.
- Have fun, kids.

717
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:14,219
- Don't do anything bad.
- Okay.

718
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:17,890
By the way, I thought Logan Lee
and Yoon Hee were friends.

719
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,160
Why wasn't her daughter invited?

720
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:24,069
What are you doing here?

721
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:26,439
I wanted to thank you in person.

722
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:27,899
She's my daughter.

723
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:30,609
- My name is Bae Ro Na.
- Hi.

724
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,239
I really love Grace Jo.

725
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,680
Thank you for inviting my daughter
to the special performance.

726
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:40,649
No, it's my pleasure.

727
00:52:40,649 --> 00:52:43,790
Besides, you played a big part
in establishing the contract.

728
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,960
Think of it as a compliment.

729
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,430
By the way, the performance
will be held in Crystal Hall, right?

730
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:55,799
The other kids seem to think
it's in the community hall.

731
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:59,040
I think there must've been
some kind of a mix-up.

732
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,439
I'll be sure to let them know.

733
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:03,609
Now, if you'd excuse me, I was
in the middle of doing something.

734
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,379
You guys have a great day now.

735
00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:09,609
- Thank you.
- Bye.

736
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,689
Let's go.

737
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,989
Where did I see that bag?

738
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:23,290
Mom, I'm so excited
that I can't wait.

739
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,790
I feel like
my heart is going to burst.

740
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,460
Will I really get to meet Grace Jo?

741
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,529
You've already asked me that
dozens of times.

742
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,239
- Are you that excited?
- You're amazing, Mom.

743
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,100
You work with someone so impressive.

744
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,609
You're incredible.

745
00:53:37,169 --> 00:53:38,239
Let's go.

746
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:44,710
You must've been startled.

747
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,379
I'm okay.

748
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,149
I'll be off now.

749
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:54,120
See you later.

750
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,359
Su Ryeon.

751
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,870
Be careful.

752
00:54:03,529 --> 00:54:04,529
You too.

753
00:54:20,149 --> 00:54:21,480
Okay, everyone.

754
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:24,219
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

755
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,460
We haven't gathered together
in so long.

756
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,529
It's the first time after
the two of you got a divorce.

757
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:33,660
Dr. Ha, you have
an American mindset.

758
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,870
You guys still stay as friends
even after the divorce.

759
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,270
I really admire you guys.

760
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:41,399
Did you really have to come?

761
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,109
You're the uninvited guest.

762
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:47,609
I received an invitation
from Logan as one of the investors.

763
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:48,950
"Investor"?

764
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:52,149
Logan's joint company will be built
on the land I invested in.

765
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,779
Didn't you know that?

766
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:56,989
My goodness, Chairman Joo...

767
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,290
must keep a lot of secrets from you.

768
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,560
That rarely happens
in the honeymoon phase.

769
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,460
The kids were so excited.

770
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,569
I'm so grateful for what Logan
is doing for them.

771
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:10,770
By the way, why didn't you bring
Su Ryeon with you?

772
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,969
I haven't seen her in a while.

773
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:16,169
She went on a trip.
The kids finished their exams,

774
00:55:16,169 --> 00:55:17,339
so she went to take a break.

775
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,810
What's with the mood?
Today's supposed to be a good day.

776
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:26,620
You know what? Let's all drink.

777
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:28,520
Bottoms up. Drink it all.

778
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:31,219
- Dr. Ha, you start.
- Cheers.

779
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:32,259
Cheers.

780
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,520
Here.

781
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:41,330
- This is beautiful.
- I know.

782
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,600
GRACE JO SOLO RECITAL

783
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,239
Ta-da. I'm going to ask Grace Jo
to sign her autograph on this dress.

784
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:49,569
And I'll give it to my daughter
as an heirloom.

785
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,640
I can't believe we'll be meeting
the prima donna of New York.

786
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:57,850
She's going to perform for us
and even carry out an audition.

787
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,219
Isn't this an event good enough
to write in our CVs?

788
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:04,489
We auditioned in front of Grace Jo.

789
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:07,560
Why did Grace Jo invite us though?

790
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,790
My dad's business partner owns
a theater in the States.

791
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,430
So he knows a lot of musicians.

792
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,230
I guess he really is
a filthy rich guy from the States.

793
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:18,770
It's an important event,
so don't make any mistakes.

794
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:35,419
Why am I so sleepy?

795
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,009
Why isn't she here yet?

796
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,879
You're right. She's really late.

797
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:08,279
It's my mom.

798
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,120
Mom, did you arrive?

799
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,089
How is the party? Is it amazing?

800
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,060
Hello? Mom, why aren't you
saying anything?

801
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,100
Jenny, help!

802
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,770
What's going on?

803
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,600
Why? Is there something wrong?

804
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,069
I don't know.

805
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,140
My mom suddenly cried for help.

806
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,710
What's wrong with my cell phone?
It's not working.

807
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:37,910
I'll try calling my dad.

808
00:57:38,649 --> 00:57:40,879
Mom... Gosh, what's going on?

809
00:57:40,879 --> 00:57:42,919
- My phone won't work either.
- I can't get any signals.

810
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,890
What are you talking about?
This is Hera Palace.

811
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,989
I'm going to try
and call my mom outside.

812
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,089
Me too.

813
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:50,780
GRACE JO SOLO RECITAL

814
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,340
GRACE JO SOLO RECITAL

815
00:57:58,169 --> 00:57:59,669
What's going on?

816
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:01,339
The doors won't open!

817
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:03,640
What are you talking about? Move.

818
00:58:05,779 --> 00:58:07,810
What? It's locked. What is this?

819
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,570
GRACE JO SOLO RECITAL

820
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,750
Why would the doors be locked?

821
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,450
Hey!

822
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,189
- What's going on?
- Open the door!

823
00:58:20,189 --> 00:58:22,129
Go back down and take your seats.

824
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,759
What? Who was that?

825
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,060
- Where is that voice coming from?
- Who are you?

826
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:29,830
Who's doing this to us?

827
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:32,299
Calm down, you guys.

828
00:58:32,939 --> 00:58:34,969
The show is about to begin.

829
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,080
- Where is this guy?
- Cut it out and open the door!

830
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:43,310
NO OPEN FLAMES

831
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,790
Chairman... Chairman Joo.

832
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,660
Dr. Ha.

833
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:58,529
Attorney Lee!

834
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,700
- Gosh, my head.
- Ms. Cheon!

835
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,270
- Wake up.
- Gosh, I have a headache.

836
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,730
- Gosh, my head aches so much.
- Sang A.

837
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:07,200
Sang A, wake up.

838
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,640
Wake up!

839
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:10,009
- Where are we?
- What is this place?

840
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,609
- Where are we?
- Gosh, my head.

841
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,439
My goodness.

842
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,750
What is this place?

843
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,049
Come on.

844
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,279
What's going on?

845
00:59:19,419 --> 00:59:21,319
- What's that?
- What?

846
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,589
- What is it?
- Where?

847
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:24,719
What is that?

848
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,460
My gosh, what was that?

849
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:33,299
- Open the door!
- Help!

850
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,069
What is that?

851
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,779
Mom?

852
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:48,950
Mom!

853
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,910
Mom.

854
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,980
Mom! Dad!

855
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:57,390
Mom!

856
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,660
- Mom...
- What is that? Mom!

857
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,029
What's my mom doing there?

858
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,460
Mom!

859
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,770
Mom!

860
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,870
Mom, what are you doing there?

861
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,399
Gosh, what should we do?

862
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,069
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

863
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:18,939
Please let us out.

864
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:21,040
I have your parents.

865
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:24,779
They need to get punished.

866
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:26,919
What nonsense are you talking about?

867
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,350
Are you saying you kidnapped
our parents?

868
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,950
Do you even know who my dad is?

869
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,219
Show yourself right now!

870
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,689
- Where are you?
- Who are you?

871
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:38,160
Where are you?

872
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,600
- Mom, please pick up!
- Help!

873
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,000
My mom won't pick up!

874
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,129
Mom!

875
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,799
My gosh!

876
01:00:51,669 --> 01:00:52,980
Don't waste your energy.

877
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,509
No one will come to help.

878
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,549
This voice...

879
01:01:00,379 --> 01:01:03,350
Look. It's that place.

880
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:04,649
What place?

881
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,089
Min Seol A?

882
01:01:12,529 --> 01:01:13,529
No way.

883
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,000
What are my parents doing there?

884
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:20,169
- Mom!
- Mom!

885
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:22,140
- Mom!
- Dad!

886
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,509
Mom! I'm sorry!

887
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:28,140
- No! Please!
- Please stop!

888
01:01:34,879 --> 01:01:35,919
What is this?

889
01:01:35,919 --> 01:01:37,049
What's going on?

890
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:38,250
My goodness!

891
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:40,620
- This is gasoline!
- My gosh!

892
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,359
What is this? It's gasoline!

893
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,790
It's gasoline?

894
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,359
What is it? What's wrong??

895
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:50,930
- Oh, my gosh!
- My goodness!

896
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:54,169
Is that a bomb?

897
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,710
- Stop!
- It'll blow up!

898
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:57,939
- Don't move!
- The door won't open!

899
01:01:57,939 --> 01:01:59,439
- We need to get out of here!
- Open the door.

900
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:00,879
Open the door!

901
01:02:00,879 --> 01:02:02,210
- Help!
- Open!

902
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,109
Help us! Help!

903
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,250
My phone won't work.

904
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,680
We can't even get a signal!

905
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,049
Do something!

906
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:15,219
It's a fire!

907
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,960
Wait!

908
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:19,160
There's a person over there!

909
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,600
- What?
- Look.

910
01:02:23,169 --> 01:02:25,640
- Where?
- Hey! Over here!

911
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:28,100
- Where?
- Please open the door.

912
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,770
- What are you doing?
- Come here!

913
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,270
- Hey!
- What...

914
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,049
Please take us out of here!

915
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,180
- Mom!
- No!

916
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,790
Mom!

917
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:45,049
What is going on?

918
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:48,620
Your parents will pay
for what you did in the past.

919
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,489
Is something wrong with that?

920
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,299
Your parents...

921
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,870
will die instead of you.

922
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:01,069
- No, no. Mom...
- No!

923
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:05,310
No! No! Mom!

924
01:03:05,439 --> 01:03:08,109
No, Mom!

925
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,419
No, Mom...

926
01:03:26,399 --> 01:03:28,759
You idiot.
I think the car is on fire.

927
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:31,330
Fire?

928
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,270
Hey, I broke the door earlier.

929
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,569
Please help me.
Open the door.

930
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:38,910
Please open the door.

931
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,710
- Hey, let's just go.
- What about her?

932
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,549
- Whatever, let's go.
- Don't go!

933
01:03:43,549 --> 01:03:44,950
She'll find her way out.

934
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,480
Let's get out of here.
What if the car explodes?

935
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:51,450
- Darn, whatever.
- Don't go!

936
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:25,589
Mom!

937
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:34,529
Why did I call out "Mom"
at that moment?

938
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,230
If I had a mom,

939
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:40,040
something like that wouldn't
have happened in the first place.

940
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,710
What are you doing?

941
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,609
Can't you see us in here?
Stop this madness now!

942
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:51,310
Hey! Why did you set this place
on fire? Are you crazy?

943
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,520
Why? Are you afraid you might die?

944
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,520
What the?

945
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:58,790
Was it okay when your kids
did the same thing?

946
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:02,890
Your kids also set a car on fire
and ran away.

947
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:07,399
What are you talking about?
We don't understand!

948
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,370
Min Seol A.

949
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,969
What do you mean, Min Seol A?

950
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:19,379
That night... There was a fire
in the van.

951
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,009
What are you talking about?

952
01:05:22,279 --> 01:05:25,379
Our kids lighted candles
on a cake...

953
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:29,149
and Min Seol A almost burned
to death.

954
01:06:08,859 --> 01:06:11,830
THE PENTHOUSE

955
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:13,700
<i>You abducted, confined,
and threatened us!</i>

956
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,129
<i>Min Seol A is my daughter!</i>

957
01:06:15,154 --> 01:06:16,755
<i>Go screw yourselves.</i>

958
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,069
<i>- Do you like him?
- I know how hard it has been.</i>

959
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:21,100
<i>Don't think it will end here.</i>

960
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,969
<i>The one who pushed Seol A
off the building.</i>

961
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:24,609
<i>I mistook you as a friend.</i>

962
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:26,580
<i>Just kill her!</i>

963
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,910
<i>I'll kill you in the end
as painfully as possible.</i>
