00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,387
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:07,757
AND BACKGROUND OF THIS
DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:09,487
LAST EPISODE

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,028
I waited to ask you for a favor.

5
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:14,497
Get rid of...

6
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:16,897
Shim Su Ryeon.

7
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,867
Why were you so fixated
on killing Shim Su Ryeon?

8
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,207
Because you wanted Joo
Dan Tae and the penthouse?

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,908
Did Joo Dan Tae say that?

10
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:32,178
Did he tell you...

11
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:35,648
that I wanted to have him?

12
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,347
We have clear proof.

13
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:41,188
We found your fingerprints...

14
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:43,287
smothered all over the knife
used to kill Shim Su Ryeon.

15
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,857
This is your knife, right?

16
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:52,167
Su Ryeon.

17
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,567
Answer me, Ms. Oh.

18
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:59,438
Did you kill Shim Su
Ryeon with this knife?

19
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:03,607
Yes.

20
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:06,208
I killed her.

21
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:10,077
What? What did you say?

22
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,258
I killed her.

23
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:18,288
I...

24
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:21,698
hated Su Ryeon...

25
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:24,728
to death.

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,708
Here...

27
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:37,978
It's all my fault.

28
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,318
It's all because of me.

29
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:45,217
I should've dealt
with it more firmly.

30
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:49,458
But it's too late.

31
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:53,058
Why is that your fault?

32
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:55,698
There's no way to stop
a psychopath like her.

33
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,928
Well, I hope you stay strong.

34
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:02,068
You can go home now.

35
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:14,918
How can I drink this trash?

36
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,467
Mister. Where is my mom?

37
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,437
Let me meet her.

38
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,067
Is she okay?

39
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,507
Why did you arrest
an innocent person?

40
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,377
What is my mom doing here?

41
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,247
Your mom admitted everything.

42
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:45,907
What?

43
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:48,418
No.

44
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:51,787
That can't be true.

45
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,817
No. No...

46
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:03,627
REST IN PEACE, SU RYEON.

47
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,328
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU,
WE SEND OUR CONDOLENCES.

48
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,037
People are sending condolences
to the shocking murder case...

49
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:11,007
that occurred at the most
expensive apartment...

50
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:13,208
- Su Ryeon.
- in Korea.

51
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,377
- The victim is Ms. Shim...
- Goodbye.

52
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,678
- At the lobby of the...
- We will...

53
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:19,678
never forget you.

54
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,488
"MONTHLY BIZ"

55
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:28,088
Su Ryeon, I hope you
go to a better place.

56
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:30,727
Oh, dear.

57
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,527
Our house price will plummet.

58
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,428
- Oh, dear.
- It will hit rock bottom.

59
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:37,058
This is a total disaster.

60
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:42,268
Oh, dear. My goodness...

61
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,537
What are you thinking?

62
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,578
What if someone hears you?

63
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:50,608
Do you know how many cameras
are shooting this scene?

64
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,947
I know.

65
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,578
A person died.
It's a murder case.

66
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,747
That's why I'm so worried.

67
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:58,817
One resident murdered another.

68
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,817
Nothing like this
has happened before.

69
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,858
The price of our apartment
is falling each day.

70
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:07,558
I'm scared to think
just how far it'll drop.

71
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,898
How could you worry
about house prices?

72
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:13,898
I'm so scared I can't
even go pee at night.

73
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:17,608
How could Oh Yoon
Hee kill Su Ryeon?

74
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:21,007
Wasn't Su Ryeon the only
person who looked out for her?

75
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:24,207
She fell for a man
and lost her mind.

76
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,517
Poor Su Ryeon lost everything.

77
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:29,618
She got well and truly betrayed.

78
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:31,817
Did you see the news?

79
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:35,288
Oh Yoon Hee decorated her
place like the penthouse.

80
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:38,058
Not to mention that she lusted
after someone else's husband.

81
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,728
When I saw how she'd photoshopped
her face into their family portrait,

82
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,428
I got the shivers.

83
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,767
That must be why she started
working for Chairman Joo.

84
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:46,928
It's so freaky.

85
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:48,868
But still,

86
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:53,007
it's not exactly bad for us.

87
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:56,778
With this happening, the reopening
of Min Seol A's murder case...

88
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:58,308
will no longer happen.

89
00:04:58,707 --> 00:04:59,908
- Really?
- Really?

90
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:03,348
How can the police investigate
when Shim Su Ryeon's dead?

91
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:06,048
The victim's gone and now
the victim's mom is dead too.

92
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:09,988
We should thank Oh Yoon Hee.

93
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,457
It looks like all the people...

94
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,928
I couldn't stand got
dealt with at once.

95
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:16,627
Shim Su Ryeon, Oh Yoon Hee,

96
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,228
and Ro Na too.

97
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,868
Try not to show too
much of your joy.

98
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:26,267
Think of the time
we spent together.

99
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:31,978
If you think about it, we
aren't completely unlucky.

100
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,048
Don't you think, Attorney Lee?

101
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,718
If we were unlucky,

102
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,687
we wouldn't have been able
to live in Hera Palace.

103
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:40,918
The skies...

104
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:44,887
will eventually
side with the rich.

105
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:47,228
The tax we pay...

106
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,298
makes the world go round.

107
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,098
Oh, dear...

108
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,137
- Oh, dear... Poor Su Ryeon...
- Darling.

109
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:05,077
Oh, dear...

110
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,548
I'm proud of you for
getting through the funeral.

111
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:15,658
Stay here for a while until
I get the penthouse sorted.

112
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,158
Ms. Yang will bring
the things you need.

113
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:23,358
Get some rest.

114
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,168
What will happen now?

115
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:30,767
What do you mean?

116
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,968
Will we go back
to the penthouse?

117
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:35,908
I'll clean it up so it
looks like nothing happened.

118
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,278
You don't have to worry.

119
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:42,118
Nothing changes.

120
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,978
Mom died in there.

121
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:45,747
How can nothing change?

122
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,517
Are you really completely fine?

123
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,428
If you're too distressed,
take time from school...

124
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,228
and study abroad for a year.

125
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:00,728
Think about it.

126
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:11,678
It's always like this.

127
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:16,278
No one really worries about us.

128
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,618
Mom said she'd protect
us, but she died.

129
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,558
They're all liars.

130
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:26,687
It's so annoying. I hate it.

131
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:32,798
Let's not go back...

132
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:35,267
to that place.

133
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:38,337
CHEONG A MEDICAL CENTER,
SERVING PATIENTS FOR 30 YEARS

134
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:40,067
What do you mean?

135
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:42,577
Your medical malpractice
suit from a few months ago...

136
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:44,978
resurfaced recently.

137
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,077
We sorted that out.

138
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,418
The patient's aftereffects
have worsened,

139
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:51,618
and he voiced his
determination to sue us.

140
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:54,988
Plus, I heard you were
questioned by the police...

141
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:57,087
regarding the child who
died at Hera Palace.

142
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,387
Why didn't you mention that?

143
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:02,528
Dozens of posts a day
are covering our website,

144
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,598
all demanding an explanation.

145
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,168
What is it you want?

146
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:12,837
Don't you get it?

147
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,577
They want you to step
down as hospital director.

148
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,007
I think a hospital director...

149
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,178
should have that much sense
of duty for his establishment.

150
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,017
Is it you?

151
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,618
Did you make an issue of
this old malpractice suit?

152
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:28,687
Your license will be
suspended for a year or two.

153
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,558
I contacted Johns Hopkins
University in America.

154
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,788
How about you study
there for a while?

155
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,898
Aren't medical mistakes
and malpractice issues...

156
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:39,168
all caused by a
doctor's lack of skill?

157
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:44,737
I nominated a new
director already.

158
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,778
Take care of the protocol
so he can take over quickly.

159
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,138
Yes, Director.

160
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:00,447
You kicked me out
of the hospital...

161
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:05,087
and took everything from me.

162
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,697
Is this the ending you wanted?

163
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:15,937
I'm only returning
everything to how they were.

164
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,138
The hospital and the foundation.

165
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:19,967
And Eun Byeol.

166
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:23,337
The director title
doesn't suit you.

167
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,748
CHEONG A MEDICAL CENTER

168
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,947
You shouldn't have
been so greedy.

169
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:35,357
Now, there's nothing...

170
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,888
you can take or keep.

171
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:55,378
How do you feel?

172
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:00,048
I got a cake from your
favorite dessert place.

173
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,077
Will you have some?

174
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,158
Will you really not talk to me?

175
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:13,957
Fine.

176
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:17,097
I guess you'll speak first
when you get too frustrated.

177
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:23,697
Eat it when you're hungry. I
especially ordered chocolate.

178
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,187
Gosh.

179
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:23,097
Who killed Su Ryeon?

180
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,227
You look a mess.

181
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,998
I told the boys
to treat you well.

182
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:32,008
I'm sorry this isn't
exactly a hotel.

183
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,408
Who killed Su Ryeon?

184
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,347
Even a great billionaire
looks just as haggard...

185
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,817
when he's starved
for a few days.

186
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:45,117
So what if you have
buildings in New York?

187
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:46,847
You don't even have a
hamburger to eat right now.

188
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:49,587
Am I wrong? Answer me, Logan.

189
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,587
No, wait, sorry.

190
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,028
Kang Ho Dong, no,
Gu Ho Dong, was it?

191
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,798
You scumbag.

192
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:05,737
How dare you con me?

193
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:08,778
How could you dare try to take
the Myeongdong plot from me?

194
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,278
Thanks to you,

195
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:16,178
I got photographed going in and
out of the Prosecutors' Office,

196
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,788
my personal details got out,

197
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,388
and I almost had to
serve time in prison.

198
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,587
Why is that my fault?

199
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,187
That's on you for
living the way you did.

200
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,717
I don't intend to kill you.

201
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,347
I won't maim you either.

202
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,918
I'm letting you live
for one reason only.

203
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,658
I just talked to your
father James Lee.

204
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:04,197
What did you do, you psycho?

205
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:07,567
I bargained with him.

206
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,168
With Min Seol A's case.

207
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:14,508
I can't believe that
brat helped me out again.

208
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:15,878
Shut your mouth!

209
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,648
To save the life
of his sick son,

210
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:21,748
your father did some
very emotional stuff.

211
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:24,278
He adopted Min Seol
A from an orphanage,

212
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,918
made her donate her bone-marrow,

213
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:28,117
reversed her adoption
and left her penniless,

214
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:31,528
and even framed her for theft
and had her deported to Korea.

215
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,187
I also have...

216
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:37,298
details of his transactions
with Congressman Cho Sang Heon.

217
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,937
They all came into
my possession.

218
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:47,138
What'll happen to your father...

219
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:50,707
if this huge secret comes out?

220
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:53,508
Hey.

221
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:56,217
Are you ready to send
your father to prison?

222
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,918
Kill me instead.

223
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,388
No, no, no way.

224
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,788
I said I didn't
want to kill you.

225
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:04,857
You don't seem to know,

226
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:08,227
but you are worth so much.

227
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,827
In return for getting you back
in one piece, your father...

228
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:14,197
sent me quite a lot of money.

229
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:18,538
Oh, of course, he also returned
the whole Myeongdong plot.

230
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,607
Everyone keeps dying.

231
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,918
Min Seol A and Shim Su Ryeon.

232
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:33,048
Then adios, amigo.

233
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:35,987
You scumbag!

234
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:38,587
Who killed Su Ryeon?

235
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,628
You did, didn't you?

236
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:44,227
I swear with my
life, Joo Dan Tae,

237
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:46,197
I will kill you!

238
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,867
Joo Dan Tae, you jerk.

239
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,008
Stay right where you are! Hey!

240
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:17,898
It's been a while since
we spent time alone.

241
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,867
Whose fault do you
think that was?

242
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:23,437
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:27,768
But still, though it took a
detour, we're back together.

244
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,308
Isn't that what counts?

245
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,847
Now I know for sure...

246
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:36,178
that you are my most
perfect partner.

247
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:38,347
How about a toast?

248
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:45,928
I love you.

249
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,477
Oh Yoon Hee!

250
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:08,347
Explain why you're
here with him.

251
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,717
Tell me! What were
you doing with him?

252
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:13,087
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

253
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:16,518
What's your
relationship with him?

254
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:20,087
Did you sleep with him? Did you?

255
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:21,628
Did you sleep with him?

256
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:25,028
Tell me yourself. Tell me now!

257
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:26,697
Take your hands off my woman!

258
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,668
What?

259
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,437
How could you do
this to me? How?

260
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:36,678
Stop it!

261
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,278
I'm sick and tired of you.

262
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,748
Go and protect your
foundation instead.

263
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,178
Stop being so clingy!

264
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,258
Joo Dan Tae. You scum!

265
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:58,928
Stop!

266
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:13,677
Get some rest.

267
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:22,258
Keep a close eye on Oh Yoon Hee.

268
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:27,788
How dare you come here?

269
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:35,597
Is the great Cheon
Seo Jin doubting me?

270
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,837
Do I look like someone...

271
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,407
who'd fall for a
woman like that?

272
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,778
What does that mean?

273
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:45,778
I was planning on
using Yoon Hee.

274
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:49,577
Where can I find such
a great prey like her?

275
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:51,748
Tell me what you're planning.

276
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,288
I must give back to Su Ryeon
exactly what she did to me.

277
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,758
That will clean everything up.

278
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,528
My company, your foundation,
and Min Seol A's case...

279
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:02,998
will all go back to
where it belongs.

280
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:09,198
Are you saying you'll
get rid of Su Ryeon?

281
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,407
What about Yoon Hee?

282
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,577
I was going to ditch her
once I was done anyway.

283
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:20,177
If we play her just right,
she'll do exactly what we want.

284
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:24,448
Isn't she the perfect
way to get to Su Ryeon?

285
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:29,518
Is that why you needed Yoon Hee?

286
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:38,327
You still have it, Joo Dan Tae.

287
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:41,938
How can I help?

288
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,768
I need funds right now.

289
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,177
My accounts are frozen because
of Logan and I'm stuck.

290
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:04,657
Hello, Congressman.

291
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:07,688
Chairman Joo, you know
how things are right now.

292
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,538
It's dangerous to
meet like this.

293
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,677
I can't cover this one up.

294
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,377
I can't let you go
out on a limb...

295
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:28,077
and end up losing your
hard-earned seat in congress.

296
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,847
I'll take that to
mean you understand.

297
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:33,347
Until now,

298
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:38,427
this is how I've been
supporting you and your works.

299
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,498
It adds up to a hefty sum.

300
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,637
Would you mind if I sent that
to the Prosecutor General?

301
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:56,877
Chairman Joo, what
are you doing?

302
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,188
I'm Cheon Seo Jin, Director
of Cheong A Foundation.

303
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,998
How about you gain
some new connections...

304
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,298
and climb higher up?

305
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,837
I will help as best I can.

306
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:27,407
It's up to you.

307
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,407
I never go down alone.

308
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,177
If I live,

309
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:35,218
you will live as well.

310
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:57,738
The J King Holdings
case you're on,

311
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:59,468
and the Cheong A
Foundation corruption case.

312
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:02,983
Come up with a story to
close them right now.

313
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,258
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

314
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:23,397
You have until today
to turn yourself in.

315
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,397
Hurry up and go to the
police station now.

316
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:30,298
If you refuse to cooperate,

317
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,968
Ro Na will end up...

318
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:34,978
just like Seol A.

319
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,218
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

320
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,470
Secretary Cho. What
are you doing here?

321
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,695
Chairman Joo wants you at
the penthouse immediately.

322
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:58,498
He says it's important.

323
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:09,008
Ms. Yang, you're finally
making yourself worthwhile.

324
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,639
You gave me...

325
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:15,879
a great idea.

326
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:18,879
I'll take this and...

327
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:22,218
It's beautiful.

328
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:26,418
Now we just need Su Ryeon.

329
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,599
Go on. Call her.

330
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:33,998
If you say the
kids are in danger,

331
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,468
she'll rush right over.

332
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:37,898
Yes, sir.

333
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,208
Ms. Yang, what's the matter?

334
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:53,248
Ms. Shim, the chairman took
the kids to his study again!

335
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,908
She just got here.

336
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,109
She'll be up soon.

337
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,718
Seok Hoon! Seok Kyung!

338
00:23:57,578 --> 00:23:59,018
How could you...

339
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:03,748
You're the one who
caused this whole mess.

340
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,009
What a pity.

341
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:34,408
Your revenge will end
with your own death.

342
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:38,919
Still, you'll be able to meet...

343
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:42,419
your dead daughter whom
you missed so dearly.

344
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:44,088
Are you happy?

345
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,058
Chairman Joo, I'm here.

346
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,269
Chairman Joo?

347
00:24:58,308 --> 00:24:59,308
Goodbye.

348
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:15,088
Chairman Joo, are you in here?

349
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:29,598
Su Ryeon?

350
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:45,848
Su Ryeon.

351
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:50,259
Su Ryeon...

352
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:56,828
Su Ryeon, are you
okay? Su Ryeon.

353
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:02,068
What? I can't hear you.

354
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:08,908
Su Ryeon.

355
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,548
Su Ryeon?

356
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,378
Su Ryeon, get up. Don't die.

357
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:16,919
You can't die! No!

358
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:20,318
Su Ryeon, no! You can't die.

359
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:22,219
You can't die...

360
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:12,469
Did you do it?

361
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:13,969
You killed my wife?

362
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:16,378
How could you such
a horrible thing?

363
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:19,108
Take her away now!

364
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,519
Did you ever have
feelings for Oh Yoon Hee?

365
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:26,588
Not even once?

366
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,858
I swear I never felt anything.

367
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,959
If you're nice to poor people,

368
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,658
they tend to be so gullible.

369
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,828
Why would I fall for a
petty wench like her?

370
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:45,209
Thanks to that,

371
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,709
we were able to
protect what was ours.

372
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,279
But why did Oh Yoon Hee...

373
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:55,779
admit that she killed her?

374
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:58,919
The proof was so certain, so
she probably just gave up.

375
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,489
But I'm certain
there's something...

376
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:06,558
between Shim Su Ryeon
and Oh Yoon Hee.

377
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,898
It seemed like Oh Yoon Hee
did something very wrong.

378
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,328
Something that could
never be forgiven.

379
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,739
Something wrong?
What could that be?

380
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:19,739
I'm not sure.

381
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,878
Anyhow, it's a
good thing for us.

382
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,878
Oh Yoon Hee will be sent to
the prosecution tomorrow.

383
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,578
I heard a public defender
will take the case.

384
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:35,588
Then there will be no problem
in finding her guilty.

385
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,328
All of this will finally end.

386
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:50,539
You are such...

387
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:54,239
a terrifying man.

388
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,239
That's why I'm so
attracted to you.

389
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:58,779
Hearing you say that...

390
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,618
arouses me already.

391
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:05,719
But you didn't kill
her yourself, did you?

392
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:08,558
I heard the scene
was quite gruesome.

393
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,388
No way, me?

394
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:15,229
How could I do
such a cruel thing?

395
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,298
You know that I can't
even squash an ant.

396
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:21,838
I took care of it neatly,
so you don't have to worry.

397
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:25,408
I'm still curious
about something.

398
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,479
Who killed Min Seol A?

399
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:31,479
Who cares?

400
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:35,919
What's important is that we got
rid of the thorns on our sides.

401
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:39,749
We got rid of Min Seol
A as well as her mom.

402
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:41,658
Bye, bye.

403
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,058
Bye, bye.

404
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,289
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

405
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,538
Mister.

406
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:04,879
Are you still here?

407
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,248
There's no use staying here.

408
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,548
Please let me see my mom.

409
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:12,389
Something is not right.

410
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,718
There's no way my mom
would've done that.

411
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,189
I know her the best.

412
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:20,028
Do you know how much
she liked Ms. Shim?

413
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,228
This makes no sense.

414
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:25,298
Let me talk to her.

415
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,998
Can you please let me see her?

416
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:31,198
Your mom said no.

417
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:34,639
I asked several times, but
she said no. What can we do?

418
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:38,778
She said you can go stay
at your grandma's house.

419
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:42,448
I won't go.

420
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,248
I won't go anywhere...

421
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,548
until I see my mom.

422
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,698
I'm your public defender.

423
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:03,369
We found several items
in your house proving...

424
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,869
that you stalked Joo Dan Tae.

425
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:07,639
You sneaked into the
penthouse numerous times...

426
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,639
and stole Shim Su
Ryeon's things...

427
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:11,179
and even wore her clothes.

428
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,609
You pretending to be Shim
Su Ryeon is all on tape.

429
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:17,179
You will be transferred
to a detention center...

430
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,248
as soon as your warrant
is issued tomorrow.

431
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:22,389
I never asked for a lawyer.

432
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:26,258
Well, I know you have
no chance to win,

433
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,698
but you should show regret...

434
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,359
for your daughter's
sake at least.

435
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,228
That's how your sentence
will be reduced.

436
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:38,409
I heard your daughter
has been staying...

437
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:39,839
at the police station for days.

438
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,439
Are you really not
going to meet her?

439
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,149
No, I won't.

440
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,448
Just tell her to go home.

441
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:53,849
I admit to all my charges.

442
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:56,558
Just...

443
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,988
Wrap this up as
soon as possible.

444
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:02,298
She's coming out.

445
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,099
Did you really kill her?

446
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:06,329
Why did you kill her? Was
it because of your affair?

447
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,929
Why did you kill
her so brutally?

448
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,538
Why did you stab
her several times?

449
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,069
Is your motive because of
your hate toward rich people?

450
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:14,139
When did you start
envying the victim?

451
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,308
Did you envy her or hate her?

452
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,808
- Say something.
- Don't you even feel sorry?

453
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,308
Mom, it's all not true.

454
00:32:21,478 --> 00:32:22,849
I know you didn't do it.

455
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:26,089
Please tell them it isn't
true! Tell them now!

456
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:27,389
Tell them now!

457
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,819
Mom. Mom...

458
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:32,228
Mom, look at me.

459
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:35,159
Mom, please look at me.

460
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,369
Mom, look at me just once.

461
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:42,238
Mom. Mom...

462
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,439
Mom... Mom!

463
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,778
Mom!

464
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:24,508
IT'S YOUR FAULT! MURDERER!

465
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:27,708
PSYCHOPATH

466
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,048
THE UNDERWORLD, GO
BACK TO BOSUK VILLAGE!

467
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,248
LEAVE, YOU PSYCHOPATH! A
MURDERER FULL OF INFERIORITY!

468
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:32,689
OH YOON HEE IS EVIL! A
DISGRACE TO HERA PALACE!

469
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:33,748
A MURDERER LIVES HERE.

470
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,429
OUR HOUSE PRICE IS
DROPPING. GET OUT OF HERE.

471
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:50,998
When are you going
to give me that?

472
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:55,808
It's nothing expensive.

473
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,308
I like it.

474
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,159
Hey.

475
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:13,558
Where have you been?

476
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,558
This place was a total mess.

477
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,129
I almost lost my mind
from all the noise.

478
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:20,529
I thought you ran
away or something.

479
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:21,699
What do you want?

480
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,939
Do you want to call me the
daughter of a murderer too?

481
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,908
Do it. Swear at me all you want.

482
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:30,178
I'm right here, so
say what you want.

483
00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:32,408
Did you...

484
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:34,949
eat?

485
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:36,719
What?

486
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:38,719
Eat this.

487
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:40,118
You can't cry on
an empty stomach.

488
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:43,219
Just stay quiet and
pretend you're not home.

489
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:45,158
You don't know when
people will come back.

490
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:49,759
MURDERER

491
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:52,129
A MURDERER FULL OF
INFERIORITY! A DEVIL

492
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:22,558
Mom, what do I do?

493
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:26,098
What do I do now?

494
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,445
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

495
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:49,442
6 MONTHS LATER

496
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:53,522
Thanks to all your help,
I think I'll be acquitted.

497
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:56,822
How can I possibly repay you?

498
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:58,752
I told you...

499
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:01,561
that I'd help you
when you needed me.

500
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:04,462
This is nothing.

501
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,932
I will stay loyal to
you and your friends...

502
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,661
for the rest of my life.

503
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:16,242
And you know what
they said on the news?

504
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:18,471
That's all fake.

505
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:22,242
That dead woman made that all up
to receive settlement money...

506
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,812
for their divorce.

507
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:25,011
What?

508
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:27,282
What was the name of
her illness again?

509
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:28,882
Delusional disorder.

510
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,291
She blabbered about a daughter
that didn't even exist.

511
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:35,992
I can't believe that
kind of illness existed.

512
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:38,791
- Really?
- Yes.

513
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,431
Chairman Joo of J King Holdings,

514
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:46,002
who was charged for embezzlement
and investment fraud was freed...

515
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:47,642
without charges.

516
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:51,512
The police found out how the victim
of the Hera Palace Murder Case,

517
00:36:51,672 --> 00:36:54,982
Shim, fabricated the
documents meticulously...

518
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,952
to take advantage of her
divorce with Chairman Joo.

519
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:02,152
The victim, Shim, suffered
from an illness...

520
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,521
known as a delusional
disorder...

521
00:37:06,422 --> 00:37:09,691
Mom, can I stop now?

522
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:11,762
My arms are about to fall out.

523
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:16,062
Mother, please forgive us now.

524
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:18,502
We were all cleared
of our charges.

525
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:21,301
Do you know how much money
I spent to make that happen?

526
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,241
I hired 10 lawyers.

527
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,142
You even tainted your
father's reputation.

528
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,612
We'll never do that again.
Please forgive us now.

529
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:35,152
Mi Ja, don't you
think this is enough?

530
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,721
My son.

531
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:43,491
Don't ever get involved in
such a nasty mess again.

532
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:48,401
Your father is thinking of
making you into a politician.

533
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:51,001
A politician? Me?

534
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:54,741
It's about time a politician
is born in our family.

535
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:59,072
So you must be super careful
not to get caught up...

536
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:01,482
in any kind of scandal. Got it?

537
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:03,452
You too.

538
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:05,412
Yes, Mother.

539
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:08,751
A congressman?

540
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,021
That sounds awesome.

541
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:24,572
I know how hard it was being
investigated by the prosecution.

542
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:28,572
It's all thanks to you, who
helped uncover the truth.

543
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:31,942
Our alumni held demonstrations
to set you free.

544
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:35,311
Individuals in the music
industry have also released...

545
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:37,551
many interviews on media,
saying they stood by your side.

546
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,412
That's no surprise.

547
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,751
I believe you were repaid
for your kind deeds...

548
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:46,322
and secret donations that
contributed to our society.

549
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:47,961
I, Ma Doo Ki, truly believe so.

550
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,331
I'm happy to see that I've
led a meaningful life.

551
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:56,501
Cheong A's irregularities
won't be mentioned anymore.

552
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,572
Let's start fresh...

553
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:03,241
and I hope you devote yourselves
for Cheong A Foundation.

554
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:05,311
Of course, ma'am.

555
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,551
By the way, how is Eun Byeol?

556
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,081
She just returned from a trip.

557
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:16,621
She'll come back...

558
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,151
to school next week.

559
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,831
Since you've been discharged,
you'll have to go to school.

560
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:35,602
The doctor said you're fine, so
you'll have no problem studying.

561
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,572
I'll reserve special
lessons so you can catch up.

562
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,081
You'll get busy from now on.

563
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,311
Ha Eun Byeol.

564
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,982
How long will you say nothing?

565
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,051
I'm losing my patience.

566
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,561
What do you want?

567
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,462
Do you want to quit
school and singing?

568
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:00,301
Is it okay if you
don't go to college?

569
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:16,342
Yes, honey.

570
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,121
What? A party?

571
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:22,782
Everything has been
sorted out neatly.

572
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:25,092
It has been concluded that
Oh Yoon Hee and Logan Lee...

573
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,522
conspired to commit
embezzlement.

574
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,462
Since everything is over now,

575
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:30,962
I'm thinking of holding a party
with the people of Hera Club.

576
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:32,832
It's been rough for all of us.

577
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,662
That sounds good. Okay.

578
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,332
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

579
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:43,842
What...

580
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:47,482
Go to your room and rest.

581
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:50,982
Mom.

582
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,621
Eun Byeol.

583
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,761
Did you just call me?

584
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,832
Finally, you've
come to your senses!

585
00:41:03,832 --> 00:41:06,761
I knew you'd overcome it.

586
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:08,962
Is there anything
else you want to say?

587
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:11,201
Is there something you want
to eat? I'll cook it for you.

588
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,931
Why aren't you asking me?

589
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:15,571
Why I took those drugs?

590
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:17,912
Let's just...

591
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:21,342
forget about that.

592
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,811
You can start over again.

593
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,181
Nothing ever happened to you.

594
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:30,092
But that won't make
the past disappear.

595
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:32,621
If you live in the past, you
won't be able to do anything.

596
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:34,691
It's the most foolish
thing you can ever do.

597
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:36,991
Then are you okay
about your past?

598
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:39,462
I'm talking about
grandpa's death.

599
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:43,232
What?

600
00:41:45,131 --> 00:41:47,902
You're no longer my daughter!

601
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:50,672
No! Cheong A is mine!

602
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:52,641
- You can't take it away from me!
- Let go!

603
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:54,412
Let go!

604
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:57,212
I said, let go! Let go!

605
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,181
Dad!

606
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,362
If I called an
ambulance that day,

607
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:18,772
he wouldn't have passed away.

608
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:21,941
I feel so bad now
that I think about it.

609
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:24,612
Back then, I only stayed
quiet to protect you.

610
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:29,282
Why are you suddenly
asking about your grandpa?

611
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:34,422
I took those pills because
I missed him so much.

612
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,282
What do you mean?

613
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:40,462
What do you mean? Tell
me so I can understand!

614
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:47,332
See? You're not over it either.

615
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:50,332
You also miss
grandpa, don't you?

616
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,001
I'm hungry.

617
00:42:57,772 --> 00:43:00,741
I want to eat pasta
with tons of garlic.

618
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:02,342
You'll cook it for me, right?

619
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:21,001
Thank you for helping me.

620
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,071
You should move
to a better place.

621
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:31,441
I didn't expect you to pay me.

622
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:33,011
Take it.

623
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:36,082
You've become an important
person to me now.

624
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,761
100,000 DOLLARS

625
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:13,881
Gosh, you really need to stop
putting your books in upside down.

626
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:15,621
What will you do without me?

627
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:18,822
What's there to worry about? You
can organize them for me every day.

628
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:24,891
My goodness, did you twirl
your hair while studying again?

629
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:27,302
I can't stop myself
from twirling my hair...

630
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:29,161
when I study.

631
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:32,102
Should I just cut my hair?

632
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:33,802
Why would you cut your hair?

633
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:37,011
Do you know how much I
enjoy tying your hair?

634
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,942
How is your hair so silky?

635
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:41,241
Because I take after you.

636
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,852
I'm late. Tie my hair for me.

637
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:47,421
Drink your juice.
I'll do it quickly.

638
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:51,692
It's good.

639
00:44:52,352 --> 00:44:53,421
Is it?

640
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:57,531
Drink it all. I added tons
of healthy ingredients.

641
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:07,302
This is all useless.

642
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,442
Just forget it!

643
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:12,411
Seok Kyung, what's wrong
with you? Calm down!

644
00:45:12,641 --> 00:45:14,712
- Let me go. Let me go!
- Seok Kyung.

645
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,112
I said let me go!

646
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:18,381
Calm down. What's the matter?

647
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:22,052
I hate her. I hate her so much.

648
00:45:25,491 --> 00:45:26,491
Seok Kyung.

649
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:28,592
Seok Kyung, calm down!

650
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,891
I won't ever forgive
her for leaving me.

651
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,062
It's okay. Calm down.

652
00:45:36,562 --> 00:45:37,932
Calm down.

653
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:45,312
I hate her. I hate her.

654
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,612
It's okay.

655
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,612
Mom!

656
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,121
Mom.

657
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,092
It's okay.

658
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,791
Mom!

659
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:03,661
It's okay.

660
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:43,062
See?

661
00:46:43,932 --> 00:46:45,901
You're not over it either.

662
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,802
You also miss
grandpa, don't you?

663
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,041
Does Eun Byeol...

664
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:55,682
know something?

665
00:46:56,682 --> 00:46:57,751
No way.

666
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:00,281
It's not possible.

667
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:01,842
I heard Dr. Ha...

668
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:05,312
is going to resign and go
to the States. Is that true?

669
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:09,082
He wants to study more, so
there's no reason to stop him.

670
00:48:09,182 --> 00:48:12,151
From what I heard, he got
kicked out by Seo Jin.

671
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,291
Honey, are you drunk?

672
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,761
- Did I say it out loud?
- Yes.

673
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:20,631
I heard Seok Hoon and Seok
Kyung will be studying abroad.

674
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:23,302
The kids wanted to go, so
they'll be gone for about a year.

675
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:25,371
Gosh, you're lying.

676
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,501
You just want the kids gone so
you guys can move in together.

677
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:32,911
You guys must be excited.

678
00:48:33,212 --> 00:48:35,482
Now that both of you
got rid of your spouses,

679
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:36,582
there's nothing stopping you.

680
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:41,322
Oh, right. Today is the day.

681
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:43,952
Oh Yoon Hee's being
sentenced today.

682
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:46,692
Oh, you're right.

683
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:48,192
I totally forgot.

684
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,491
Are you sure you forgot?

685
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:51,631
I thought you purposely
held the party today...

686
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:55,432
to celebrate the war that
broke out in Hera Palace.

687
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,432
What do you mean "celebrate"?
People might get the wrong idea.

688
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:02,501
I'm just kidding. It was a joke.

689
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,572
What do you think the
court will decide?

690
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,982
I bet she'll get a long sentence
considering what she did.

691
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:11,552
She obviously has no hope.

692
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:13,651
She already admitted
to the murder,

693
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:15,952
so the trial is just
going to be a formality.

694
00:49:16,151 --> 00:49:17,552
You never know.

695
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:21,421
You can never predict
how a trial will end.

696
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,602
I'm Kim Jung Min, a
reporter from SBC.

697
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:38,171
I'd like to talk to Ms. Oh.

698
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:40,041
She needs to go to court,
so she has no time.

699
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:43,881
And as you can see, she
doesn't seem interested.

700
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:49,781
Su Ryeon asked me for a favor.

701
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:01,161
I'll give you
exactly five minutes.

702
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:09,202
It wasn't easy for
me to come meet you.

703
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:13,982
How could you kill
her like that?

704
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,212
Just tell me why you're here.

705
00:50:18,112 --> 00:50:21,281
What did Su Ryeon ask you to do?

706
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:28,491
PETITION

707
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:29,661
What's this?

708
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,232
It's a petition.

709
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,102
Please give it to Oh Yoon Hee.

710
00:50:34,862 --> 00:50:37,572
"Oh Yoon Hee"? Who's that?

711
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,332
A good friend of mine.

712
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,241
She's going to surrender
to the police tomorrow.

713
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:48,312
And once she does, she'll
get punished by the law.

714
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:54,182
But I feel like she
might need this.

715
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:57,322
Then why don't you give
it to her yourself?

716
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,421
I'm worried I might
change my mind.

717
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,491
PETITION

718
00:51:03,491 --> 00:51:04,732
Petition.

719
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:07,602
The Oh Yoon Hee I know...

720
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,732
is a very warm-hearted
and just person.

721
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:14,641
I hope Yoon Hee...

722
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:18,472
will safely go home and
return to her daughter.

723
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,011
I hope she gets the chance...

724
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:24,511
to build happy memories
with her daughter,

725
00:51:25,812 --> 00:51:28,921
which is something I never
got to do with Seol A.

726
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:32,991
And thus, I earnestly ask for
you to be lenient with her.

727
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:36,822
From Min Seol A's
mother, Shim Su Ryeon.

728
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,161
Whatever it was that you did,

729
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,572
how could you kill someone who
was this worried about you?

730
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:49,442
I'm here because I promised
Su Ryeon to do this,

731
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,972
but it gives me the creeps
to be sitting here with you.

732
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,041
How could you kill her
just to take her place?

733
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,342
I heard she was nice to you.

734
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,621
Did you think you'd be able
to take over the penthouse...

735
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:03,222
and have Joo Dan Tae
once you killed her?

736
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:25,312
COURT

737
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:38,722
Mom.

738
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,032
DEFENDANT

739
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:51,171
Defendant, Oh Yoon Hee,

740
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:53,832
yearned to have the life
that the victim had...

741
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,371
and confessed that she hated her so
much that she wanted to kill her.

742
00:52:57,711 --> 00:52:59,971
Also, there's a footage
of the defendant...

743
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:03,812
secretly entering the penthouse
and trying on the victim's dress.

744
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:07,411
Attorney, is there
anything you'd like to say?

745
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:12,052
The defendant already admitted
to everything as she testified.

746
00:53:13,252 --> 00:53:15,522
However, please take
into consideration...

747
00:53:15,522 --> 00:53:17,891
that she suffered for
a very long time...

748
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,401
due to financial instability
and had to raise a daughter...

749
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,832
all on her own.

750
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,072
This is so fun!

751
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:48,262
Here's the verdict.

752
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:52,762
Defendant, Oh Yoon Hee, was
jealous of the victim...

753
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,661
who trusted and helped her...

754
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:57,971
and brutally killed her by
stabbing her many times.

755
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,602
And due to the brutality of
the crime, her ill intention,

756
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:04,441
and the shock she gave
to the victim's family,

757
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:06,312
we cannot help but give
her a severe punishment.

758
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:09,842
The justice department
believes she deserves to be...

759
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:13,252
isolated from our society for
the horrible crime she committed.

760
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:16,782
Thus, we sentence her
to life imprisonment.

761
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:36,383
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

762
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:39,842
Secretary Cho. What
are you doing here?

763
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:42,012
Chairman Joo wants you at
the penthouse immediately.

764
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:44,911
Chairman Joo.

765
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,292
Chairman Joo, are you in here?

766
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:07,471
Su Ryeon?

767
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:29,822
Su Ryeon...

768
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:35,502
Su Ryeon, stay with me.

769
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:37,502
Su Ryeon!

770
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,201
Wait. I'll call an ambulance.

771
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:43,441
Wait a little bit.

772
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:45,742
Su Ryeon.

773
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,812
What? I can't hear you.

774
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:55,451
Run away.

775
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,921
Run... Run away.

776
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:00,292
Su Ryeon.

777
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:13,971
I didn't kill...

778
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,171
Su Ryeon.

779
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:20,941
Mom.

780
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:24,141
What did you just say, Ms. Oh?

781
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:26,852
I didn't kill...

782
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:30,921
Shim Su Ryeon, Your Honor.

783
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:36,492
I didn't kill her.

784
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:38,862
I swear on my daughter's name.

785
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:41,401
I'm not the culprit.

786
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,002
Please reinvestigate the case.

787
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:46,631
Everything was fabricated!

788
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,002
I'm not the culprit.

789
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,272
I didn't kill Shim Su Ryeon.

790
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,272
Please reinvestigate
the case, Your Honor!

791
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:55,082
I'm not the culprit!

792
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,411
Mom!

Ro Na.

794
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:00,151
Ro Na.

795
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:01,721
I didn't kill her!

796
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:04,322
I'm innocent!

797
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:08,461
It wasn't me! I didn't kill her!

798
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,092
This trial doesn't count!

799
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:12,891
This trial doesn't count!
Let me have another trial!

800
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,661
Let me have another trial!

801
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:17,901
No! I didn't kill her!

802
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,272
It wasn't me!

803
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:20,971
I didn't kill her!

804
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:23,502
- It wasn't me!
- Get going already!

805
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:26,772
No, please! I didn't do it!

00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:29,131
What's going on?

815
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:40,941
We have breaking news. A
defendant who received...

816
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:42,812
a life sentence
in court today...

817
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:46,352
escaped after the van got into an
accident and flipped upside down.

818
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:48,352
The defendant who ran away...

819
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:50,022
was the assailant of
the murder incident...

820
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:51,151
that occurred in Hera Palace.

821
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,022
- She stood trial for six months.
- Ro Na.

822
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,121
But today, she suddenly
denied all charges...

823
00:59:55,322 --> 00:59:57,691
and threw a scene in court.

824
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:00,931
The police are searching
the nearby areas...

825
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,532
- Ro Na.
- and checking the CCTVs...

826
01:00:05,832 --> 01:00:06,901
Where are you going?

827
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:11,542
Logan, I need to meet Ro Na.

828
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:13,211
Please tell her I'm alive.

829
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:15,141
The cops are already
at your house.

830
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:20,012
If you want to get
caught, you can go ahead.

831
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:24,121
No. My Ro Na... What
about my daughter?

832
01:00:28,862 --> 01:00:31,062
How could you be audacious enough
to worry about your daughter...

833
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:34,492
even after killing two people?

834
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:37,971
You really...

835
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,131
give me the creeps.

836
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:44,201
What do you mean I
killed two people?

837
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:46,512
You must've thought you'd be
able to forget about it...

838
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:49,612
now that the one and
only witness is dead.

839
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:52,181
But unfortunately,

840
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:56,082
Su Ryeon told me
everything before she died.

841
01:00:57,282 --> 01:01:00,492
She told me you killed
my little sister.

842
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,292
"Little sister"?

843
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:04,992
Your little sister?

844
01:01:05,191 --> 01:01:07,562
Yes. My little sister.

845
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,461
My little sister, Min Seol A.

846
01:01:16,302 --> 01:01:17,901
We've finally met.

847
01:01:19,812 --> 01:01:22,181
I came all the way over
to Korea to find...

848
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:24,012
the person who killed my sister.

849
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:25,911
And that person...

850
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,881
was you?

851
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:33,721
Why did you do it?

852
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:37,391
Why did you kill her?

853
01:01:38,592 --> 01:01:41,131
Why on earth did you
kill that poor girl?

854
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:47,072
Su Ryeon trusted
and waited for you.

855
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:49,971
She trusted that you'd
turn yourself in,

856
01:01:50,342 --> 01:01:52,971
and believed you until the
end even when she knew...

857
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,481
you were the one
who killed Seol A.

858
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:58,852
But how could you
backstab her like that?

859
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,852
If Su Ryeon hadn't
stopped me back then,

860
01:02:02,822 --> 01:02:05,191
I would've killed
you that instant.

861
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:08,362
Then Su Ryeon wouldn't have
died in vain like that.

862
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:11,792
No, I didn't kill Su Ryeon!

863
01:02:11,992 --> 01:02:13,191
Don't lie!

864
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:16,431
You teamed up with
Joo Dan Tae...

865
01:02:17,102 --> 01:02:18,772
and tried to get
rid of Su Ryeon.

866
01:02:19,731 --> 01:02:20,971
But you know what?

867
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,342
Su Ryeon tried to protect
you until the end...

868
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:26,441
even when she knew everything.

869
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,082
But how could you...

870
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,242
do something like that to her?

871
01:02:32,112 --> 01:02:33,352
You're not even human.

872
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:36,721
You deserve to die.

873
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:40,792
You're just a piece of trash
that doesn't deserve to live.

874
01:02:46,592 --> 01:02:48,862
What? I can't hear you.

875
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:51,161
Run away.

876
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:53,802
Run away.

877
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:58,242
You're right.

878
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:03,112
I'm responsible for
Su Ryeon's death too.

879
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:07,381
Since it's true I wanted
to get rid of her.

880
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:10,735
You're right.

881
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:14,322
Kill me. I deserve to die.

882
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:18,752
But kill me later, after I
get revenge for Su Ryeon.

883
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:22,102
I'll let you kill me
after I get revenge on...

884
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,461
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo
Jin, who killed Su Ryeon...

885
01:03:24,772 --> 01:03:26,772
with my own hands.

886
01:03:27,072 --> 01:03:28,102
I give you my word.

887
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:32,141
So for now, please let me go.

888
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,941
Please help me. Please...

889
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,211
Do you expect me...

890
01:03:38,112 --> 01:03:39,711
to believe you again?

891
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:44,221
No. You'll die here, today.

892
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,252
The police will never find you.

893
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:49,762
You'll be remembered forever
as a brutal murderer...

894
01:03:49,762 --> 01:03:51,362
and a fugitive.

895
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:53,961
Just remain in
people's memories...

896
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:57,062
as a cold-blooded mom who even
abandoned her own daughter.

897
01:03:58,572 --> 01:04:00,772
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

898
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:04,042
I didn't kill her.

899
01:04:04,342 --> 01:04:06,711
I swear I didn't kill Su Ryeon!

900
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:09,112
Joo Dan Tae framed
me for everything!

901
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:10,681
Shut your darn mouth!

902
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:13,112
I'll kill you just the same!

903
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:14,951
Just like how Su Ryeon died!

904
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:19,092
Just like how my
sister Seol A died.

905
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:23,492
A miserable and gruesome death.

906
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:37,302
Fine.

907
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,512
I won't ask you to
believe me anymore.

908
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:45,881
It's true I killed Min Seol A.

909
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:50,151
I was bound to be
punished for that.

910
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:55,062
Kill me. Kill me now!

911
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:57,391
But don't forget.

912
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,292
Even if I die,

913
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:03,161
the real culprit who
killed Su Ryeon...

914
01:05:04,461 --> 01:05:05,701
will still stay alive.

915
01:05:56,022 --> 01:05:57,022
Ro Na.

916
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:01,221
I'm sorry.

917
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:31,112
MY FRIEND

918
01:07:31,112 --> 01:07:32,112
Su Ryeon.

919
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:36,252
Since we have much to celebrate,
how about we take a picture?

920
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:39,721
Sure.

921
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:44,022
Let's see.

922
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,332
That's too lame.

923
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,171
- Ta-da.
- A polaroid?

924
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,772
You're so old-fashioned.

925
01:07:59,211 --> 01:08:00,671
I'm more of a classic type.

926
01:08:02,282 --> 01:08:05,582
Since it's our first photo together,
I want it to be meaningful.

927
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:08,312
A one and only
photo in this world.

928
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:10,421
Gosh, that sounds so corny.

929
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:13,252
This is why you shouldn't
hang out with rich people.

930
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:15,862
They live in their
own fantasy world.

931
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:20,661
My beautiful friend,
Su Ryeon. I love you!

932
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:23,832
I hope we look good.

933
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:02,272
THE PENTHOUSE

934
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:44,042
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE PENTHOUSE.

935
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:48,481
WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE
PENTHOUSE SEASON 2.

936
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:52,851
THE PENTHOUSE 2
