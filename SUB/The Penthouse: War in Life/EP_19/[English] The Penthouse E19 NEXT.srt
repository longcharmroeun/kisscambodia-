THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,947
AND BACKGROUND OF THIS
DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:13,457
EPISODE 19

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:14,657
What's going on?

5
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:15,827
- This is gasoline!
- My gosh!

6
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,557
What is this? It's gasoline!

7
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,358
It's gasoline?

8
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:26,145
- What is it? What's wrong?
- It's a bomb!

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,310
It's a bomb!

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,709
What are you doing?

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,339
Can't you see us in here?

12
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,639
Stop this madness now!

13
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,280
Hey! Why did you set this
place on fire? Are you crazy?

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,589
Why? Are you afraid
you might die?

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,790
What the?

16
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,890
Was it okay when your
kids did the same thing?

17
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,990
Your kids also set a car
on fire and ran away.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,600
What are you talking
about? We don't understand!

19
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,571
- Min Seol A.
- What?

20
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,700
What do you mean, Min Seol A?

21
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:02,941
That night... There
was a fire in the van.

22
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:04,811
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,680
Our kids lighted
candles on a cake...

24
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,380
and Min Seol A almost
burned to death.

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,391
That's a lie! That
never happened.

26
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,621
Don't make things up!

27
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:20,191
It's true. Jenny
told me that night.

28
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,361
Wait! I really
didn't know anything.

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,201
I really didn't know!

30
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:29,300
The kids probably got
afraid and ran away.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,040
It was a prank.
That's all it was!

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,341
A prank?

33
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,671
Min Seol A almost
died that night.

34
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,910
Because of your
kids who ran off,

35
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,850
leaving her alone
in a burning car.

36
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,380
And after all they did,

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,050
your kids still didn't
show any hint of remorse.

38
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,061
How could you do that?

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,531
What? You're still alive?

40
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,960
Nice. We're so lucky.

41
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,831
Why? Did something happen?

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,775
I had a nap and just woke up.

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,470
MIN SEOL A, JOO SEOK HOON,
YOO JENNY, JOO SEOK KYUNG...

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,271
Do you know what you did?

45
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:12,410
Because of you, I almost died.

46
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,311
Because of the fire you started.

47
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,450
What fire? Do you smoke?

48
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,751
You should quit,
for your own sake.

49
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,695
I thought you liked to drink,
but you're a heavy smoker too?

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,391
LAUGHING

51
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:28,831
LAUGHING

52
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,681
So what? Are you going
to do the same to us?

53
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,281
Who are you? Aren't you
Min Seol A's brother?

54
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,551
If you don't stop this immediately,
I will tear you to shreds!

55
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,051
Will you?

56
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,621
Give it a go.

57
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,221
I have no intention of
letting you all live.

58
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,830
- What?
- Please open the door!

59
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,729
- Jenny, Mom's dying!
- Save me!

60
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,301
Stop this now! Stop it!

61
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,401
Hey!

62
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,401
- Stop it!
- Save us!

63
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,070
Let us out!

64
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:16,441
- Save me, please!
- Let us out!

65
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,510
No!

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,751
Mom!

67
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,450
- Mom.
- Mom.

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,450
Please...

69
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,420
Write down what each of
you did to Min Seol A.

70
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,061
The clock's ticking!

71
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:34,390
Hey!

72
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,961
We got it!

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,600
Get out of the way.

74
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,971
What did you do to our kids?

75
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,570
If you harmed them,
I will kill you!

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,570
The kids, of course,
need time to repent too.

77
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,880
For what they did.

78
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,980
Shall we make a deal?

79
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,181
Confess everything
you did to Min Seol A.

80
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,551
Confess what happened on
the night Min Seol A died.

81
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,950
Don't leave out a single detail.

82
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,920
What do you want us to say?

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,091
Confess right now
if you want to live.

84
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,491
Don't say a word.

85
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,091
Don't fall for this!

86
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,660
You lunatic.

87
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,461
Are you saying we
should die here?

88
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,501
Get off me!

89
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,101
I'll go first!

90
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,541
I did nothing wrong at all.

91
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:22,911
I found out later that Min
Seol A was locked up...

92
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,481
in Hera Palace's
mechanical room.

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,650
Joo Dan Tae, Cheon Seo Jin,
you locked her up, didn't you?

94
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,710
Say it now!

95
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,280
You're blaming me now?

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
I did everything for our kids!

97
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,551
That's a joke. The
kids were an excuse.

98
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,260
You wanted to get the video
she had of your affair!

99
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,491
I told you to shut up!

100
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,760
Hey! Darn you!

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,161
Our lives and our kids'
lives are at stake!

102
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:47,431
And you still want
to point fingers?

103
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,630
You punk.

104
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,941
Let go of me.

105
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,400
- Come here!
- Stop it!

106
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,111
- You fools.
- What have you done?

107
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,340
- Get off me.
- Will you stop it?

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,380
Look at that! Do something!

109
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,320
You have five minutes.

110
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,820
I'll release the person who makes
the most truthful confession.

111
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,720
And their child too.

112
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,661
So, you don't care if you die?

113
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,470
Then I'll do as you wish.

114
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,830
No! No.

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,541
Me. I'll go first.

116
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,601
That night...

117
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,640
All I did was wipe the
blood off the fountain.

118
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,650
That goes for me too.

119
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,510
Jenny's mom told me
to wipe the blood,

120
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,280
and that's all I did!

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,390
Stop it! This is a trap.

122
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,320
They're putting on a
show to get evidence!

123
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,320
Hey. Keep your mouth shut.

124
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,491
You can die for this alone!

125
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:48,991
I can't die.

126
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,900
That guy, Joo Dan Tae said...

127
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,830
we should dispose of the body.

128
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,640
I honestly only followed
what Joo Dan Tae said.

129
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,111
- What a joke.
- Lee Kyu Jin, you stupid scumbag!

130
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
The bag.

131
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:05,411
You brought the golf club
bag to put her body in!

132
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,080
That golf club bag.

133
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,450
We moved that in your car!

134
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,880
- And your ex-wife, this witch.
- What?

135
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,890
She faked the girl's will!

136
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,991
- What?
- You two couples!

137
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,421
You made it look
like it was suicide!

138
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,960
Joo Dan Tae, you trashy punk.

139
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,861
You made it look like...

140
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,530
she fell from Bosuk Village!

141
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,460
- Are you crazy?
- It was all you!

142
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,070
- He said shut up!
- Get off me!

143
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,101
- Stop it!
- Let's try to get out of here!

144
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,900
It's all on you!

145
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,840
- I didn't do anything!
- I want to get out of here!

146
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:39,911
You two. If that girl
hadn't noticed your affair,

147
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,650
none of this would've happened.

148
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,851
Because of you two,
all our kids might die.

149
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,691
If something happens to
Jenny because of you,

150
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,020
I will crush you to a
pulp with my two hands.

151
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,390
Get off me.

152
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:58,101
Hey! Say that you
killed Min Seol A!

153
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,231
We might all have to die
because of what you did!

154
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,871
Why would I kill her?

155
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:05,070
Then was it you, Ms. Cheon?

156
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,301
I didn't do it!

157
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,441
Then who on earth killed her?

158
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:12,840
All our kids might die!

159
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,950
Listen.

160
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,520
Please! Please save
my daughter Jenny.

161
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,691
The one in a white dress,

162
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,791
the prettiest girl
there is my daughter.

163
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,161
If you'll spare my daughter,

164
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,890
I'll give you everything I own.

165
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,001
My home and building,

166
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,231
I'll give you everything.

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,171
Please spare my Jenny.

168
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,371
Min Hyuk. Min Hyuk, no!

169
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,840
- Min Hyuk! No!
- The truth is,

170
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,811
my mom is very sick.

171
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,351
She has two months to live.

172
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,820
Please let me live
for two more months.

173
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,161
Let me die with my mom.

174
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:58,621
Don't you lie.

175
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,691
- Please...
- How dare you say that?

176
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,231
- Darn you.
- Get off me!

177
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,830
- Let go!
- Let go!

178
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,530
- Let go of me, you jerk!
- Stop it!

179
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:07,801
What are you saying...

180
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,371
What was that?

181
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,840
- What happened?
- He blew up.

182
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,941
He blew up.

183
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,741
- Look.
- Where?

184
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,681
What's that?

185
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:26,450
Over there. Look...
There's someone there.

186
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,520
- Who?
- Who is it?

187
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,499
What?

188
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,011
Su Ryeon?

189
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:57,850
Shim Su Ryeon!

190
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:04,320
You think so much of your kids,

191
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,590
so how could you do
that to Min Seol A?

192
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,590
What does that have
to do with you?

193
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,330
Was it...

194
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,631
Was it you behind all this?

195
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,600
Shim Su Ryeon! That
woman's out of her mind.

196
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,151
Min Seol A was my daughter!

197
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,980
What?

198
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,490
The poor girl who was switched
and abandoned without my knowing.

199
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,960
She never got to hold my hand,

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,131
or call me "Mom" before
she died before her time!

201
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,970
The Min Seol A...

202
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,041
that you looked down on
and trampled all over...

203
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:56,740
was my daughter.

204
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,881
- How come...
- I knew it!

205
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,921
Hey, what did you
do to Eun Byeol?

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,881
Quit this stupid
joke immediately!

207
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,691
Su Ryeon.

208
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,590
Let's calm down first.

209
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:14,230
Let's all take a deep breath.

210
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,161
You won't really kill
all of us here, will you?

211
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:23,230
I will represent everyone
here and apologize to you.

212
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,840
- I'm sorry!
- Su Ryeon.

213
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,411
- Hurry!
- I'm sorry too.

214
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,610
- There you go.
- I'm sorry!

215
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,980
- I'm sorry!
- I apologize!

216
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:37,011
- I'm sorry!
- We apologize.

217
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,480
I don't care for
heartless apologies!

218
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:40,820
You lunatic!

219
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,021
Shut up!

220
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,490
You're only paying
for what you did.

221
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,631
See for yourselves.

222
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,801
See what monsters you
turned your kids into.

223
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,600
She's out of her mind.

224
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:05,980
She's gone. Where did she go?

225
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:08,681
- Where is she?
- Shim Su Ryeon!

226
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,820
Open the door! Open this door!

227
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,881
- Let us out!
- Open the door, Shim Su Ryeon!

228
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,891
Shim Su Ryeon!

229
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,061
Let me out of here!

230
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,391
Wait, wait!

231
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,561
I have to get out!

232
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:29,901
No!

233
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,000
What now?

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,840
No! No!

235
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,411
Save me!

236
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,480
What happened?

237
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,960
Darn it.

238
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,441
My gosh.

239
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,881
Let's go.

240
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,620
Wait for me. Wait up.

241
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,421
I had my hair done!

242
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:25,096
STATEMENT

243
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,340
- Let go.
- Are you okay?

244
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:41,771
What's this?

245
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,411
It's raw sewage!

246
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,840
- It's blood!
- Blood?

247
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,911
Darn it.

248
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,811
What should we do now?

249
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,990
Are you okay?

250
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,360
What is this now?

251
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,771
- Darn it!
- Dr. Ha!

252
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,431
Listen to me carefully.

253
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:15,340
As of this moment, Min
Seol A was never here.

254
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,740
Min Seol A did not fall
and die in this building.

255
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,521
Will this be big enough?

256
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,291
It's Min Seol A's bag.

257
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,960
I wrote a suicide
note. Set that up too.

258
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,271
We must finish cleaning
up in five minutes.

259
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,511
I'll go down.

260
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:59,151
With this,

261
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,120
all the proof is gone.

262
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,120
Even after her death,
we enjoyed the party...

263
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,590
as if nothing had happened.

264
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,500
It was the grandest
party in the world.

265
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,011
You'll never see such a
party even in your next life.

266
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,710
The lights around
the fountain...

267
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:26,311
were so beautiful.

268
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,250
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

269
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,521
- Jenny!
- Mom!

270
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,191
- Dad!
- Eun Byeol.

271
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,761
Jenny! Jenny.

272
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:43,990
- Eun Byeol!
- My goodness.

273
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,571
GRACE JO'S PRIVATE
SOLO RECITAL

274
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:48,801
Silence!

275
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,970
What...

276
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,100
- Gu Ho Dong.
- Gu Ho Dong?

277
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,370
What are you doing?

278
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,041
Stop this right now!

279
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,350
I'll give you all the cash you
want! Stop this immediately!

280
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:02,511
Money?

281
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,320
How much will you give me?

282
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,320
Is it enough to
bring my sister back?

283
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:11,820
Are you really Min
Seol A's brother?

284
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,021
- Her brother?
- What?

285
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,200
I thought you were suspicious.
You were Min Seol A's brother?

286
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,000
Did you lock up and threaten my
child to avenge for a dead girl?

287
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,671
How can you call
yourself a teacher?

288
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:26,970
This is nothing compared to
what they did to poor Seol A.

289
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,610
Your kids are alive and well.

290
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,311
Don't forget.

291
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,681
You brought this
upon yourselves.

292
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,450
The letters of remorse
your kids wrote here.

293
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,590
I'll make sure to pass
them to the police.

294
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,151
You scumbag!

295
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
- Don't!
- Stop it!

296
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:47,990
Don't move.

297
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,031
- Gu Ho Dong!
- Gu Ho Dong!

298
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:52,436
Hey!

299
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,278
GRACE JO'S PRIVATE
SOLO RECITAL

300
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,200
I will catch and
kill you myself.

301
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,100
You jerk.

302
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,811
Okay, Chairman.

303
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,811
- What was it about?
- It's nothing.

304
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,350
Ms. Shim.

305
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,720
Hello. I was waiting for you.

306
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,261
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

307
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,830
I packed everything.

308
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,891
That's why I came to get you.

309
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,860
I haven't seen Ro Na
for a while as well.

310
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,511
Su Ryeon is at my
place right now.

311
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,480
Ro Na practices so hard.

312
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,580
What? Well, yes.

313
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,320
She met Grace Jo today.

314
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,090
She's so eager now.

315
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,090
The coffee's ready.

316
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,100
What do you mean?

317
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,330
What is all over?

318
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,240
The kids all confessed to
bullying and taunting Seol A.

319
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:09,411
The adults too.

320
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,641
They confessed the
disposal of her body...

321
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,141
and faking cause of death.

322
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,081
Then Joo Dan Tae...

323
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,520
- confessed it too?
- Of course.

324
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,151
He's the worst of them all.

325
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:27,560
He disposed of a corpse, destroyed
evidence, and set a fire.

326
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,631
He even slandered Seol A's name.

327
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,999
What about Cheon Seo Jin?

328
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,799
Did she confess to
killing Min Seol A?

329
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,310
No.

330
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,671
She denied it to the end?

331
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,510
Even when you said you saw her?

332
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,510
You said you saw the
ruby ring on her finger.

333
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,550
When Cheon Seo Jin...

334
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,050
pushed Min Seol
A over the ledge.

335
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,290
It wasn't Cheon Seo Jin.

336
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,760
What?

337
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:04,760
The person...

338
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
who really killed
my daughter Seol A.

339
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,931
It wasn't Cheon Seo Jin.

340
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,010
No?

341
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:20,141
Then... Who's the real killer?

342
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,921
It's you.

343
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,821
You killed her.

344
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,030
My Seol A.

345
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,131
Why did you kill her?

346
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,851
Are you okay? Did
you burn your hand?

347
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,490
What do you mean?

348
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:05,161
What are you talking about?

349
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,831
Do you remember when I asked
to see you on the 47th floor?

350
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,260
The day I told you
Seol A's my daughter.

351
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:17,770
The person who pushed Seol A.

352
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,240
I saw them clearly.

353
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:21,770
Who...

354
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,171
Who was it?

355
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:25,941
She was wearing a ruby ring.

356
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,151
A red ruby ring.

357
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,220
Is something wrong?

358
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,220
I'm fine.

359
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,020
I'll call you back.

360
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,700
I thought it was odd...

361
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,500
how you disappeared
without a word.

362
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,970
But early the next
morning, Ro Na called me.

363
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,280
Hi, Ro Na. Why did
you call me so early?

364
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,810
A police station?

365
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:09,220
She was at a police station and
you weren't answering your phone.

366
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:13,725
PULL THE DOOR-HANDLE

367
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,530
I went in to wake you in
case you'd fallen asleep.

368
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,631
Yoon Hee.

369
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,851
This is Seol A's necklace.

370
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,421
However hard I thought,

371
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,191
I couldn't figure out why
you'd have Seol A's necklace.

372
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,331
Why are you so surprised?

373
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,760
So I went to ask you.

374
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,161
To see for myself. But...

375
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,831
Revenge?

376
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,970
You're just trying to
get what you want...

377
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,571
without getting
blood on your hands!

378
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,040
Why did you send me
to Bosuk Village...

379
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,470
when I didn't know anything and
get me involved with Min Seol A?

380
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,240
I need your testimony.

381
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,210
Go to the police station and
just tell them what you know.

382
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:12,081
The police station? Me?

383
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,550
My poor daughter
who died is in here.

384
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,460
Stop mentioning Min Seol A.

385
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,060
I have to go now.

386
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
You were a different person.

387
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,901
You seemed extremely anxious...

388
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,901
and it seemed like you
were hiding a huge secret.

389
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:33,071
So I followed you.

390
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:47,020
No matter how much
I thought about it,

391
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,191
I couldn't wrap
my head around it.

392
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,520
Why did you try to get rid of
Seol A's necklace at that timing?

393
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:52,720
It was as if...

394
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,191
you were trying to deny your
memories from that night.

395
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:01,901
What is this nonsense?

396
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,700
Are you crazy?

397
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,470
Did you lose your mind
because of your dead daughter?

398
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I...

399
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,371
understand how bitter
and frustrated you are,

400
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,841
but don't blame an
innocent person.

401
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,911
Then why did you burn
Seol A's necklace?

402
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,210
Why did you have it
in the first place?

403
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,181
She gave it to me as a gift.

404
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,250
To thank me for helping her.

405
00:22:21,621 --> 00:22:24,621
But you suddenly told me
she was your daughter,

406
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:26,661
and I didn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

407
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,891
That's why I tried to
get rid of it. That's it.

408
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:31,230
No.

409
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,760
You were drunk that night,

410
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,431
and you totally blacked out.

411
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,631
Then you remembered
after I told you.

412
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,270
So you tried to get rid of
the clothes and necklace...

413
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,441
that could've been used
as proof. Am I wrong?

414
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:45,740
Su Ryeon! Why are
you doing this to me?

415
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,681
I didn't do it.

416
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,111
I really didn't do it.

417
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:51,310
Quiet down.

418
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,181
Is it okay if Ro Na hears this?

419
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,691
Mom. What's wrong?

420
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,790
Are you fighting with Ms. Shim?

421
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,960
No, we're not.

422
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:05,960
Go get some juice.

423
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,631
- It's in the fridge.
- Just go get some!

424
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,081
Do you have proof?

425
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,351
Not just suspicion,
but real proof.

426
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,490
Actual proof that I
killed your daughter.

427
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,760
If you don't, get out of here
before I have you dragged out.

428
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,931
It is over...

429
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:39,161
between us now.

430
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,200
After Seol A died,

431
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,740
we carried out an autopsy.

432
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:51,911
The DNA of several people...

433
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,381
were found all over her body.

434
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:58,280
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo
Jin's were on it as I expected.

435
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,220
But there was one
piece of DNA...

436
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,050
that we couldn't confirm.

437
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,621
It was left under...

438
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:09,760
Seol A's fingernails as
she struggled to fight.

439
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:16,631
The police investigation was
postponed because of that.

440
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,200
The DNA of the suspect...

441
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,641
does not match with the
residents of Hera Palace.

442
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,411
Do you mean we can't
catch the killer?

443
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:32,181
If there's DNA left under
the victim's fingernails,

444
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:33,821
it means there will be...

445
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,851
a noticeable wound on
the killer's body too.

446
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,851
I was curious.

447
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:42,831
Who Seol A was with
before she died.

448
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,500
I was doubtful, but
I still had to check.

449
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,780
Oh Yoon Hee.

450
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:07,151
It was you.

451
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:18,831
DNA TEST RESULT

452
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:24,571
DNA 1 AND DNA 2
MATCH IDENTICALLY,

453
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:27,086
WHICH PROVES THEY
ARE THE SAME PERSON.

454
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:31,271
DNA TEST RESULT

455
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,539
Do you remember?

456
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:35,680
When they held an
emergency parent meeting...

457
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,749
at Cheong A Arts High
School after Seol A died?

458
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:43,750
You drank? And after that?

459
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,091
I can't remember.

460
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:49,861
She just said she
can't remember.

461
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,861
What's that wound on your hand?

462
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,700
You don't remember that as well?

463
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,941
Finally, all pieces of the
puzzle have fallen into place.

464
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:06,681
That wound on your
hand is the proof.

465
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,181
What I saw wasn't Cheon
Seo Jin's ruby ring,

466
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,381
but it was Seol A's necklace
you ripped from her neck.

467
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,621
The one who killed
Seol A is you.

468
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:18,151
No!

469
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,290
- No.
- Was it because of Ro Na?

470
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,560
Because if Seol A was gone,

471
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:28,401
she would get into Cheong A since
she was on the waiting list.

472
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,101
Is that why you killed Seol A?

473
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,601
Stop this nonsense.

474
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:34,141
This is all just
your imagination.

475
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:38,040
You can always fabricate
something like this.

476
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,050
Why? Are you having
second thoughts...

477
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,121
on making Cheon
Seo Jin the killer?

478
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,790
Is that why you're
trying to blame it on me?

479
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,790
Oh Yoon Hee! How far
are you willing to go?

480
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,591
I could've gone to
the police right away,

481
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:59,030
but I wanted to give you a
chance to ask for forgiveness.

482
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:01,770
I didn't kill her. It wasn't me!

483
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,171
I know that you feel guilty,

484
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:05,770
but that won't bring
your daughter back.

485
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,310
You're the one who
couldn't protect her!

486
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,770
You're right. It's my fault.

487
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,210
For mistaking a
murderer as my friend.

488
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,550
What do you think Ro Na
will say when she finds out?

489
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:24,891
Will she understand and forgive
you when she finds out...

490
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:28,290
that her mom killed
someone for her?

491
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,300
Do not say anything...

492
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,871
to Ro Na about Min Seol A.

493
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,571
Don't sway that
vulnerable child...

494
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:42,071
with your ridiculous
speculations!

495
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,611
You really have...

496
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:48,280
nothing to fear when
it comes to Ro Na.

497
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,510
Honey. Let's go home.

498
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,181
Is this your answer?

499
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:35,530
Bring her to me politely.

500
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,270
I can go on my own.

501
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:56,710
I'll call you later.

502
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:14,831
You did the right thing.
You made the right choice.

503
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,871
For Ro Na to live,
you have no choice.

504
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,540
You did the right thing.

505
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,321
It's okay. It's nothing.

506
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:42,191
It's okay.

507
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,161
It's so cold.

508
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:02,980
Seok Kyung.

509
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,550
What are you doing?

510
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:06,750
- Let go!
- Seok Kyung!

511
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,621
It's okay. Calm down.

512
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:12,321
It's okay.

513
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,661
It's okay, Seok Kyung.
It's going to be okay.

514
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,161
Get lost!

515
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,831
Dad.

516
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm so scared.

517
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,401
Min Seol A keeps chasing me.

518
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,081
It's okay. I'm right
here, so don't worry.

519
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,141
I'm right here, so
don't be afraid.

520
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,851
Did Mom kill Min Seol A?

521
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:41,621
Because of me?

522
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,050
Did she kill her...

523
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,361
to cover up my sins?

524
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,401
It's okay, sweetie.

525
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,071
It's okay.

526
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:19,091
You are...

527
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,290
Min Seol A's real mom?

528
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,161
You did something very
gutsy, Shim Su Ryeon.

529
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,060
Why on earth are you
acting up so much?

530
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:32,371
Are you foolish enough to
put your life on the line...

531
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,240
for a dead girl?

532
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,611
Say whatever you want.

533
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:39,310
If it weren't for you, she
wouldn't have died like that.

534
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,411
Why did you do it?

535
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:44,050
Was killing Seol
A's dad not enough?

536
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,381
Why did you switch...

537
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,191
those poor babies when
they were so young?

538
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,691
Then did you think...

539
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,200
I would actually raise
that jerk's daughter?

540
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,631
You're seriously too naive.

541
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:09,010
Why would I do that for
a darn loser like him?

542
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,071
Don't think it will end here.

543
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,810
I will make sure
you're punished...

544
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,151
for what you did.

545
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,950
You scumbag.

546
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:31,861
Who is it?

547
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,530
The one who made
you so confident.

548
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,441
Taking Hye In and sending
her to New York...

549
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,500
and preparing a show
like that today.

550
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,071
An amateur like you
couldn't have done it.

551
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:46,441
I'm certain there is
someone who's helping you.

552
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:50,950
Tell me. Who is it?

553
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,020
Fine.

554
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:03,060
I'll just send you to
your dead daughter now.

555
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,000
It's Logan Lee, sir.

556
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,851
Yes, it's me. I was
just about to call you.

557
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,591
Now?

558
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:39,230
Okay.

559
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,970
Don't take your eyes off her.

560
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,071
And make sure she
doesn't meet the kids.

561
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:25,310
What is this? What's going on?

562
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,680
Turn the lights back on. Now!

563
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:23,500
Turn the lights back on!

564
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:30,140
She's gone.

565
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,881
Find her now!

566
00:35:41,451 --> 00:35:42,491
Stop!

567
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,520
Excuse me for being late.

568
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:14,281
It's okay.

569
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:15,890
I'll have the same, please.

570
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,591
So, Mr. Joo.

571
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,991
I heard you missed the
event with Grace Jo.

572
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,000
You know I put in a lot
of work into it, right?

573
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,000
You put me in a bad position.

574
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,600
So do you want to
tell me what happened?

575
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,941
There was an accident.

576
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,710
I guess you didn't
hear anything about it.

577
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:40,810
Something very interesting happened
in the limousine you sent us.

578
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:43,850
Oh, yes. I heard about
it from my secretary.

579
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,421
There must've been some kind of
confusion with the limousines.

580
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:53,560
Anyway, do you happen to know a
man by the name of "Ho Dong Gu"?

581
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,960
"Ho Dong Gu"? Gu Ho Dong?

582
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,491
Yes. This man called me...

583
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:02,471
and he asked me if I knew
the real Dan Tae Joo.

584
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,401
He claims that you and
others at the Hera Palace...

585
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,040
are involved in
some kind of a...

586
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,500
murder case.

587
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:11,071
Is this true?

588
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,410
He's not reliable at all.
You don't have to mind him.

589
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,381
Well... It's against my
policy to go around...

590
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:21,421
digging up other people's
private business matters,

591
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,520
but it did catch me off guard.

592
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,921
Considering the fact
that you tried to sell...

593
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,460
your living
daughter's property...

594
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,790
and now, a murder case.

595
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:33,361
I don't know if I can keep
trusting you as a business partner.

596
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,230
The investment
presentation is tomorrow.

597
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,930
The investors have high hopes
for this casino business.

598
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,941
You cannot be swayed now.

599
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,000
They're all just false rumors.

600
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,910
What if I don't believe you?

601
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,980
I'll prepare thoroughly and
prove you weren't wrong.

602
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,051
I will never disappoint you.

603
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,591
Investment presentation...

604
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,660
I'll be looking forward to it.

605
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,901
Okay.

606
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:13,871
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

607
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:19,512
How did it go?

608
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,252
Wasn't Joo Dan Tae
suspicious of you?

609
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:26,921
He's a skeptical person,
so I'm sure he has doubts.

610
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,991
But since he is the president,

611
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,322
and the investment
presentation is tomorrow,

612
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:34,261
I think he's willing
to push forward.

613
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:38,962
I know how hard it was.

614
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:41,901
Why did you go to
Oh Yoon Hee's place?

615
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:47,242
I wasn't mistaken about
what I saw that night.

616
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:01,551
Have you forgotten that
Su Ryeon and I are close?

617
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:05,362
If that bothered you,
you wouldn't be here.

618
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,062
Am I wrong?

619
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,042
Hello?

620
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,241
Why are you so hard to reach?

621
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:25,081
Dan Tae's involved with
my daughter's death.

622
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:28,452
Come with me to the police
tomorrow and testify about Seol A.

623
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,122
You're the only person
I trust right now.

624
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:33,152
I must catch her killer.

625
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:35,821
Please help me, Yoon Hee.

626
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:46,431
Yoon Hee is helping Dan Tae.

627
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,732
She betrayed me.

628
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:51,902
What did I tell you?

629
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,512
I told you not to trust her!

630
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,081
Yoon Hee is the murderer.

631
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:05,152
She killed Seol A.

632
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,521
What...

633
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:13,532
What did you just say?

634
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:16,162
The person who killed Seol A...

635
00:40:18,602 --> 00:40:19,871
was Yoon Hee.

636
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:26,711
Calm down.

637
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:29,581
Now is not the right time.
Please give me more time.

638
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:30,811
I'll deal with it.

639
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:32,542
Why do you need more time?

640
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,551
What do you expect from her?

641
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:38,281
Yoon Hee has already
betrayed you.

642
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,692
She'll do everything she can...

643
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:41,952
to kill you along
with Joo Dan Tae.

644
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:42,991
I know that.

645
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,722
- But now isn't the time.
- Why not?

646
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:48,031
Why can't we just kill her?

647
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:50,401
Just like how she killed Seol A.

648
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:53,102
I want to do that too!

649
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:56,901
But that won't be the end.
What will we do after that?

650
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,271
Do you think Seol A would want
us to become murderers like them?

651
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:05,042
What about Seok
Hoon and Seok Kyung?

652
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:07,181
I'm their mother.

653
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,121
I can't end my life so
irresponsibly like this.

654
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,991
I feel a lot more angry
and furious than you do,

655
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,961
and it's driving me crazy.

656
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:21,692
But I'm trying my
best to stay calm...

657
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:24,732
because I know we can't solve
this by being emotional.

658
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,371
I'm going to take
revenge in my own way.

659
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:31,501
I'm going to leave her until the end
and put her through the most pain.

660
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:35,871
So just stick to the plan...

661
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,042
and do things one by one.

662
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,982
That's the best we can do now.

663
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:57,132
Chairman Joo, what
took you so long?

664
00:41:57,132 --> 00:41:59,061
This is an emergency situation.

665
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,531
You made us wait for so long.

666
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:04,241
Why did you want to meet
so early in the morning?

667
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,602
Why do you think?

668
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:09,311
We almost died, and our
kids were in danger too.

669
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:13,581
Are you just going to
sit back and do nothing?

670
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:16,181
Did you find Su Ryeon?

671
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:18,382
- No.
- You failed to find her?

672
00:42:19,422 --> 00:42:22,991
Good for you.
You're doing great.

673
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,592
What?

674
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:28,232
Now, we finally know that
Su Ryeon was the one...

675
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:29,931
who's been blackmailing us.

676
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:32,362
Does she not care how much
she traumatized the kids?

677
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,131
How could a mother do
something like that?

678
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:37,801
But we can't report
her to the cops.

679
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:39,741
We're no better than her.

680
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:43,342
The kids already know everything,
so what's there to be scared about?

681
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:44,982
Let's sue her...

682
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:47,352
for kidnapping,
confinement, and blackmail.

683
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:50,881
I won't forgive her for this.

684
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:55,451
Come to think of it, you were
right about everything, Ms. Cheon.

685
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:58,321
Su Ryeon really turned
out to be Seol A's mother.

686
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,991
That means she's
been lying to us...

687
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,761
and planning this all along.

688
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:05,431
Did we make any mistakes?

689
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:08,201
I bet she consistently
gathered evidence.

690
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:13,311
What if we all end
up going to jail?

691
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:16,712
You're the one married to
her. Didn't you notice...

692
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:18,112
anything suspicious?

693
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:20,451
You always acted so smart.

694
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:23,422
But seriously, are you dumb?

695
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:27,321
He must not have noticed because
he loved his wife so much.

696
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:32,321
I admit that I made a mistake.

697
00:43:33,162 --> 00:43:35,391
But what matters is how we
deal with it from now on.

698
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:37,931
If you don't want to
get fooled by her again,

699
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:39,602
all of us better stay alert.

700
00:43:39,602 --> 00:43:41,472
Do you not understand?

701
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,701
We already confessed everything.

702
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:46,842
What's the use of staying alert?

703
00:43:47,612 --> 00:43:49,641
Think about what kind of
situation we were in yesterday...

704
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:51,982
before we confessed everything.

705
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:55,412
You're right. We were forced.

706
00:43:56,152 --> 00:43:58,652
We made false confessions
because we felt pressured.

707
00:43:58,881 --> 00:43:59,951
Bingo.

708
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:03,362
If we say we lied because
we felt threatened,

709
00:44:03,722 --> 00:44:04,991
the cops won't be
able to arrest us.

710
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:08,191
We must come up with a
story and stick to it.

711
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:11,362
Let's say Su Ryeon got
all of you involved...

712
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:13,071
so she could divorce me.

713
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:16,641
She wanted to get a
huge amount of alimony.

714
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:17,641
One more.

715
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:19,571
Let's also add that Su Ryeon...

716
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:22,712
was delusional and thought
Seol A was her daughter.

717
00:44:22,811 --> 00:44:23,982
That's a good idea.

718
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:28,782
There's no evidence to prove
that Seol A is her daughter.

719
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:35,391
But what about Gu Ho Dong?
What will we do about him?

720
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,662
I'll take care of him.

721
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:40,061
I'll do everything
I can to find him.

722
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:44,131
We worked very hard to build
the Hera Palace Kingdom.

723
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:45,931
I won't let them destroy us.

724
00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:47,772
Never.

725
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:24,042
I apologize, sir.

726
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,842
Do everything you can
to bring Su Ryeon to me.

727
00:45:26,472 --> 00:45:27,941
I don't care if
it's just her body.

728
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:37,522
Eun Byeol.

729
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:39,891
Did you sleep well?

730
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:42,222
You shouldn't go to school
today. I'll call the school.

731
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:44,621
I messed up my midterm exams,
so I can't skip school.

732
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:46,862
It's okay to skip school.

733
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:47,991
Look at me.

734
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,001
Are you really okay?

735
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:54,472
Eun Byeol is stronger
than you think.

736
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:57,102
Hurry up and go to school.

737
00:45:57,441 --> 00:46:00,141
Get there faster than
others and practice singing.

738
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:02,641
You're right. I should
stick to my normal routine.

739
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:04,741
It's not like I
did anything wrong.

740
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:12,282
You and Dad are the ones who
didn't raise me properly.

741
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:22,261
Eun Byeol.

742
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:36,141
You're going to
proceed with that?

743
00:46:36,482 --> 00:46:38,612
Is it really necessary to hold
the inauguration ceremony?

744
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:40,751
Don't you remember what we
went through last night?

745
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:42,852
I did nothing wrong.

746
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:45,052
So why must I cancel my
plans like I'm guilty?

747
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:49,192
I won't let Su Ryeon
have things her way.

748
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:52,722
We're divorced, so stop
interfering in my business.

749
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:55,092
Are you not worried
about Eun Byeol?

750
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:57,631
Can't you see that
she's all broken inside?

751
00:46:58,001 --> 00:46:59,531
She has nightmares every night,

752
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:01,972
and keeps talking
nonsense. She isn't sane!

753
00:47:01,972 --> 00:47:03,472
Right now,

754
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:09,041
the best consolation
she can receive is...

755
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,612
to see her mother
become the director.

756
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:16,151
That's what I can
do to console her.

757
00:47:17,452 --> 00:47:20,251
What's going to change if
you just keep babying her?

758
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,621
We can't let her get haunted
by Seol A all her life.

759
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:24,862
You're incompetent
and irresponsible.

760
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:26,562
You're the worst father.

761
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:31,562
You really are a
frightening woman.

762
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:34,501
Do you know what's going
on inside Eun Byeol's head?

763
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:39,171
She's scared that you
might've killed Seol A.

764
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:45,712
I didn't kill her.

765
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:48,182
That's what matters.

766
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:52,482
Stop making a fuss and make
sure you attend the ceremony...

767
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:55,052
as the director of
Cheong A Medical Center.

768
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:03,161
I found this on Mr. Gu's
desk this morning.

769
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:09,472
RESIGNATION LETTER

770
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:10,741
Resignation letter.

771
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:12,741
Go screw yourselves.

772
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:16,112
"Screw"?

773
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,712
He must've lost his mind.

774
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:21,781
How dare he tells
you to go screw...

775
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:27,621
Ma'am.

776
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:30,621
It's for the better since
he was always a nuisance.

777
00:48:30,962 --> 00:48:34,562
He pretty much left you a gift in
celebration of your inauguration.

778
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,332
And everything is going well...

779
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:40,202
with the inauguration ceremony
that will be held this afternoon.

780
00:48:40,302 --> 00:48:42,671
Today, I'll be
singing for you...

781
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:45,501
as a surprise event.

782
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:49,511
I'll be singing your
favorite song...

783
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,641
Okay, you may leave.

784
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:55,411
Okay, I'll see you
later at the hall.

785
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:07,652
RESIGNATION LETTER.
GO SCREW YOURSELVES.

786
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:13,832
Gu Ho Dong.

787
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,302
There's something
suspicious about him.

788
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:52,271
I knew it. Logan was the
one helping Su Ryeon.

789
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,552
Can we meet right now?

790
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:02,552
It's important.

791
00:50:05,322 --> 00:50:08,151
So tell me. Why did
you want to see me?

792
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:12,692
Is Su Ryeon doing well?

793
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:14,661
I've been wondering
where she was hiding.

794
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:17,932
I'm relieved to know
that she's with you.

795
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:20,732
I don't know what
you're talking about.

796
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:24,671
I know she's staying with
you in your hotel room.

797
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:27,241
I already checked.

798
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:29,641
So you don't need to lie.

799
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:40,052
As you already know, I
work for J King Holdings.

800
00:50:40,692 --> 00:50:43,021
And the chairman is
looking for his wife.

801
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:48,031
And as his employee, I should
tell him what he wants to know.

802
00:50:49,092 --> 00:50:50,332
For instance,

803
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:52,631
Su Ryeon's whereabouts
and whom she's with.

804
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:57,041
Then you should've
contacted Mr. Joo.

805
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,202
Why in the world
did you come to me?

806
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,011
Because I'm curious.

807
00:51:03,781 --> 00:51:04,881
Why are you...

808
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,251
helping Su Ryeon?

809
00:51:08,881 --> 00:51:11,952
Don't tell me you've
developed personal feelings...

810
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:13,552
for your business
partner's wife.

811
00:51:16,322 --> 00:51:17,391
Now Ms. Oh,

812
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:21,291
why is it necessary for me to
explain my personal feelings...

813
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:22,962
to someone like you?

814
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:27,501
I'm sure this project is
very important to you too.

815
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:30,501
And I'm worried you
might ruin everything...

816
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:32,241
because of your
personal feelings.

817
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:34,641
Is it because of Mr. Joo?

818
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:36,511
Because apparently, to me,

819
00:51:36,982 --> 00:51:40,212
you're the one who seems like you
have personal feelings toward him.

820
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,182
What did you say?

821
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,901
Now, did you really think that I was
going to go and invest my money...

822
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:02,572
without doing any background
research on my business partner?

823
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:06,371
Listen.

824
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,182
I don't care if
you're his employee...

825
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:14,052
or his little Juliet.

826
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,552
Because it seems obvious Mr. Joo's
private life seems rather...

827
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:20,251
disturbing anyway.

828
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:23,121
So why don't we keep all
this nonsense confidential...

829
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:24,692
for the benefit of both of us?

830
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:31,161
Because you do realize that we
have a very, very important...

831
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:34,102
investment conference
coming up, right?

832
00:52:36,802 --> 00:52:38,741
We can't trust you...

833
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:41,942
as long as we know
you're helping Su Ryeon.

834
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:45,342
I'll have to tell the chairman
about your relationship with her.

835
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:48,112
Listen.

836
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:51,682
When this is over, I'm
planning to take Su Ryeon...

837
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:53,151
to America with me anyway.

838
00:52:55,822 --> 00:52:58,722
Did she agree to go with you?

839
00:52:59,062 --> 00:53:00,732
I'm convincing
her at the moment.

840
00:53:01,462 --> 00:53:03,832
Obviously, she can't live
with Mr. Joo anymore.

841
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:06,702
But isn't that what you
wanted in the first place?

842
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:08,901
For me to get rid of her.

843
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:18,381
Su Ryeon is going to go to
the States with Logan Lee?

844
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:28,121
Hello?

845
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:31,092
Did you find out who's
helping Su Ryeon?

846
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:34,562
No, not yet. I need more time.

847
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:40,732
Will you do me a
favor and speed it up?

848
00:53:48,212 --> 00:53:49,911
Yoon Hee knows about
our relationship?

849
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:52,041
How?

850
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:53,911
I think she saw you
entering the hotel.

851
00:53:55,082 --> 00:53:56,482
I made sure she
won't say anything,

852
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:58,621
but we never know when she
might tell Joo Dan Tae.

853
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:03,052
I hope she at least
stays quiet...

854
00:54:03,962 --> 00:54:05,462
until today's
investment presentation.

855
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:07,791
If Dan Tae finds
out before that,

856
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:11,001
everything will
go down the drain.

857
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:17,442
We'll just have to
leave it to fate.

858
00:54:18,072 --> 00:54:20,212
Judgment day has come.

859
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:22,871
It'll all go well.

860
00:54:24,682 --> 00:54:25,682
I hope so.

861
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:29,852
We must succeed...

862
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:32,381
for Seol A.

863
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:34,692
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL

864
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:37,621
I'd like to announce
that Ms. Cheon Seo Jin...

865
00:54:38,092 --> 00:54:40,592
got voted as the next
director of the foundation.

866
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:45,061
THE 7TH DIRECTOR INAUGURATION
CEREMONY OF CHEONG A FOUNDATION

867
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,178
CERTIFICATE OF
APPOINTMENT, CHEON SEO JIN

868
00:54:57,842 --> 00:54:58,842
Congratulations.

869
00:55:00,682 --> 00:55:04,751
Now let's hear Ms. Cheon's
inauguration speech.

870
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:07,921
Hello, I'm Cheon Seo Jin.

871
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:10,862
First of all, I'd like
to thank you all...

872
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:13,891
for making time to
attend the ceremony.

873
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:21,631
I especially would like to
thank all the board members...

874
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:25,542
who trusted me enough
to appoint me...

875
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:29,012
as the director
of the foundation.

876
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:32,142
THE 7TH DIRECTOR INAUGURATION
CEREMONY OF CHEONG A FOUNDATION

877
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:40,022
I will stick to my
late father's goal...

878
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:44,221
and make sure Cheong A stays
strong and transparent.

879
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:46,522
I promise that to
all of you here.

880
00:55:46,892 --> 00:55:52,902
THE 7TH DIRECTOR INAUGURATION
CEREMONY OF CHEONG A FOUNDATION

881
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,321
HA YOON CHUL

882
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:15,792
What is this?

883
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:17,092
I got a text.

884
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:20,121
She got in using
her connections?

885
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:30,942
THE 7TH DIRECTOR INAUGURATION
CEREMONY OF CHEONG A FOUNDATION

886
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:39,012
THE HEAD OF THE ART DEPARTMENT
FORGED HER DAUGHTER'S GRADES...

887
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:40,182
TO GET HER ACCEPTED TO
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL.

888
00:56:41,012 --> 00:56:44,151
Ms. Cheon, I'm Oh Song
Yi from Jeonghee Daily.

889
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:46,481
Are you aware that
someone sent a tip-off...

890
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:48,921
regarding the school's
entrance exam irregularities?

891
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:51,492
Did you really forge your daughter's
score to get her accepted?

892
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:53,161
I heard she sang out of tune...

893
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:56,262
and ran out in the middle
of the test. Is that true?

894
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:58,161
Is it true that you received
bribes from a few mothers...

895
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:00,332
and forged their kids'
grades in return?

896
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:01,931
- Ma'am?
- What do you have to say?

897
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:03,671
- Is it true?
- Tell us what happened.

898
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,072
We'd like an explanation.

899
00:57:05,671 --> 00:57:06,901
Do you admit to everything?

900
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:08,471
Please explain...

901
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:19,921
What's going on?

902
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:26,862
What is it?

903
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,172
"CHEONG A FOUNDATION'S
IRREGULARITIES COME TO LIGHT"

904
00:57:36,937 --> 00:57:38,607
ACCORDING TO THE TEXT,
CHEON SEO JIN'S DAUGHTER...

905
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:47,092
HOWEVER, OTHERS SAY SHE GOT A
HIGH SCORE THANKS TO HER VOICE...

906
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:53,022
I guess it's true.

907
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:54,621
I can't believe it.

908
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:57,702
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S NECESSARY
TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION...

909
00:58:07,602 --> 00:58:08,931
What do you think you're doing?

910
00:58:09,272 --> 00:58:10,802
Stop what you're
doing right now!

911
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:12,671
Hello, I'm Prosecutor
Oh Joon Hyuk.

912
00:58:13,242 --> 00:58:15,272
I'm a huge fan. I'm sorry
we had to meet like this.

913
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,042
We have a search and seizure warrant
along with an arrest warrant.

914
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:20,651
You need to come with us.

915
00:58:23,012 --> 00:58:24,052
Let me go.

916
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:25,681
Who do you think I am?
How dare you touch me!

917
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:28,022
Let me go! Get off me!
Stop what you're doing now!

918
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:29,391
Ma'am, this is bad.

919
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:32,391
The prosecutors took everything
from the teachers' office.

920
00:58:33,862 --> 00:58:36,231
Ms. Cheon, what's going on?

921
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:39,131
What kind of a crazy jerk
could've reported you?

922
00:58:41,302 --> 00:58:42,302
Do you think...

923
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,871
It's not a big deal.

924
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:48,871
There must be a misunderstanding.
It'll quickly be taken care of.

925
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:51,012
I want you to stay here...

926
00:58:51,181 --> 00:58:54,252
and make sure the students
and parents don't get wavered.

927
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:57,522
Get off me. Let me go!

928
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:02,292
Ma'am.

929
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,092
Do you think I'll let
this get in my way?

930
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,292
I'm...

931
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:11,631
Cheon Seo Jin,

932
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:15,332
the director of
Cheong A Foundation.

933
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:22,742
- Hello.
- Yes, this way.

934
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:25,211
Thank you.

935
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:29,151
- Welcome.
- Hello.

936
00:59:30,211 --> 00:59:31,582
Thank you for coming.

937
00:59:32,621 --> 00:59:33,681
Hello.

938
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,822
Since our Myeongdong land
has been set as collateral,

939
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:42,762
we're big shots in
this business deal.

940
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,401
So let's not rely on
Chairman Joo so much...

941
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:47,871
and get involved aggressively.

942
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:48,971
We should do that.

943
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:53,701
Nothing went well all this time
when we trusted Chairman Joo.

944
00:59:53,772 --> 00:59:55,671
That's what I'm saying.

945
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:59,842
Wait. You didn't go to
the inauguration ceremony?

946
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:01,352
The women of Hera Palace...

947
01:00:01,352 --> 01:00:03,711
were all dolled up to go
there since this morning.

948
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:07,451
I know you're divorced and
all, but you're still...

949
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:09,092
a director of a
Cheong A Foundation.

950
01:00:09,092 --> 01:00:10,562
You should've cast a vote.

951
01:00:10,762 --> 01:00:13,062
If you did, you could've saved up
something for yourself later on.

952
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:16,832
If this investment goes well,

953
01:00:17,302 --> 01:00:19,032
should I pay my wife a
huge amount of alimony...

954
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,262
and get divorced?

955
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:22,602
Can you stop saying
such stupid things?

956
01:00:23,102 --> 01:00:24,971
I can't focus because
of your yapping.

957
01:00:25,072 --> 01:00:28,411
Focus on what? We
haven't even started yet.

958
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,141
Something feels strange.

959
01:00:35,012 --> 01:00:36,512
Why isn't Logan Lee here?

960
01:00:37,621 --> 01:00:38,951
You're right.

961
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,292
Our rich investor from
the US is running late.

962
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:46,762
What's taking Logan Lee so long?

963
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,191
Call him again.

964
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:51,461
He's not the type to be late.

965
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:55,389

SIGNED BY LOGAN
LEE AND JOO DAN TAE

967
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:40,512
Mr. Hong, let's begin.

968
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:51,461
Did he answer?

969
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:52,522
I can't reach him.

970
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,362
His phone has been turned off.

971
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,461
How could he turn off his
phone on such an important day?

972
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,731
The investors seem worried,

973
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:01,772
so why don't we begin the event?

974
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:03,971
You should begin with
the business briefing.

975
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:09,141
INVESTMENT PRESENTATION OF THE
INTEGRATED RESORT AND CASINO

976
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,512
Hello, everyone.

977
01:02:16,451 --> 01:02:17,981
I apologize for making you wait.

978
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:20,985
I'm the chairman of J King
Holdings, Joo Dan Tae.

979
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:23,136
INVESTMENT PRESENTATION OF THE
INTEGRATED RESORT AND CASINO

980
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:28,891
Our joint investor,
Mr. Logan Lee...

981
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:31,332
is still in discussion with
the headquarters in the US,

982
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:33,862
so I will begin the briefing.

983
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:37,401
The biggest casino
ever in Asia...

984
01:02:37,602 --> 01:02:40,072
will be built in the
center of Myeongdong soon.

985
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:42,711
The integrated resort and
casino that will be built...

986
01:02:42,711 --> 01:02:44,481
will include the
largest-ever swimming pool...

987
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,342
and shopping center in line with
the fourth industrial revolution.

988
01:02:47,651 --> 01:02:50,481
I guarantee it will become the
best tourist attraction of Korea.

989
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:53,322
I'll explain more
through the screen.

990
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:58,262
- This is the rate of return chart.
- Yes, Eun Byeol.

991
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:00,992
- It was provided by Myungjin Bank.
- What? I can't hear you.

992
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:02,961
- The expected investment...
- Hold on.

993
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:04,332
by J King Holdings is...

994
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:07,532
What's wrong, Eun
Byeol? It's okay.

995
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:08,671
Don't cry and tell me.

996
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:10,401
Yes.

997
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:13,272
What?

998
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:15,312
Tell me slowly, Eun Byeol.

999
01:03:19,582 --> 01:03:20,911
Okay, I'm on my way now.

1000
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,041
DETECTIVE

1001
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:39,731
We expect a yearly profit
of 3.5 billion dollars...

1002
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,371
per year.

1003
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:44,971
Amazing!

1004
01:03:58,022 --> 01:03:59,221
Are you Chairman Joo Dan Tae?

1005
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:00,921
Yes, I am.

1006
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:05,092
What is it? You can't come in
here without an invitation.

1007
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,221
It's a private room.

1008
01:04:06,461 --> 01:04:08,731
You are under arrest for
embezzlement, investment fraud,

1009
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:10,931
and violation of the
Capital Market Act.

1010
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:12,362
Arrest him.

1011
01:04:12,362 --> 01:04:14,401
- What?
- What is going on?

1012
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:15,602
What are you doing?

1013
01:04:15,971 --> 01:04:17,602
Why would I commit embezzlement?

1014
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:20,102
I have never broken the law.

1015
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:21,742
You can talk at the
station. Take him away.

1016
01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:23,112
Who sent you people?

1017
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:24,641
Who ordered you to do this?

1018
01:04:47,602 --> 01:04:49,371
Are you kidding me right now?

1019
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:50,731
What do you mean,
"embezzlement"?

1020
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:52,772
Why would I steal
the company's money?

1021
01:04:52,772 --> 01:04:54,141
You sold Logan Lee's name...

1022
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,772
and gave false information
to the investors...

1023
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:57,171
to receive investments.

1024
01:04:57,171 --> 01:04:59,012
Why would I sell
Logan Lee's name?

1025
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:01,151
He's my partner for
our casino business.

1026
01:05:01,512 --> 01:05:02,752
Call Logan Lee now.

1027
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:04,621
You can ask him yourself!

1028
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:06,022
Are you looking for me?

1029
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:10,621
Logan. Logan!

1030
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:12,522
I'm glad you're here.

1031
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:13,961
There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

1032
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:16,092
Please sort out this
ridiculous situation.

1033
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:22,431
You still don't get it
now, do you, Mr. Joo?

1034
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:28,242
I'm the one who reported you,

1035
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:30,312
Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

1036
01:05:30,981 --> 01:05:33,411
What? What did you say?

1037
01:05:34,352 --> 01:05:37,582
I am the one who reported
you to the police.

1038
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:09,512
THE PENTHOUSE

1039
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,621
<i>I told you you were
up for a surprise.</i>

1040
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:13,722
<i>It's only fair that they
suffer the same way.</i>

1041
01:06:13,722 --> 01:06:15,321
<i>- You piece of trash!
- You piece of trash!</i>

1042
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:16,821
<i>What's wrong? Eun Byeol!</i>

1043
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:19,492
<i>You should experience the
sorrow of losing a child too.</i>

1044
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:20,992
<i>I won't let you have your way.</i>

1045
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:23,232
<i>You want me to
kill Shim Su Ryeon?</i>

1046
01:06:23,331 --> 01:06:24,702
<i>I'll wait until you come back.</i>

1047
01:06:25,131 --> 01:06:27,502
<i>I'll reveal the whole truth.</i>

1048
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:30,172
<i>Go on and try it. Let's
see who wins in the end.</i>
