THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:07,466
AND BACKGROUND OF THIS
DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:11,333
EPISODE 20

4
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:15,445
Are you Chairman Joo Dan Tae?

5
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:17,856
You are under arrest for
embezzlement, investment fraud,

6
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:20,256
and violation of the
Capital Market Act.

7
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:22,385
- Arrest him.
- What's going on?

8
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:24,525
What is going on?

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,655
What are you doing?

10
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,326
Why would I commit embezzlement?

11
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:29,626
I have never broken the law.

12
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,696
- Take him away.
- Who sent you people?

13
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,065
Who ordered you to do this?

14
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:34,965
You're making a mistake!

15
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:39,275
Wait. Chairman Joo. What is
going on? Investment fraud?

16
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:40,846
Attorney Lee, find
out what's going on.

17
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,046
You can hire dozens of lawyers.
Just get to the bottom of it.

18
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:45,546
- I did nothing wrong!
- Chairman Joo.

19
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,145
Dr. Ha. Where is Dr. Ha?

20
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,325
Is Su Ryeon behind all of this?

21
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,236
Mom.

22
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,785
Do you have proof?

23
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,585
Why are you arresting me?

24
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:25,856
You sold Logan Lee's name...

25
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,785
and gave false information
to the investors...

26
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:28,955
to receive investments.

27
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,725
Why would I sell
Logan Lee's name?

28
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:32,796
He's my partner for
our casino business.

29
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:34,565
Call Logan Lee now.

30
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,496
You can ask him yourself!

31
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:37,736
Were you looking for me?

32
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,406
Logan. Logan!

33
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:45,675
I'm glad you're here. There
seems to be a misunderstanding.

34
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,776
Please sort out this
ridiculous situation.

35
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,186
You still don't get it
now, do you, Mr. Joo?

36
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,955
I'm the one who reported you,

37
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:01,856
Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

38
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,055
What? What did you say?

39
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:09,165
I am the one who reported
you to the police.

40
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,765
You used my name to
receive an investment?

41
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:18,276
You knew how to speak Korean?

42
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:21,406
I want him to be punished
strictly according to the law.

43
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:24,776
I have never been
involved with him...

44
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,545
for any type of business.

45
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,656
No, no. Logan. What
are you saying?

46
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,855
We even signed a contract.

47
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:36,156
I even set my Myeongdong land as
collateral to make a casino...

48
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:39,695
Will this be enough
of an answer?

49
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:43,966
What is this? What...

50
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:48,366
I'll soon find out whether you're
someone who'll take my hand...

51
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:50,575
and go far or grab my
ankle and hold me back.

52
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,635
Or I could be the one to
present an unpleasant surprise.

53
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:56,545
This is...

54
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:01,616
I told you, you were up
for an unpleasant surprise.

55
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:05,915
You jerk!

56
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,355
Let go of me.

57
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,626
Grab him! Grab him now!

58
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:10,956
He's a swindler.

59
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,396
He's the real crook!

60
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,565
Let go of me. Hey, Gu Ho Dong!

61
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:17,065
- Chairman Joo. Don't say anything!
- Grab him. Let go of me!

62
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:18,896
- Grab Gu Ho Dong.
- Take the Fifth!

63
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,265
That punk. You jerk!

64
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:23,706
- Let go. He's the swindler!
- Don't say anything!

65
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,306
Don't let him get away!

66
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,806
Gu Ho Dong!

67
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,415
I'm sorry for
calling so suddenly.

68
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:34,015
You were the only one
to ask for a favor.

69
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:37,216
I never imagined you'd
ask me for a favor.

70
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,485
I always thought you were
living an elegant life.

71
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:41,626
How did you get into this mess?

72
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,626
I lived with a
monster all this time.

73
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,225
I'm sorry for calling you
for something like this.

74
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:52,836
I leeched off you for five
years before graduating.

75
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:54,765
And you even paid
for my tuition.

76
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,676
I'm glad I can
finally pay you back.

77
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,746
Thank you.

78
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:06,776
What is going on?

79
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,646
Why are we going to the
broadcasting station?

80
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,586
I was waiting for you.

81
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:13,056
I have something
urgent to tell you.

82
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,785
Do you know Mr. Jung Doo
Man of Happy Future Party?

83
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,656
No. I don't know him at all.

84
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,225
I knew it.

85
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:25,636
There's a rumor going around
that you and Mr. Jung...

86
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,066
are having a secret affair.

87
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:29,566
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:31,605
Why would I meet
someone like him?

89
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,946
I found out the reason today.

90
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,375
You asked me to find Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung's mom, right?

91
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:38,946
Did you find her?

92
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,516
I opened Joo Dan Tae's
safe in his office today...

93
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,316
and found this photo.

94
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:45,316
Don't be shocked.

95
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,956
She is the one who gave
birth to the twins.

96
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:53,596
I can't believe it.

97
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,665
How could this happen?

98
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,535
Where is she right now?

99
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,266
Welcome to "Reporter Kim's Eye".

100
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,276
Chairman Joo, the owner of...

101
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:07,805
the biggest investment company
in Korea, J King Holdings,

102
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:11,475
has been arrested for
embezzlement and investment fraud.

103
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,816
He used a casino business to
attract huge investments...

104
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,946
in order to raise
his stock prices.

105
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:19,716
The Public Prosecutors' Office
carried out a search and seizure...

106
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,125
of J King Holdings' office
located in Yeoksam-dong...

107
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,256
and summoned the people
concerned for an investigation.

108
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,596
"Reporter Kim's Eye" will
focus on this incident today.

109
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,966
The video of Chairman
Joo of J King Holdings...

110
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,365
and Director Cheon of
Cheong A having an affair...

111
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:36,706
- is going viral on the internet.
- These two crossed the line.

112
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:37,875
They were caught in a villa...

113
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,045
Sir, is Chairman
Joo really done for?

114
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,906
Will he get arrested?

115
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,745
Then what will happen
to my Myeongdong land?

116
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,946
If the owner is arrested,
it's as good as trash.

117
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,985
Sell everything before
the stocks plummet.

118
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:53,185
Meanwhile, Cheong A Foundation
is being investigated...

119
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,886
for fabricating grades...

120
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,386
and entrance exam
irregularities.

121
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,966
No, no!

122
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,066
- Eun Byeol.
- No!

123
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,266
- No!
- Also, an anonymous informant...

124
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,466
has requested for a
reinvestigation...

125
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:11,276
of the death of Min, who came in
first place in Cheong A's 2020 exam.

126
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,206
We also received information
that Min suffered from...

127
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,675
severe bullying from the
students of Cheong A...

128
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:20,115
and was a victim
of severe violence.

129
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,415
What's interesting is that
all of the assailants...

130
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:26,185
are living in Hera Palace, the
symbol of wealth in Gangnam.

131
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,925
They were apparently known as
members of "Little Hera Club"...

132
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:32,125
and used their influence at
school to get what they wanted...

133
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,165
- all this time.
- What if I get expelled, Mom?

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,925
I was accepted because
of Ms. Cheon too.

135
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:40,035
Don't worry. You have me.

136
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:47,136
Wait! Listen to me. What
in the world are you doing?

137
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,045
No, Mom!

138
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,305
Let go!

139
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,586
Darn it! Let go of me!

140
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:56,415
Honey!

141
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,355
- Take them away.
- Let go!

142
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,225
- Let go of me!
- Mom!

143
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,696
- Let go.
- Mom!

144
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,066
- Dad!
- Mom.

145
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,035
Dad!

146
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:18,406
Dad!

147
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,985
What happened to Chairman Joo?

148
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,485
The investigation will
take longer than expected.

149
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,956
They took all the secret
ledgers in the office...

150
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,026
and there's nothing we can do.

151
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,795
I should've prevented
this from the start.

152
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,735
Everyone at Hera Club
has been arrested too.

153
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,966
I think they'll investigate
Min Seol A's death as well.

154
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,875
The police raided Hera Palace
and the place is a mess.

155
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:55,776
The police?

156
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,946
Ro Na. My daughter.

157
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:12,456
The police reopened...

158
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:15,266
the case regarding the
death of Min at Hera Palace.

159
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,935
They're closing
in on those who...

160
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,836
entered the building that day.

161
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:22,105
Police is especially looking
at her contact history...

162
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:24,175
- within days of...
- Is this the end?

163
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:27,646
They're focusing on Min's
whereabouts days prior to her death.

164
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,305
The police is highly suspecting
foul play and murder...

165
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,245
- It was clearly...
- It was clearly...

166
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,946
- a coerced confession...
- a coerced confession...

167
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,485
- under duress.
- under duress.

168
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,326
If you have thoughts of
your own, say something.

169
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:43,926
Why should we be
here for questioning?

170
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,995
Shim Su Ryeon set this up to
gain an advantage in her divorce.

171
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:51,836
The two are preparing to go
to court to get divorced.

172
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:54,566
The bottom line is money.

173
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,265
The family is so filthy rich,

174
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,806
so Shim Su Ryeon...

175
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:02,475
is desperate to get
leverage on her husband.

176
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,816
Why else would she
have locked us up...

177
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,115
and threatened us?

178
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,816
What else could
I've done to live?

179
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,786
I had to say what
she wanted to hear.

180
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,186
Don't you think?

181
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:15,286
- Shim Su Ryeon's out of her mind.
- Why should we be questioned?

182
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,796
Is there proof that the
dead girl is her daughter?

183
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,525
You're suspected
of taking bribes...

184
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,796
and doing favors for
students for years.

185
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,096
Will you say
anything about that?

186
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,036
Mr. Prosecutor.

187
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,005
I'm rich.

188
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,306
I could spend 100,000 dollars
every month until I die...

189
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,676
and still have a fortune left.

190
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,076
So why...

191
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:38,716
would I accept a subpar
student over some chump change?

192
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,115
My pride wouldn't allow that.

193
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:46,056
I wonder who the
whistle-blower is.

194
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,586
Is it Gu Ho Dong?

195
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:49,855
I can't confirm anything.

196
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:53,495
He's the only one who'd
talk such nonsense.

197
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:55,826
But that fool...

198
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,936
is a fraud who took a job
under a false identity.

199
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,966
He's trying to slander my foundation
under his alias Gu Ho Dong.

200
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,735
How will you explain how
your daughter was accepted?

201
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:09,145
We obtained originals of her
performance test and scores.

202
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,816
We even have the file
you falsified yourself...

203
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,245
in evidence.

204
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,495
Is this what you call a scandal
behind an entrance exam?

205
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,796
Classical music students...

206
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,235
are chosen according
to future potential.

207
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,865
We listen to their voices...

208
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,936
and pick those who have
most potential to improve.

209
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:43,446
A minor mistake that day isn't
a reason to drop a student.

210
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:46,346
Is this what you call evidence?

211
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:51,155
Do you know the amount of
harm you caused my foundation?

212
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:54,755
I will make an issue of this.

213
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,796
I'll sue for slander
and compensation.

214
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,725
Everything.

215
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,155
What are you painting, Mom?

216
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,566
The house I'll live in later.

217
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,536
Isn't it pretty?

218
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,696
I prefer apartments.

219
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:44,105
Still, if you move,
I'll move too.

220
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,846
I'll stick to you for
the rest of my life.

221
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:49,846
Even after marriage.

222
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,475
I pity Mom so much.

223
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:03,956
Why are you here?

224
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,096
How dare you?

225
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,936
I was worried about you.

226
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:14,466
How two-faced.

227
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,066
You did that when
you're worried for us?

228
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,735
You reported Dad, didn't you?

229
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:21,846
Are you trying to
ruin our family?

230
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,046
Are you pleased to
get your revenge?

231
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,475
Your dad...

232
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,946
is paying the price
for what he did.

233
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,015
That's only right.

234
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,056
I'm sick of all that
right and wrong.

235
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,125
Are we really a family?

236
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:42,495
Shouldn't a family cover-up
for each other's mistakes?

237
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,836
Do you only value your
biological daughter and not us?

238
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,005
We're your kids too.

239
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,966
You were our mom!

240
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,036
Was it all a lie?

241
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:56,505
No. No, it wasn't a lie.

242
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:00,546
I swear that I never once
thought you weren't my kids.

243
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,385
If you really thought
we were a family,

244
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,586
you couldn't have done this.

245
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:11,355
I don't want to
see you. Get out.

246
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,566
Get out of our house!

247
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,395
- Get out!
- Seok Kyung, get a grip.

248
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:19,966
Say something, Seok Hoon.

249
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,905
Can you understand her
or what she did to us?

250
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,576
Why did you come here? You
knew it wouldn't end well.

251
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,916
I'm very sorry for you both.

252
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,346
But...

253
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,556
it was something I had to do.

254
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,755
Only then could I forgive you...

255
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,625
and go back.

256
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,596
I know I'm the reason of
your reckless behaviors.

257
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:52,796
And that penalty.

258
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,066
I'll pay for it for
the rest of my life.

259
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,975
Until I die, as your mom...

260
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,846
You can let that dead
brat call you mom.

261
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:15,255
We need time.

262
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,725
We're trying to understand you,

263
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,025
so leave for now.

264
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:30,166
I'm here, so don't worry
too much and leave.

265
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,005
I will take good
care of the kids.

266
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:35,875
Thank you.

267
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,515
If something happens to them,

268
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,286
please call me.

269
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:43,086
I will.

270
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,615
Ro Na.

271
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:18,416
Ro Na. Bae Ro Na.

272
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,525
What are you doing here?

273
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:27,826
Where's Ro Na?

274
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,306
Ro Na.

275
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,875
Where's Ro Na.

276
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:44,446
Did you do something to her?

277
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:48,515
What do you think I did?

278
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,716
Su Ryeon!

279
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,086
If you so much as
touched her hair,

280
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,355
I really won't let it go.

281
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,125
What will you do, then?

282
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:59,755
Will you kill me too?

283
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,125
I see you value your
daughter's life.

284
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,436
Tell me. Where is Ro Na?

285
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,306
Seol A said you were nice
and was grateful toward you.

286
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:14,336
When she was abandoned by
the only person she trusted,

287
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:17,306
did you stop to think just
once how she must've felt?

288
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:20,275
I'm a thousand times
more disgusted...

289
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,186
than when I thought
Seo Jin had killed her.

290
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,186
Nothing happened
to Ro Na, right?

291
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,485
If something happens
to her, I'll die.

292
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,686
I'd rather you kill me
and leave her alone.

293
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:32,755
No.

294
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:38,196
You need to feel what
it's like to lose a child.

295
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,365
Isn't it only fair for you
to go through the same thing?

296
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:48,846
Su Ryeon. It's all my fault.

297
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:52,745
I did it, so please
leave Ro Na alone.

298
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,786
She didn't do anything wrong.

299
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,956
My daughter is my life.

300
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:04,025
I was drunk and out
of my mind that night.

301
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,756
I wasn't in my right mind.

302
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:10,066
The day you told me Seol
A was your daughter,

303
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:12,695
that's when I remembered.

304
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:16,066
I couldn't believe
what I'd done.

305
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:19,476
It's true, please, believe me.

306
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:23,605
Turn yourself in.

307
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,615
- What?
- Admit to what you did...

308
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:31,185
- and pay the price.
- What about Ro Na, then?

309
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,455
Must she be branded as a
murderer's daughter for life?

310
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,496
No, no.

311
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,395
That will kill her.

312
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:43,425
You know very well
what Ro Na's like.

313
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,935
So why did you do such a thing?

314
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:50,635
Why did you do something you can't
turn back for a spot in Cheong A?

315
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:53,736
Su Ryeon. Seol A's already dead.

316
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,006
The living must go on.

317
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:58,875
I'll be really good to you.

318
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:02,115
I'll make it up to you and
Seol A for the rest of my life.

319
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,546
Please, Su Ryeon.

320
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,115
Is it okay for the
rest to just move on?

321
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,056
Is it over if you
just cover it up?

322
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,655
Is that why you
sided with Dan Tae?

323
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:16,465
How could you betray
me? How could you?

324
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,205
I will expose...

325
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,175
the whole truth.

326
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:32,246
The fact that Seol
A had a mom too.

327
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,346
I'll prove it.

328
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,855
Su Ryeon. You can't, please.

329
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,556
I beg of you.

330
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:43,925
Ro Na can't find
out. Please don't.

331
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,695
Give me some time.

332
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,665
I'll send her abroad
so she won't find out.

333
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,365
Then I'll turn
myself in as you say.

334
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:55,336
I promise. Please, Su Ryeon.

335
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,736
Please, help me.

336
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,276
Ms. Shim, I got the ice cream.

337
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,276
Mom. What are you doing?

338
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:07,746
Ro Na.

339
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,256
Why didn't you answer your
phone? I was so worried.

340
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,016
I left my phone at home.

341
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,986
What's up with you?

342
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,655
Can you tell me?

343
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,796
No, it's nothing.

344
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:21,326
Go to your room and rest.

345
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,365
I'll explain.

346
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,566
Your mom can't seem
to tell you herself.

347
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,566
Su Ryeon.

348
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:31,506
Stop it.

349
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:35,006
I get it. I'll do
as you say tomorrow.

350
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,375
So please, please stop.

351
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,316
Don't. Stop here.

352
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:40,576
You'd better...

353
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:42,915
keep your word.

354
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,385
I have to go.

355
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,726
Mom, are you okay?

356
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,496
Yes.

357
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:03,205
I feel a bit dizzy.

358
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:06,476
I need to get some rest.

359
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,816
Mom. Did you see the news?

360
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,016
Hera Palace was
turned upside-down.

361
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,945
Min Seol A, the girl who got
into Cheong A in first place.

362
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,655
Apparently, she
died in Hera Palace.

363
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,155
It was possibly
murder, not suicide.

364
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:28,566
I don't know what's going on.

365
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:30,925
We lived in her
apartment for a while.

366
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,465
Mr. Joo, Ms. Cheon,

367
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:36,236
even Jenny and Min
Hyuk's parents...

368
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,836
are all being questioned
by the police.

369
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,546
I need some rest.

370
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:56,826
What should I do, Ro Na?

371
00:20:57,885 --> 00:21:01,056
If I turn myself in, the
whole world will come for us.

372
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:04,365
It's all over.

373
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,836
Mom ruined your life.

374
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:16,746
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL
PERFORMANCE EXAM, 2020

375
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,516
Is it true Ha Eun
Byeol got in illicitly?

376
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,816
She well and truly
ruined her entrance exam.

377
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,016
The mom who shielded her is
being grilled by prosecutors.

378
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,385
Is this how she'll get
kicked out? Oh, dear.

379
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:28,425
I hated how she acted
like a princess.

380
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,455
Her social media and
personal details got hacked.

381
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,125
I bet she can't
show her face again.

382
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:36,226
Over 50,000 people signed a
petition to have her expelled.

383
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:37,526
Get Ha Eun Byeol's out!

384
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,476
REFERENCE ROOM

385
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,115
How many times must I say?

386
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:27,976
There was a party that night,

387
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:30,385
and that's where we all were.

388
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:32,115
For a short while...

389
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:37,086
I saw about 20 people that day
with golf bags in our elevator.

390
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:40,826
How many hours do you
keep a person here?

391
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:45,465
You created a paper company
to launder your slush fund.

392
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:48,965
This document is from Logan Lee.

393
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:50,705
He gave it to Mr. Joo himself...

394
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,675
when he visited J King Holdings.

395
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:56,046
Mr. Lawyer, as you know.

396
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,915
this isn't a question that
you can answer in his place.

397
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,546
I know, but...

398
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:04,915
Did you accept money or valuables
from parents in return...

399
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:06,516
for accepting a student?

400
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:07,586
No.

401
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,326
What's this doctored file...

402
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:12,256
we found on your computer
about the entrance exam scores?

403
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:15,066
I never made such a file.

404
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:17,195
Then who made this?

405
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,465
I have no idea.

406
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:19,836
SUSPECT INTERROGATION

407
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:23,265
Why was it found in your office
if you never made the file?

408
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:26,076
I never saw that
document before.

409
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:31,945
Sir. You've been at
work for a long time.

410
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:33,346
How about a break?

411
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,615
You did well, Ms. Cheon.

412
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:37,685
Get a good night's sleep.

413
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,885
I'll prepare for the next
round of questioning.

414
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,026
You did well too, Mr. Park.

415
00:23:45,395 --> 00:23:47,355
Dr. Ha's also at the
police station...

416
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:49,226
giving a witness statement.

417
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:53,036
I'm tired. Let's go home.

418
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,326
Eun Byeol.

419
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:01,705
Eun Byeol?

420
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,635
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

421
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,276
Eun Byeol. What's
wrong? Eun Byeol!

422
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,746
Eun Byeol! Wake up! No!

423
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:15,746
Eun Byeol!

424
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:19,316
Oxygen saturation's falling.

425
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:22,256
Eun Byeol, you can't
die! Eun Byeol!

426
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:25,596
If you die... Mom will die too!

427
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,526
Are we there yet? She's dying!

428
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,165
Eun Byeol!

429
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:33,836
- She overdosed.
- Eun Byeol.

430
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,536
Eun Byeol! What's
wrong with her?

431
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,076
Eun Byeol! Eun
Byeol, Mom's here.

432
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:40,736
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

433
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,705
Why is she so cold?

434
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,306
Vitals.

435
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:45,915
Hurry, do something.

436
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,346
She's so cold.

437
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:49,846
Quickly.

438
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:51,786
- The rate's going too fast.
- Intubate!

439
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:52,855
Okay.

440
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,355
200 joules. Clear.

441
00:25:55,986 --> 00:25:57,385
- Not yet.
- 250 joules.

442
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:59,395
250 joules. Clear.

443
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,215
Mom!

444
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,286
2020 CHEONG A ARTS HIGH
SCHOOL ADMISSION CEREMONY

445
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,195
She's back.

446
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:39,865
Eun Byeol.

447
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:44,435
Ms. Cheon!

448
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,306
Where are you?

449
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:20,306
Where are you right
now, Shim Su Ryeon?

450
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:34,786
Cheon Seo Jin.

451
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,276
Please.

452
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:55,506
Please stop now.

453
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,476
Please stop.

454
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,145
I'm begging you.

455
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:08,355
Please save...

456
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:11,355
my daughter Eun Byeol.

457
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:17,326
I really didn't
kill your daughter.

458
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:18,796
I know...

459
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,766
you didn't kill her.

460
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:36,086
What is it?

461
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:38,115
I'm sorry sir. Someone's
blocking the car.

462
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:43,486
What do you want?

463
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:46,256
I waited to ask you for a favor.

464
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:51,326
You knew it?

465
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,766
Then why are you doing this?

466
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:56,165
Then...

467
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:59,336
do you think that
makes you innocent?

468
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,476
You disrespected Seol A,
confined and threatened her,

469
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:06,215
and even made a fake
will to insult her death.

470
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:11,346
On top of that, you even had
an affair with my husband.

471
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,915
Before my two eyes.

472
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,596
What's so unfair
about everything?

473
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,355
So?

474
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:24,566
You're willing to keep going?

475
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,435
My daughter almost
killed herself!

476
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:33,175
Will you be satisfied
if she dies?

477
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,875
That's your problem.

478
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:36,846
Didn't you bring all
of this upon yourself?

479
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:39,346
Please stop.

480
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:41,846
Please stop now.

481
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:44,016
This is a problem
between us adults.

482
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:47,316
Do you have the right
to hurt my daughter?

483
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:48,955
Did you have the right...

484
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,125
to hurt Seol A?

485
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,596
Your daughter will suffer
just the same as her.

486
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,695
I have no intention of stopping.

487
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:01,596
I'll submit all the evidence
I gathered to the police...

488
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:05,105
and even if they refuse, I'll
keep trying again and again.

489
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:08,175
I'm willing to do anything
to prove your sins.

490
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,875
If you really want
to protect Eun Byeol,

491
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:15,246
admit to your sins and
receive punishment.

492
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,016
Step down as the director
and never teach again.

493
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,556
I can't do that.

494
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:22,556
Do you know how I got that
position? That's all I have!

495
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,895
You still can't give
up that position?

496
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:30,496
Even when your
daughter is dying?

497
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:33,965
Is your ambition and greed
more important than your child?

498
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,105
Stop blabbering.
What do you know?

499
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,875
You'd better get a grip if
you want to save your child.

500
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:44,846
You're a mom too.

501
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,875
Give up everything and
pay for your sins...

502
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,115
for you and Eun Byeol's sake.

503
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,385
If you don't, I don't care...

504
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:56,185
if Eun Byeol gets hurt or not.

505
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:17,675
Fine. Go on and try it.

506
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,046
Let's see who wins in the end.

507
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:24,115
I won't let you have your way.

508
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,125
Is that so?

509
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,125
Oh. I almost forgot.

510
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:38,195
I'm sorry for revealing
the video of you...

511
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:40,236
and Joo Dan Tae's affair.

512
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:42,905
What?

513
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:47,576
I know it's over between you
two. I guess I was thoughtless.

514
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:51,605
You didn't know?

515
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:55,276
Joo Dan Tae has already
fallen for Oh Yoon Hee.

516
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:58,885
That's nonsense.

517
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:02,286
Why would he fall for a
wench like Oh Yoon Hee?

518
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,056
Do you think you can fool
me with your rubbish?

519
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,625
Do you still trust Joo Dan Tae?

520
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:09,766
Then go check for yourself.

521
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:15,266
You left Eun Byeol like that
just for a jerk like him?

522
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,276
I pity you, Cheon Seo Jin.

523
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:42,996
Get rid of...

524
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,665
Shim Su Ryeon.

525
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,135
What did you say?

526
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:54,336
You want me to
kill Shim Su Ryeon?

527
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,076
Shim Su Ryeon isn't...

528
00:32:57,306 --> 00:32:59,615
someone you should
underestimate.

529
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:03,086
No, she already has too
much power in her hands.

530
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:04,316
What do you mean?

531
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,215
Logan Lee was the one
who was helping her.

532
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,955
She joined hands with Logan Lee.

533
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,556
I checked with my own eyes.

534
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,756
I know. He's the one who
reported me to the police.

535
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,526
I'm so furious I
found out too late.

536
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:21,836
Yet you won't do
anything about it?

537
00:33:23,105 --> 00:33:26,875
Shim Su Ryeon is really
a terrifying woman.

538
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,806
This fight won't be easy.

539
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,506
You must stop it now. Or else,

540
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,615
you and I are both done for.

541
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:39,986
But can I ask why?

542
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:44,826
Why are you so desperate
to kill Shim Su Ryeon?

543
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:46,726
I'm just curious.

544
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:49,895
That's because...

545
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,705
Su Ryeon found out
about our relationship.

546
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:01,135
She even knows I'm
helping you right now.

547
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,276
We have no choice.

548
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:07,546
She has lost her mind. She's
even threatening Ro Na.

549
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,786
She might get both of us
arrested for embezzlement.

550
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,085
I won't let them
get away with it.

551
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:16,025
Shim Su Ryeon and
that punk Logan Lee.

552
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:18,856
Su Ryeon now thinks...

553
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,496
you and I have become one.

554
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:27,565
She thinks we're both her
enemy she must get revenge.

555
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:32,576
We can't just sit
back and do nothing.

556
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,306
Don't worry.

557
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:40,146
You've fallen in danger
while helping me.

558
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,076
Of course, I'll protect you.

559
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:45,045
Leave Shim Su Ryeon up to me.

560
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:46,985
It won't take long.

561
00:34:52,856 --> 00:34:54,096
Oh Yoon Hee!

562
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:01,596
Explain why you're
here with him.

563
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,865
Tell me! What were
you doing with him?

564
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:06,275
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

565
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,775
What's your
relationship with him?

566
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,215
Did you sleep with him? Did you?

567
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:14,916
Did you sleep with him?

568
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,215
Tell me yourself. Tell me now!

569
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:19,956
Take your hands off my woman!

570
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:23,786
What?

571
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:28,626
What did you just say?

572
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,365
How could you do
this to me? How?

573
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:34,896
You deceived me?

574
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:38,465
You said it wasn't Oh Yoon
Hee. How dare you fool me?

575
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:39,876
How dare you?

576
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,376
Stop it!

577
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,405
I'm sick and tired of you.

578
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,576
Do you even have the time
to be jealous right now?

579
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,246
Go and protect your
foundation instead.

580
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,516
Stop being so clingy!

581
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:05,695
Joo Dan Tae. You scum!

582
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,365
Stop!

583
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:27,615
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

584
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:29,473
Get up. Let's go.

585
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,903
I said I'm not going.

586
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:34,043
How can I go to school
when our family is a mess?

587
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,374
Listen to me. This is more
serious than you think.

588
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,983
I'm your guardian as of
today, so just do as I say.

589
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:42,014
Why are you the
guardian when I'm here?

590
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:47,354
Are you okay, Dad?

591
00:36:47,694 --> 00:36:49,923
Everything is okay, right?
Will our family be fine?

592
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,663
Is what they said
on the news true?

593
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:55,794
I'll take care of that,
so don't worry about it.

594
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:57,834
Get to school.

595
00:36:58,304 --> 00:36:59,804
You must stay more confident
in this type of situation.

596
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:02,703
Show them that no
one can mess with us.

597
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,804
I don't care about
anything else.

598
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:07,144
I don't care who you meet...

599
00:37:07,273 --> 00:37:09,243
or how much you're criticized.

600
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:16,383
But I can't tolerate with
our family becoming poor.

601
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,394
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL

602
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:27,864
Is this why they say "Birds
of a feather flock together"?

603
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:29,194
How brazen of them.

604
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:31,933
If it were me, I'd be so
embarrassed to come to school.

605
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,804
- Their parents are nasty too.
- How despicable.

606
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:35,633
My goodness, you
give me the creeps.

607
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:37,304
You really came to school?

608
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:40,603
His sense of shamelessness
is scaring me.

609
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:44,743
Look at this dude.

610
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:48,353
How dare you block my way?

611
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:52,683
Why? Do you have a
problem? Hit me then.

612
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:55,054
Hit me. Go on.

613
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:56,194
Hit me.

614
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,924
Seok Hoon, you know how to
control your temper now.

615
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:04,133
I saw the news yesterday and your
family is about to be ruined.

616
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,873
His dad is a total swindler.

617
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,674
He even had a nasty affair.

618
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,344
What will happen now?

619
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:15,814
Will you and Eun
Byeol become sisters?

620
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:18,413
"Joo" Eun Byeol?

621
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:21,954
Hey! Stop it.

622
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:24,584
I know. Aren't you
guys our friends?

623
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:26,723
We already have
enough to worry about.

624
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,093
You really must be worried.

625
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:30,993
Since the news said Min
Seol A was tormented...

626
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,993
by you and your parents.

627
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:35,134
Look at Ha Eun Byeol.

628
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,334
She's too embarrassed
to come to school.

629
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,134
Shut your mouth!

630
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:40,734
You piece of trash!

631
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:43,873
You little...

632
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:47,174
- You piece of trash!
- You piece of trash!

633
00:38:47,473 --> 00:38:48,914
- You piece of trash!
- You piece of trash!

634
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:51,584
- You piece of trash!
- You piece of trash!

635
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,313
- You piece of trash!
- You piece of trash!

636
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,414
Stop it!

637
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,114
How brazen.

638
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:02,723
Do you think you guys
did nothing wrong?

639
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:06,424
You looked on and did nothing
when they were the assailants.

640
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,634
Now that the situation has
changed, you're bullying them?

641
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,894
You guys are the same.

642
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:14,973
Hey. Are you trying to protect Seok
Hoon since he's your boyfriend?

643
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:19,304
Ro Na. Seok Hoon's era is over.

644
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:22,014
Why don't we go out now?

645
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:23,273
Don't we look good together?

646
00:39:24,484 --> 00:39:25,544
Don't we make a good couple?

647
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,183
Hey, stop it!

648
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:30,713
Hey!

649
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:32,354
You wench!

650
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:38,523
Come over here!

651
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:48,503
Stop!

652
00:39:53,704 --> 00:39:56,243
What are you doing at
this sacred school?

653
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:59,144
They picked a fight and
threw trash at us first!

654
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,914
That's not true. Seok Kyung
grabbed her by the hair first.

655
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:02,984
Quiet down!

656
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:05,884
The school is chaotic
enough already.

657
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:07,283
Who told you to fight like this?

658
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:10,623
Get back to your
classrooms. Now!

659
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:12,993
Get going!

660
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:22,473
Joo Seok Hoon, Joo Seok Kyung,

661
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:24,574
Yoo Jenny, Lee Min Hyuk, stop.

662
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,804
You can't just leave like this.

663
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:29,973
Aren't you going to
clean up this trash?

664
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:32,713
We didn't do it. They
threw the trash at us.

665
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:33,984
We're victims.

666
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:38,924
How dare you talk
back to your teacher?

667
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:42,524
You all get two penalty points.

668
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:46,563
Also, clean the bathrooms
after class today.

669
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:51,734
Bae Ro Na. Why are you
staring at me like that?

670
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,534
Aren't you friends with them?

671
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:55,674
Come here and pick up the trash.

672
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:57,404
Now.

673
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:00,373
You know that you're
the worst, right?

674
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:08,753
Eun Byeol.

675
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:11,854
Mom won't go down like this.

676
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,753
I promise I'll rise back up.

677
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:18,493
You trust me, right?

678
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,464
Are you listening to me?

679
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:32,243
My daughter, Eun Byeol.
You should get up...

680
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:37,513
and eat something nice with me.

681
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:40,813
I'll make pasta
and wait for you.

682
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:18,784
- Search thoroughly!
- Yes, sir!

683
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:24,123
Where's the guest in this room?

684
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:25,893
He already checked out.

685
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:29,034
Go to the airport right away.

686
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,193
Yes, sir.

687
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:34,133
Catch him and bring
him to me at all costs!

688
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:35,174
Yes, sir.

689
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:39,743
Did you take all my
stuff out of the hotel?

690
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:43,914
Good work, Mr. Hong.
I'll see you in the US.

691
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:46,883
You should be careful too.

692
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:53,054
It seems like Oh Yoon Hee told Joo
Dan Tae about our relationship.

693
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,724
Well...

694
00:42:55,724 --> 00:42:57,823
She had nowhere else to go.

695
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:00,123
Did you report Oh Yoon
Hee to the police?

696
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:05,333
She promised she'd
turn herself in today.

697
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,133
Do you think she'll
keep that promise?

698
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,974
She'll never turn
herself in voluntarily.

699
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,073
That's...

700
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:16,513
up to her.

701
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:19,484
I will keep...

702
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,054
the promise I made with Seol A.

703
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:27,054
Let's go to the States together.

704
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:30,524
The only thing left is
for you to become happy.

705
00:43:31,393 --> 00:43:32,424
I promised Seol A...

706
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:35,534
that I'd make sure her
mom becomes happy too.

707
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:41,203
I can't leave.

708
00:43:41,474 --> 00:43:43,203
Joo Dan Tae is
after you right now.

709
00:43:43,873 --> 00:43:46,344
You shouldn't be here
at least until...

710
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,344
he's punished by the law.

711
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:50,844
Then what about Seok
Hoon and Seok Kyung?

712
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:53,383
I'm their mom.

713
00:43:53,484 --> 00:43:54,583
Do you think...

714
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:57,414
they want you as their mom?

715
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:00,083
There are things
you can't change.

716
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,654
Didn't you know you wouldn't
be able to go back to them...

717
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:07,193
the moment you decided
to avenge for Seol A?

718
00:44:10,034 --> 00:44:12,034
I can't leave my
children in his hands.

719
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:20,174
It's a plane ticket for tonight.

720
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:21,943
I've prepared everything.

721
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:23,443
You must not put
this off any longer.

722
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:27,643
I told Hye In that
you're coming too.

723
00:44:40,724 --> 00:44:41,794
Thank you.

724
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:44,133
I mean it.

725
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,774
I'll wait until you come.

726
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:54,943
I won't leave alone.

727
00:45:04,654 --> 00:45:05,723
I'm so tired.

728
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,424
You told us not to
worry. What is all this?

729
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:10,424
I can't believe I got
investigated by the cops.

730
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,764
I'm the most honest
and just woman ever.

731
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:16,333
You're the exact
opposite of that.

732
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:20,134
Why are you taking
it out on my husband?

733
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,674
He even bought
you hangover soup.

734
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:23,534
We all got
investigated all night.

735
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:25,374
Gosh, I don't even have the
strength to keep my eyes open.

736
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:26,374
What...

737
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:29,943
And I helped you get
summoned as a witness.

738
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:32,183
I don't get why you're so angry.

739
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:35,054
Did you do something
that we don't know about?

740
00:45:35,953 --> 00:45:38,953
Why were you so intimidated
in front of the police?

741
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:41,083
It was so embarrassing.

742
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,654
Watch what you say.
I wasn't intimidated.

743
00:45:43,754 --> 00:45:45,693
I'm a lawyer for goodness' sake.

744
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:47,894
I'm already pretty upset that
I had to get investigated...

745
00:45:48,494 --> 00:45:50,034
by the police.

746
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:54,363
Min Hyuk shouldn't have hung
around with those terrible kids.

747
00:45:55,073 --> 00:45:56,774
Not a single person
in our family...

748
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:59,843
is capable of doing
something so horrible.

749
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:04,744
Are you blaming this on Jenny?

750
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:07,744
Then do you think it
was Min Hyuk's fault?

751
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:08,953
How dare you!

752
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:13,154
What are you all staring at?

753
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:15,593
You're being too
obvious, you know.

754
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,794
What? Is it your first
time to see a celebrity?

755
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,304
Our names made it to the
top real-time search list,

756
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,433
and our faces came out
on every news channel.

757
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:29,304
We've become celebrities now.

758
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,073
We'll only end up embarrassing
ourselves here. Let's go.

759
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,504
Honey, you must be tired.

760
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,124
You're here.

761
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:47,953
Where's her mother?

762
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:50,154
She went to take
care of something.

763
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:52,093
What does she need to do when
her daughter is in this state?

764
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:55,193
They washed out her stomach,

765
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,634
and her pulse and breathing
are back to normal.

766
00:46:57,733 --> 00:47:01,333
Shut your mouth and
just go to your boss.

767
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,284
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

768
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:23,924
I'm sorry I wasn't there...

769
00:47:24,823 --> 00:47:26,524
to protect you.

770
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,963
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

771
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:43,073
Eun Byeol.

772
00:47:43,914 --> 00:47:45,244
Eun Byeol, are you awake?

773
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:47,613
It's me, your dad.
Can you recognize me?

774
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:54,554
Eun Byeol, why did you do that?
Why would you that to yourself?

775
00:48:00,863 --> 00:48:01,863
Eun Byeol.

776
00:48:04,963 --> 00:48:06,164
Eun Byeol?

777
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:18,644
Of course.

778
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:22,254
I'll make sure not to ruin the
reputation of our foundation.

779
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:23,884
You trust me, right?

780
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:26,853
It'd be great...

781
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:29,723
if you show the prosecution
that you're strongly against...

782
00:48:32,193 --> 00:48:33,924
the investigation.

783
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,233
I'll call you again.

784
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:42,874
How can you be here right now...

785
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:44,804
after what happened
to Eun Byeol?

786
00:48:46,744 --> 00:48:48,443
Are you blaming it all on me?

787
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:51,073
Do you think you didn't
do anything wrong?

788
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:52,284
Eun Byeol...

789
00:48:56,054 --> 00:48:57,254
Eun Byeol won't talk.

790
00:48:57,983 --> 00:48:59,024
What?

791
00:49:00,554 --> 00:49:01,794
She's awake?

792
00:49:02,093 --> 00:49:05,093
She's regained her consciousness,
but she won't say anything.

793
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:07,164
I think she has
psychogenic aphasia.

794
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:10,463
"Aphasia"?

795
00:49:16,774 --> 00:49:19,644
It's probably temporary
since she just woke up.

796
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:21,943
Don't worry.

797
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:24,774
I'll have her
receive treatment...

798
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:27,744
once I deal with the foundation.

799
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:29,284
I'm busy. You should go.

800
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:41,463
Seo Jin.

801
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:44,193
Please get to your senses.

802
00:49:45,603 --> 00:49:48,304
How can the foundation
matter in this situation?

803
00:49:49,274 --> 00:49:50,333
It matters.

804
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:52,544
Eun Byeol will get better...

805
00:49:53,603 --> 00:49:55,744
once everything
returns to normal.

806
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,213
She'll go to school,

807
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:01,044
eat well, and fervently
practice singing.

808
00:50:02,514 --> 00:50:03,884
I trust my daughter.

809
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:08,284
I'm going to make
her quit school...

810
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:10,953
and take her to my hometown.

811
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:14,624
I don't want to be the director
of Cheong A Medical Center.

812
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:17,193
You two-faced jerk.

813
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:22,634
You always act just
and conscientious.

814
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:25,544
But stop being so pretentious.

815
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:29,813
You denied having done
anything to Min Seol A...

816
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:32,343
when the cops asked
you about her.

817
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:35,953
You obviously don't want to
end up becoming a criminal.

818
00:50:38,183 --> 00:50:40,453
You're no different from
the other Hera Club members.

819
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,654
No, you're even worse.

820
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:44,823
You're so quick
to condemn others,

821
00:50:44,823 --> 00:50:47,664
and you only care about
the well-being of yourself.

822
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,494
Stop acting like you
care about Eun Byeol.

823
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:53,433
I'm the only person
who can protect her.

824
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:54,433
Yes, that's right!

825
00:50:56,274 --> 00:50:57,504
I'm surprised you didn't
know that earlier.

826
00:50:58,404 --> 00:50:59,674
That's exactly who I am.

827
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:02,774
But I won't give
up on Eun Byeol.

828
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:06,544
I won't let you
raise her anymore.

829
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:35,313
Hello, sir.

830
00:51:35,414 --> 00:51:39,044
It's me, Cheon Seo Jin.

831
00:51:42,113 --> 00:51:44,313
I called to ask you for help.

832
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:48,453
The irregularities
regarding the foundation...

833
00:51:55,264 --> 00:51:56,634
Please help me out.

834
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:23,853
It's me, Yoon Hee.

835
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:25,294
Is everything okay?

836
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:27,764
I was getting worried and
was just about to call.

837
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,634
What are you going
to do about Su Ryeon?

838
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:31,634
I'm so nervous.

839
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:33,534
Who knows what she might do?

840
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:36,603
Why are you so nervous?
I'm Joo Dan Tae.

841
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:40,203
She tried so hard to destroy
me, but see? I'm fine.

842
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:43,713
Su Ryeon will never
be able to beat me.

843
00:52:44,613 --> 00:52:45,813
Don't worry and just wait.

844
00:52:59,664 --> 00:53:00,664
Yes?

845
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:03,693
Is this Unit 4502? Please come
down and take your parcel.

846
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:07,664
I'm busy right now. I'll
go pick it up later.

847
00:53:22,714 --> 00:53:23,754
Hello?

848
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:27,823
Ms. Oh Yoon Hee, I'm calling
from Gangnam Police Station.

849
00:53:29,294 --> 00:53:30,554
What's the matter?

850
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:32,623
You must visit the station...

851
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:34,724
to answer some questions
regarding J King Holdings.

852
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:39,234
Okay, I will.

853
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:53,643
You have until today
to turn yourself in.

854
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:55,784
If you don't, I won't be
able to guarantee anything.

855
00:54:00,524 --> 00:54:03,823
You need to feel what
it's like to lose a child.

856
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:07,663
Isn't it only fair for you
to go through the same thing?

857
00:54:11,534 --> 00:54:13,034
Aren't you ready yet?

858
00:54:13,434 --> 00:54:15,304
I don't intend to forgive you.

859
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:18,103
Hurry up and go to the
police station now.

860
00:54:18,103 --> 00:54:21,504
SU RYEON

861
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:25,073
If you refuse to cooperate,
Ro Na will end up...

862
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:26,413
just like Seol A.

863
00:54:40,623 --> 00:54:41,893
Please don't do this.

864
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,633
If you do anything
to my daughter,

865
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:47,063
I swear I won't stand still.

866
00:54:57,244 --> 00:54:59,444
With classical singing
in the very center,

867
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:01,643
- we are learning...
- Ro Na! Ro Na!

868
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:05,484
Mom.

869
00:55:05,954 --> 00:55:07,024
Are you okay?

870
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,393
Nothing happened, right?

871
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:10,754
What's the matter?

872
00:55:10,893 --> 00:55:12,063
Why would I not be okay?

873
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:14,623
Is Ro Na's mother crazy?
What's wrong with her?

874
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:18,264
Ms. Oh, you can't just
barge in here during class.

875
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:21,464
Ro Na and the kids had a fight,

876
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:23,073
but I didn't hit or scold her.

877
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:26,044
I'm sorry.

878
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:28,873
Mom, what's the matter?

879
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:30,673
You told me that
everything was okay.

880
00:55:30,673 --> 00:55:32,284
Why would you come
all the way to school?

881
00:55:32,744 --> 00:55:34,143
You're embarrassing me.

882
00:55:35,554 --> 00:55:36,583
I'm sorry.

883
00:55:37,054 --> 00:55:38,923
I must've been out of it.

884
00:55:39,823 --> 00:55:41,554
I just got really
anxious, you see.

885
00:55:42,254 --> 00:55:45,563
Don't ever come home
alone after school, okay?

886
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:49,593
Don't meet anyone. Don't
go to the academy either.

887
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:51,563
Come home right after school.

888
00:55:51,563 --> 00:55:53,403
Mom, are you going somewhere?

889
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:57,073
Mom.

890
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,103
Is it because of Ms. Shim?

891
00:56:01,843 --> 00:56:03,343
I don't know what's going on,

892
00:56:03,744 --> 00:56:06,044
but can't you just apologize?

893
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:09,684
She seems so sad these days.

894
00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:11,413
That's none of your business.

895
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:13,754
Just worry about
your own mother.

896
00:56:15,694 --> 00:56:16,754
To be honest,

897
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:19,893
I had a really hard
time when I quit school,

898
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:23,264
and I even thought of
committing suicide.

899
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:26,903
A car was speeding toward me,

900
00:56:28,004 --> 00:56:29,204
and I didn't want to move.

901
00:56:37,343 --> 00:56:39,044
Ro Na, are you okay?

902
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:42,883
Ms. Shim saved my life.

903
00:56:45,014 --> 00:56:47,024
She gave me a tight hug,

904
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:49,454
and it felt like...

905
00:56:50,194 --> 00:56:51,653
she was telling me...

906
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:54,224
to stay alive no matter what.

907
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:02,304
So if you did anything wrong,

908
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:04,173
just apologize to her first.

909
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:06,804
Do me a favor.

910
00:57:17,784 --> 00:57:20,224
Mom. Mom!

911
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:33,234
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

912
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:44,373
What am I thinking?

913
00:57:48,184 --> 00:57:49,514
I need to get to my senses.

914
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:58,093
You have until 6pm today.

915
00:57:58,593 --> 00:58:00,063
I won't wait any longer.

916
00:58:02,123 --> 00:58:03,194
Su Ryeon.

917
00:58:31,494 --> 00:58:33,764
MY FRIEND

918
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:40,163
MY FRIEND

919
00:58:52,913 --> 00:58:54,413
MY FRIEND

920
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:59,929
MS. YANG

921
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,224
Ms. Yang, what's the matter?

922
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:07,663
Ms. Shim, the chairman took
the kids to his study again!

923
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:24,974
Seok Hoon! Seok Kyung!

924
01:00:17,734 --> 01:00:19,264
SU RYEON

925
01:00:26,244 --> 01:00:28,204
The receiver cannot be reached.
Please leave a message...

926
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:44,423
Su Ryeon.

927
01:00:45,254 --> 01:00:46,363
Su Ryeon.

928
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:52,163
Su Ryeon, are you
okay? Su Ryeon.

929
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:57,573
What? Su Ryeon.

930
01:01:02,643 --> 01:01:03,714
Su Ryeon.

931
01:01:04,643 --> 01:01:06,343
Su Ryeon. Su Ryeon.

932
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:09,254
Su Ryeon, wake up!
Su Ryeon, don't die!

933
01:01:10,353 --> 01:01:14,653
No, please! Don't
die! Please don't die!

934
01:01:32,704 --> 01:01:34,843
My goodness, what happened?

935
01:01:37,843 --> 01:01:40,514
- My gosh, what's going on?
- Did someone get hurt?

936
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:45,883
You're under arrest
for committing murder.

937
01:01:45,923 --> 01:01:48,524
You may plead the Fifth, and you
have the right to an attorney.

938
01:01:48,883 --> 01:01:50,954
And you may request the court to
review the legality of your arrest.

939
01:01:52,663 --> 01:01:54,323
Ms. Yang, what happened?

940
01:01:54,593 --> 01:01:55,663
Ms. Shim...

941
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:00,234
Take her.

942
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:05,234
Did you kill her?

943
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:07,244
You killed my wife?

944
01:02:07,843 --> 01:02:09,744
How in the world
could you do this?

945
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:12,484
Hurry up and take her away.

946
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:28,123
- Mom.
- Mom.

947
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:29,264
- Mom.
- Mom.

948
01:02:29,264 --> 01:02:30,464
- Get off me!
- Mom!

949
01:02:30,464 --> 01:02:31,934
- Mom.
- Mom.

950
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:33,504
- Mom!
- Mom.

951
01:02:33,704 --> 01:02:35,163
- Mom.
- Let me go!

952
01:02:35,163 --> 01:02:36,403
- Mom.
- Mom.

953
01:02:36,403 --> 01:02:38,034
Will you please let go?

954
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,274
Get off me!

955
01:02:39,274 --> 01:02:40,903
- Mom!
- Mom.

956
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:42,873
- Mom.
- Mom.

957
01:02:44,643 --> 01:02:46,514
- Mom! Mom!
- Get off me!

958
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,284
- Calm down.
- Mom!

959
01:02:48,284 --> 01:02:49,454
- Calm down!
- Mom!

960
01:02:49,454 --> 01:02:51,214
Calm down. Calm down.

961
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,784
Calm down.

962
01:02:58,694 --> 01:03:00,694
There was a murder
incident at the penthouse?

963
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:03,163
How could something like
that happen in Hera Palace?

964
01:03:03,794 --> 01:03:04,964
Is this a lie?

965
01:03:06,063 --> 01:03:08,434
Is that... Is that
really Su Ryeon?

966
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:12,234
My goodness, what is this mess?

967
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:15,204
Isn't that Oh Yoon Hee?

968
01:03:15,403 --> 01:03:16,413
No way.

969
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:20,514
Wait, so she killed Su Ryeon?

970
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:24,454
That crazy witch!
She's not even human!

971
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:26,823
I can't believe this.

972
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:29,923
Search the entire place.

973
01:03:29,923 --> 01:03:31,024
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

974
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,004
Look at how she photoshopped
her face into the family photo.

975
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:43,673
She was a complete stalker.

976
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:47,673
This is creepy.

977
01:03:49,244 --> 01:03:51,073
Gosh, what is all this?

978
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:55,784
Look at all these
expensive bags and clothes.

979
01:03:58,484 --> 01:03:59,883
There's a knife missing.

980
01:04:00,153 --> 01:04:01,383
It's the one that was
used to kill the victim.

981
01:04:01,853 --> 01:04:03,024
Take it as evidence.

982
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,863
Who are you people?

983
01:04:16,873 --> 01:04:18,704
- Are you Oh Yoon Hee's daughter?
- Yes.

984
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:21,004
Why?

985
01:04:22,143 --> 01:04:23,913
What are you doing at my house?

986
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:25,944
What about my mom?

987
01:04:26,843 --> 01:04:27,984
Where is she?

988
01:04:28,843 --> 01:04:30,883
We repeat the announcement.

989
01:04:35,954 --> 01:04:38,694
Please come to Gate One.

990
01:04:38,694 --> 01:04:39,764
SIR, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

991
01:04:39,764 --> 01:04:41,494
Your attention, please.

992
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:43,694
Korean Airline...

993
01:04:43,694 --> 01:04:46,034
Another horrible incident
occurred at Hera Palace,

994
01:04:46,034 --> 01:04:48,304
the most expensive
apartment in Gangnam.

995
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:51,704
Shim got murdered
in her penthouse,

996
01:04:51,704 --> 01:04:55,103
and Oh, another resident of
the apartment, got arrested.

997
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:57,214
Shim, the resident
of the penthouse,

998
01:04:57,214 --> 01:05:00,083
died at the scene due
to excessive bleeding.

999
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:09,083
Taxi!

1000
01:05:13,663 --> 01:05:14,764
Taxi!

1001
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:30,673
I was on my way home
after grocery shopping,

1002
01:05:31,913 --> 01:05:34,014
and I saw the woman
from the 45th floor...

1003
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,254
using a card key to
enter the penthouse.

1004
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:39,484
I thought something was strange,

1005
01:05:40,423 --> 01:05:43,093
and I suddenly heard a
scream inside the house.

1006
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:45,194
I ran inside, and Ms. Shim...

1007
01:05:48,123 --> 01:05:50,133
She's the one who
killed her. I saw it.

1008
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,403
I saw her stabbing
Ms. Shim with a knife.

1009
01:05:54,603 --> 01:05:58,304
I was preparing to get
divorced with my wife.

1010
01:05:59,403 --> 01:06:01,444
My wife was seeing
another man...

1011
01:06:03,073 --> 01:06:04,873
and in order to go to
the States with him,

1012
01:06:06,944 --> 01:06:08,913
she kept demanding a divorce.

1013
01:06:09,913 --> 01:06:13,653
But once Oh Yoon
Hee found out...

1014
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,123
that we were getting a divorce,

1015
01:06:17,994 --> 01:06:19,694
that's when her
obsession started.

1016
01:06:19,923 --> 01:06:21,893
She called me continuously...

1017
01:06:22,964 --> 01:06:23,994
as if...

1018
01:06:25,393 --> 01:06:27,264
she was my wife.

1019
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:32,534
And she even sneaked into
our bedroom one night.

1020
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:35,744
I was so shocked.

1021
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,944
Are you talking about this?

1022
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:42,044
Oh, yes.

1023
01:06:43,214 --> 01:06:46,254
I installed a CCTV in our bedroom
because we had many valuables,

1024
01:06:47,024 --> 01:06:48,423
and she was caught on tape.

1025
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,353
She was wearing your
late wife's dress?

1026
01:06:54,764 --> 01:06:57,234
Were you ever
threatened directly?

1027
01:06:58,034 --> 01:07:02,204
Oh. She even said this to me.

1028
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,974
I recorded it just in case.

1029
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:07,774
I waited to ask you for a favor.

1030
01:07:10,343 --> 01:07:11,444
Get rid of...

1031
01:07:12,944 --> 01:07:14,143
Shim Su Ryeon.

1032
01:07:15,883 --> 01:07:17,883
Why were you so fixated
on killing Shim Su Ryeon?

1033
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:22,853
Because you wanted Joo
Dan Tae and the penthouse?

1034
01:07:25,494 --> 01:07:27,123
Did Joo Dan Tae say that?

1035
01:07:29,063 --> 01:07:30,333
Did he tell you...

1036
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:33,934
that I wanted to have him?

1037
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:35,833
We have clear proof.

1038
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:39,944
We found your fingerprints...

1039
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:41,974
smothered all over the knife
used to kill Shim Su Ryeon.

1040
01:07:43,944 --> 01:07:45,444
This is your knife, right?

1041
01:07:46,444 --> 01:07:48,113
Answer me, Ms. Oh.

1042
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:51,184
Did you kill Shim Su
Ryeon with this knife?

1043
01:07:53,423 --> 01:07:55,423
We even have a witness,
so it's no use to deny it.

1044
01:08:05,494 --> 01:08:06,563
Yes.

1045
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:12,173
I killed her.

1046
01:08:13,274 --> 01:08:15,444
What? What did you say?

1047
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:20,813
I killed her.

1048
01:08:22,813 --> 01:08:23,954
I...

1049
01:08:25,984 --> 01:08:27,484
hated Su Ryeon...

1050
01:08:29,284 --> 01:08:30,593
to death.

1051
01:08:57,813 --> 01:09:00,823
THE PENTHOUSE

1052
01:09:00,854 --> 01:09:02,684
<i>Oh Yoon Hee killed Su Ryeon?</i>

1053
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:04,323
<i>I admit to all my charges.</i>

1054
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:06,493
<i>Mom... Mom!</i>

1055
01:09:06,493 --> 01:09:08,023
<i>Dad, are you really
okay with this?</i>

1056
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,694
<i>I'm just trying to return
everything back to its place.</i>

1057
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:13,463
<i>I envy Chairman Joo and Seo Jin.</i>

1058
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:15,233
<i>What are you talking
about? Be more specific!</i>

1059
01:09:16,374 --> 01:09:18,973
<i>Su Ryeon told me
everything before she died.</i>

1060
01:09:18,973 --> 01:09:20,604
<i>It's truly amazing.</i>
