1
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:07,642
(The symbol of desire, Hera Palace)

2
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:08,642
(Two rooms...)

3
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:09,537
(that were...)

4
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,346
(hidden inside...)

5
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:13,377
(Hera Palace...)

6
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:15,054
(have been opened.)

7
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,012
(The Penthouse Hidden Room - Hidden Story)

8
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:18,982
(Let's hear...)

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,552
(the stories no one knew about...)

10
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:25,183
(from the residents of Hera Palace.)

11
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,327
(The Penthouse Hidden Room - Hidden Story)

12
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:31,762
(It begins now.)

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,845
(This program was shot in accordance with COVID-19 safety regulations.)

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,219
I can't believe this.

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,189
I've been working in television for almost 30 years...

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,385
and I've hosted numerous shows.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,845
But I think hosting this show today is the biggest honor...

18
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:51,179
of my life.

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,745
Thank you so much.

20
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,649
My gosh.

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,619
- It's unbelievable. - It's like...

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,116
I finally feel like I've led a successful career.

23
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:03,355
To be honest, I decided not to be paid today...

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,130
- and just came to have fun. - Really?

25
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,399
It's time to party.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,866
As for me, I've decided to be paid lesser than usual.

27
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:15,339
I must say, there was a nationwide frenzy...

28
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,179
- Right. - due to The Penthouse.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,410
- The whole nation went crazy. - That's right.

30
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,649
It was hard to find someone who didn't watch The Penthouse.

31
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,850
It was a true frenzy.

32
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:28,545
Yes. Our amazing actors have all joined today's amazing special.

33
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,010
All the main characters are gathered here today.

34
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,910
And if you look upstairs,

35
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,680
you can see the kids of The Penthouse.

36
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,079
- Yes. - They are all gathered.

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,219
There they are. Hello.

38
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,550
- Hello. - I see Jae Jae.

39
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,045
- Hey, you guys. - This is so cool.

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,616
You guys look kinder than I thought.

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,815
- Some of them are so mean. - I know.

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,155
- But actually, they're all adults. - Right.

43
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:57,565
We're shooting this in separate locations...

44
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,369
like a simultaneous live broadcast.

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,339
Is this your first time seeing each other through a screen?

46
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,536
- Yes. - Yes.

47
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,369
- Are you excited? - Yes.

48
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,310
So, did they tell you anything?

49
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,036
- No, not at all. - They didn't say anything?

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,449
I didn't hear anything either.

51
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,606
(Look forward to the behind stories of the kids!)

52
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:15,120
What's really strange about this drama is...

53
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,745
although I know all of them, I saw...

54
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,949
Eugene and So Yeon greeting each other happily...

55
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,286
before we began, and it scared me even more.

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,825
- Did it feel more awkward? - Yes.

57
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,329
- I know. - That scared me even more.

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,929
I went to the bathroom before I came here...

59
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,269
and I met Jenny inside there.

60
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,765
To be honest, I got scared.

61
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,235
Because I was so immersed in the drama.

62
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,709
I'm sure today's special will be very exciting.

63
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,906
Ms. Shin, although Season One received so much love,

64
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,049
did you sometimes worry if Season Two...

65
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,880
might not be as popular as its previous season?

66
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,186
I couldn't get any sleep.

67
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,350
Really?

68
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,716
(They totally agree.)

69
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,130
- You worried that much? - Since so many people loved it.

70
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:58,190
That's true.

71
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,889
- That's why it's so hard. - I see.

72
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,455
Let's meet the kiss expert, Mr. Um Ki Joon.

73
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,265
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,040
What about you? Are you worried as well?

75
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,100
We're trying hard to find new details...

76
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:11,970
that will differentiate our acting...

77
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:13,976
from Season One.

78
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:18,010
We'll introduce you one by one soon...

79
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,145
as we keep talking.

80
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,120
The Penthouse Hidden Room, Hidden Story.

81
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,519
I'm sure you all know how amazing The Penthouse was.

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,485
Let's watch through the screen and see for ourselves again.

83
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:30,859
Let's begin.

84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,459
(The viewer ratings of episode 21 exceeded 30 percent!)

85
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,425
(The ratings got higher and higher for each episode!)

86
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:40,669
(The Penthouse heated up the viewers during the cold winter.)

87
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,540
I'll make them suffer the exact same way.

88
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,566
Then they'll realize what they did wrong.

89
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:50,506
(The reason why The Penthouse was the talk of the town)

90
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:55,245
(It started with a shocking incident from the first episode...)

91
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,359
(and maintained its tension until the last moment.)

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,455
My gosh.

93
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,425
- She's such a great actress. - I knew it.

94
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,825
You haven't forgotten either.

95
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,100
(It portrayed the twisted desires of adults...)

96
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:15,795
(through bold and explicit scenes.)

97
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:21,110
(It was full of suspense and satisfying scenes...)

98
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:27,445
(with unexpected twists and a fast-paced story.)

99
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,349
(Also, we can't leave out...)

100
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,356
(the amazing acting by such talented actors!)

101
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:40,529
(Villains teamed up with more villains.)

102
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,966
(It was truly a drama full of exhilarating scenes!)

103
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:53,266
(It always made you look forward to the next episode.)

104
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,719
(The Penthouse frenzy is still continuing at this moment.)

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,490
- It's full of amazing scenes. - Yes.

106
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:09,690
Many people say that The Penthouse...

107
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:12,829
is full of unexpected twists as the story unfolds.

108
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,699
- Yes. - It's always unpredictable.

109
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,130
Besides the viewers who are watching,

110
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:20,766
I heard even the actors were really surprised...

111
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,539
when they saw the script...

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,209
and couldn't believe the story.

113
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,209
Yes. I bet the actors were surprised as much as the viewers.

114
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,375
How was it?

115
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,820
We really wanted to know who the culprit was too.

116
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,375
Whenever we met,

117
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,786
we calculated the timeline to find out who the killer was.

118
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,760
- We were always like that. - Did you wonder about the script...

119
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,230
- Yes. - and who the real killer was...

120
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,060
based on the previous episodes?

121
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,659
Did you really talk about that with each other?

122
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,730
We did that very often.

123
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:52,625
At first, we took wild guesses about who the killer was.

124
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,300
Since we didn't know who the killer was either.

125
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,466
I didn't know it was me.

126
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,536
I knew it was you.

127
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,339
Do you remember what I told you?

128
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,310
- Everyone said it was me. - I said it was you.

129
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,149
They all kept saying it was me.

130
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,519
Even Yoon Chul said it was Oh Yoon Hee.

131
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,516
But I kept saying it wasn't me.

132
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,920
Since you didn't shoot that scene yet?

133
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,589
- You didn't even see the script. - That's right.

134
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,089
You must've felt frustrated that you were being suspected.

135
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,889
I was frustrated. Seriously frustrated.

136
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,930
But I knew it was her.

137
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,466
Because after we shot the elevator scene...

138
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,870
- You knew? - After I finished...

139
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,899
shooting a scene with Eugene,

140
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,870
I shot another additional scene on my own.

141
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,610
It was a secret scene that was added.

142
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:33,940
You really knew?

143
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,536
That's when I found out it was Oh Yoon Hee.

144
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,909
- My goodness. - This is how it was.

145
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,719
- Everything was confidential? - Even the actors didn't know?

146
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,579
- I didn't know. - What's really interesting is,

147
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,920
after we receive the script,

148
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:48,190
we can see what kind of scenes are scheduled to be shot.

149
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,620
But what's funny about this drama is...

150
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:51,185
they suddenly disappear after shooting a certain scene.

151
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,295
That's when they go shoot another scene like that.

152
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,000
- In secret. - In secret.

153
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,625
- It's totally confidential. - I received an additional script.

154
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,469
And they told me not to say anything.

155
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,440
- Everything is done secretly. - It could be the writer's plan.

156
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,839
Gosh. That just gave me the chills.

157
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,539
After you shoot a scene, imagine how much you want to tell...

158
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,849
- the other actors that you know. - That's true.

159
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,680
When the other actors are trying hard to guess...

160
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,980
who the real killer is,

161
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:18,320
you must keep quiet even when you know.

162
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,916
You knew?

163
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,889
We will introduce you one by one now.

164
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,630
But it's no fun if we introduce you by your names.

165
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:28,730
- So we came up with some keywords. - Yes.

166
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:32,399
Some of you may think it's you when you hear the keyword.

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,199
Can you not look?

168
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,440
I saw. I already saw it.

169
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,740
Stop looking. What's wrong with you?

170
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,706
I tend to be a shallow person.

171
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,076
You're just like your character.

172
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,820
Then we will introduce you one by one...

173
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:50,916
through the keywords that we came up with.

174
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:53,920
The keyword for the first person...

175
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,459
- This is very easy. - I think all of you will know.

176
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,356
- The keyword is "Producer". - Producer.

177
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,329
- Producer. - It's quite a controversial word.

178
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,560
That's right.

179
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:05,399
There's a rumor that Um Ki Joon was the director of this drama.

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,166
(There was a rumor that he was actually directing the drama.)

181
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,005
And during the SBS Drama Awards last year...

182
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,476
(2020 SBS Drama Awards, Winner of Top Excellence Award)

183
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,909
(He mentioned the rumor...)

184
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,606
(about being the producer of the drama.)

185
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:22,416
Thank you. Happy New Year.

186
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,656
Why is everyone mistaken that he was involved in producing this drama?

187
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,586
Let's check through the screen.

188
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,456
It'll be so fun to watch all the scenes at once.

189
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,765
I don't think I can stop now.

190
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:41,336
What on earth?

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,796
What's this music?

192
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,235
It's very romantic.

193
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,809
What's up with this music?

194
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,875
- Oh, gosh. - He kisses anytime and everywhere.

195
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,015
You kissed that much?

196
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,316
There are so many, now that all the scenes are put together.

197
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,755
I think he kissed in every episode.

198
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,330
And what's funny is, there's always someone watching.

199
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,365
- Someone is always watching. - I know.

200
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:13,665
(What can you do for me?)

201
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,870
There he goes again.

202
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:21,275
I think he really was the producer.

203
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,735
My gosh.

204
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,710
(There is no doubt...)

205
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,110
(that Joo Dan Tae is...)

206
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:31,450
(the producer.)

207
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:32,950
Producer Joo Dan Tae.

208
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,819
(He kissed all the actresses.)

209
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,159
I admire you.

210
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,659
(Embarrassed)

211
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,330
What's really funny is,

212
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,559
watching a single scene...

213
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,569
and all the scenes combined feels so different.

214
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,730
It's totally different.

215
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,700
- It seems like a bit too much. - Yes.

216
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:50,100
- I agree. - I heard from the staff...

217
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,240
of this drama that Mr. Um said...

218
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:56,676
he wouldn't participate if he didn't shoot those scenes.

219
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,750
That's what I heard.

220
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,549
Although he didn't participate as a producer,

221
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,880
he made it clear that he wanted to kiss all of them.

222
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,789
But when you actually received the script...

223
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,789
and saw how many kissing scenes there were,

224
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,220
and that someone was secretly watching...

225
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,059
every time you kissed someone,

226
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,630
you must've been worried when you prepared for the scenes.

227
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:18,165
The thing that worried me the most...

228
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,995
was that two of the actresses I kissed...

229
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,200
- were married. - Right.

230
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:26,169
- It must've bothered you. - That worried me the most.

231
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,110
I see. I'm sure it was very tough for him.

232
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:33,380
Since they're famous for being such happily married couples.

233
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,019
- They're famous. - They're very happily married.

234
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,785
So Yeon, what did your husband say? He's an actor too.

235
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,120
Did he say Um Ki Joon was going a bit overboard?

236
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,760
Since he was smooching everyone?

237
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,260
Rather than Lee Sang Woo,

238
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,826
- my parents-in-law... - Parents-in-law?

239
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,269
Whenever there were kissing scenes...

240
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,895
or scenes where I was having an affair,

241
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,639
I was worried it was a bit too much.

242
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,569
So I told them about the episodes in advance...

243
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,439
and recommended that they don't watch them.

244
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,210
It turned out to be episodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...

245
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,279
I was kissing in almost every episode.

246
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,319
That practically means they can't watch at all.

247
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,990
I felt so sorry.

248
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:13,519
But they said I was amazing since it was just an act.

249
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,159
- They totally understood. - They rooted for you.

250
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,456
Didn't your mother-in-law say she wished to be an actor too?

251
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,360
Eugene, what about you?

252
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,130
I never watched it with my husband.

253
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,799
I didn't have many kissing scenes though.

254
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,899
But I think he watched it alone later.

255
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,240
That might be even sadder.

256
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:31,269
But since he's an actor too, I'm sure he understands.

257
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,809
But one time, they released an article about me.

258
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,340
It was titled, "Oh Yoon Hee's Sneaky Hand".

259
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,750
It said I touched Ki Joon's butt when I was kissing him.

260
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,149
- Really? - Yes!

261
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,750
I doubt the script was that detailed.

262
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,049
Telling her to caress his butt?

263
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,620
After my husband saw that article,

264
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,090
he asked me what it meant...

265
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,429
by my sneaky hand.

266
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,826
She was totally absorbed in her character, like method acting.

267
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:57,596
- It was just acting. - Her body remembered.

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,096
So it wasn't a fake act, but real.

269
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,039
She's a real professional.

270
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,639
Personally, there's something I'm curious about.

271
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,769
After seeing your kissing scene,

272
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,035
did your husband ask why you didn't kiss him like that?

273
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,439
My gosh.

274
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,076
(That's so hilarious.)

275
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:17,885
What an unexpected question.

276
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,620
What are you talking about?

277
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:20,985
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,816
Still, since he asked, can you answer?

279
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,260
He didn't say that.

280
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,460
- I'm glad. - So Yeon, what about you?

281
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,255
- Me neither. - I'm glad.

282
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,765
Actors must always be careful.

283
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,539
(Bewildered)

284
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,169
Mr. Um, can you tell us?

285
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,039
When you shoot kissing scenes, scenes in bed,

286
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,380
or "wall scenes", where you kiss against a wall...

287
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,275
- Wall scenes? - A wall?

288
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,250
Are those scenes harder to shoot?

289
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,580
For me, hitting someone is the hardest.

290
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,250
- Hitting is the hardest? - Yes.

291
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,985
- I'd rather let someone... - You were really good though.

292
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,590
- That comes from experience. - She was actually hit by you.

293
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,856
If it's coming from someone who got hit, then it must be true.

294
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,826
So although he didn't participate in producing the drama,

295
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,899
it felt as if he really did.

296
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,436
- That's how good is acting was. - Yes.

297
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,639
- Shall we introduce the next actor? - Okay.

298
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,936
The keyword for the next actor is "Spoiler".

299
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,080
A spoiler?

300
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,779
I heard this person recently...

301
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,710
spoiled the story of this drama to a close person...

302
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:24,019
and that person was extremely disappointed.

303
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,019
Right.

304
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,149
(She seems to feel guilty.)

305
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,889
- It's Ji Ah. - That's because even the actors...

306
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,289
shoot certain scenes secretly without letting the others know.

307
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,830
Yet, they must not spoil the contents.

308
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:38,226
- Yes, they must keep quiet. - They must keep it a secret.

309
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,936
Especially, many people were wary of...

310
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,510
spoilers for The Penthouse.

311
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:46,836
- Right. - In spite of all that,

312
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:50,210
someone in here took away someone's happiness with a spoiler.

313
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:51,980
- He must've waited so long. - Yes.

314
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:55,149
He must've waited for a whole week, and she snatched it away.

315
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,880
Let's see what it's about...

316
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:59,049
and who it is.

317
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,819
(I was getting ready to watch it this morning.)

318
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,485
It's Kim Hee Chul's Instagram.

319
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,360
(I didn't watch it yet.)

320
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,389
(Lee Ji Ah was the spoiler.)

321
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,159
It was Shim Su Ryeon.

322
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,426
(Shim Su Ryeon has spoiled everything.)

323
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,569
(Lee Ji Ah, Shim Su Ryeon)

324
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,500
I understand why he's using that emoji.

325
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,340
(You ruined my happiness.)

326
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:18,436
(I thought you already knew.)

327
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:21,539
- The drama was already aired. - Yes.

328
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,710
And it was one of the top trending search words.

329
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:25,610
And since she was very close with Hee Chul,

330
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,210
did you think he already knew?

331
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:30,220
After I died in that episode,

332
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:34,049
I received texts from everyone I knew.

333
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,120
And since my name was on the top trending search list,

334
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,659
I naturally thought he would know.

335
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,299
So I just told him I died.

336
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,330
But he was so shocked, and so was I.

337
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:46,130
- I was really sorry. - You took away his happiness.

338
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,399
It was a very important scene.

339
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,365
So you snatched away his happiness.

340
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,510
In a way, it's kind of creepy.

341
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:57,135
A dead person sent a text saying she had died.

342
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:01,375
So I heard Hee Chul is very upset because of that.

343
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,415
Shall we meet him?

344
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,645
What?

345
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,015
What is this?

346
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,485
Hello, Ji Ah.

347
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,330
I'm Kim Hee Chul, a real fan of The Penthouse.

348
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:18,569
Due to my schedule, I was binge-watching...

349
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,970
the last few episodes.

350
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:24,340
But Ji Ah suddenly said, "Hee Chul, I died."

351
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,939
She sent me a text before I saw it.

352
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,480
You took away my small happiness.

353
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,980
I really wanted to join you today,

354
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:38,220
but I'm at a mountain shooting "Mom's Diary" right now.

355
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:41,389
I really enjoyed watching The Penthouse.

356
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,860
Soon Ok, the show was so cheerful and fun.

357
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,830
Maybe not exactly cheerful.

358
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:49,326
Anyway, thank you so much for the great show.

359
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,970
I'd like to thank the whole cast as well.

360
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,669
And I'm so curious to know...

361
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,500
what the child actors are like in real life.

362
00:15:56,501 --> 00:16:00,210
Also, I'm totally convinced that Ji Ah and Cheon Seo Jin are...

363
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,909
on bad terms in real life too.

364
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,250
- About Ki Joon, - He's in too deep.

365
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:08,145
I've heard so many nice things,

366
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,785
but after watching the show, I'm scared of him.

367
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,819
It's so cold out here right now.

368
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,419
Lastly, if I was there with you all,

369
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,429
I would've done an impression of Kyu Jin, played by Tae Gyu.

370
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,326
Ji Ah has seen it.

371
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,726
"Our Kyu Jin did it."

372
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,899
- My lips are frozen. - That's incredible.

373
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,799
- I'll be looking forward... - He sounds exactly like Kyu Jin.

374
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,269
- to Seasons 2 and 3 as well. Bye. - That was amazing.

375
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,269
Thank you so much.

376
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,375
By the way, Ji Ah,

377
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,505
will you be in Season Two?

378
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:40,309
Everyone's dying to know.

379
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,620
He asked me...

380
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:42,980
if I died for real,

381
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,189
but if I told him, that would be another spoiler, right?

382
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,490
So I asked him if he really wanted to know,

383
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:49,519
and he said no. In the end, I didn't tell him.

384
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,789
- You didn't. - That's good.

385
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,490
But it must be so hard to keep all the secrets.

386
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:57,000
Eun Kyung, did people ever ask you any questions about the show?

387
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,230
Many ask me if Su Ryeon really is dead.

388
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,299
(Everyone is dying to know.)

389
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,870
- If she died for real. - Right.

390
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:03,135
- They don't believe it. - I see.

391
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,210
I just told them to keep on watching.

392
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,940
- Good. - Until the end.

393
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,440
The shooting of Season Two...

394
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,740
- has started, right? - That's right.

395
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:13,079
I can imagine how curious everyone must be.

396
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,849
Did Hee Chul do an impression of Tae Gyu...

397
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,420
- in front of you? - It was incredible.

398
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,650
- Yes. - He sounded just like Tae Gyu.

399
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:21,516
I even filmed it.

400
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:25,329
- When I first debuted as an actor, - Okay.

401
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,056
I visited other towns to meet the audience.

402
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,730
Do you remember those business cards...

403
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:32,629
that nightclub waiters used to hand out?

404
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,240
When I found my name on those, I was thrilled.

405
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,970
- I get it. It means you're famous. - Do you know what I mean?

406
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:38,210
"I'm a celebrity."

407
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,405
But this feels even more amazing.

408
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,210
Seeing another celebrity do an impression of me,

409
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,879
I realize how popular our show is.

410
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,010
Do you think he did a good job?

411
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,309
He sounds just like me.

412
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,746
- He really conveyed the character. - Exactly.

413
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,890
Let's see who the next keyword is for.

414
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,986
Here's the keyword.

415
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,119
(Dumb and Dumber)

416
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,460
It's "Dumb and Dumber".

417
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,129
- Dumb and Dumber. - I think I know.

418
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,400
Can you guess who this is?

419
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:03,460
Why are you looking at me? Is it me?

420
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,195
- Everyone seems careful. - Really?

421
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,596
Eugene, can you guess who it is?

422
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,569
I think it's either Yoon Chul and Kyu Jin...

423
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,740
or Ma Ri and Sang A.

424
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:13,836
- But I... - What?

425
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,710
This is why no one can say anything.

426
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,779
But you've narrowed it down very well.

427
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,609
Those are pretty much the pairs...

428
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,819
that can be described as Dumb and Dumber...

429
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,650
in The Penthouse.

430
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:25,789
- Who are they? - Let's...

431
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,789
- find out... - Are they men or women?

432
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,990
- in the video. - All right.

433
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:30,559
How could she go after another woman's husband?

434
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,885
And on top of that, murder?

435
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,660
Did Ms. Cheon really push Min Seol A?

436
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,730
To cover up her affair?

437
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,829
That would mean she's evil.

438
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,596
What murderer isn't evil?

439
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,266
Gosh.

440
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,635
What is it you want to say?

441
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,205
I have to go to work soon.

442
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,445
Now isn't the time to be so cheeky, is it?

443
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,049
I'm thinking of filing a complaint to Cheong A Arts High School.

444
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,720
I can't let an immoral...

445
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,115
and shameless person like you teach our kids.

446
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,430
Those are Min Hyuk and Jenny's middle school report cards.

447
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:08,230
As you can see, their school grades and their performance test scores...

448
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,026
were way below average.

449
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,665
Yet, how did they make it to Cheong A Arts High School?

450
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,135
Oh, my.

451
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,365
Is this for real?

452
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,940
Jenny came in third...

453
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,236
on her performance test.

454
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,279
Min Hyuk came in fourth.

455
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,215
(Even their kids' grades are similar.)

456
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,619
I'll stay loyal to Ms. Cheon...

457
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,619
until Jenny gets accepted to Seoul University of Music.

458
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,660
Me too.

459
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:40,289
It's not like she had an affair with my husband.

460
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,900
I'll just pretend like I don't know anything.

461
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:45,425
- Salute! - Salute!

462
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:49,596
No, like this! Like this!

463
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:58,445
We're such a perfect match.

464
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,379
It's like "Dumb and Dumber".

465
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,379
(Dumb and Dumber)

466
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,379
(We respect Eun Kyung's opinion.)

467
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,915
It was in your own words.

468
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:10,319
The thing is, you two are so cute together.

469
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,089
I always look forward to when they appear together.

470
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,760
In addition to the funny bits we just watched,

471
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,400
when they wiped off the blood together,

472
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:20,200
it was so hilarious.

473
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,440
- I know what you mean. - The conversation was so funny.

474
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,640
(Episode 4, Ma Ri and Sang A are cleaning up...)

475
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,606
(to cover up Seol A's accident.)

476
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,140
Even so, aren't you being too hard on a dead girl?

477
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:30,640
She's just a kid.

478
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:31,980
How strange.

479
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,576
Why do you keep defending her?

480
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,675
Do you feel guilty?

481
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,016
What are you talking about?

482
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:43,619
Do you actually want to fight me right now?

483
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,326
- Wait, wait. - Get out of the way.

484
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,629
The situation itself is...

485
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,670
- very tense, - Yes.

486
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,230
but the lines are so funny.

487
00:20:54,231 --> 00:20:57,039
Thanks to the performance of you two,

488
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,109
the viewers could enjoy the show even more.

489
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,170
Are you satisfied with your teamwork?

490
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:05,079
Actually, we get along very well in real life too.

491
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,150
- Is that so? - In real life too?

492
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:08,415
They're best friends.

493
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,250
- They are? - Seriously.

494
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:11,390
If we weren't the same sex,

495
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:13,546
we would have gotten married.

496
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,660
We're a great match.

497
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:19,029
Min Hyuk and Jenny, did you become best friends...

498
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,400
just like your mothers?

499
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,900
In the show, I'm super clingy with Min Hyuk.

500
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:25,195
(Jenny is clingy with Min Hyuk.)

501
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:26,599
I'm sure...

502
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,900
being good friends in real life helps a lot.

503
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:32,670
Can we keep seeing you together in Season Two as well?

504
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,306
Is it okay to get excited about it?

505
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,740
Well...

506
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:39,480
- I guess, maybe. - Come on.

507
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,150
(Don't say anything more.)

508
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:42,920
(Something's fishy.)

509
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,250
- Something's going on. - Eun Kyung is too nice.

510
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,450
She almost spilled the beans.

511
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:48,490
I shouldn't say it?

512
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,359
(They make eye contact.)

513
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,990
- Right? - I can't wait to find out.

514
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:56,430
Will their teamwork be still as good or get even better?

515
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,029
There's something I'd like to add.

516
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,670
Everyone's been so touched...

517
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,940
by something Eun Kyung does.

518
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:05,006
She always acts 100 percent no matter what the camera angle is.

519
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,836
Even when she's out of frame,

520
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,240
- she does her best for the others. - That's right.

521
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,279
Always.

522
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,910
Even when she is not in frame?

523
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:14,250
Yes, exactly.

524
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,279
Also, she shares so much information...

525
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,846
about healthy foods.

526
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,420
- That's right. - She advertises them.

527
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:24,826
"Have you tried this? You should."

528
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,455
When you're my age, you'll understand.

529
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,529
Younger people may think,

530
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,460
"She's making me uncomfortable."

531
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:32,170
But these days, I get convinced so easily.

532
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,170
- You purchase it right away. - Right?

533
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:35,970
- That's what happens. - Have you bought anything lately?

534
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:37,496
Black goat extract.

535
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:39,240
It's nice.

536
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,740
- We all got tart cherry juice. - Tart cherry juice.

537
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,839
- We all got it. - I got it too.

538
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,109
We all did.

539
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,475
She's familiar with all kinds of supplements.

540
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,250
That's understandable. I'm sorry,

541
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,450
but can you edit out the part where I said black goat extract is nice?

542
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:55,056
I host "Animal Farm", so...

543
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,789
(Hilarious)

544
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,925
Please edit it out.

545
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:01,756
If you can't, I'll understand.

546
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,496
I didn't say that I like it.

547
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:08,869
All right.

548
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,170
Let's move on to...

549
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:12,970
- the next keyword. - The next keyword.

550
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:15,109
The next keyword is,

551
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,279
"Excellent Anger Management".

552
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,579
- It's not anger management issues? - Excellent Anger Management.

553
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,875
The person is good at anger management.

554
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,546
Who manages anger best here?

555
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,549
- If the person is good at it... - It must be Kyu Jin.

556
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,720
- The person is good at it. - Ups and downs...

557
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:30,119
Kyu Jin can control his anger right away.

558
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,890
(Agreed)

559
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,589
He gives in immediately.

560
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,200
- It's not that he gives in. - He gives in right away.

561
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,655
- He just feels happy. - Right away.

562
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,329
- He suddenly feels happy? - He's not caught up in the past.

563
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,369
- If he feels happy now... - He lives in the present moment.

564
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,099
- Of course. - He's great at anger management.

565
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,010
Most of the characters are very bad at anger management.

566
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,309
But there's one person...

567
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,135
who's very good at it. Let's find out.

568
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,806
I knew it.

569
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,019
He's not good at anger management at all.

570
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,930
(Furious)

571
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:11,160
(Calm)

572
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:13,465
He is good. He's excellent.

573
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:16,069
- He is. He's very good. - He controls his anger very well.

574
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,369
- He's amazing. - He's incredible.

575
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,210
Getting angry doesn't solve anything.

576
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,079
- Violence doesn't solve anything. - You're right.

577
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,375
Can I ask you whenever I have questions?

578
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,549
- And treat you like... - He's so funny.

579
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,645
my older brother?

580
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,579
A brother?

581
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,250
(He even becomes friends with the neighbor...)

582
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:36,715
(who makes him uncomfortable right away.)

583
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:44,155
(Furious)

584
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,599
He's angry again.

585
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,736
(Calm)

586
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,769
(Furious)

587
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,365
He's scary.

588
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,475
But he still has his pride.

589
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:58,579
He gets angry in the beginning at least.

590
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,346
(Calm)

591
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,975
I'm sure I had it in my bag when I left the office.

592
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,890
His mood changed so fast.

593
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,089
(You're officially...)

594
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,289
(the only member of Hera Club who is good at anger management.)

595
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,986
- Congratulations. - I agree.

596
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, my.

597
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,200
Should we say that he changes his attitude fast?

598
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,400
He does. I think he's very optimistic.

599
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,440
- He's optimistic. - You're right.

600
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:24,599
But he still has his pride.

601
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,970
- He gets angry in the beginning. - Of course.

602
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:29,576
He says what he wants to say, no matter what happens later.

603
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,506
- The thing is, - No matter what happens later.

604
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:35,746
when you get angry but then change your attitude fast,

605
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:38,819
it's usually because of the other person's reaction.

606
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,990
- That's usually the case. - Most of the time.

607
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:40,990
But Kyu Jin sometimes changes his attitude...

608
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,619
even if no one says anything. It's so shocking.

609
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,455
That's because Kyu Jin is an only son.

610
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:48,799
He was the pampered youngest son as a kid.

611
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,299
That plays a part too.

612
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,599
- You analyzed the character well. - Of course.

613
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,970
(It's the result of his perfect character analysis.)

614
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,069
All right.

615
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,099
But I guess he's happier than most of the characters.

616
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,106
Of course. No matter how angry he is,

617
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,140
- his mood gets better soon. - That's right.

618
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:03,710
- He does whatever he wants. - Exactly.

619
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:07,109
All right. Excellent Anger Management.

620
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,250
Actually, if you can manage your anger well,

621
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,650
- it benefits you in the end. - Yes, it's smart.

622
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,720
Exactly.

623
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:15,589
Let's see the next keyword.

624
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,185
The next keyword is pretty funny.

625
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:20,986
"Hair, Hair".

626
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:24,700
- I'm sure you can guess. - Hair, Hair?

627
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,266
- Ho Dong? - Hair, Hair.

628
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,895
It's Ho Dong.

629
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:29,836
- That's right. - That makes sense.

630
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,836
He shocked so many viewers.

631
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,175
Let's find out.

632
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,809
(He came out of nowhere at the end of Episode 7.)

633
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,606
Even his first appearance was so intense.

634
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:41,846
In those sandals.

635
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:45,250
(Gu Ho Dong)

636
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,450
(He speaks in a friendly dialect.)

637
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:47,849
You can't beat me.

638
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,359
(He speaks in a friendly dialect.)

639
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,319
What's with your outfit?

640
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,256
(With his long, unruly hair, he always looks scruffy.)

641
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,935
(A wig can make such a big difference.)

642
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,536
(What kind of a person are you, Ms. Oh?)

643
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,510
But first, kill Joo Dan Tae first.

644
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:09,806
With that thing stuck in his chest...

645
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:15,346
(Are they really the same person?)

646
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:17,076
Or I could be the one to present an unpleasant surprise.

647
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,260
(His dialect is still the same, but it has a different vibe.)

648
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,056
I remember that moment.

649
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,786
Let go!

650
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,529
- That was amazing. - Nice.

651
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,725
That was fantastic.

652
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,395
Which character did you like more,

653
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,309
Ho Dong or Logan?

654
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,475
I feel more attached to Ho Dong, of course.

655
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,779
When it comes to looks, I'd prefer looking like Logan,

656
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,920
but it was really fun playing Ho Dong.

657
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:52,950
It was challenging too.

658
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:56,260
You don't often get to play a character like him.

659
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,359
I don't.

660
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,556
The scene where Su Ryeon stabs him in the chest...

661
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:05,757
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] SBS 'The Penthouse Special'</font>
<font color="#ff8080">"Hidden Room - Hidden Story"</font>
<font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

662
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,200
He didn't even fall. He just kept talking.

663
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:10,536
It taught me the importance of chest muscles.

664
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,635
- It encouraged me to work out. - Even after being stabbed...

665
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,109
There was a lot of talk about that scene, actually.

666
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,410
People wondered why I didn't fall or feel pain.

667
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,180
I'm curious. Why didn't you pull it out right away?

668
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:21,579
It was a very small pen tip.

669
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,879
- Around 1cm. - Right.

670
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,615
People wondered why it didn't kill me.

671
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,549
- They talked about it a lot. - The thing is,

672
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,119
you'd normally pull it out immediately.

673
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,086
The next line had a lot of impact.

674
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:33,425
But first, kill Joo Dan Tae first.

675
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,526
(The line was worth putting up with the pain.)

676
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,029
- You wanted to say the line first. - That's why I put up with it.

677
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,296
- If you pull it out right away, - Really?

678
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,236
- it wouldn't be as cool. - I wanted to say the line first.

679
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:48,680
But it ended up having the opposite effect.

680
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:50,006
"Why isn't he pulling that out?"

681
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,205
People were distracted by it.

682
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:53,806
It's distracting.

683
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,119
For us to be able to enjoy the show fully,

684
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,316
you don't have to tell us in detail,

685
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:02,885
but will Logan Lee be in Season Two?

686
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,486
Will you be yet another person in Season Two?

687
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:09,730
I'm not sure yet, actually.

688
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:14,599
The scripts are given to us little by little, so...

689
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,940
They don't even tell the cast.

690
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:17,240
- Really? - I was so curious,

691
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,865
so I even called the writer, but she wouldn't tell me.

692
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,069
She's so strict.

693
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,339
It would be so fun for the cast as well.

694
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,180
- Exactly. - They must take guesses too.

695
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,309
We ask each other if we guessed right.

696
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,715
I'm sure filming this show was...

697
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:33,586
special in that sense.

698
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,960
Let's move on to the next keyword.

699
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:38,286
Here's the next keyword.

700
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:41,256
"The Unrecognized Detective".

701
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:42,895
The Unrecognized Detective.

702
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,856
- The Unrecognized Detective? - I think I know.

703
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:46,629
- It's Ji Ah. - Yes.

704
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,796
- It's Su Ryeon, right? - I see.

705
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,296
We'll see.

706
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,869
- Let's see if you're right. - But I was a spoiler.

707
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,336
- She's a spoiler. - So it's not her.

708
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,579
- It's the Unrecognized Detective. - Oh, we already know her keyword.

709
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,049
- She keeps thinking on her own. - Who is it?

710
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,480
Well, let's find out.

711
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:04,076
No one seems to be able to guess it.

712
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:05,750
Oh, that's right.

713
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:06,920
That makes sense.

714
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,786
- That makes perfect sense. - No one listens to me.

715
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:14,160
- Your guesses were always right. - Exactly.

716
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:15,730
- But no one believes her. - No one.

717
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,256
No one believes her.

718
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,695
Look at that.

719
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,170
- All she says is right. - She's always right.

720
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:23,566
She's so smart.

721
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,306
Back then and even now,

722
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,806
I suspect only one person.

723
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,135
She's like Sherlock Holmes.

724
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,106
Your wife.

725
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,046
That's absurd speculation.

726
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,480
Why would your wife visit a criminal...

727
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:42,086
(All her guesses turn out to be right afterward.)

728
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:45,119
She may have seen Min Seol A die, or...

729
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,260
Or?

730
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,455
What does that make me?

731
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,026
- A fool. - Exactly.

732
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,596
He keeps defending her.

733
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,125
That's nonsense.

734
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,569
I say that all the time.

735
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,395
You say, "That's nonsense," so many times.

736
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,369
The person who orchestrated all of this...

737
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,510
She's right again.

738
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:01,806
It's you, right?

739
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,905
- She's incredible. - She really is right.

740
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,945
(Min Seol A is Shim Su Ryeon's daughter.)

741
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:09,079
Oh, my.

742
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,180
Unbelievable.

743
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:11,316
She's so sharp.

744
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,615
- She's a brilliant detective. - She was right again.

745
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,246
Deny it if you can.

746
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,089
She's incredible.

747
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,190
(Seo Jin is a great detective who was recognized by no one.)

748
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:20,329
She's the Unrecognized Detective.

749
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,195
The Unrecognized Detective.

750
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:24,000
No one believes her.

751
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,566
Why... Right?

752
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:27,099
There were kids like her in school.

753
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,096
Everything they say is right, but no one listens to them.

754
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:31,935
They have no friends.

755
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:36,940
If one person had listened to me, things wouldn't have ended so badly.

756
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:39,145
- You're right. - But no one did.

757
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,276
Whenever she guesses something,

758
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,675
- Ki Joon disregards it. - "What are you talking about?"

759
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,115
Then she gives up.

760
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,359
Are your hunches often right in real life too?

761
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,190
No, not really. It's nothing like in the show.

762
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,260
It's nothing like in the show.

763
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,599
Do you have your radar up in real life too...

764
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,069
and take guesses?

765
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,796
But most of my guesses are wrong.

766
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,710
She's not that thorough in real life.

767
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:08,740
(She's completely different in real life.)

768
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,036
- She's different in real life. - It's only in the show.

769
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,435
- She's completely different. - All right.

770
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,806
Eun Byeol, how did you feel...

771
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,319
about your mom's hunches?

772
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,375
But she never really...

773
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,990
- told me anything... - Yes?

774
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:22,955
about her hunches.

775
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,016
But you're always peeking here and there.

776
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:28,996
I was always intimidated by her.

777
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:32,700
So I wasn't really in the position to judge her hunches.

778
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,099
But it seems like...

779
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,869
you do take after her.

780
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,536
Toward the end of the show, you tell her you miss your grandpa.

781
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:45,135
You talk just like her.

782
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:48,010
They say kids are mirrors of their parents.

783
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:50,475
So I also...

784
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,450
tried to copy Seo Jin's facial expressions and stuff.

785
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:54,990
(She tried to copy Seo Jin.)

786
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,319
- Her gestures as well. - Her gestures.

787
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,356
- I tried to copy her. - You tried to copy her.

788
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,756
In addition to being your mom, she's a great actress.

789
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,799
- There are two people left now. - Yes.

790
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,039
- Eugene and Jong Hun. - There are two people left.

791
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,640
This time, guess the keywords.

792
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:11,740
Take a guess.

793
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,470
Let's start with Eugene.

794
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:15,736
Eugene's keyword...

795
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,150
sums up all the things she did in the show...

796
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:21,879
- very well. - It's very clever.

797
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,776
- It's perfect. - Absolutely.

798
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:26,145
- Can you guess? - Take a guess.

799
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,885
Oh, getting drunk?

800
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,160
- It's close. - Alcohol...

801
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:32,586
- Wasted? - Wasted...

802
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,625
It's a part of it.

803
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:35,900
Is it about making a scene?

804
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:38,160
- She's strong. - She's strong?

805
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:39,625
It's included too.

806
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:44,036
- Well, is it too hard? - Yes.

807
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,740
- What is it? - The keyword is,

808
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:49,635
"Fighting, Crying, or Drinking".

809
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:50,940
(Hilarious)

810
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:52,846
That pretty much sums it up.

811
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,246
- You're fighting, crying, - That's perfect.

812
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:57,076
- or drinking. - I'm not sure if you realize,

813
00:33:57,221 --> 00:34:00,420
- but 60 percent of the time, - That's right.

814
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:02,190
- you were fighting, - Crying...

815
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,655
- crying, or drinking. - My goodness.

816
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,930
It's what my friend did every time he took a leave...

817
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:10,955
from the military after getting dumped.

818
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,029
- He did that every time. - That's right.

819
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,729
- Fighting, Crying, or Drinking. - This is hilarious.

820
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,700
You might think, "I did a whole lot of other things too."

821
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,510
- "I didn't only fight or..." - No, I agree.

822
00:34:19,511 --> 00:34:20,736
It was exhausting.

823
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,336
You agree?

824
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:25,010
It'd be so funny to see it all put together.

825
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,006
It must have been exhausting. Let's see it.

826
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:28,209
You can't sing!

827
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,049
You never heard me sing.

828
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,080
She's fighting.

829
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,020
(Fighting and more fighting)

830
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:34,245
She's fighting again.

831
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,256
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

832
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:39,760
(She shot more action scenes than anyone else.)

833
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,560
She's extremely strong.

834
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:45,125
(Crying)

835
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:49,535
I invested a million dollars, and I'm about to lose all that.

836
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:55,975
(She feels sad and cries again.)

837
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,606
(She also shot more crying scenes than anyone else.)

838
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,180
- It must have been hard. - Seriously.

839
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,946
(In the end...)

840
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:08,785
She seems to always end up drinking.

841
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:11,120
That doesn't end well.

842
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,486
- You're right. - She shouldn't have drunk.

843
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:15,660
She loves all kinds of drinks.

844
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:17,196
(She even drinks more than anyone else.)

845
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,526
Bottoms up?

846
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,569
Oh, my.

847
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,169
(She's number one in all 3 things.)

848
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,740
In real life, she doesn't drink at all.

849
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,435
- Really? - Not at all.

850
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:27,736
How nice.

851
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:29,736
She seems to like it.

852
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:32,649
(She perfectly pulled off action, crying, and drinking scenes.)

853
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,979
Like Eun Seok mentioned,

854
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,676
in real life...

855
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:40,220
She doesn't drink even if everyone else is drinking.

856
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,290
I can't and don't drink, but despite that,

857
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,986
it was quite fun to act as if I was drunk.

858
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,660
Because I don't drink myself,

859
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:51,129
- I end up observing drunk people. - Of course.

860
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,100
- You observe them. - I think that helped.

861
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,770
"That's what I must do to act drunk."

862
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,696
It was fun for you to act drunk because you don't drink yourself.

863
00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:00,205
Fighting and crying, you do all the time, so it wasn't fun.

864
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,875
- No. Don't say that. - He's kidding.

865
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,680
I do tend to cry a lot,

866
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:12,586
but fighting is something I really don't do.

867
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,290
- But... Wasn't it fun? - It was fun.

868
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,220
Fighting was fun too.

869
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:19,026
Wasn't it physically draining?

870
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,926
It was physically challenging,

871
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,455
but it's satisfying to do something you don't do in everyday life.

872
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,700
Is it harder to film fighting scenes or yelling and crying scenes?

873
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:29,540
What's harder? Kissing scenes?

874
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,770
(What's the hardest to act out?)

875
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:34,209
- Hitting someone is the hardest. - Hitting someone?

876
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,180
- It's rare for me. - I see.

877
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:39,080
I didn't get to slap someone in many dramas.

878
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,510
- In this drama... - We all got hit.

879
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:42,819
Yes. I hit you and you.

880
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,620
- Not you, I hit you. - Not me.

881
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,919
- Anyway, I think... - You hit everyone.

882
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,450
- You hit everyone. - Almost.

883
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,919
About these scenes where you hit someone.

884
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,490
If you don't hit them properly, you must do multiple takes,

885
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:57,029
- and that makes things worse. - Yes.

886
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,229
So I say, "I'll do it in one go," and go for it.

887
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,200
- So... Yes? - You really hit people?

888
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:04,140
Yes, almost all of us actually hit or got hit for real.

889
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,305
When you're hit, don't you think to yourself,

890
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:09,010
"They didn't have to hit me this hard, did they?"

891
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:11,580
Did you ever think like that?

892
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,249
I hit him so many times.

893
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,850
- He got hit the most. - No?

894
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,220
I feel terrible about it.

895
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:17,279
How many times were you hit?

896
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,616
But her hand skills... "Hand skills" should I say?

897
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:25,220
- Her hitting skills. - Yes, that, it's amazing.

898
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,285
- That's true. - So I was fine.

899
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:30,200
- One time it hurt a lot. - Which one?

900
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:33,470
- She climbed onto the table... - Oh, yes, that.

901
00:37:33,471 --> 00:37:35,430
to whack me like this.

902
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,765
That was quite original.

903
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,435
- So original. - You never knew saw it coming.

904
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,609
That was a scene from episode 10.

905
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,649
(Original scenes must be viewed again.)

906
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,975
Aren't you sick of it?

907
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,316
That's just your guilt talking.

908
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,356
(Full swing!)

909
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,930
In the original script, it says I'm so furious...

910
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:02,426
and throws a vase next to me at him.

911
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,895
To make sure it's not dangerous,

912
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,165
they had the vase made especially with sugar.

913
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,200
But it shattered the moment I grabbed it...

914
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,270
because I was already so charged.

915
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,870
- She was full of emotion. - I was emotional.

916
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:16,910
So the director said since the vase is already broken,

917
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,549
why don't we come up with something more original?

918
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,705
The director made a suggestion.

919
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,580
"How about you step onto the table and hit him?"

920
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:27,015
"It's rare for a woman to do that."

921
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:28,419
And we added another detail.

922
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,089
We rehearsed and it was great so we added one more thing.

923
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,560
On the table there were flowers.

924
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,899
I was to get on the table, kick the flowers aside, and hit him.

925
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,459
That's how we got that scene.

926
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,899
As soon as I hit him and the director yelled "cut",

927
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,669
he said, "So Yeon, I'm bleeding."

928
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,435
(Embarrassed)

929
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,665
Because she almost ran up to me.

930
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:49,375
- It must've been so scary. - "Let's do this in one take."

931
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,450
You ran up to him and landed a spike on his head.

932
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:54,350
- That was so original. - It must've hurt bad.

933
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:55,606
I gasped when I saw it.

934
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,979
- Did you? - Of course.

935
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,645
It must've been scary to watch from the sidelines.

936
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:03,560
Everyone's saying the hardest thing to do was to hit someone.

937
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:06,426
- That was the hardest. - Yes. Ki Joon said that too.

938
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:10,125
Tae Gyu, what was the hardest for you in this drama?

939
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,296
Getting beaten up was hard.

940
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,866
I get beaten up in so many different ways.

941
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,406
Ki Joon's secretary hits me using brass knuckles.

942
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:22,805
I'm really innocent.

943
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:25,435
Shall I open my stomach to show you?

944
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,446
Chairman Joo.

945
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:36,015
Chairman. Let's talk this out.

946
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,560
I had to think about how much I should react.

947
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,330
If it's brass knuckles, how much pain should I portray?

948
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:43,830
- It takes calculating. - And my mom slaps me.

949
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,026
Mom. What this is...

950
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:49,299
- I got flung away. - You did.

951
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,999
After a while, I got hit so much that...

952
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,736
it would get boring if I reacted the same way each time.

953
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,040
- It was hard. - It takes research to be hit.

954
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,805
What hurt the most?

955
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:00,979
Toward the very end, my mom...

956
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,176
shakes my head and shoves me across a table.

957
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:07,145
I roll on my side and fall off the table.

958
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:10,290
After that, though it's not shown on screen,

959
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:13,859
the actress who plays my mom stomps on me.

960
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,026
He got stomped on.

961
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,430
- Mom. - I will kill you.

962
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:19,799
(His mom stomps on her son with all her might.)

963
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,370
- Was that scripted? - She stomped on me.

964
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:23,600
- No, it wasn't. - She got revved up.

965
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:26,736
- Once you start, you can't stop. - "She got revved up"?

966
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,479
I had to lie there and maintain eye contact.

967
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,049
I had to go on acting for her sake, but she was wearing heels.

968
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,176
I was wearing protective padding to shield me from the abuse,

969
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:37,850
but it was so scary.

970
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:39,350
Do you get along in real life?

971
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:41,919
Yes, we do. We knew each other already.

972
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,189
We did a previous drama together too.

973
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,560
But getting stomped by someone wearing high heels...

974
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:47,430
- High heels are scary. - It was so scary.

975
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,426
It's worse to look up at her from below.

976
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,196
- We're left with Yoon Jong Hun. - Yes.

977
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,339
- This is a famous keyword. - Yoon Jong Hun's turn.

978
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,696
I think you'll know.

979
00:40:58,101 --> 00:40:59,705
I see it right now.

980
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,040
- Right? - I know it.

981
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,736
Jong Hun, can you guess what it is?

982
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:06,350
Yes. She said it to me during our shoot yesterday.

983
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:09,549
It's something many people say to describe you.

984
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,116
That's right. Yoon Jong Hun's keyword is...

985
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,620
"Sickly Sexy".

986
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:15,216
(Sickly sexy)

987
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,689
Did that word exist already?

988
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,529
- No, no, it was created. - For Jong Hun.

989
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,955
- It became popular. - Wow, that's impressive.

990
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,700
A sexy man who cooks...

991
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,625
- is "cooking sexy". - "Cooking sexy".

992
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,669
- "Smart sexy". - "Smart sexy".

993
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,935
What's this, then? "Sick and sexy"?

994
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:33,240
"Weak and sexy"?

995
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,106
That doesn't sound right.

996
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,839
He seems sickly,

997
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,549
- but makes you want to protect him. - He's still sexy.

998
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,575
That must be what's appealing.

999
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,375
Let's find out why people think so.

1000
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:50,316
Don't hate me too much.

1001
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:53,390
(Today, he's shy and sexy.)

1002
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:56,060
- Oh, you're constantly in pain. - Sick and sexy.

1003
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:57,555
He's in pain.

1004
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:03,796
My gosh.

1005
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,066
- He's even lying down. - Oh Yoon Hee.

1006
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:09,779
(He looks sexy even when having regrets.)

1007
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,080
"Even when having regrets".

1008
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:13,145
"Even when having regrets"?

1009
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:15,305
"Oh Yoon Hee"?

1010
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,075
(Sighing)

1011
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,645
- He's still... - Even when he sighs.

1012
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,350
You cheated on me with Joo Dan Tae.

1013
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:24,020
The person I hate the most!

1014
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:25,316
You're the same.

1015
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:28,986
You met Oh Yoon Hee, whom I resent the most.

1016
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,225
A divorce?

1017
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,665
I told you that will never happen until I decide.

1018
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:38,066
You're crazy.

1019
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,910
You should worry about your current situation.

1020
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:43,439
- "Flapping". - If I don't help you,

1021
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,779
this hospital will blame you for this accident.

1022
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,549
- "Shrinking away". - Then you'll lose your license...

1023
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,075
- and be kicked out for good. - Why do you keep stepping backward?

1024
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,915
Eun Byeol?

1025
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,986
Oh, dear.

1026
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,086
I'll never let you take her.

1027
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:59,955
I'll tell Eun Byeol you went to a conference.

1028
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,665
This scene was great.

1029
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:15,870
Yoon Hee.

1030
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:19,609
(This is sickly sexy.)

1031
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,609
The subtitles...

1032
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,720
(This is sickly sexy.)

1033
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:24,316
You look like you'll collapse.

1034
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,216
That was so funny.

1035
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,120
I think...

1036
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:31,790
even the viewers want to protect you.

1037
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,359
- Yes. - It's a maternal instinct.

1038
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,999
You need someone to lean on or something to hold onto.

1039
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,729
- Yes. He's always shying away. - Right?

1040
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,499
We talked about this ourselves.

1041
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,970
All the women, the female characters in the drama...

1042
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:45,499
are strong, glamorous,

1043
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,566
tall, and forceful.

1044
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,810
All the men seem frail...

1045
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:54,906
and make us want to protect them.

1046
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,779
He's the one who looks strongest on the outside,

1047
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,689
- but he looks sickly. - Despite his build.

1048
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,685
You have a point.

1049
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:06,430
- In real life are you... - I'm healthy and fine.

1050
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:07,685
(I'm healthy.)

1051
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:09,529
- I'm glad to hear that. - Thanks.

1052
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,459
- He went to action school... - Yes, he went to a stunt school.

1053
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,069
- You learned stunts? - Yes.

1054
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,470
- For real? - Really?

1055
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,499
- He's an official graduate. - Yes.

1056
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,665
(A graduate of an action school)

1057
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:21,805
Did you step backward on purpose to portray your character?

1058
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:26,709
Yes, plus So Yeon plays a villain with such charisma and power.

1059
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,580
I wanted to portray her overpowering me.

1060
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:30,979
He's a gentleman to let her push him around.

1061
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,120
It's gentlemanly to not fight back.

1062
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,946
He gets pushed backward too much for that.

1063
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,620
- He flaps and flails. - He's such a worry.

1064
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:41,160
But in reality, he studied at a stunt academy.

1065
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,060
- That's a twist. - It is a twist.

1066
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:45,229
When a drama airs,

1067
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,169
it's very rare for every character to be loved...

1068
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,040
- and admired. - It is.

1069
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:53,069
But we went through each character...

1070
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,240
and it's easy to see why the viewer ratings were so high,

1071
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:59,906
and why people loved the drama and its characters so much.

1072
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:03,020
We compiled some scenes that...

1073
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:06,546
- viewers identified as the best. - Yes.

1074
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,020
(The Penthouse)

1075
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:12,689
(Best scenes voted by viewers)

1076
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,256
(The Penthouse)

1077
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,296
(I'm Cheong A Arts High's best prodigy)

1078
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:24,466
(Seo Jin and Yoon Hee fight for the trophy.)

1079
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,510
Give me that trophy now.

1080
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:28,466
Did you think you'd always win first place?

1081
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,879
This is mine.

1082
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,106
(The extreme, girl-crush fight scene was much talked about.)

1083
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:39,589
(So Yeon's special forces training for drama "Iris" helped out.)

1084
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,990
- Oh, right. - That looks intense.

1085
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:44,116
Oh, dear. My wig came off.

1086
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:51,356
No!

1087
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:58,136
I will never let you take this.

1088
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:00,406
I had to go through all those humiliations because of you!

1089
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,240
But I got my revenge now with this.

1090
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:04,939
Do you get it? I'm the best at Cheong A Arts High School.

1091
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,145
You should know your place and stop singing.

1092
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,116
You pitiful brat.

1093
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:12,745
- What? - Fine.

1094
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,645
If you wanted to win so dearly,

1095
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:18,156
I'll let you.

1096
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:23,156
The fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin.

1097
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:29,696
You're just a darned thief.

1098
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:33,466
I'll kill you if you say one more word.

1099
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,540
Then give me that trophy now!

1100
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,805
If you still have an ounce of pride left!

1101
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:43,875
I had it coming.

1102
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,015
- Sorry. - Even now...

1103
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:58,156
Yes, this scene...

1104
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,040
(The scream of Su Ryeon who realized the truth)

1105
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:14,810
- This too. - It broke my heart.

1106
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:16,816
I still figured you deserved to know...

1107
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,116
what really happened 17 years ago.

1108
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:26,356
(The baby that was swapped 17 years ago was Min Seol A!)

1109
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:38,035
No, don't leave. Take these off me.

1110
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,305
How could you call yourself human?

1111
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:41,939
Mr. Yoon!

1112
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,279
This scene was the most-viewed...

1113
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,779
one minute from this episode.

1114
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,075
It was the most-viewed part.

1115
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,116
Joo Dan Tae.

1116
00:47:59,491 --> 00:48:02,086
I will kill you.

1117
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:11,366
(Joo Dan Tae... We saw the evil in you.)

1118
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,995
This ring.

1119
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,910
(Su Ryeon questions Dan Tae about the finger.)

1120
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:19,040
He was so evil.

1121
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,205
You finally found it?

1122
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,475
I apologize.

1123
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,779
I always got excited every time I wondered...

1124
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,645
when you might find it.

1125
00:48:26,721 --> 00:48:31,415
(It's the moment she realizes the extend of Dan Tae's evilness.)

1126
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:34,459
You killed him and kept his finger as a souvenir?

1127
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,256
The moment I saw the wedding ring on his finger,

1128
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:41,926
I totally lost my mind.

1129
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,165
How dare he steal you from me?

1130
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,410
The fact that you were pregnant with his baby...

1131
00:48:48,411 --> 00:48:51,379
made me want to tear his heart into pieces.

1132
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,810
You're crazy.

1133
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:54,645
How could I not go crazy...

1134
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:56,575
when my woman betrayed me?

1135
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:59,475
How could you leave me for an insignificant guy like him?

1136
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:01,620
You're evil.

1137
00:49:01,621 --> 00:49:04,919
Evil? So what if I slept with Seo Jin?

1138
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,856
I'm sorry, but you betrayed me first!

1139
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,796
I think...

1140
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,566
that will make up for this finger.

1141
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:19,939
(Seo Jin's mad piano play)

1142
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,205
- Oh. - Oh, this was just...

1143
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:25,406
My gosh.

1144
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:27,279
It needs no description.

1145
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,546
(Fueled with desire, Seo Jin left her father to die.)

1146
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:44,125
(Her incredible acting made her top the real-time most-searched names.)

1147
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,805
You're the one who made me like this, Dad.

1148
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:05,176
So don't feel so wronged.

1149
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:09,116
You at least...

1150
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:13,455
left me one thing.

1151
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,125
That was so cool.

1152
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,069
(Logan Lee's dramatic entrance)

1153
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,466
- Yes, this scene. - Logan.

1154
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,499
The viewers felt great when this happened.

1155
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,569
(Logan shows himself to Dan Tae.)

1156
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,236
You still don't get it now, do you, Mr. Joo?

1157
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,935
I'm the one who reported you,

1158
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:34,680
Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

1159
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:37,879
You knew how to speak Korean?

1160
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,716
I am the one who reported you to the police.

1161
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,285
Will this be enough of an answer?

1162
00:50:45,521 --> 00:50:46,656
This is...

1163
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:51,625
I told you, you were up for an unpleasant surprise.

1164
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,270
(The day the evil masks came off)

1165
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,665
This must've been so hard to film.

1166
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,479
- It must've been so tough. - That's crazy.

1167
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,609
(A massive blockbuster)

1168
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,640
It was so...

1169
00:51:05,641 --> 00:51:07,245
What are you doing?

1170
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,406
Why?

1171
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:14,685
(Su Ryeon teaches the evil parents a lesson.)

1172
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,156
Please open the door!

1173
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,520
Hey!

1174
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:25,499
(The scene was of an otherworldly scale that even involved the kids!)

1175
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,669
Confess right now.

1176
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,669
I said shut it!

1177
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,325
Our lives are at stake!

1178
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,609
- Darn it. - Stop it!

1179
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,906
You managed to control yourself.

1180
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:38,439
There was a bomb there.

1181
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,510
- I protected that. - You had a reason.

1182
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:42,010
All I did was wipe the blood off the fountain.

1183
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:44,450
You brought the golf club bag to put her body in!

1184
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:46,620
We moved that in your car!

1185
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:48,549
- And your ex-wife, this witch. - What?

1186
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,116
- Are you crazy? - It was all you!

1187
00:51:50,221 --> 00:51:51,319
It's all on you!

1188
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,555
Here at least...

1189
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:56,899
Shim Su Ryeon!

1190
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,796
That woman's out of her mind.

1191
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:03,935
It was so...

1192
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:16,350
What is this?

1193
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:21,216
(From fire, water, and raw sewage)

1194
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,959
What's that now?

1195
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,160
(It looks like a boot camp.)

1196
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,285
It looks so hard.

1197
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:33,325
Darn it!

1198
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,299
Even after her death, we enjoyed the party...

1199
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,770
as if nothing had happened.

1200
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:41,705
It was the grandest party in the world.

1201
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:47,046
(The greatest scenes which showcased captivating and impressive acting!)

1202
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,375
(Best scenes chosen by the viewers)

1203
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,886
(Everyone on the 1st and 2nd floor is reminiscing.)

1204
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:56,319
- Honestly, Do Yeon. - What?

1205
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,656
- We have it easy, making a living. - We do.

1206
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,589
Watching that was just...

1207
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,089
I got the chills.

1208
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,529
We never got drenched...

1209
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,299
or bombed by raw sewage.

1210
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,729
We're in a warm studio.

1211
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:11,140
I keep thinking that actors are just amazing.

1212
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:12,640
You screamed and...

1213
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:14,970
- talked about conscience. - Yes.

1214
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:16,406
When I watched that scene,

1215
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:18,839
I wondered if your conscience felt pricked that...

1216
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,975
you played schoolgirls.

1217
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:21,149
(Hitting with facts)

1218
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,279
To be honest.

1219
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,520
- That's so two-faced. - Exactly.

1220
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:27,785
How hard must it have been? It must've been too much.

1221
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,089
(Nodding)

1222
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,060
The viewers could think that.

1223
00:53:32,061 --> 00:53:34,586
Yes, of course they could.

1224
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:35,926
That's so funny.

1225
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:39,395
There were scenes with us in a school uniform.

1226
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:40,773
I did feel guilty.

1227
00:53:41,123 --> 00:53:42,154
So guilty.

1228
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:44,773
The scene...

1229
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,629
There were scenes with us in a school uniform.

1230
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,706
I did feel guilty.

1231
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,160
So guilty.

1232
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:53,529
The scene...

1233
00:53:54,074 --> 00:53:58,243
where you leave your father...

1234
00:53:58,244 --> 00:54:01,614
and play the piano in your room took everyone by shock.

1235
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:03,469
You blew everyone's minds with your acting every time,

1236
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,810
but the viewers were blown away even more...

1237
00:54:07,014 --> 00:54:09,154
- with that particular scene. - That's right.

1238
00:54:09,155 --> 00:54:11,453
That song isn't "Moonlight Sonata",

1239
00:54:11,454 --> 00:54:14,254
- but people said... - It was truly insane.

1240
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:16,294
that it was the craziest "Moonlight Sonata" they'd heard.

1241
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,464
That scene was such a masterpiece.

1242
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:20,660
One of the most memorable comments that I saw was that it seemed...

1243
00:54:21,034 --> 00:54:24,464
like she put her lifetime's worth of emotions into that one scene.

1244
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,564
That's right.

1245
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:27,299
I've seen a lot of comments saying something like that.

1246
00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:29,134
So Yeon's facial expression was...

1247
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:32,303
- something I've never seen before. - Indeed.

1248
00:54:32,304 --> 00:54:35,210
Ji Ah,

1249
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,379
- Your crying scene. - crying your heart out...

1250
00:54:38,414 --> 00:54:40,143
- must've been so exhausting. - I bet.

1251
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,879
Even us, who have never done any acting before,

1252
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:46,279
can imagine how exhausting it would be.

1253
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:48,123
How was it?

1254
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:51,259
I passed out for good two days after filming that scene.

1255
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:54,464
I was trying to flail around...

1256
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:56,930
while being tied down, so my muscles ached...

1257
00:54:57,094 --> 00:55:01,404
to the point where I couldn't get up for two days after.

1258
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:02,569
I bet.

1259
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:06,473
I don't think any sport could make me feel that sore.

1260
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:08,413
Right. Doesn't it feel like someone beat you up?

1261
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:11,180
And because I concentrated all my energy into that one scene,

1262
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:14,183
my whole body ached as if I had been beaten up.

1263
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:16,584
You really poured all of your energy into it.

1264
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:18,783
I was being threatened in the scene.

1265
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:22,390
I was being told that Hye In isn't my daughter,

1266
00:55:22,394 --> 00:55:25,493
and when I got the call, the voice was changed,

1267
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:28,129
but when I turned around, the secretary was holding...

1268
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:31,759
a voice changer, telling me that I should've been more careful.

1269
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:34,270
My next line was,

1270
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:38,899
"It was you? The person who's been calling me?",

1271
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:43,373
but instead, I said, "It's you!"

1272
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:45,243
That's a hilarious way of saying it.

1273
00:55:45,244 --> 00:55:48,080
That's what came out of my mouth.

1274
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,614
It was such a serious scene and I was bawling,

1275
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:54,350
- but we all burst out laughing. - "It's you!"

1276
00:55:55,425 --> 00:55:57,524
Not just that scene,

1277
00:55:57,525 --> 00:56:00,064
but you know the scene where all of you are in it together?

1278
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,390
The bus scene!

1279
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:04,663
That's a scene rare to come by in a drama.

1280
00:56:04,664 --> 00:56:06,604
- It was like a blockbuster movie. - Right?

1281
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:08,533
Everyone was on the bus...

1282
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:10,134
except for Ji Ah.

1283
00:56:10,135 --> 00:56:12,040
It must've been difficult to film that too.

1284
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:16,739
It was hard for me to stay outside in the cold too,

1285
00:56:16,945 --> 00:56:19,683
but everyone else was getting soaked,

1286
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,513
so just imagine how cold they must've been.

1287
00:56:21,514 --> 00:56:25,354
I felt so bad that I couldn't leave after finishing my lines.

1288
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:27,924
I felt so bad about leaving after.

1289
00:56:27,925 --> 00:56:29,593
- Right. - She stayed with us.

1290
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,424
It was stated on the script...

1291
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:34,734
that we would be sprayed on by sprinklers,

1292
00:56:34,735 --> 00:56:37,930
but it was a lot more water than we had expected.

1293
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:39,334
The sprinklers seemed so strong too.

1294
00:56:39,335 --> 00:56:41,834
We were really flustered. We didn't know what to do.

1295
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:44,569
We could barely say our lines.

1296
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:48,509
- It felt like we were swimming. - It was like taking a shower.

1297
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:50,544
I can't imagine how cold you guys must've been.

1298
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:54,350
Originally, that was supposed to go on for a long while.

1299
00:56:54,554 --> 00:56:56,950
We were supposed to be sprayed with water the whole time,

1300
00:56:57,085 --> 00:56:58,819
but the director changed the script for us...

1301
00:56:58,824 --> 00:57:00,723
because even he was surprised.

1302
00:57:00,724 --> 00:57:02,790
Even he thought that it was too much water.

1303
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:05,460
For how long did you guys film the scene?

1304
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:07,419
We started at sunrise and finished at sunset.

1305
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:11,899
Everyone was wet,

1306
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:16,000
and they were warming up in a tent after,

1307
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:18,640
huddled around the heater.

1308
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:22,013
Then, we started to see steam coming from Tae Gyu's clothes.

1309
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:24,314
- Goodness! - We were so surprised.

1310
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,379
Because you thought he was on fire?

1311
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,980
I got a video of that.

1312
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:30,549
Everyone was sitting by the heater too,

1313
00:57:30,554 --> 00:57:34,453
but I was the only one who had steam coming out of me.

1314
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,250
You were sitting the closest to the heater.

1315
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:39,859
You were hogging the heater, so we couldn't get close!

1316
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:42,064
(My dad...)

1317
00:57:42,065 --> 00:57:43,560
It was freezing cold.

1318
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:46,430
- It must've been a long day. - It was, wasn't it?

1319
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:50,073
It was a long day for all of us,

1320
00:57:50,074 --> 00:57:53,899
but nobody on the set complained,

1321
00:57:54,105 --> 00:57:55,873
so I was very touched by that the whole time we were filming.

1322
00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:58,843
We did a lot of bad things...

1323
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:00,343
- in the drama. - Right.

1324
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:03,283
So, after filming that day,

1325
00:58:03,284 --> 00:58:04,879
I said...

1326
00:58:05,284 --> 00:58:09,819
that this should make up for all the bad things we've done.

1327
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,560
Just that one day.

1328
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:13,794
- It was that long of a day. - Right.

1329
00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:16,129
- I have a question. - Yes?

1330
00:58:16,164 --> 00:58:18,404
You know how everyone is arguing on the bus,

1331
00:58:18,405 --> 00:58:22,234
then everyone starts apologizing?

1332
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:24,439
Everyone is arguing, then out of nowhere,

1333
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:26,573
Seo Jin says, "I'm sorry!"

1334
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:28,069
- It was really funny. - Indeed.

1335
00:58:28,974 --> 00:58:31,714
(One by one, everyone is starting to apologize, then...)

1336
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:34,649
(I'm sorry!)

1337
00:58:35,284 --> 00:58:37,049
(I'm sorry!)

1338
00:58:37,624 --> 00:58:39,424
- Right? - It was funny.

1339
00:58:39,425 --> 00:58:40,723
You were intending it to be funny, right?

1340
00:58:40,724 --> 00:58:41,723
It wasn't a part of the script.

1341
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:42,794
- It was an improvisation. - It was?

1342
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:45,520
The one where you scream, "I'm sorry!"?

1343
00:58:45,724 --> 00:58:47,263
- Really? - "I'm sorry!"

1344
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:49,393
Who in the world apologizes like that?

1345
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:50,464
Her eyes are huge like this,

1346
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:52,700
and she screams, "I'm sorry!"

1347
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:57,500
- It was dark humor. - Indeed.

1348
00:58:57,804 --> 00:59:00,739
And in the scene, I tell Su Ryeon...

1349
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:03,169
that we shouldn't get so worked up.

1350
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:05,683
I tell her that we should take a deep breath instead.

1351
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:07,540
- Why did I take one instead? - So Yeon took one instead.

1352
00:59:08,454 --> 00:59:11,120
I asked myself that too when I watched the episode.

1353
00:59:11,554 --> 00:59:14,424
(Here's the clip.)

1354
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,794
Let's calm down.

1355
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:17,819
Take a deep breath first.

1356
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:21,134
(Taking a deep breath)

1357
00:59:21,135 --> 00:59:23,033
You're not going to kill all of us in here, are you?

1358
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:24,759
You were reacting to him even there.

1359
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:26,433
That's hilarious.

1360
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:29,629
I wonder...

1361
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:34,509
what you consider the best part of the drama.

1362
00:59:34,514 --> 00:59:36,814
I'd say So Yeon's scene.

1363
00:59:36,815 --> 00:59:38,714
I think it was the last episode.

1364
00:59:38,715 --> 00:59:41,879
When I saw it, I shared about how good it is on our chat.

1365
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:44,254
It's when she's on the phone,

1366
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,120
- But she's holding herself back? - but she's holding her tears back.

1367
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:49,120
Yes.

1368
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:51,694
- Eun Byeol. - When she was calling everyone.

1369
00:59:51,695 --> 00:59:54,660
I felt ecstatic for the first time when I watched that.

1370
00:59:56,465 --> 00:59:59,933
(Seo Jin is calling all the alumni...)

1371
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:03,500
(in order to save the foundation from the unfair entrance scandal.)

1372
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:07,913
(It's a great scene where you can see all of Seo Jin's emotions,)

1373
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:11,410
(including sadness, frustration, desperation, and more.)

1374
01:00:11,914 --> 01:00:15,609
Hello, I'm Director Cheon Seo Jin.

1375
01:00:18,624 --> 01:00:20,819
I'm calling to ask for help...

1376
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:25,189
regarding the foundation's scandal.

1377
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,330
Please help.

1378
01:00:38,374 --> 01:00:39,803
It was incredible.

1379
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,739
I'm sure everyone would agree.

1380
01:00:41,744 --> 01:00:43,370
Eun Byeol, what about you?

1381
01:00:43,675 --> 01:00:46,343
When Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung find out...

1382
01:00:46,344 --> 01:00:48,584
that Su Ryeon is dead,

1383
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:51,084
it was heartbreaking to see them get so emotional.

1384
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:53,719
Seok Kyung tears books apart.

1385
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:57,620
Did you tear up watching that?

1386
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:59,390
Yes, I did.

1387
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:05,433
(A great scene in episode 21 where Seok Kyung and Seok Hoon...)

1388
01:01:05,434 --> 01:01:10,430
(get emotional as they find out that Su Ryeon is dead.)

1389
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:11,873
- Let me go. - Seok Kyung!

1390
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:14,270
Let go of me!

1391
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,410
Calm down. What's wrong?

1392
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:17,879
I'm so mad.

1393
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:20,210
I'm so mad, I might go crazy.

1394
01:01:23,715 --> 01:01:24,919
Seok Kyung.

1395
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:26,924
Seok Kyung, calm down!

1396
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:31,049
She abandoned me!

1397
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:33,189
It's fine.

1398
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:37,230
Mom!

1399
01:01:37,295 --> 01:01:39,759
Mom!

1400
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:41,529
It'll be okay.

1401
01:01:41,804 --> 01:01:43,000
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung?

1402
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:44,433
I'm honored.

1403
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,774
(Shy)

1404
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:50,140
You didn't like your stepmother. No, you hated her,

1405
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:53,839
but even then, you hated...

1406
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,250
the idea of her disappearing.

1407
01:01:55,414 --> 01:01:58,484
- I hated her, but not to death. - But not to death!

1408
01:01:58,485 --> 01:01:59,819
I didn't tell her to get out and die.

1409
01:02:00,025 --> 01:02:01,689
I just told her to get out.

1410
01:02:02,025 --> 01:02:03,453
You only wished that she'd leave the house,

1411
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:05,020
- not die. - No.

1412
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:08,589
She should've just gone out, but she went overboard and died too.

1413
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,660
That's what it was.

1414
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:13,560
Jenny, what about you?

1415
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:15,469
(Humming)

1416
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:18,604
Seok Hoon, what was that? He was singing just now.

1417
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:20,703
I think of this song whenever I hear Jenny's name.

1418
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,544
- What song? - "SOLO".

1419
01:02:22,545 --> 01:02:24,779
(That's "SOLO" by Jennie of BLACKPINK.)

1420
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:29,683
(You guys are truly the Evil Avengers, right?)

1421
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:31,680
Jenny, which scene is the most memorable to you?

1422
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:33,453
It's my mom's scene,

1423
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:37,194
in which she works as the scrub mistress.

1424
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:38,864
I know a lot of viewers were surprised by that.

1425
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:41,794
- Indeed. - They were shocked by her past...

1426
01:02:41,795 --> 01:02:44,093
and wondered how Jenny would react to that...

1427
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,404
and how our relationship would change when I found out.

1428
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:49,334
A lot of people were asking where the father went too.

1429
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:51,703
I got emotional watching my mom...

1430
01:02:51,704 --> 01:02:54,404
work so hard.

1431
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:56,473
Those cupping marks were...

1432
01:02:56,474 --> 01:02:58,614
- They made it so realistic. - Indeed.

1433
01:02:58,615 --> 01:03:02,980
There was so much hard work and dedication put into the drama,

1434
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:07,779
and I think that's what created so many legendary scenes.

1435
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:10,553
I just wanted to say this.

1436
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:13,890
The drama was such a huge hit,

1437
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:17,364
and the reason for that...

1438
01:03:17,365 --> 01:03:19,230
is that not only everyone worked hard,

1439
01:03:19,905 --> 01:03:23,029
but more so because everyone was...

1440
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,700
a great lead role,

1441
01:03:25,244 --> 01:03:28,569
and also an amazing supporting character.

1442
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,310
I think that's what brought the drama so much success.

1443
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:35,413
Everyone was a main character, but they were all great sub-characters.

1444
01:03:35,414 --> 01:03:38,484
It felt like the main character changed with every episode,

1445
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,080
and they all have a solid storyline.

1446
01:03:40,324 --> 01:03:43,120
They'd all be a main character and then a sub-character.

1447
01:03:43,655 --> 01:03:45,364
There were no holes.

1448
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:47,620
That's why I think it did so well.

1449
01:03:48,795 --> 01:03:53,700
(The Penthouse 2 premieres on Friday, February 19.)

1450
01:03:53,804 --> 01:03:57,573
People are curious about even the small details...

1451
01:03:57,574 --> 01:04:00,303
- of popular dramas. - Right. The behind the scenes.

1452
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,674
They wonder if they purposely included a certain subplot,

1453
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:05,484
or if the actors just acted out the scenes on the spot.

1454
01:04:05,485 --> 01:04:07,143
There are so many things people are curious about.

1455
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:10,053
My curiosity led me to even think about this.

1456
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,149
I even wondered...

1457
01:04:12,425 --> 01:04:15,194
if Eun Kyung's eyeshadow color had a meaning.

1458
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:18,460
- One day, it was green, and... - Depending on the day.

1459
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,093
That's a very detailed observation.

1460
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:22,194
- Her eyeshadow color changed. - Right.

1461
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:25,104
That's why we'll discuss the color of your outfits,

1462
01:04:25,105 --> 01:04:27,899
your characters, and their desires.

1463
01:04:28,434 --> 01:04:29,933
(The Outfit Colors, the Characters, and Desires)

1464
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:31,370
(What the Viewers Think 1)

1465
01:04:33,045 --> 01:04:39,040
(Su Ryeon often wore pastel tones and white in the drama.)

1466
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:41,654
(In comparison to that,)

1467
01:04:41,655 --> 01:04:46,080
(Seo Jin wore a lot of black and red.)

1468
01:04:48,425 --> 01:04:55,390
(That's why there was a sharp contrast when they were together.)

1469
01:04:56,465 --> 01:05:01,569
(But there was a time when the tone of their outfits changed.)

1470
01:05:03,675 --> 01:05:09,339
(Whenever Su Ryeon exhibited her girl-crush charms, she wore black.)

1471
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:19,919
(Whenever Seo Jin was around her strict father, she wore white.)

1472
01:05:19,954 --> 01:05:24,859
(Was this all by chance? Or was this intentional?)

1473
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:27,819
(But that's not all.)

1474
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:32,859
(Oh Yoon Hee's dress code included a lot of bright colors.)

1475
01:05:32,965 --> 01:05:34,160
Since I'm...

1476
01:05:36,074 --> 01:05:37,500
a mom.

1477
01:05:38,074 --> 01:05:41,939
(Once she decided to betray Su Ryeon, her dress code changed.)

1478
01:05:43,445 --> 01:05:44,669
That seat next to you...

1479
01:05:45,344 --> 01:05:49,649
(It seemed as though her dress code became more similar to Seo Jin's.)

1480
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:01,529
(Does the color of their outfits reflect the depth of their desires?)

1481
01:06:02,065 --> 01:06:05,064
I'm sure many people asked you this question.

1482
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:07,003
A lot of viewers saw that...

1483
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:10,303
Ji Ah wore a lot of bright colors...

1484
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:13,843
- and a lot of white. - Right.

1485
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:17,173
- So Yeon wore dark colors... - Right.

1486
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:18,883
like red and black.

1487
01:06:18,884 --> 01:06:22,583
Eugene started out wearing bright tones and then it got darker,

1488
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:24,354
and she started wearing red.

1489
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:29,454
Is this something you discuss with your stylists?

1490
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:32,393
Or does the production crew suggest it...

1491
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:35,593
and make decisions after reaching a consensus with the actors?

1492
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:37,164
Or is it none of the above,

1493
01:06:37,165 --> 01:06:39,864
and are the viewers just overthinking it?

1494
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:41,404
Is it all a coincidence...

1495
01:06:41,405 --> 01:06:44,173
when you just wore the colors and brands that you liked?

1496
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:45,774
Maybe you just wore what was given to you,

1497
01:06:45,775 --> 01:06:48,444
- and we're too into it. - You're right.

1498
01:06:48,445 --> 01:06:51,040
Since there are a lot of actors,

1499
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:55,013
we all chose a color that fit our characters, so they didn't overlap.

1500
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:57,383
- We discussed it with each other. - Is that so?

1501
01:06:57,384 --> 01:06:59,053
That includes the makeup too. Compared to the beginning,

1502
01:06:59,054 --> 01:07:01,923
our makeup becomes darker as we turn more evil.

1503
01:07:01,924 --> 01:07:04,324
To help with our acting,

1504
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:06,859
we wanted to provide a visual change...

1505
01:07:07,495 --> 01:07:10,933
so that the viewers could feel the emotions and nature of the scene.

1506
01:07:10,934 --> 01:07:12,729
We prepared a lot for it.

1507
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,833
In the scene where So Yeon and I were together,

1508
01:07:15,834 --> 01:07:19,543
- we both prepared black outfits. - The dresses.

1509
01:07:19,544 --> 01:07:22,374
But when I heard that So Yeon was wearing black,

1510
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,874
- I changed it into a white dress. - Right.

1511
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:26,043
That way, in scenes where we confront each other...

1512
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:28,183
- Right. You provided contrast. - It was like good and evil.

1513
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:31,010
Right. We paid attention to those details.

1514
01:07:32,184 --> 01:07:36,093
Did the color of your eyeshadow also have a meaning?

1515
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,019
Yes. There was nothing for me to do.

1516
01:07:38,195 --> 01:07:40,519
I looked into it, and that was the only color left, so I chose it.

1517
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,830
It was unparalleled.

1518
01:07:43,964 --> 01:07:46,200
The green was very conspicuous.

1519
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:49,673
The next thing the viewers thought was...

1520
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:51,529
Viewers these days are really incredible.

1521
01:07:51,544 --> 01:07:55,444
I never thought they'd be curious about this too.

1522
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:58,143
They found something that is extremely detailed.

1523
01:07:58,144 --> 01:07:59,779
- Let's take a look. - Okay.

1524
01:07:59,884 --> 01:08:02,779
(The Like-Sisters Soju Bottle, What the Viewers Think 2)

1525
01:08:02,815 --> 01:08:05,479
(In Episode 8 of The Penthouse)

1526
01:08:06,985 --> 01:08:08,220
"Like Sisters"?

1527
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:12,889
Aren't you having a hard time?

1528
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:16,194
(Like Sisters)

1529
01:08:16,195 --> 01:08:19,133
When I saw that on set, I laughed a lot.

1530
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:20,529
It was a prop.

1531
01:08:21,304 --> 01:08:24,729
(What's the secret behind the soju bottle?)

1532
01:08:25,075 --> 01:08:28,609
A lot of people mentioned that soju bottle.

1533
01:08:28,745 --> 01:08:31,779
They wondered why they labeled it "Like Sisters".

1534
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:34,284
Was there a hidden intention?

1535
01:08:34,285 --> 01:08:37,654
Or did the props team make it out of their love for you guys?

1536
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,253
The props team made it,

1537
01:08:40,254 --> 01:08:43,524
- and they're all very detailed. - Right.

1538
01:08:43,525 --> 01:08:47,864
They wanted to portray Su Ryeon and Yoon Hee's relationship,

1539
01:08:47,865 --> 01:08:49,793
so they labeled it "Like Sisters".

1540
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:51,963
In a different scene, the label was different.

1541
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:53,904
- It was very... - Were any labeled "Like Enemies"?

1542
01:08:53,905 --> 01:08:55,534
- "Like Enemies". - "Like Enemies"?

1543
01:08:55,535 --> 01:08:57,604
- Like a spoiler. - "Like Enemies"!

1544
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:58,973
- "Like Enemies". - "Like Enemies".

1545
01:08:58,974 --> 01:09:01,099
Once the culprit is revealed, "Like the Culprit".

1546
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:03,639
- That's a good idea. - That would be good.

1547
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,744
- It could be a hint. - Right.

1548
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:07,139
It could be a clue.

1549
01:09:08,754 --> 01:09:11,984
Also... Gosh, this is... This made me realize how...

1550
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:17,149
a lot of people read deeply into the various aspects of the drama.

1551
01:09:17,155 --> 01:09:18,389
Let's take a look first.

1552

01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:30,003
There we go.

1556
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:31,370
The ending scene.

1557
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:36,269
(What's the meaning of this ending?)

1558
01:09:37,415 --> 01:09:40,713
- It's from "Titanic". Right. - A lot of people read into this.

1559
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:43,784
Lee Ji Ah is standing in the back,

1560
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:45,654
and Eugene is standing in the front.

1561
01:09:45,655 --> 01:09:46,984
In the movie "Titanic",

1562
01:09:46,985 --> 01:09:48,923
- DiCaprio stood in the back, - Right.

1563
01:09:48,924 --> 01:09:51,253
- And DiCaprio died. - and then he died.

1564
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,519
The characters both died.

1565
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:56,994
So people wondered if that was an intended subplot.

1566
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:59,003
- They went as far as to think that. - That's incredible.

1567
01:09:59,004 --> 01:10:02,734
But others are saying that it has no meaning.

1568
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,204
I want to say it has a big meaning.

1569
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:05,973
- Just because. - I know.

1570
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:07,104
Just because.

1571
01:10:07,105 --> 01:10:08,574
- Say it has a meaning. - Lie about it.

1572
01:10:08,575 --> 01:10:10,809
Lie about it. Say that you discussed it with the director.

1573
01:10:10,844 --> 01:10:13,744
Honestly though, the people who were filming this...

1574
01:10:13,745 --> 01:10:15,683
were filming us from afar.

1575
01:10:15,684 --> 01:10:18,154
So they didn't give us any directions.

1576
01:10:18,155 --> 01:10:22,120
It was really just us goofing off.

1577
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:24,694
While we were filming, we were reminded of the scene,

1578
01:10:24,695 --> 01:10:26,124
so we decided to do it.

1579
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:29,633
The two of us were on the boat alone for a long time.

1580
01:10:29,634 --> 01:10:32,003
- There were drones filming us. - Drones were filming us.

1581
01:10:32,004 --> 01:10:33,534
We ran out of things to do,

1582
01:10:33,535 --> 01:10:35,673
so we tried this and that.

1583
01:10:35,674 --> 01:10:37,003
We tried various things.

1584
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:39,574
- As an ardent viewer, - That's scarier.

1585
01:10:39,575 --> 01:10:41,239
- that was disappointing. - It was disappointing.

1586
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:44,874
That just shows us how much interest people have been taking...

1587
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,883
in this drama.

1588
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:48,583
It's like a game to the viewers.

1589
01:10:48,584 --> 01:10:51,083
It's like a game for the viewers...

1590
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:52,784
- and netizens. - Right.

1591
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:55,093
So regardless of whether or not it was right,

1592
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:57,649
it was something they wanted to know, so we asked you about it.

1593
01:10:58,594 --> 01:11:00,223
(The actors' off-screen chemistry that you couldn't see in the drama)

1594
01:11:00,224 --> 01:11:01,293
(Falling)

1595
01:11:01,294 --> 01:11:03,559
I've lost my center of balance.

1596
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:05,604
(It's always cheerful at the set.)

1597
01:11:05,605 --> 01:11:06,734
- Oh, my. - Okay.

1598
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:08,800
Did you say "Oh, my"?

1599
01:11:08,804 --> 01:11:09,929
(Her feelings are hurt.)

1600
01:11:10,235 --> 01:11:11,500
Oh, my goodness!

1601
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,414
(Fighting)

1602
01:11:15,415 --> 01:11:16,574
You can push him harder.

1603
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:18,609
- Never mind. - All of a sudden?

1604
01:11:20,245 --> 01:11:22,183
- Gosh, it's incredible. - That was good.

1605
01:11:22,184 --> 01:11:24,210
What? You're incredible?

1606
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:30,050
- Good work, everyone. - Good work, everyone.

1607
01:11:30,855 --> 01:11:33,489
You murderer. You piece of trash!

1608
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:38,189
- Cut. Very good. - Very good.

1609
01:11:38,195 --> 01:11:40,029
I had to call him a piece of trash first. Darn.

1610
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:44,630
I'm going to clean the vineyard and return in Season Two!

1611
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:47,099
You're going to lose the vineyard.

1612
01:11:48,544 --> 01:11:50,670
Hit me. Hit me. Slam it down. No.

1613
01:11:51,884 --> 01:11:53,910
Slam it down on my head!

1614
01:11:55,384 --> 01:11:57,179
(Flying out)

1615
01:11:59,985 --> 01:12:01,479
I hate this!

1616
01:12:03,955 --> 01:12:05,689
(Grabbing his collar 1 time)

1617
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:08,660
(Grabbing his collar 2 times)

1618
01:12:08,834 --> 01:12:09,960
Let go!

1619
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:12,604
- Hey! - Is it you again?

1620
01:12:12,605 --> 01:12:13,904
(Laughing)

1621
01:12:13,905 --> 01:12:15,059
Is it you again?

1622
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:17,899
I was here the whole time.

1623
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:23,040
- Okay. - Is there a dove in there?

1624
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,179
(Laughing hysterically)

1625
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,349
Then we hear the wings flapping.

1626
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:32,979
- Yes. I'm drunk. - Yoon Chul is handsome. Good job.

1627
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,194
- It was really good. - Do we have to do this?

1628
01:12:36,195 --> 01:12:39,819
(We applaud good acting.)

1629
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:41,090
(Shouting)

1630
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:42,729
(Exclaiming)

1631
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:44,933
- Are you satisfied? - That was great.

1632
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:46,399
Let's go over there.

1633
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:48,670
Yes!

1634
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:52,803
I saw the atmosphere on set in the behind-the-scenes footage,

1635
01:12:52,804 --> 01:12:55,874
and everyone seemed really close.

1636
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:59,013
- Right. - You laughed too much to film.

1637
01:12:59,014 --> 01:13:02,614
So it's time for us to show the viewers...

1638
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:05,683
how close you guys really are.

1639
01:13:05,684 --> 01:13:08,994
We'll get closer now with the Get Close Talk.

1640
01:13:08,995 --> 01:13:11,723
For the Get Close Talk, we used these phones...

1641
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:13,763
to create a group chat.

1642
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:17,093
The people invited to this group chat...

1643
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:19,963
are all the actors here.

1644
01:13:19,964 --> 01:13:22,670
You have all been invited to the group chat.

1645
01:13:23,105 --> 01:13:26,000
Eun Seok, you chose this as your profile picture.

1646
01:13:26,844 --> 01:13:29,769
I'll send you a group message during Lunar New Year.

1647
01:13:31,214 --> 01:13:33,479
- Don't turn off your notifications. - Thank you.

1648
01:13:33,644 --> 01:13:34,809
Is it done?

1649
01:13:35,684 --> 01:13:37,454
You may write your own name.

1650
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:40,024
- This is a secret ballot. - Of course.

1651
01:13:40,025 --> 01:13:41,553
We promise you...

1652
01:13:41,554 --> 01:13:44,154
- to keep it a secret. - It's anonymous.

1653
01:13:44,155 --> 01:13:45,223
Right?

1654
01:13:45,224 --> 01:13:48,263
We'll reveal the result only to the viewers.

1655
01:13:48,264 --> 01:13:50,133
- Be honest. - Yes.

1656
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,630
While shooting,

1657
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:56,500
you all worked very hard,

1658
01:13:56,605 --> 01:14:00,239
but is there anyone who you think worked harder than you did?

1659
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:02,814
Including yourself,

1660
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:03,814
(The voting begins.)

1661
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:04,843
message us one person's name.

1662
01:14:04,844 --> 01:14:06,543
As soon as he finished reading the question,

1663
01:14:06,544 --> 01:14:08,849
Jong Hun messaged me.

1664
01:14:09,985 --> 01:14:12,053
I thought it was anonymous.

1665
01:14:12,054 --> 01:14:13,583
I should've kept quiet.

1666
01:14:13,584 --> 01:14:15,253
We never said whom you voted for.

1667
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:16,819
But...

1668
01:14:17,254 --> 01:14:19,389
This is so fun to read alone.

1669
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:21,824
She just quietly said,

1670
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,460
"What? He thinks he worked the hardest?"

1671
01:14:24,434 --> 01:14:26,404
- You didn't say that, did you? - Never.

1672
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:27,763
- We ensure secrecy. - I'll remain silent.

1673
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,099
Hold on.

1674
01:14:29,434 --> 01:14:30,933
You must think that at least one person...

1675
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:33,803
would write your name, right?

1676
01:14:33,804 --> 01:14:35,104
Or think, "But what if no one does?"

1677
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:36,739
"Should I write my own name?"

1678
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:38,314
I bet you all have a lot in your heads.

1679
01:14:38,315 --> 01:14:41,340
Let me tell you something about the message I got so far.

1680
01:14:42,084 --> 01:14:44,383
You'll watch this later, right?

1681
01:14:44,384 --> 01:14:46,723
I suggest you wait until the drama is over.

1682
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:52,189
(I'm not really laughing.)

1683
01:14:52,964 --> 01:14:54,524
Here's the result.

1684
01:14:54,525 --> 01:14:56,229
Hang on. Let me see.

1685
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:57,929
(Sighing)

1686
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:01,364
(Why am I nervous over this?)

1687
01:15:01,365 --> 01:15:03,774
Are you not going to tell us? Is that it?

1688
01:15:03,775 --> 01:15:05,200
It's for our own fun.

1689
01:15:07,474 --> 01:15:08,910
How funny.

1690
01:15:09,674 --> 01:15:12,484
- Nine actors voted. - Yes.

1691
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:14,580
The actor who placed first...

1692
01:15:15,214 --> 01:15:16,484
received six votes.

1693
01:15:16,485 --> 01:15:17,880
(9 actors voted, and 1st place received 6 votes.)

1694
01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:20,984
I guess there's something we don't know.

1695
01:15:20,985 --> 01:15:22,093
Mr. Sickly Sexy.

1696
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:23,290
(Me?)

1697
01:15:24,695 --> 01:15:27,324
No, I'm clapping because...

1698
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:28,994
"sickly sexy" sounds very appealing.

1699
01:15:28,995 --> 01:15:30,064
(He got me again.)

1700
01:15:30,065 --> 01:15:32,763
- For you to be healthy. - That's right.

1701
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:34,460
- Did you see his face? - I know.

1702
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:35,574
Sickly Sexy.

1703
01:15:35,575 --> 01:15:37,003
(What? Did I hear that right? Is it really me?)

1704
01:15:37,004 --> 01:15:39,769
(Really? Be modest, Jong Hun.)

1705
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:41,204
I'll continue to give it up for you.

1706
01:15:41,205 --> 01:15:43,170
- Right. - Mr. Sickly Sexy.

1707
01:15:43,674 --> 01:15:45,269
This person received a lot of votes.

1708
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:47,583
The winner is Cheon Seo Jin.

1709
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:48,883
(Cheon Seo Jin received the most votes.)

1710
01:15:48,884 --> 01:15:50,114
Congratulations.

1711
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:53,223
Everyone worked very hard.

1712
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:55,354
- Everyone worked hard, but... - Of course.

1713
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:57,290
you worked harder a bit more.

1714
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:59,893
I think it's because...

1715
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:02,133
Cheon Seo Jin has a lot of lines.

1716
01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:04,963
She also says those lines without thinking.

1717
01:16:04,964 --> 01:16:06,364
(In fact, she speaks fast without thinking.)

1718
01:16:06,365 --> 01:16:10,473
I think that's why I was voted.

1719
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:12,204
When we work together,

1720
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:13,803
even when I'm not in a shoot,

1721
01:16:13,804 --> 01:16:16,439
if I hear someone screaming,

1722
01:16:16,474 --> 01:16:18,074
it's her.

1723
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:19,744
If someone's pouring out so much energy,

1724
01:16:19,745 --> 01:16:21,683
it's her again.

1725
01:16:21,684 --> 01:16:25,083
I'd feel exhausted by just watching her.

1726
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:27,723
I'm sure they voted for you...

1727
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:30,553
because they could feel how much things were tough...

1728
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:31,694
for you.

1729
01:16:31,695 --> 01:16:33,393
Should I announce second place?

1730
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:37,164
Name everyone who received a vote regardless of the vote counts.

1731
01:16:37,165 --> 01:16:38,393
Everyone who received a vote?

1732
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:41,064
- Ms. Oh Yoon Hee. - Oh, right.

1733
01:16:41,065 --> 01:16:42,370
Thank you.

1734
01:16:42,705 --> 01:16:46,574
It's been quite a while since you started acting,

1735
01:16:46,575 --> 01:16:47,944
but you had a hiatus...

1736
01:16:47,945 --> 01:16:50,614
while giving birth and raising children.

1737
01:16:50,615 --> 01:16:52,444
So your speech at the award was...

1738
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:54,609
- very touching. - Right.

1739
01:16:55,315 --> 01:16:59,824
(Her speech at the SBS Drama Awards was touching.)

1740
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:01,624
I was worried if I could really act again.

1741
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,024
If I could do well.

1742
01:17:03,025 --> 01:17:04,793
This made me decide...

1743
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:07,590
to continue to act again.

1744
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:10,864
I've been acting for over 30 years.

1745
01:17:10,865 --> 01:17:14,700
But it was the first time to have...

1746
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:17,604
such easygoing actors...

1747
01:17:17,605 --> 01:17:18,673
- with a good atmosphere. - I know.

1748
01:17:18,674 --> 01:17:20,143
- You've met so many actors. - That's very true.

1749
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:22,170
- Who gave you the hardest time? - I've worked since I was 13.

1750
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:24,814
Wait. You can message me.

1751
01:17:24,815 --> 01:17:26,843
- Set the date for it. - Okay.

1752
01:17:26,844 --> 01:17:28,950
I can't wait to hear it.

1753
01:17:28,955 --> 01:17:30,984
I wish we'll be able to talk about these things openly...

1754
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:32,784
- Right. - one day.

1755
01:17:32,785 --> 01:17:36,024
It was my first time working with Eun Kyung.

1756
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:37,793
I was very surprised...

1757
01:17:37,794 --> 01:17:40,293
and moved at the beginning.

1758
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:42,760
She's very passionate.

1759
01:17:42,794 --> 01:17:44,559
She's the one with the most experience,

1760
01:17:44,764 --> 01:17:46,534
- but she works the hardest. - I know.

1761
01:17:46,535 --> 01:17:48,534
Every time I watch TV,

1762
01:17:48,535 --> 01:17:50,234
comments like these get edited out.

1763
01:17:50,235 --> 01:17:52,574
We'll add this one out of nowhere.

1764
01:17:52,575 --> 01:17:54,503
- "Out of nowhere"? - Yes.

1765
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,843
Please don't edit it out.

1766
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:59,583
I mean it. I'm sure everyone feels the same.

1767
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:02,253
I'll be quick, so they won't edit it out.

1768
01:18:02,254 --> 01:18:03,814
Sometimes the color of our outfits...

1769
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:05,654
can overlap,

1770
01:18:05,655 --> 01:18:07,380
then she'd volunteer...

1771
01:18:07,384 --> 01:18:08,524
to get changed.

1772
01:18:08,525 --> 01:18:10,854
That's how considerate she is.

1773
01:18:10,855 --> 01:18:12,364
- She's very... - She's very kind.

1774
01:18:12,365 --> 01:18:14,124
If someone's arm...

1775
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:16,133
or parts of their bodies are in the angle,

1776
01:18:16,134 --> 01:18:18,963
they'd coast,

1777
01:18:18,964 --> 01:18:20,963
- but she'd work hard... - Right.

1778
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:22,473
even when she's not in the angle at all.

1779
01:18:22,474 --> 01:18:24,874
I know what kind of person she is...

1780
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,239
from working with her in the past.

1781
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:29,410
Since I spoke fast, please don't edit it out.

1782
01:18:29,974 --> 01:18:31,213
(Adding on)

1783
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:33,513
Let me add to that.

1784
01:18:33,514 --> 01:18:36,753
She keeps the balance in the drama.

1785
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,309
- This must air. - Yes.

1786
01:18:39,884 --> 01:18:42,290
Shall we move on to the second question?

1787
01:18:42,294 --> 01:18:44,950
We first begin with...

1788
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:47,090
heartwarming questions.

1789
01:18:47,964 --> 01:18:50,059
You're supposed to feel uncomfortable on variety shows.

1790
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:52,763
- I'm sorry about that. - You're supposed to reveal a lot.

1791
01:18:52,764 --> 01:18:53,803
Right.

1792
01:18:53,804 --> 01:18:55,734
- You must keep this anonymous. - Okay.

1793
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:58,034
- And don't say who sent it. - Okay.

1794
01:18:58,035 --> 01:18:59,170
You're all close,

1795
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:03,010
but is there anyone you feel personally uncomfortable with?

1796
01:19:03,474 --> 01:19:05,473
We feel uncomfortable asking this question too.

1797
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:06,484
(He doesn't know what to do.)

1798
01:19:06,485 --> 01:19:07,710
There may be many reasons.

1799
01:19:09,485 --> 01:19:12,223
For example, someone else might be too funny...

1800
01:19:12,224 --> 01:19:13,324
when you want to be the clown.

1801
01:19:13,325 --> 01:19:15,423
So you never get a chance to be funny.

1802
01:19:15,424 --> 01:19:17,524
Or someone you feel difficult to face.

1803
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:19,624
Let's say you like to drink,

1804
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,664
but someone is too exemplary.

1805
01:19:21,665 --> 01:19:23,994
Or you prefer coffee instead of drinking,

1806
01:19:23,995 --> 01:19:27,463
but there's someone who drinks every time you meet.

1807
01:19:27,464 --> 01:19:29,673
- And so on. - That makes sense.

1808
01:19:29,674 --> 01:19:32,843
It's nothing negative.

1809
01:19:32,844 --> 01:19:35,239
Ki Joon's twitching.

1810
01:19:36,044 --> 01:19:37,513
The more it vibrates...

1811
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:39,643
(The more her phone vibrates, the more nervous Joo Dan Tae gets.)

1812
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:42,984
I won't say who it is.

1813
01:19:42,985 --> 01:19:44,383
Thank you for the quick answer, Jong Hun.

1814
01:19:44,384 --> 01:19:46,019
Oh, come on.

1815
01:19:46,025 --> 01:19:47,883
- You have one? - How can you answer so fast?

1816
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:49,149
You have someone?

1817
01:19:49,155 --> 01:19:50,854
You could answer right away.

1818
01:19:50,855 --> 01:19:52,423
Can anyone openly share...

1819
01:19:52,424 --> 01:19:55,120
why you find someone uncomfortable?

1820
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,064
That makes you very cool, just so you know.

1821
01:19:57,065 --> 01:19:58,164
(That's absurd.)

1822
01:19:58,165 --> 01:19:59,564
- How is that cool? - No one fell for it.

1823
01:19:59,565 --> 01:20:00,664
- It's brave. - No one fell for it.

1824
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:02,574
- Anyone? - I picked Tae Gyu.

1825
01:20:02,575 --> 01:20:04,529
You find me uncomfortable? Hold on.

1826
01:20:04,535 --> 01:20:05,673
Hold on.

1827
01:20:05,674 --> 01:20:07,744
- I picked Tae Gyu. - Tell me. Why?

1828
01:20:07,745 --> 01:20:09,074
- You see... - I have a reason.

1829
01:20:09,075 --> 01:20:11,944
Jong Hun said he picked Tae Gyu,

1830
01:20:11,945 --> 01:20:13,914
but Tae Gyu said there's none.

1831
01:20:13,915 --> 01:20:15,683
- My goodness. - Tell me why.

1832
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:18,753
I didn't have anyone else to write aside from him.

1833
01:20:18,754 --> 01:20:20,753
Because we're so close, I thought he'd understand if I wrote his name.

1834
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:22,553
Oh, right. You could do that if you're closest.

1835
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:23,854
That's the best compliment.

1836
01:20:23,855 --> 01:20:25,154
I have one too.

1837
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:26,260
I picked Tae Gyu too.

1838
01:20:27,665 --> 01:20:29,760
Did you feel the same?

1839
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:31,160
You are...

1840
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:33,463
- so popular. - Right.

1841
01:20:33,464 --> 01:20:36,069
They just think I'm easy.

1842
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:37,303
Because I wouldn't bicker about it.

1843
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:38,534
- That's right. - Right.

1844
01:20:38,535 --> 01:20:41,444
Someone who'd manage his anger well even if he hears this.

1845
01:20:41,445 --> 01:20:42,673
(Kyu Jin's calm already.)

1846
01:20:42,674 --> 01:20:43,744
Right.

1847
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:44,944
Anyone else wants to take this chance?

1848
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:48,284
- "Take this chance". - I picked Seo Jin.

1849
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:50,683
It's not that I find her uncomfortable.

1850
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:53,053
I had many shoots with the other ladies.

1851
01:20:53,054 --> 01:20:54,824
So I had many chances to get to know them.

1852
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:56,324
You didn't have many scenes with her?

1853
01:20:56,325 --> 01:20:57,654
Right. She's also...

1854
01:20:57,655 --> 01:20:59,664
very kind.

1855
01:20:59,665 --> 01:21:01,963
So even if I wanted to approach her,

1856
01:21:01,964 --> 01:21:04,660
I wasn't sure how I should.

1857
01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:07,303
That's why when I watched her acting,

1858
01:21:07,304 --> 01:21:08,833
it felt real.

1859
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:10,574
If we're very close,

1860
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:12,673
- I can predict how she'd act. - Right.

1861
01:21:12,674 --> 01:21:14,500
But we don't have that.

1862
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,713
- That's why. It's a positive thing. - That's true.

1863
01:21:16,714 --> 01:21:18,173
- And... - I also chose Logan Lee.

1864
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:20,244
Did you pick me?

1865
01:21:20,245 --> 01:21:21,244
- Why? - It's the same reason.

1866
01:21:21,245 --> 01:21:23,354
I've hit or fought...

1867
01:21:23,355 --> 01:21:24,383
with everyone else,

1868
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:26,253
but I never had a scene...

1869
01:21:26,254 --> 01:21:28,553
that confronted or made eye contact with him.

1870
01:21:28,554 --> 01:21:29,994
- Except when I was Ho Dong. - It's a shame.

1871
01:21:29,995 --> 01:21:31,954
- Oh, right. - Ho Dong...

1872
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:33,559
He was wearing a wig.

1873
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,290
- Right. - He was in a wig.

1874
01:21:35,294 --> 01:21:36,433
- He wore a wig. - It's like you consider...

1875
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:39,599
Ho Dong and Logan Lee as two different people.

1876
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:41,404
If you find each other uncomfortable in real life,

1877
01:21:41,405 --> 01:21:42,800
it's best not to meet outside.

1878
01:21:43,705 --> 01:21:45,303
- Yes. - Stay away.

1879
01:21:45,304 --> 01:21:46,803
It's best to keep a distance.

1880
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:48,244
Staying close isn't always the best.

1881
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:49,774
Tae Gyu was glaring at me...

1882
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:51,370
and when we met eyes, he avoided my eyes.

1883
01:21:51,844 --> 01:21:53,114
He avoided me.

1884
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:55,439
It's not that. I'm happy. I don't hold grudges.

1885
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:57,614
I can tell they're very close.

1886
01:21:57,615 --> 01:22:00,923
Even though it can be an awkward question, you make jokes.

1887
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:03,354
It's very nice to see. So, you received two votes, Tae Gyu.

1888
01:22:03,355 --> 01:22:04,654
(Bong Tae Gyu received 2 votes.)

1889
01:22:04,655 --> 01:22:06,519
- Congratulations. - Who else voted?

1890
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:09,293
Does anyone...

1891
01:22:09,294 --> 01:22:11,433
want to speak...

1892
01:22:11,434 --> 01:22:12,833
to another person?

1893
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:14,433
Something you want people to know.

1894
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:15,564
Writer Kim Soon Ok.

1895
01:22:15,565 --> 01:22:16,704
- The writer? - Yes.

1896
01:22:16,705 --> 01:22:19,200
- Can I send her a video message? - All of a sudden?

1897
01:22:20,245 --> 01:22:22,269
Writer Kim. It's me, Kyu Jin.

1898
01:22:23,044 --> 01:22:25,470
Writer Kim. I love you.

1899
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,583
Our cute and sexy Writer Kim. You're awesome.

1900
01:22:28,584 --> 01:22:30,614
Oh, my.

1901
01:22:30,615 --> 01:22:32,314
It's not that he's good at managing his anger.

1902
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:34,050
He's good at flattering people.

1903
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:35,624
He's good at all kinds of things.

1904
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,053
- He's good at all kinds of things. - He's good at all kinds of things.

1905
01:22:37,054 --> 01:22:38,293
- He's good at everything. - Yes, everything.

1906
01:22:38,294 --> 01:22:39,689
No, Kim Soon Ok is the best.

1907
01:22:44,934 --> 01:22:50,874
(Soon, footage of The Penthouse 2 will be shared for the first time.)

1908
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:55,099
(Soon, footage of The Penthouse 2 will be shared for the first time.)

1909
01:22:59,144 --> 01:23:00,744
(The Penthouse)

1910
01:23:00,745 --> 01:23:05,849
(The Penthouse 2 premieres on Friday, February 19.)

1911
01:23:06,224 --> 01:23:09,593
Since you're working on Season Two,

1912
01:23:09,594 --> 01:23:11,893
people are probably asking you...

1913
01:23:11,894 --> 01:23:14,324
- a lot of questions. - A lot.

1914
01:23:14,325 --> 01:23:16,994
Today, we'll show you scenes...

1915
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:18,933
of Season Two they're currently working on.

1916
01:23:18,934 --> 01:23:22,003
In fact, the production crew won't tease you with it...

1917
01:23:22,004 --> 01:23:24,133
but show you a generous amount of scenes.

1918
01:23:24,134 --> 01:23:26,200
Really? I can't wait to watch it.

1919
01:23:26,575 --> 01:23:28,503
- We're curious too. - We haven't seen it either.

1920
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,673
It won't be like giving you...

1921
01:23:29,674 --> 01:23:31,670
tiny samples of dumplings.

1922
01:23:31,815 --> 01:23:33,914
- A whole dumpling. - Really?

1923
01:23:33,915 --> 01:23:36,553
We're going to show you properly.

1924
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:37,583
I'm curious.

1925
01:23:37,584 --> 01:23:40,950
But those punks from broadcast stations...

1926
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:43,694
You can't let your guard down...

1927
01:23:43,695 --> 01:23:45,620
or trust them until the end.

1928
01:23:45,894 --> 01:23:48,720
Our dear staff from the broadcast station, excuse my language.

1929
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:51,029
"Punks" was a little rude.

1930
01:23:51,035 --> 01:23:53,763
What will happen in Season Two?

1931
01:23:53,764 --> 01:23:55,359
- Let's watch. - I'm curious.

1932
01:23:56,235 --> 01:24:01,139
(The Penthouse 2)

1933
01:24:23,264 --> 01:24:24,633
- What was all that? - It's strong.

1934
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:27,660
- What was that? - It makes me even more curious.

1935
01:24:27,804 --> 01:24:29,133
We already filmed this much?

1936
01:24:29,134 --> 01:24:30,774
We filmed a lot.

1937
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,269
We don't...

1938
01:24:32,544 --> 01:24:34,800
- You don't know how much is done? - No, I don't.

1939
01:24:34,844 --> 01:24:37,010
I have no idea what those scenes are about.

1940
01:24:37,344 --> 01:24:38,444
- I mean it. - I really don't know.

1941
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:41,109
I read the script, but when the director films it...

1942
01:24:41,245 --> 01:24:44,349
The result is different...

1943
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:45,984
- from the script. - Right.

1944
01:24:45,985 --> 01:24:47,620
When we act together, there's this synergy effect.

1945
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:50,319
- I can't even guess. - Me neither.

1946
01:24:50,355 --> 01:24:54,359
I just saw a glimpse of it and it's stirring up so much imagination.

1947
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:56,333
I'm frustrated. I'm even more frustrated now.

1948
01:24:56,334 --> 01:24:57,963
I think that could be the beauty of watching the drama later.

1949
01:24:57,964 --> 01:24:59,963
People will guess what each scene is about after watching this clip.

1950
01:24:59,964 --> 01:25:02,133
When Season Two begins,

1951
01:25:02,134 --> 01:25:03,833
some viewers will find out if they were right.

1952
01:25:03,834 --> 01:25:07,473
Others might go, "It's totally different from what I expected."

1953
01:25:07,474 --> 01:25:09,574
"So that's the plot twist."

1954
01:25:09,575 --> 01:25:12,370
The viewers will have fun like that. Playing a guessing game.

1955
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:14,984
I believe that's how many viewers will watch...

1956
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,914
the second season.

1957
01:25:16,915 --> 01:25:20,253
Once this is aired today,

1958
01:25:20,254 --> 01:25:23,290
I can't wait to see...

1959
01:25:23,294 --> 01:25:25,620
all the theories viewers will share after watching this little clip.

1960
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:27,124
I'm so curious...

1961
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:29,364
- about what they will say. - One of those many people...

1962
01:25:29,365 --> 01:25:31,529
will try to figure out...

1963
01:25:31,535 --> 01:25:34,263
the meaning of Joo Hee's tongue sticking out.

1964
01:25:34,264 --> 01:25:35,564
That's what I just thought.

1965
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:38,074
- Why would she do that suddenly? - Is it an important foreshadowing?

1966
01:25:38,075 --> 01:25:39,340
Even her clothes are black.

1967
01:25:39,674 --> 01:25:40,870
What is that?

1968
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:44,109
I bet everyone will have all sorts of imagination.

1969
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:46,914
What's funny is that even they don't know much about it.

1970
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:48,383
(We want to tell you more, but we don't know much.)

1971
01:25:48,384 --> 01:25:51,380
- Even the actors themselves. - I have no idea what it's about.

1972
01:25:53,355 --> 01:25:57,154
So many things happened at once. It's confusing.

1973
01:25:57,155 --> 01:25:59,824
- Su Ryeon opened her eyes. - Right.

1974
01:25:59,825 --> 01:26:01,989
- There was a scene like that? - I didn't see it!

1975
01:26:02,394 --> 01:26:03,494
Under the water,

1976
01:26:03,495 --> 01:26:05,893
- she suddenly opened her eyes. - That's Seo Jin.

1977
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,333
- It's Seo Jin. - Is that so?

1978
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:08,760
Oh, come on.

1979
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:15,269
Seriously, I thought my heart dropped.

1980
01:26:17,174 --> 01:26:21,083
The second season of The Penthouse that so many are waiting for...

1981
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:23,210
will premiere on February 19.

1982
01:26:23,955 --> 01:26:27,954
Most people would've watched it.

1983
01:26:27,955 --> 01:26:30,920
But if anyone's been waiting to binge-watch it,

1984
01:26:30,924 --> 01:26:33,920
or wants to catch up with the buzz now,

1985
01:26:33,924 --> 01:26:37,133
there's a great summary video on SBS Catch.

1986
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:38,534
Please check it out.

1987
01:26:38,535 --> 01:26:41,064
But you still have...

1988
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:42,929
- Enough time. - enough time.

1989
01:26:43,035 --> 01:26:45,604
So you could watch all the episodes one by one.

1990
01:26:45,605 --> 01:26:47,173
Right. Or you will miss so many scenes.

1991
01:26:47,174 --> 01:26:49,739
- Yes. - Sleep less and watch them all.

1992
01:26:51,214 --> 01:26:54,109
The joy you can get from watching it is way bigger.

1993
01:26:54,214 --> 01:26:58,010
The actors who worked hard despite the busy schedule,

1994
01:26:58,155 --> 01:27:01,019
and the child actors up there,

1995
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:02,454
thank you so much again.

1996
01:27:02,455 --> 01:27:05,019
Thanks to you,

1997
01:27:05,155 --> 01:27:08,093
we're going to enjoy the thrill of the drama...

1998
01:27:08,094 --> 01:27:10,234
in 2021.

1999
01:27:10,235 --> 01:27:12,729
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2000
01:27:14,165 --> 01:27:17,473
We're doing our best filming Season Two, so please wait.

2001
01:27:17,474 --> 01:27:20,003
The character relationship chart has completely changed.

2002
01:27:20,004 --> 01:27:21,540
An even faster story progression.

2003
01:27:21,644 --> 01:27:23,513
An even more brutal story.

2004
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:25,444
An unimaginable story.

2005
01:27:25,445 --> 01:27:27,143
It's beyond your imagination.

2006
01:27:27,144 --> 01:27:29,513
An evil story made by good people.

2007
01:27:29,514 --> 01:27:30,854
You'll see how far we'll go.

2008
01:27:30,855 --> 01:27:33,683
The Penthouse Season Two might be extremely annoying.

2009
01:27:33,684 --> 01:27:35,279
Please look forward to it.

2010
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:36,849
I'm Kyu Jin.

2011
01:27:37,455 --> 01:27:38,889
My mom said it's fun.

2012
01:27:53,504 --> 01:27:54,970
Why do I feel like something is missing?

2013
01:27:55,674 --> 01:27:57,139
Am I just being oversensitive?

2014
01:28:07,184 --> 01:28:08,183
(Cheon Seo Jin, you can't be happy! You will become miserable!)

2015
01:28:08,184 --> 01:28:09,223
(Die! Die!)

2016
01:28:09,224 --> 01:28:10,694
(You can never be happy.)

2017
01:28:10,695 --> 01:28:11,819
(The voice of a devil!)

2018
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:42,188
(The Penthouse will come back with Season 2.)
