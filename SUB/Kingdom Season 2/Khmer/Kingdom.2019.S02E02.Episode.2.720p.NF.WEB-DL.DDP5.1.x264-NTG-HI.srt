- [coughing]

171
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,785
- Go on, get off!
- [groans]

172
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,663
[man 1] Why are you puking everywhere?
You drunk!

173
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,057
- I can't believe you threw up...
- [man 2] I'm dying.

174
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,249
...that expensive wine!

175
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,667
- Hyah!
- [horse neighs]

176
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,911
[head court lady] Officer, for what reason
must you visit this late in the evening?

177
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,430
We received a report of a murder
at this location.

178
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,141
We are conducting a search,
and you will cooperate.

179
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,078
- Everyone, scatter and search!
- [soldiers] Yes, sir!

180
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,855
Officer, this is a private residence
of Her Majesty.

181
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,775
It is unlikely that anyone here
will behave

182
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,902
in an unbecoming manner to her reputation.

183
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,030
The incident you are describing
could not have happened here.

184
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,602
[soldier 1] Search the quarters!

185
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,097
Who lives in that house?

186
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,724
Normally, it is where
we would accommodate guests.

187
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,975
For now, it's empty.

188
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,040
[sighs]

189
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,430
[suspenseful music]

190
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,933
[gasps]

191
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,792
[solider 2] Sir, there's something
you need to see over here!

192
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,357
[gasps]

193
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,195
Over here, sir.

194
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,533
Winter has frozen most of the soil,

195
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,326
but this spot here is soft.

196
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,454
[soldier 2] It looks like someone
buried something.

197
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,588
Hyah!

198
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,219
[panting]

199
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,682
[horses galloping]

200
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,642
[gasping]

201
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,436
This way. Come on, let's go.

202
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,564
[indistinct chatter]

203
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,700
That troop over there.
Don't let them get away!

204
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,248
[men shouting]

205
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,547
[shouting indistinctly]

206
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,594
- [soldier 3] Over here!
- [men shouting]

207
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,522
[ominous music]

208
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,277
How mortifying.

209
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,947
They were all found at Naeseonjae?

210
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,406
[commander] Yes, sir.

211
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,826
We found the corpses
of seven pregnant women and infants.

212
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,665
The women we found were stabbed,
but something was odd about the children.

213
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,876
All the female infants
were strangled to death,

214
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,337
but it doesn't seem like
anything was done to the boy.

215
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,758
I believe that one
must have been stillborn.

216
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,841
But how...

217
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,553
How could this happen?

218
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,183
Something very strange is going on.

219
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,603
Why would you think
that the girls were murdered...

220
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,690
and that only the boy remains untouched?

221
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,777
Good sir, what are you trying to say?

222
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,533
Whoever it is that took the lives
that once belonged to this bodies...

223
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,245
they were looking for a son
among these women.

224
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,832
[sighs]

225
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,709
[horn blares]

226
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,792
[gasps]

227
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,463
[scoffs]

228
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,550
Uh, isn't that the horn?

229
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,556
The one that tells us
that the king has passed away.

230
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,475
[foreboding music]

231
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,105
[horn blaring]

232
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,943
Tell me, what on earth happened?

233
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,866
This is a letter that was sent
from The Chief State Councilor.

234
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,451
He's in Joryeong.

235
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,749
[Cho Hak-ju] <i>The plague in Gyeongsang
is out of control</i>

236
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,626
<i>and Crown Prince Chang
has committed high treason.</i>

237
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,006
<i>Despite battling illness,
His Majesty came all the way to Joryeong.</i>

238
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,051
<i>We were victorious
in containing the plague,</i>

239
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,510
<i>in Mungyeong Saejae,</i>

240
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,221
<i>but Chang and his aides
took advantage of the chaos</i>

241
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,514
<i>to seize the throne.</i>

242
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,642
<i>It was then that Chang decapitated
His Majesty</i>

243
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,144
<i>with his own hands.</i>

244
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,398
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

245
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,526
- [sobbing]
- Your Majesty!

246
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,779
Return to us!

247
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,615
Return to us!

248
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,331
[sobbing]

249
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,427
[foreboding music]

250
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,279
[thumping]

251
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,957
[guard 1] What should be done
with the Lord's corpse?

252
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,680
To his side, he was a traitor,
he was still a hero to all of us.

253
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,017
You should dress him in shrouds
and laid to rest.

254
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,434
Sir.

255
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,106
Taxation and rites...

256
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,315
HANYANG CONFERENCE HALL

257
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,192
you will handle the state funeral.

258
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,903
The Chief Magistrate
of the Capital District Office

259
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,864
should secure and repair

260
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,075
any damage to bridges and pathways
along the burial route.

261
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,662
Are there not more pressing matters
to attend to?

262
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,623
Our throne is currently vacant.

263
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,001
Finding an heir quickly
should be our first priority.

264
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,337
Well, at the moment, we do have the Queen
standing in as our regent.

265
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,049
She should give birth
to a potential heir any day now.

266
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,303
That child has every chance
of being a boy,

267
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,555
which would then mean
he would inherit the throne.

268
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,390
And what if it's not a boy?

269
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,936
We must search the collateral bloodlines
to be prepared.

270
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,983
There are children of Prince Noseong,
I believe he was executed in Ganghwa.

271
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,945
Those children are hardly related to him.
Why must we go that far down the line?

272
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,114
Or do you just want to put a puppet
on the throne?

273
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,116
The Second State Councilor is right.

274
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,119
We must take great care to follow the rule
of primogeniture.

275
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,247
We will table this discussion
until the birth of the child.

276
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,499
[guard 2] Honorable gentlemen,
this is the head eunuch.

277
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,463
I've received a message
from the Office of Royal Delivery.

278
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,174
Her Majesty has begun labor.

279
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,635
The Queens's baby should arrive
immediately.

280
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,722
Certainly, that is well-timed.

281
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,600
Huh, some good news makes for nice change.

282
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,443
[councilor 1] I suppose
all we can do for now

283
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,687
is wait to see if her Majesty
gives us a prince.

284
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,582
- [councilor 2] Certainly.
- [councilor 3] True.

285
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,150
DELIVERY ROOM AT THE QUEEN'S PALACE

286
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,570
This is the Queen's room.

287
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,949
Her Majesty has been waiting for you
and the nurse.

288
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,204
Let us proceed.

289
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,174
Your Majesty, this is the head court lady.

290
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,315
[head court lady]
The royal physician is here for you.

291
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,829
What did you do
with the rest of the girls?

292
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,582
[head court lady] They were taken care of
as per your Majesty's orders.

293
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,211
[foreboding music]

294
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,970
You want me to keep pushing
the Naeseonjae investigation?

295
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,430
That is correct.

296
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,558
But you must do so in complete secrecy.

297
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,892
Understood, sir.

298
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,769
We do not have much time.

299
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,688
We must find out the truth

300
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,108
before the Queen births that child.

301
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,488
THE BASE CAMP IN MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

302
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,533
State your business.

303
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,869
The magistrate told me to stop by,

304
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,246
and to perform a wellness check
on the prince.

305
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,090
This order came directly
from the magistrate?

306
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,082
Yes.

307
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,587
CHO BEOM-PAL

308
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,139
[door opens]

309
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,328
Highness.

310
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,081
How have you been feeling?

311
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,545
Hanyang is far,
and the journey won't be easy.

312
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,716
I'll treat your wound first
so you can keep it from getting infected.

313
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,106
[gasps]

314
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,502
[tense music]

315
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,380
[gasps]

316
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,122
[rebel 1] There's no way they didn't know
we were coming.

317
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,012
We were set up. Someone told them.

318
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,890
That must mean...

319
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,768
there is a spy among us.

320
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,231
We shouldn't be talking
to each other right now.

321
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,277
What does that mean?

322
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,946
I'm not going to die in this prison. No.

323
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,743
My purpose won't be complete
until I avenge my family.

324
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,122
They will pay for Lord Ahn Hyeon's death.
Will you help me?

325
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,958
I swear I would do everything
in my power...

326
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,793
to make them pay for it.

327
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,463
But is there any way for us to do that?

328
