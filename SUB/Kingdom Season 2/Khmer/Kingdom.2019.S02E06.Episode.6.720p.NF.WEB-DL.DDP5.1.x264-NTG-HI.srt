00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,260
it was built to house portraits...

174
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,182
as a way to honor kings,
of past and present.

175
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,392
This is my bloodline.

176
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,896
These portraits are placed on the throne
as if they were alive.

177
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,232
We perform our ancestral rites...

178
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,194
to honor their legacies.

179
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,155
But there are two shrines
that remain empty.

180
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,745
This one here was made for my father.

181
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,164
And the other...

182
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,546
This last one was built for me.

183
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,631
[baby gurgles]

184
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,260
Therefore...

185
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,889
you shall come out at once.

186
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,333
Let me see him.

187
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,380
Show me this child.

188
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,305

191
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,350
This child has been bitten?

192
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,103
He has been bitten, yes,
but he is not a monster.

193
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,522
Trust me, sir.

194
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,608
This child is not stricken
with the plague.

195
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,360
You must not kill him, please.

196
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,739
Don't do this, sir.

197
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,283
I know that you do not want
to end his life.

198
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,453
Highness, you asked me to protect him.

199
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,873
I've done it for you.

200
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,583
Go to the Queen's side...

201
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,835
keep watching her baby.

202
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,339
You mean, the prince?
The Queen's newborn, Your Highness?

203
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,883
Sir, there is something
I have to tell you.

204
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,719
It has to do with the Queen
and her newborn son.

205
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,224
- The child is not...
- I already know the truth.

206
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,062
That child is Mu-yeong's son.

207
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,356
So, I...

208
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,944
I need you to watch over him.

209
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,658
Highness, you said that no one else
should get hurt, remember?

210
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,161
So please, spare this child's life.

211
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,914
The plague will come to an end.

212
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,083
And this will be a bad memory.

213
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,085
Winter will be spring.

214
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,379
This nightmare will be done.

215
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,299
[gasps]

216
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,641
No.

217
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,353
As long as this child lives...

218
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,524
this terror will never end.

Highness.

235
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,394
It's time for us to head back.

236
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,616
Someone told me that Your Majesty

237
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,202
would like to see the records
from seven years ago.

238
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,663
But surely, you already know,

239
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,040
we seal the records of that time

240
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,752
so not even the Kings
can know what happened back then.

241
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,004
No one will tell me how my family died.

242
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,926
My parents, my brother,
both passed seven years ago.

243
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,055
All anyone tells me, is it was the plague.

244
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,892
Now the plague killed all the court ladies
and the guards.

245
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,353
However, neither you nor uncle...

246
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,316
no one here will tell me anything
about who they were.

247
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,819
So, who should I ask about this?

248
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,116
[sighs]

249
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,745
The royal lecture will begin shortly,
Your Highness.

250
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,791
The lessons you'll learn there

251
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,126
will be valuable
in helping the country thrive.

252
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,962
The more you learn,
the better you can lead the royal court

253
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,756
and look after the people of Joseon.

254
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,931
Escort His Majesty.

255
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,443
[councilor] Our young King misses
his parents more and more by the day.

256
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,903
It would be too much...

257
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,906
for him to learn what really happened
to them back then.

258
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,616
He'd be devastated.

259
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,619
We must do what we can
to ensure His Majesty never finds out.

00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,811
Yeong-sin? It is you, isn't it?

264
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,938
It's been a while, my lord.

265
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,148
Good to see you.

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,784
Oh, stop being so formal.

269
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,954
- Talk to me like your friend.
- You're drinking so much.

270
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,497
Haven't you had enough?

271
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,917
I'm only drinking this much
because I'm having dinner with you.

272
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,088
- Ha! Loosen up, will you?
- [chuckles]

273
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,592
All right, fine. Then I will.

274
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,178
Huh? I'm the Second State Councilor.

275
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,473
Somebody!
This guy's getting chummy with me!

276
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,310
- [laughing]
- And speaking of titles...

277
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,688
what would people say if they saw
a court official sitting there,

278
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,106
eating up all their food, huh?

279
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,984
[both laugh]

280
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,444
You couldn't be more right.

281
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,487
I don't know how I ended up here.

282
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,617
You know, back in Dongnae,
I only took the magistrate position

283
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,577
because if I didn't, my uncle said,

284
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,704
he'd make me a eunuch.
[laughs]

285
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,373
But I am the Second State Councilor now.

286
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,336
But you know what,
it's a lot of responsibility.

287
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,421
I got to look good all the time,

288
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,341
and I never get to drink like this.
[laughs]

289
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,387
But you're doing great things.
Order has been restored.

290
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,473
Gyeongsang has recovered.

291
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,975
This country has overcome so much.

292
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,102
I've seen it first-hand.

293
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,480
That's enough.

294
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,734
Don't make me talk about
serious matters with you, okay?

295
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,070
Just enjoy the wine.
[chuckles]

296
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,662
How's the King? Is he in good health?

297
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,960
He is growing up well.

298
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,128
He may be young, but he's already finished

299
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,381
<i>The Four Books</i> and <i>Three Classics.</i>

300
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,425
He'll grow up to be a wise king. I'm sure.

301
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,055
I'm doing my best.

302
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,725
After all, this is what
His Highness wanted.

303
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,812

[tense music]

305
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,795
Tell me right now, can I trust you?

306
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,506
Are you sure this child...

307
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,426
is not sick with the disease?

308
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,428
I'm sure of it, sir.

309
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,931
The monsters left bites
all over his hand and feet.

310
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,975
I put him in water and saved him.

311
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,394
I saw the worms come out of him myself.

312
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,062
[Kim Sun] Do not spare him!

313
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,441
That child is the legitimate heir
to the throne.

314
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,235
He is the only threat to your rule.

315
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,363
You'll bring chaos across the country.

316
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,536
Two cannot rule, there can only be one.

317
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,621
Just kill the boy at once.

318
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,462
I'll accept that you're right
about one thing.

319
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,215
Between the two of us,

320
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,761
one of us will need to be put to death.

321
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,016
That said...

322
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,563
which of us truly deserves to die?

323
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,068
He is a prince
and the only legitimate heir.

324
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,070
And I...

325
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,032
I'm not even the Queen's son.

326
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,411
I killed my father with my bare hands.

327
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,917
If you must choose between the two of us,

328
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,715
which one do we need more
to rule this starving,

329
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,343
plague-ridden country torn apart by war?

330
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,722
I ask you, which would you choose to live?

331
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,896
- This child...
- [baby coos]

332
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,565
...maybe the only hope left
for our kingdom.

333
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,818
The ones who intended to use him

334
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,570
to cease power for themselves
have all been killed by now.

335
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,324
So, please...

336
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,246
guide this prince to rule.

341
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,474
I trust you with this.

342
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,770
And the Ministers...

343
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,607
who are virtuous and loyal to you.

344
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,491
[sighs]

345
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,123
We can't do this.

346
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,666
What if that child...

347
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,586
is not the descendant of the former king?

348
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,964
He is.

349
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,342
I assure you.

350
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,556
I am his brother
and he has the blood of a king.

351
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,436
Please write that the war
killed my father.

352
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,025
As well as the Queen whom I called mother.

353
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,362
I was killed too.

354
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,409
That is how the history should read.

355
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,582
This is the gift that I offer this land...

356
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,629
as a descendant of the royal blood.

357

I wonder how His Highness is.

361
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,410
[Beom-pal] I mean,

362
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,705
he's got Seo-bi hanging around him,
so I'm sure he's well.

00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,920
[sighs]

364
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,342
- What is that?
- It's a journal.

365
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,481
It contains all of her notes
on the plague.

366
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,599
[Beom-pal gasps]

367
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,228
[Seo-bi] <i>The plague began
when a handful of dead</i>

368
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,647
<i>were revived with the resurrection plant.</i>

369
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:40,359
<i>The eggs of the worms on the plant
seized control of the brain</i>

370
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,944
<i>thus raising the dead.</i>

371
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,281
<i>The resurrected lose all ability
to reason,</i>

372
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,743
<i>they feel no pain, and quickly develop
an insatiable hunger</i>

373
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,578
<i>for human flesh and blood.</i>

374
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,705
<i>A bite from these monsters,</i>

375
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,708
<i>transfers the worms
into the new host's bloodstream,</i>

376
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,668
<i>but it does not transform them.</i>

377
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,963
<i>However, it will lower
the body's temperature</i>

378
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,049
<i>until they eventually die.</i>

379
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,720
<i>The disease initially began spreading
at Jiyulheon in Dongnae.</i>

380
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,889
<i>The people there cooked and eat the flesh</i>

381
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,392
<i>of someone who have died
after being bitten by a plague victim.</i>

382
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,188
<i>Those who ate that person
suffered convulsions before dying,</i>

383
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,023
<i>and became monsters themselves.</i>

384
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,525
<i>After this particular interaction,</i>

385
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,321
<i>all those who are bitten immediately
turned into mindless beasts.</i>

386
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,325
<i>Not everyone who is bitten
turns into a monster.</i>

387
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,704
<i>If a bite victim plunges their wound
in water before death,</i>

388
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,332
<i>it will remove the worms
before they can reach the brain,</i>

389
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,417
<i>thus eliminating the disease.</i>

390
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:44,090
<i>In addition, newborns are immune
to the disease even if they are bitten</i>

391
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,509
<i>because their brains
are not yet fully developed.</i>

392
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:54,141
<i>The worms thrive in colder temperatures,
so they lie dormant in spring and summer.</i>

393
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,060
<i>In autumn and winter,</i>

394
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,687
<i>their active hours are limited
to when the sun is up.</i>

395
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,149
<i>Then from the winter solstice
to the first day of spring,</i>

396
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,111
<i>the monsters remain active
throughout the day and night.</i>

397
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,446
<i>But in all my research,</i>

398
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,241
<i>I still have not found
the answer to one question.</i>

399
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,328
<i>It is a certainty to me
that the worms favor cold temperatures,</i>

400
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,124
<i>but for some reason,
extreme heat causes them to thrive.</i>

401
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,126
<i>and spread even more viciously.</i>

402
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,961
<i>There must be a secret.</i>

403
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,755
<i>Something still hidden
behind the resurrection plant.</i>

404
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,178
Seo-bi is still trying to determine
what causes the disease?

[gasps]

406
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,892
The plague was wiped out seven years ago.

407
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,561
No, not completely.

408
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,689
The plant doesn't just grow in Sangju,

409
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,649
it has also been found elsewhere.

410
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,360
- In which region?
- Well, there's been many.

411
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,823
Gyeongsang, the Three Provinces,
Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Hwanghae.

412
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,409

all over the country.

I brought the elder and his son
from the nearby village.

420
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,717
These plants...

421
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,136
when did they start growing here?

422
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,930
Oh, yes.

423
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,681
Well...

424
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,976
We planted these a while ago.

425
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,229
What do you mean by that?

426
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,438
You planted these?

427
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,274
Who exactly gave you the seeds?

428
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
Well...

429
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,196
my son here followed a merchant to China

430
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,156
to earn some money.

431
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,618
He got those plants near the Yalu River.

432
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,829
[old man] We planted them,
thinking we can make money off of them.

433
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,165
Is that true?

434
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,917
Yes, my lord.

435
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,503
I was told it brings back the dead.

436
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,964
I thought I could make money off it.

437
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,424
I couldn't sell it
because no one believed me,

438
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,676
so I just left them.

439
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,056
[foreboding music]

440
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,855
Are you certain someone sold
that plant to those men?

441
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,524
Yes, I'm sure.

442
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,068
He even knew exactly what to do
with the plant

443
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,695
to bring the dead back to life.

444
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,781

Good question.

448
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,833
His Highness thought I should come here
and let you know about this matter.

449
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,751
And I was told to give this journal to you

450
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,628
in case there's another outbreak.

451

Where is His Highness? Where is he going?

452

He's gone to the Northern Region...

453
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,140
