Uh...

14
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,439
Highness,

15
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,733
I know I've committed a grave error,

16
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,746
but I must thank you for your forgiveness.

17
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,216
But you have done this once already.

18
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,157
The cookies and the pomegranates.

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,534
What else was there?

20
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,580
It's so hard to remember.
You've stolen so many things from me.

21
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,292
[Mu-yeong] Highness, I deserve
to be executed for touching your table.

22
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,879
However, I beg you,
please take pity on my wife.

23
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,466
She works many hours as a seamstress
supporting me.

24
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,221
Until I was finally able
to pass the exam at 40.

25
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,472
My wife is pregnant,

26
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,275
and she is struggling
with morning sickness.

27
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,683
She needs nourishment,

28
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,394
and I am unable to provide that for her.

29
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,855
It's tearing me apart.

30
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,943
I know it's wrong to steal, but I hope
you understand it was for my wife.

31
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,654
Sir, I'm begging you for your mercy.

32
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,529
So then,

33
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,866
do you truly take them home to your wife?

34
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,535
Yes, Highness.

35
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,330
I would never lie to His Highness
about anything.

36
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,458
Is your wife in good health?

37
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,173
Yes, my wife is well.

38
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,051
[sighs]

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,267
From now on...

40
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
you should've probably tasted first.

41
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,073
[stutters]
What do you mean by that, sir?

42
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,827
Am I allowed...

43
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,290
Are you saying I can keep taking things
back to my wife?

44
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,965
[sighs]

45
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,262
[Chang] Let's say that I am,
what would I get in return?

46
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,806
[Mu-yeong] I will gladly offer
anything I have

47
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,474
in service of His Highness.

48
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,108
I want your loyalty.

49
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,320
That is my duty as your personal guard,
Your Highness.

50
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,571
Of course, I would be loyal.

51
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,533
No matter what comes or the circumstances,

52
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,493
I want you at my side.

53
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,747
Do you think you can do that?

54
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,963
Yes, Highness.

55
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,466
I can certainly do that.

56
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,970
No matter the cost
or what I might stand to lose,

57
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,766
I will stay at Your Highness' side
at all times.

We have to keep moving.

63
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,552
[soldier 1] Your Highness told us
that Cho Hak-ju must be destroyed.

64
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,346
We still believe in that cause.

He's in critical condition.

- We must act quickly to save him.

Uncle, are you all right?

71
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,379
Seo-bi, what on earth do we do?

72
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,502
I'm willing to do anything.
Just tell me what to do.

73
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,757
Those medicines won't work.

74
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,551
Traditional medicine
won't treat the cause.

75
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,862
So you're saying we should just sit here
and let him die?

76
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,222
What caused this was a bite
from the plague victims.

77
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,599
Paying attention to the symptoms

78
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,685
will help us learn
how to cure the disease.

79

They seem to only care about where
they're getting their next meal.

83
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,905
We've learned that
they hate water and fire.

Burning heat scares them off.

91

[councilor] What are you trying
to tell us?

146
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,818
A murder took place
at the family residence of Her Majesty?

147
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,861
Perhaps I was not clear enough.

148
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,531
Seven pregnant women and female infants

149
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,825
were found dead in Her Majesty's estate.

150

We still don't know who has committed
this cruel act or why.

What we do know...

152
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,375
is the crime is connected
to the Queen's Palace,

153
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,170
and that the culprit was most likely
searching for a male.

154
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,133
Are you implying

155
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,677
that the Queen took a baby from a commoner

156
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,346
to fool us into believing
she birthed a prince?

I have never heard such nonsense!

it will destroy this country.

Welcome, Chief State Councilor.

when you barge
into the Office of Royal Delivery,

169
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,851
and while she was in the pain of labor.

170
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,895
He defiled the space,

171
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,063
while even His Majesty cannot trespass.

172
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,526
Attacking the royal family with smears
are threatening national security.

173
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,322
I see no other option
but to behead the Royal Commander.

174
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,406
Lord Cho.

175
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,201
This is unprecedented.

176
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,203
We can never behead
such a high-ranking officer.

177
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,787
One officer is not enough!

178
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,374
The Training Commander in Mungyeong Saejae

179
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,044
along with the soldiers

180
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,447
who joined in that traitor, Chang,
should also be beheaded!

181
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,049
Lord Cho, that is preposterous.

182
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,592
Think about what you are saying.

183
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,968
Those are our soldiers!

184
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,678
Why would they ally themselves with him?

185
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,597
The reasons are never important.

186
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,892
When will you realize
these men are against you?

187
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,478
And we must punish them with a swift hand

188
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,855
so that justice may return
just as quickly.

189
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,531
They want to join hands with the traitor,

190
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,243
that makes the rest of them the same.

191
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,079
We'll behead their families
and relatives...

192
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,667
and their wives' families and relatives.

193
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,129
And their mothers' families as well,
to set an example.

194
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,092
We cannot simply kill these people.
Not without a proper investigation.

195
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,180
- [swords rasping]
- [gasps]

196
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,434
For our national security,
it must be done.

197
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,608
Are there any objections?

198
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,993
[soldier 2] Gather all the families.
Do not let anyone escape.

[gasps]

202
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,420
Stop this at once!
Do you even know where you are?

203
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,090
- [grunting]
- [kid screams]

204
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,261
[tense music]

205
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,556
Come!

206
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,639
Move it!

207
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,393
Get up!

208
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,519
[whimpering]

209
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,316
Come on, we should hurry.

210
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,028
What made them guilty of treason?

211
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,865
The people and soldiers
in Mungyeong Saejae aren't traitors.

212
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,962
You know that better than anyone, my lord.

213
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,245
Watch what you say. Are you not aware
of how scary my uncle is?

214
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,164
[indistinct chatter]

215
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,540
[girl] Daddy!

216
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,543
Daddy!

217
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,212
Daddy!

218
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,923
Daddy?

219
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,967
Daddy...

220
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,385
Daddy...

221
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,345
[soldier 3] Shut up!

222
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
Let's get out of here.

223
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,808
Did you need to buy herbs?
The apothecary is over that way.

224
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,185
I can get them alone.

225
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,563
Why don't you go to the house?
Please, you should go on with that.

226
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,155
[women whimpering]

SCHOLARLY INSTITUTION
NEAR THE CITADEL OF HANYANG

232
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,802
THOSE WHO TRESPASS ON THE INSTITUTION
WILL BE PUT TO DEATH

233
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,733
[breathing heavily]

00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
[sighs]

235
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,867
They took...

236
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,374
They took my baby.

237
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,043
[somber music]

[door opens]

00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,467
[sighs]

241
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,062
How is her condition?

242
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,857
She's out of the critical stages.

243
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,693
She doesn't seem like
she can handle the shock.

244
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,653
Highness, may I ask how you know her?

245
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
She is Mu-yeong's wife.

246
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,660
[sighs]

247
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,624
Is it true Cho Hak-ju has recovered?

248
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,217
And what is this?

249
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,303
This worm is the disease.

250
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,351
Just below the bloom, these white spots,

251
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,145
those are eggs from this worm.

252
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,189
If a person would ingest this flower,

253
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,858
the eggs would hatch
and turn them into a monster.

254
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,488
What about how to stop it?

255
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,698
Are we any closer to finding a cure?

256
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,950
We must save those in Sangju.

257
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,329
I'm sorry, Your Highness, but it will be
a while before I can cure it.

258
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,455
[sighs]

259
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,543
Chaos in such tiny package.

260
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,713
It's taken countless lives,

261
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,007
nearly destroyed the Gyeongsang Province,

262
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,136
and has brought the entire kingdom
to its knees.

263
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,807
All from a worm.

264
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,267
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

265
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,897
I know you have some injuries.

266
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,566
Dongnae would've been difficult
for anyone.

267
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,277
There are plenty others
that have suffered worse.

268
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,530
And even more will be hurt
by the end of this.

269
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,368
I will put a stop to it.

270
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,205
[sighs]

271
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,001
To do that,

272
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,671
I need you to do something first.

273
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,476
My lord.

274
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,144
[gasps]

275
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,958
What kind of herb did you need that
it took you this long to go and get it?

276
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,982
My lord.

277
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,569
I must ask a favor.

278
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,280
[ominous music]

279
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,532
You wish to work

280
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,118
as Her Majesty's physician?

281
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,456
This woman was the one
who saved you, Uncle.

282
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
She deserves a reward.

283
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,711
I ask that you consider her request.

284
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,756
I was planning to visit Her Majesty
to honor the prince.

285
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,134
Perhaps you should come.

286

289
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,817
[court lady] Your Majesty.

290
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,196
The Chief State Councilor is here
for an audience.

291
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,869
You may let him in.

00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,877
[tense music]

[door closes]

294
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,349
I was so concerned
after hearing that you have fallen ill.

295
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,517
Have you made a full recovery?

296
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,688
And Saejae,
did things go smoothly for you?

297
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,494
It's my little prince.

298
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,623
[Queen] Look at him.
He's so healthy and bright.

299
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,626
We have him now.

300
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,804
I heard you'll be executing
all the soldiers and their families.

301
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,973
It was a wise choice.

302
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,393
No men loyal to you would ever side
with the Crown Prince.

303
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,311
It is beyond comprehension.

304
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,606
They're the bait.

305
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,652
The means for me to draw Chang
out of hiding.

306
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,327
There is another
who has committed a great sin

307
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,372
and who should die.

308
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,085

[sighs sharply]

310
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,932
The woman in the next room...

311
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,686
she is a skilled physician
in her own right.

312
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,564
I am greatly concerned
by the physical toll

313
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,357
that birth has taken on you.

314
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,985
I would like her to examine your pulse.

315
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,532
What would I stand to gain from a commoner
looking after my health?

316
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,077
Why do you wait?

317
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,040
Her pulse needs to be examined.

318
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,625
Father, stop.

I am done repeating myself!

[gasping]

326
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,863
If you have nothing to hide,

327
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,325
then let her take your pulse.

328

What did you find?

331
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,568
No rough pulse.

332
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,696
Her heart is beating normally.

333
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,740
And what does that mean exactly?

334
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,202
[gasps, sighs sharply]

335
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,666
That baby...

336
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,378
is not Her Majesty's child.

337
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,672
[tense music]

338
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,799
When did you plan this?

339
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,095
[tense music]

340
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,432
Explain what's going on.

341
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,725
Sir...

342
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,521
The cubit and pregnancy pulse
are not present at all.

343
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,606
[Beom-il] Does that mean
Her Majesty lost the baby?

344
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,151
[sobs]
Please punish us.

345
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,944
[sighs]

346
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,072
I thought we told you
to take care of Her Majesty?

347
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,157
[gasps, whimpers]

348
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,077
We apologize, but the thoroughfare
and conception vessels are too weak.

349
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,430
[royal physician] We tried every remedy
we could think of,

350
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,540
but nothing has been successful, my lord.

351
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,626
[Beom-il] Is conceiving one child...

352
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,254
- really that difficult?
- [physicians whimpering]

353
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,090
I'll have no issue bearing a child.

354
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,597
I am ready to give him an heir

355
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,265
and it will be a boy.

356
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,350
[royal physician sobbing]

357
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,021
You would dare consider
faking a pregnancy?

358
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,816
How would you go about fooling
all the eyes and ears at the palace?

359
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,235
Forget this preposterous idea.

360
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,072
Focus on your health.
You need to conceive.

361
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,410
His Majesty is well over 50 years old.

362
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,496
What if he were to pass on
before I got pregnant?

363
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,833
So you'll just stand aside...

364
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,460
like a dog?

365
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,090
Watching the prince that you despise,
ascend to the throne?

366
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,135
[ominous music]

367
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,974
Not even the King himself can touch me
when I am with child.

368
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,894
Working out a solution
wouldn't be that difficult.

369
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,607
We'd need to swear everyone
in my service to secrecy.

370
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,610
And what about father?

371
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,447
It will not have our blood in its veins.

372
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,991
He would never accept such a thing.

373
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,701
Of course...

374
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,373
we will keep it a secret from him too.

375
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,126
What if he finds out?

376
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,384
You have cursed me with this
since you were a girl.

377
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,803
You were gifted at birth
with a bit of cunning,

378
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,805
but you have always been foolish.

379
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,516
And now it has brought us this.

380
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,310
Putting everything
we struggled for at risk.

381
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,772
The Haewon Cho Clan
is on the brink of its demise.

382
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,898
You're wrong.

383
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,608
I was the one who protected us.

384
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,485
What can you protect with a commoner child

385
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,404
that does not even know its own mother?

386
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,658
I do not want that for my country.

387
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,994
I will not have any of it.

388
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,621
What now?

389
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,208
Will you take back what you did to Chang

390
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,627
all because you don't like this baby?

391
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,548
Prince Noseong was exiled.

392
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,569
But they still don't know I'm alive,
on Ganghwa Island.

393
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,511
[sighs]

394
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,430
They may be distant relatives,

395
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,640
but they are more suited
to that throne than him.

396
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,977
As for that child...

397
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,689
I will put an end to his life tonight.

398
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,274
But I will not stop there.

399
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,860
Countless more will need to die.

400
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,946
Your court ladies and all your physicians.

401
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,492
Anyone else you might
have included in this fuss.

402
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,203
It would be done.

403
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,082
Nothing but a childless dowager

404
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,335
locked in West Palace.

405
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,340
[coughs]

406
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,722
Punished as you live out
the rest of your days.

407
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,515

[Beom-il] <i>And what about father?</i>

00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,828
<i>It will not have our blood in its veins.</i>

411
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,997
He would never accept such a thing.

412
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,415
What if he finds out?

413
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,126

[foreboding music]

421
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,770
Has there ever been a time
you didn't hate me?

422
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,394
All for having been vulnerable
being born a girl?

423
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,359
I never needed your approval.

424
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,866
I'm about to have everything
you ever wanted.

425
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,831
I'm the most powerful Haewon Cho.

426
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,710
This kingdom...

427
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,590
must fall at my feet.

[man 2] I hear he died from the plague.

435

Even the Chief State Councilor
isn't safe from it.

He was a powerful man.

Now, he and His Majesty
have died of this disease.

439
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,028
Not much hope for us, is there?

440
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,907
We're all gonna die soon.

Oh, it's cold.
[blows air]

447

Either join me or leave me alone.

I don't like you standing
and watching me in the cold.

It's been a few hours.

450
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,952
You haven't caught a single fish,
have you?

451
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,788
Are you trying to pick a fight?

452
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,917
All of our food sources have gone dry.

453
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,920
Same goes for the fish,
there's hardly any out there.

[sighs]

455
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,050
I'd be happy for the opportunity
to catch anything at all

[chuckles]

458
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,809
You know, these days,
people worship food like a god.

459
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,563
And that just means
this country has gone through hell.

Oh, grab that, please!

463
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,404
Oh, oh, do you have it?

464
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,448
Oh, okay! Easy, easy, easy!

465
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,199
[grunts]
Hold on. Hold on!

466
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,367
Oh, let me help.

467
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,172
- [both grunting]
- No, no, no, don't pull.

Hey...

00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,422
Why did you...

472
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,300
[sighs sharply]
I don't know what I did to deserve this.

473
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,887
You, sir,

474
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,139
I hope to never see you again.
[grunts]

475
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,266
Goodness.

476
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,227
Why did you pull?

477
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,896
I told you to hold it.

478
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,774
Uncle.

479
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,697
[dramatic music]

480
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
What did you call me?

481
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,577
I checked my family tree.

482
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,246
You are to be my distant uncle.

483
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,876
[Chang] You're a forgotten member
of the royal family.

484
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,336
Even so...

485
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,798
Bloodlines cannot remain hidden
for very long.

"People have a tendency
to worship food like a god."

487
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,846
Is it <i>The Book of Han</i> you're reading?

488
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,642
"The royal bloodlines".

489
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,020
What do you know?

490
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,774
It doesn't matter who it belongs to.

491
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,111
Your Highness, or I, or even some lowborn.

492

We all bleed the same blood.

493
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,909
It may have lost its meaning for you,

494
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,328
in this country, though,

495
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,665
it is the most important asset.

496
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,419
Through the generations,

497
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,088
our blood stays strong.

00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,845
[horse snorts]

499
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,060
[gloomy music]

500
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,275
Our soldiers' families
have been rounded up.

501
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,569
They'll be killed tomorrow.

502
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,405
Tell me...

503
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,325
why are you so loyal?

504
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,913
I heard about
what happened to your family.

505
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,126
I know that's why you help me.

506
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,211
So that you could avenge them.

507
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,591
My master and Cho Hak-ju had gone.

508
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,346
Their sins will lay to rest with them.

509
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,143
So why?

510
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,649
Why are you still standing here?

511
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,570
Since they've gone...

512
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,490
have we gotten any meat or rice?

513
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,827
Even though they're gone,
everything is the same.

514
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,581
The country is a mess.
Everyone in it is starving.

515
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,419
[Yeong-sin] But I believe in you.

516
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,840
I think you can bring about
the changes we need.

517
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,178
Was I mistaken?

518
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,271
Such a horrific tragedy for the nation.

519
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,900
I was concerned about keeping up
with my duties as a Queen.

520
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,986
You are kind enough to make
the arrangements for the funeral,

521
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,530
and I'm very grateful.

522
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,075
I was simply doing
what was necessary of me, Your Majesty.

523
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,455
Yes, but you have a kind heart
and have gone out of your way for me.

524
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,750
That is why I am so fond of you, Beom-pal.

525
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,460
Oh... oh.

526
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,834
That's very kind of you...

527
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,588
Might I request another favor?

528
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,468
My family's gone. Now that
my father and brother are no more...

529
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,347
I have no one left to watch over us.

530
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,100
You're being promoted.

531
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,520
I'd like to appoint you as the head
of the Royal Commandery.

532
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,022
You'll stay by my side
with my palace guards

533
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,233
and help protect me and my prince.

534
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,780
I am honored to accept these orders,
Your Majesty.

535
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,283
[chuckles]

536
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,120
But there is one matter
I'd like to discuss.

537
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,248
Just before he passed away,

538
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,585
my Uncle visited Your Majesty's chambers
with a female physician.

539
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,325
Would you know what happened...

540
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,047
I sent her away
as I already have a physician.

541
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,216
She wasn't necessary here.

542
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,011
[sighs sharply]
I see.

543
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,140
[foreboding music]

544
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,198
[foreboding music continues]

545
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,285
[infected snarling]

546
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,077
[shrieks]

547
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,004
[Queen] I heard you've studied
under Lee Seung-hui.

548
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,964
Is this true?

549
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,220
You'll do everything in your power
to learn more about the plague.

550
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,931
Your teacher wasn't good enough.

551
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,558
I hope you have more success.

552
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,774
[snarling]

553
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,109
My father had the right idea.

554
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,739
These monsters are powerful.

555
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,325
I can add their power to mine.

556
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,536
