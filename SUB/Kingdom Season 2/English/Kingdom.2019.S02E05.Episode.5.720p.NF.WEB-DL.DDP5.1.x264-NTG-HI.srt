You are finally here.

170
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,647
You've been away for too long.

171
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,317
Come here and pay respect to your mother.

172
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,778
You are not my mother.

173
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,655
[chuckles]

174
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,036
You deny your filial duties?

175
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,038
I'm disappointed.

176
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,540
Give up the throne.

177
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,209
It does not and will never belong to you.

178
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:23,172
And by doing this, you believe the people
will serve you instead?

179
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,258
They won't.

180
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,510
You're a demon.

181
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,806
A criminal that decapitated his own father
with his bare hands.

182
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,935
This throne belongs...

183
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,773
to my son, the heir to the king.

184
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,403
This child...

185
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,449
How do we know
he truly is the son of the king?

186
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,576
Why were pregnant women
found gathered and buried

187
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,411
outside your manner at Naeseonjae?

188
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,457
What events led to Your Majesty
killing those women and children?

189
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,794
I'm afraid that Minister Ho has a point.

190
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,755
I, too, have been hovering
my own doubts about this.

191
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,508
We must place all of the physicians
and the court ladies

192
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,926
under arrest posthaste,

193
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,928
so that the truth of this matter
may be found.

194
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,262
You doubt my child?

195
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,349
You dare question
he's the son of the king?

196
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,601
I am here
not because I care for the throne

197
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,146
nor to oust you for being a member
of the clan that you are simply born into.

198
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,566
The throne has responsibilities
you will never understand!

199
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,695
"The people of this land
regard food as a God,

200

and the King must serve
his people as such."

201
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,368
You have neglected your responsibility.

[chuckles]

205
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,883
Will you step down of your own accord?

206
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,345
Or do we need to drag you off of there
like a dog?

[soft chuckle]

208
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,640
So your father wasn't enough?

209
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,894
You will murder
your mother and your own brother?

210
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,941
I welcome you to.

211
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,194
I won't leave the throne.

212
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,740
Try pulling if you must but I won't move!

[breathes sharply]

214
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,497
Your Highness, there's no need to dirty
his hands with her blood.

215
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,874
Do not concern yourself.

216
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,167
I will bring the seal

217
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,045
and make her issue a royal edict
to announce your enthronement.

I will accompany him.
