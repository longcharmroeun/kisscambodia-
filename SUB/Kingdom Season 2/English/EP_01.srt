Sir! Your Highness!

The gate is open!

195
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,140

- Prepare to run!

00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,893
Your Highness!

00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,436
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

199
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Come on, go!

00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,363
- Get inside! Now!
- No!

202
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,991
What's the matter?

203
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,575
You can't.

225
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,857
What's wrong with you?

226
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,403
I thought Your Highness said
they retreated at daybreak.

227
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,239
I am at a loss.

228
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,742
They returned to corpses in the sun.

229
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,246
There must be a reason.

All right, they're here.

234
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,975

Oh. Wait, wait. The sun is out.

250
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,477
Why are they still moving around?

251
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,357
It's the cold.
The resurrection plant prefers it.

252

[pants]

253
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,818
[Seo-bi] If they are all alike,

254
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,112
then sunlight
is not what they are afraid of.

255
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,739
They only fear high temperatures.

256
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,494
But now that it's winter,
it stays cold even with the sun.

257
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,954
They will never cease now.

258
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,665

[snarling]

260
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,306
Their numbers have stayed the same
since their attack yesterday.

261
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,019
[stutters]
So... so?

262
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,230
That means they are
the only monsters nearby.

263
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,816
If there were more,
they would have attacked us.

264
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,420
[Beom-pal] Even if those are
the only other monsters around here,

265
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,573
the citadel would surely have hundreds!

266
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,825
How do you suppose we survive
the twenty pack?

267
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,328
If we cross the stream,
they should not follow.

268
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,015
Since they cannot cross the water,
we should head up this mountain.

269
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,999
It's far safer
than returning to the citadel.

270
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,338
Seo... Seo-bi. Up the mountain?

271
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,006
Where will we go?

272
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,801
Did you not tell me once before

273
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,471
that the Haewon Cho Clan
is able to guarantee your safety?

274
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,222
[Seo-bi] We will go to Mungyeong Saejae.

Due to urgent matters, the Chief State
Councilor has left for Mungyeong Saejae.

286
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,809
Now what is it that requires my absence
from the State Council?

287
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,935
What do I have to see?

288
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,020
This matter is of great importance.

289
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,397
I requested your presence
to see it for yourself.

All right. What is this?

293
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,543
[commander] Last night, we found
these women outside the north gate.

294
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,088
According to the autopsy, one of the women
had only just given birth.

295
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,091
The baby found with her...

296
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,427
have been strangled to death
prior to our discovery.

297
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,139
Is the culprit detained?

298
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,017
[commander] They said the woman uttered
something peculiar before she died.

299
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,312
She claimed the people in her village
did this to her and her child,

300
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,731
and that they would kill
every last one remaining.

301
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,941
Those were her final words.

302
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,110
Where is this village?

"Naeseonjae"? You're sure of it?

306
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,419
Yes, it's the private residence...

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,297

The Royal Commandery Division

314
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,351
knows about Naeseonjae.

315
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,105
We must seek immediate assistance
from the Chief State Councillor.

316
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,857
We cannot tell my father.

317
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,486
We must keep this a secret.

318
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,740
My father must never know.

He had a jade ornament
of the Haewon Cho Clan,

334
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,880
so that is why we let him pass the gates.

It is I, your only nephew, Beom-pal.

A strange disease spread on my first day
as magistrate in Dongnae.

I barely escaped here with my own life.

341

[Beom-pal] Please, grant me shelter.

342
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,107
I see.

343
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,819
I appointed you magistrate of Dongnae.

344
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,991
And yet, it appears
all you've managed thus far...

345
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,869
is protecting your pathetic life!

[gasping]

347
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,917
Uncle, I'm not sure I understand.

348
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,378
Dongnae was placed in your care.

349
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,173
What were you doing exactly?

350
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,758
And the Crown Prince...

351
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,805
under your nose murdered the commander
of the Royal Army in Dongnae.

352

[gasps]

353
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,185
Wait, wait. Do you mean...
that Beom-il is dead?

354
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,188
I wasn't aware.

355
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,315
I promise, I wasn't aware!

356
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,027
Please believe me! I did not know!

357
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,988
You should be grateful...

358
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,660
that Haewon Cho blood flows within you.

[whimpers]

360
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,456
That man is Dongnae's magistrate...

361
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,418
and Haewon Cho Clan's only heir.

362
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,838
See that he is treated accordingly.

364
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,009
And what of the woman behind you?

[gasping]

366
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,225
The thing is,

367
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,687
she is a nurse who worked
for the physician, Dr. Lee Seung-hui.

368
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,022
[Beom-pal] I would not be alive
if it were not for her.

369
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,527
Dr. Lee Seung-hui, the physician?

370
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,157
Is that true?

371
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,120
Yes, my lord.

372
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,374
See to it that she has
accommodations as well.

373
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,590
[gloomy music]

374
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,636
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

375
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,389
[snarling]

376
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,191
[foreboding music]

377
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,277
[dog whimpers]

378
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,118
[all gasp, whimper]

379
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,249
[crows squawking]

380
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,979
Even we care for rationing...

381
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,774
the food will only last five more days.

382
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,985
With these many refugees,
there's not enough.

383
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:27,158
In that case, each morning,
hand out food to every last one.

384
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,078
You're correct to ration,

385
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,956
but the people should not starve.

386
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,178
This is not the disease we know of.

387
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,390
Things were not like this three years ago.

388
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,892
They only ate flesh of humans.

389
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,270
Bites did not lead to infection,

390
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,522
and the infected did not rise
during sunlight.

391
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,860
He's hiding something.

392
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,946
Lord Cho Hak-ju knows more
about the disease.

393
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,322
He has deceived you...

394
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,783
and all of us, my lord.

395
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,541
What are you trying to say?

396
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,045
I feel...

397
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,048
we are paying for the decision
we made back then.

398
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,884
This is our punishment.

399
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,181
You have regrets?

400
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,102
My lord.

401
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,065
I have no regrets at all.

402
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,485
Three years ago, Sangju...

403
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,487
and Gyeongsang was spared.

404
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,115
If given the choice,

405
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,659
I would not change a single act.

406
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,122
My apologies.

407
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,042
I have forgotten my place for the moment.

408
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,211
I will join the others
and ensure the citadel's security.

409
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,530
[wind whooshing]

410
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,126
Your Highness.

411
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,737
Your Highness.

412
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,074
I overheard Lord Ahn Hyeon...

413
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,035
saying odd things to one of his men.

414
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,329
[Mu-yeong] They spoke as if...

415
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,374
they already know many things
about this disease.

416
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,712
And it seems Lord Cho Hak-ju
is implicated as well.

417
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,881
Your Highness.

418
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,676
I believe it's best to leave this place.

419
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,970
I will escort you, Your Highness.

420
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,097
You will be much safer...

421
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,267
back to the passage
and up the north branch.

422
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,900
Why are you sharing
this information with me?

423
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,069
Sir?

424
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,163
Did Cho Hak-ju command you to?

425
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,998
Sir.

426
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,335
Lord Ahn Hyeon told me...

427
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,881
that the palace guards knew
I was en route to here.

428
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,177
Was that your doing?

429
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,018
So, then...

430
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,897
are you trying to sort out between...

431
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,566
Lord Ahn and I right now?

432
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,110
Your Highness.

433
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,366
You assume you can't trust me now?

434
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,372
I left everything, my pregnant wife,

435
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,375
I left my family to follow you.

436
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,463
I've come all the way
to Gyeongsang for you.

437
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,260
And even now, you still do not trust me?

438
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,812
[guard 2] Fire!

439
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,731
Fire over there!

440
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,067
Fire!

441
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,736
Fire!

442
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,322
[gasps]

443
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,994
- [flame roars]
- [men screaming]

444
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,715
[whimpering]

445
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,398
[women wailing]

446
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,985
[thuds, crashes]

447
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,116
[gasps, pants]

448
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,207
[pants]

449
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,587
The food.

450
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,339
Were you able to save
any of the food inside?

451
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,966
No, sir. I'm sorry.

452
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,847
This was your watch! What were you doing?

453
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,224
How could you let this happen
on your guard?

454
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,684
We don't know, sir.

455
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,607
All of a sudden,
there was an explosion, and...

456
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,645
- [grunts]
- [groans]

457
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,858
Do you know how valuable
that warehouse was?

458
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,069
The lives of everyone here
depended on the food that was inside!

459
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,237
[guard 3] I'm sorry.

460
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,947
It is all my fault.

461
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,116
- [crowd gasping]
- You should die!

462
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,360
[government clerk] It was me!

463
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,914
I left it alone.

464
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,252
[indistinct chatter]

465
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,255
I did this.

466
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,926
[government clerk] The fault...

467
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,346
it's mine.

468
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,934
I couldn't let my child starve to death,

469
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,062
so I just tried to take some rice.

470
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,065
I didn't know this would happen.

471
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,192
I dropped my lamp.

472
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,361
I dropped it by accident.

473
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,529
[sobbing]

474
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,283
I'm sorry!

475
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,453
Just...

476
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,666
Just kill me.
[whimpers]

477
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,463
[somber music]

478
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,468
What does it matter?

479
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,096
We're going to die.

480
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,976
[government clerk]
Whether we starve to death...

481
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,397
or get eaten by those monsters,

482
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,109
we're all going to die.

483
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,534
[gloomy music]

484
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,714
MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

485
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,527
[both sigh]

486
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,197
Do you really think you can use that
to stop this disease?

487
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:49,994
There's always a way to stop it,
no matter how severe the disease is.

488
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,746
And this one is no different.

489
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,707
If I study this plant's property,

490
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,210
I am sure I can find a way
to put a stop to this disease.

491
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,755
As long as we stay in Mungyeong Saejae,

492
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,798
we should be safe.

493
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,593
[sighs heavily]

494
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,430
There are still people alive
in the citadel of Sangju.

495
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,601
We have to save those people.

496
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,313
Right. His Highness...

497
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,858
[Hak-ju] What is that in your hand?

498
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,942
[gasps]

499
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,989
Hand it over, now!

500
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,092
Do you know what this plant is?

501
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,551
[gasps]

502
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,309
It brings the dead to life.

503
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,228
It's called the resurrection plant.

504
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,272
This plant's behind...

505
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,359
It's behind this outbreak.

506
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,238
And how do you know this?

507
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,321
[gasps]

508
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,535
I first learned of this,
through this nurse.

509
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,207
Go on, then. Tell him how you know.

510
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,251
[gasping]

511
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,883
"The resurrection plant was used
to bring the dead King back to life.

512
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,720
This plant is the cause of this disease."

513
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,808
Is that what Lee Seung-hui told you?

514
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,144
Oh, what do you mean by that?

515
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,771
What do you mean... "The dead King"?

516
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,483
[gasps]
Please have mercy.

517
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,254
[Seo-bi] The only reason I found
that plant, is because read about it

518
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,946
in his patient journal.

519
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,740
You read his patient journal?

520
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,536
Then you must also know...

521
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,707
how to raise the dead back to life?

522
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,718
"If you mash the resurrection plant,
put it on a needle,

523
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,345
and insert it deep into the glabella,

524
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,724
in two hours time,
the dead will return to life.

525
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,809
That's what he wrote in his journal.

526
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,438
[tense music]

527
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,527
I will take that girl to Hanyang as well.

528
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,865
Make preparations.

529
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,148
[palace guard 1] Yes, my lord.

530
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,952
Hanyang? When? What for?

531
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,585
There is still unfinished...

532
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,213
work to do.

533
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,174
When it is done...

534
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,678
I will return to Hanyang
and meet the future prince.

535
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,687

[Ann-hyeon] <i>Wait.</i>

00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,858
What did you say?

538
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,987
I will go to Mungyeong Saejae.

539
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:13,781
Your Highness.

540
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,116
Those monsters are everywhere.

541
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,993
Mungyeong Saejae
will be impossible to reach.

542
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,412
To save our people, I must go.

543
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,374
I will require your best men.

[sword rasps]

546
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,141
I will lead the way, Your Highness.

547
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,445
Let's go.

551
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,102
[growling]

552
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,073
[snarls]

553
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,084
[growling]

554
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,397
[snarling]

555
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,615
[ominous music]

556
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,244
[locks clinking]

557
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,382
[somber music]

558
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,157
Extinguish your torches.

559
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,578
[flame sizzles]

560
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,298
[foreboding music]

561
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,950
[Chang] The north branch is very close
to the passageway.

562
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,643
The monsters fear water,
so if we cross the river,

563
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,313
we should be able to escape them.

564
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,167
[Sangju offficer] Even if you cross
the north branch,

565
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,359
Mungyeong Saejae
will not be easy to enter.

566
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,915
The Five Armies will be
guarding the gates.

567
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,685
[Chang] The number of soldiers
has dropped to a mere tenth

568
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,492
due to the war three years ago.

569
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,703
There are about 5,000 elite soldiers
in Hanyang alone.

570
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,872
But even for Cho Hak-ju...

571
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,791
it will be difficult
to send all those men.

572
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,586
At most, the number...

573
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,671
cannot be more than 2,500.

574
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,257
That's still half the available force.

575
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,594
There is not many to guard
all the gates of Gyeongsang.

576
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,347
They'll be undermanned.

577
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,015
[Chang] I agree.

578
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,851
If they are guarding every gate,

579
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,020
Mungyeong Saejae would have no more...

580
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,105
than 500 men.

581
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,649
It will not be possible

582
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,693
to guard all of Mungyeong Saejae's walls
with that number.

583
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,280
[Ann-hyeon] The northwest section
of the first gate is built very high.

584
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,991
Functionally, it requires little defense.

585
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,369
The amount of men on guard would be few.

586
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,329
WEST SIDE, SOUTH SIDE

587
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,040
Well, then, once you're
in Mungyeong Saejae,

588
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,167
what is Your Highness' plan?

589
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,338
[foreboding music]

590
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,092
Cho Hak-ju...

591
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,054
will die by my sword.

592
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,057
[Chang] <i>For his shameless disregard
of the people,</i>

593
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,268
<i>for his traitorous attempt
to steal the throne,</i>

594
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,187
<i>I will punish him and reclaim my place.</i>

595
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,025
I will end this disease
and save our people from starvation.

596
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,736
And I will survive...

597
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,701
<i>and create a new world.</i>

598
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,538
[foreboding music]

599
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,211
[closing theme music]
