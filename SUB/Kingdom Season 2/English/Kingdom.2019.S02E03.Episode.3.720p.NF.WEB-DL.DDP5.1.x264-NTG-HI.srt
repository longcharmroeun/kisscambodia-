00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,337
...you're saying will resurrect the dead?

10
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,421
[Cho Hak-ju] Correct.

11
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,382
Immune to the sword,

12
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,385

00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,637
that hunger for human flesh.

14
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,515
Absurd. You can't bring the dead
back to life.

15
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,808
[Cho Hak-ju] It is the truth.

16
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,144
And if it is?

17
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,230
For what reason
would you show this plant to me?

18
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,442
Are you suggesting
we resurrect our fallen soldiers

19
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,819
so they can continue fighting
the Japanese?

20
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,112
[Cho Hak-ju] I am not.

21
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,698
If the corpses started to rot,

22
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,617
resurrection isn't possible.

23
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,580
What's more, we cannot simply kill
our soldiers who sacrifice.

24
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,458
Squandering our military is not an option.

What are you trying to say?

27
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,845
The sick people of Sumang...

28
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,058
we'll use them.

29
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,312
Turn them into monsters

30
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,690
and unleash them upon the Japanese army.

31
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,944
That is how we survive.

32
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,658
These are not animals on a farm,
these are people...

33
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,534
And what purpose do they serve?

34
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,787
They would be dead in due time.

35
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,582
Our blood is the currency used
for this war.

36
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,127
It is our sworn duty to guard the land
and our people.

37
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,921
So then,

38
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,591
you would break that oath

39
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,927
and kill those you once protected.

40
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,265
I will not take part in such crime.

41

Resurrecting the dead?

42
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,146
This is nonsense.

43
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,941
Such thing is not possible.

44
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,944
[Cho Hak-ju] Tell me something.

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,197
Is it the lowly commoner you fight for?

46
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,998
I do not fight for them.

47
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,375
I swore to defend

48
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,254
the royal family,
the keystone of this country.

49

The Haewon Cho Clan...

00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,216
to the canal,

171
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,218
and provide cover along the way...

172
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,970
JUSEOMYEON, JUNAMMYEON

173
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
it could increase our odds.

174
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,483
We could cover you
after you cross the river,

175
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,311
but in the mountains,
you won't be visible to us anymore.

176
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,274
How can we provide cover fire
if we can't see where you are?

177
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,530
[tense music]

178
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,538
Fire now.

179
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,621
[soldier] Fire!

180
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,750
[cannons firing]

181
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,128
- [infected snarling]
- [explosions]

182
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,596
[snarling]

183
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,355
[cannons firing]

184
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,441
FIRE

185
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,821
[explosion]

186
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,702
[snarling]

187
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,589
[explosion]

188
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,466
Look! Over there!

189
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,968
They are launching cannon fire
near the canal.

190
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,098
[men grunting]

191
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,189
Come on, everyone. Be quick.

192
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,398
Come on. Hurry!

193
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,567
[servant 1] Oh, they stopped fighting.

194
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,902
[servant 2] Move quickly!

195
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,985
[servant 3] Let's go!

196
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,534
[servant 2 grunts]

197
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,662
[sighs]

198
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,705
I don't understand. What is going on here?

199
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,959
It's His Highness, the Prince.
He's taking Lord Cho Hak-ju down,

200
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,642
and he's in control of Mungyeong Saejae.

201
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,878
Oh, that's great news.

202
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,424
His Highness regrets
that he could not be here.

203
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,551
He must resolve a matter in Hanyang.

204
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,553
However, I come bearing a message.

205
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,722
It is not possible to get everyone...

206
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
out of the citadel safely
as we are still outnumbered.

207
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:21,021
So, we will continue to bring you food
using this method from time to time.

208
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,691
So please stay here
and hold out as long as you can.

209
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,359
[indistinct chatter]

210
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,361
[children giggling]

211
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,374
[servant]
Come on, give me a hand with this.

212
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,159
THE BASE CAMP IN MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

213
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,044
How is he doing?

214
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,089
His body temperature keeps dropping.

215
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,259
Hmm.

216
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,054
But you are sure that my uncle
will not turn into one of those monsters?

217
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,807
I'm reasonably certain
that he will not turn.

218
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,351
Besides, not everyone
turns into a monster.

219
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,729
Like Dan-i.

220
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,439
He was bitten by the king,

221
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
and he never turned into one.

222
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,404
However, he did become bedridden
and died eventually.

223
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,741
The disease has changed.

224
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,910
Dongnae, Jiyulheon happened differently.

225
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,664
It was the ones who ate Dan-i's flesh
that became monsters.

226
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,168
They spread the disease afterwards.

227
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,961
Then, uh...

228
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,464
Then, what will the disease do
to my uncle?

229
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,925
Well, he may not fall prey to it.

230
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,678
He'll probably die from the symptoms.

231
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,472
Just as Dan-i had.

232
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,182
We have to treat him somehow.

233
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,772
Seo-bi, please save his life.

234
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,401
I know what he's done to His Majesty
is unforgivable,

235
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,196
but we cannot let him die
in such a horrible way.

236
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,322
Dan-i...

237
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,450
there was nothing I could do to help him.

238
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,537
This time, it has to be different.

239
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,667
If I cure him
and find out what causes the symptoms,

240
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,796
maybe I will find a way
to bring this plague under control

241
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,879
once and for all.

242
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,340
All right.

243
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,467
Just whatever you do,
please save my uncle's life.

244
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,846
His body temperature has dropped again.

245
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,891
We must warm his body.
Look around for any herbs that could help.

246
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,976
Sure. Okay. I can do that.

247
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,397
[panting]

248
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,608
Seo-bi. Seo-bi, wait.

249
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,068
Would this work?

250
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,612
This is a rare medicinal wood
that the Queen asked for.

251
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,281
Sappanwood?

252
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,451
It's used to treat
gynecological conditions and ailments.

253
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,454
Lord Cho would not benefit from this,
unfortunately.

254
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,538
[Beom-pal sighs]

255
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,919
[Seo-bi] Wait.

256
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,880
Did you...

257
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,425
say Her Majesty asked for this herb?

258
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,180
This couldn't be
for Her Majesty herself, could it?

259
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,807
Of course it's for Her Majesty.

260
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,767
Why else would I have worked so hard
to get it?

261
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,272
You mean the Queen herself used this?

262
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,733
No. That cannot be.

263
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,448
Did the Queen use it recently?

264
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,827
Is that really important right now?

265
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,829
My uncle has one foot in his grave.

266
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,414
Please, you must tell me.

267
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,583
[sighs]

268
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,835
I had to get this wood last month
and the month before.

269
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,672
What's wrong?

270
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,257
[rustles]

271
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,013
- [door opens]
- [both gasp]

272
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,557
- [horses galloping]
- [soldier] Hyah! Hyah!

273
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,684
Hyah!

274
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,062
[officer] Your Highness.

275
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,524
We have a problem.

276
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,405
[Lee Gang-yun] What happened?

277
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616
Where are the soldiers who were on guard?

278
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,785
[officer] They were killed.
We found their bodies behind the building.

279
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,995
Who did this?

280
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,581
Tell me right now!

281
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,352
[officer] I was informed
that Your Highness' personal guard

282
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,045
passed the three gates with a carriage.

283
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,714
He said he was carrying out an order
by His Highness.

284
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,593
[tense music]

285
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,768
[panting]

286
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,610
Hyah!

287
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,867
[Mu-yeong's wife] What is this place?

288
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,539
His Majesty collapsed just a few days ago
due to smallpox.

289
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,459
The palace is in total chaos right now.

290
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,421
Unfortunately, I must work.
I cannot stay at your side.

291
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,509
And I worry about leaving you alone
since you're so close to giving birth.

292
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,637
This residence belongs
to an acquaintance of mine.

293
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,473
In just a few days, I will return for you.

294
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,225
If I am to wait here,

295
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,894
then who will take care of you
when you come home?

296
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,064
Even if it's only for a few hours,
who will cook your meals?

297
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,482
Please.

298
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,193
I want to stay with you where I belong.

299
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,577
I will never understand what I did
to deserve such a loving wife.

300
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,999
Especially when you suffer
with a husband as foolish as I am.

301
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,627
[sighs]

302
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,796
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,716
You know I truly am.

304
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,971
I'll wait for you, then.

305
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
And there is no need to worry about me.

306
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,062
It will only be a few days.

307
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,732
So, please look after yourself

308
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,275
and wait for my return.

309
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,946
[sighs deeply]

310
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,042
Take her to the room.

311
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,294
This way, please.

312
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,048
[gloomy music]

313
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,692
[Beom-il] You made a wise decision.

314
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,446
I'm truly glad
you brought her here yourself.

315
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,657
Now you know your wife is in good hands.

316
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,619
And we are getting what we want.

317
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,331
If anything...

318
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,752
untoward happens to my wife
while she's here,

319
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,297
I will not...

320
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,301
ever not stand idly by.

321
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,637
[thwacks]

322
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,226
Know your place.
You have no right to threaten.

323
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,774
Shall I grab your wife by her hair
and drag her here?

324
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,361
And end her life before your eyes?

325
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,324
I understand the Crown Prince
is very fond of you,

326
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,578
but the Haewon Cho Clan
will not be threatened by a mere guard.

327
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,374
I need to know
where the Crown Prince goes,

328
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,668
and with who he meets.

329
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,419
Understand?

330
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,505
That's the only...

331
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,926
way your family's safety will be ensured.

332
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,513
[sighs]

333
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,226
[gloomy music]

334
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,915
[sighs]

335
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,171
Hyah!

336
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,841
Hyah!

337
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:34,847
[Mu-yeong] Hyah!

338
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,769
It has already been four hours
since they left.

339
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,439
If you know they are burdened,
they must be very far by now.

340
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,149
If Cho Hak-ju reaches Hanyang first,

341
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,276
he will return with the might
of the Five Armies.

342
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,278
The people are still scarred
by the last war.

343
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,961
We cannot let our country implode again.

344
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,364
But how will you catch him?

345
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,825
There are many routes
he could have taken to get to Hanyang.

346
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,203
I am a tiger hunter.

347
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,538
No one is better at chasing targets.

348
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,622
Allow me to join you.

349
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,834
[Lee Chang] Hyah!

350
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,586
- Hyah!
- [Yeong-sin] Hyah!

351
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,754
[Lee Chang] Hyah!

352
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,299
Hyah! Hyah!

353
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,427
[tense music]

354
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,643
Is anyone outside?

355
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,727
HANYANG CONFERENCE HALL

356
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,354
Why have we still not received word?

357
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,484
Lord, we have not heard any news
from the Queen's Palace yet.

358
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,570
But Her Majesty's labor pains
began hours ago!

359
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,307
What if something has gone wrong?
Have you considered that?

360
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,368
Stop making such a fuss and sit down.
Just have patience.

361
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,036
I cannot tolerate this nuisance.

362
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,625
Councillors,

363
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,253
are you not at all curious, though?

364
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,465
His Majesty was falling in and out
of consciousness due to the plague.

365
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,762
So why would the Chief State Councillor
take His Majesty to Mungyeong Saejae?

366
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,515
That is not important right now.

367
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,183
The only thing that matters,

368
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,103
is whether or not we can restore
the backbone of this kingdom.

369
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
[sighs]

370
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,151
[midwife gasping, whimpering]

371
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,158
[groans]

372
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,620
[screams]

373
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,677
[royal officer] Who ordered the killings
of the women and children?

374
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,835
[midwife] How dare you!

375
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,380
You dare to suspect Her Majesty?

376
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,093
The moment Her Majesty learns
about this betrayal,

377
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,803
you...

378
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,473
will face her Queen's wrath!

379
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,976
[panting]

380
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,562
Are you keeping a close watch
on the Queen's Palace?

381
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,105
Yes, sir.

382
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,066
We are monitoring everyone
from the court ladies,

383
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,694
to the court maids,
even the water maids are being tracked.

384
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,029
[panting]
Sir.

385
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,575
I was just informed
of something very strange,

386
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,202
from the people
who lent palanquins to Naeseonjae.

387
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,164
It seems that, there were more, actually.

388
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,458
[royal officer]
<i>Six palanquins, not three last night.</i>

389
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,379
[suspenseful music]

390
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,429
[royal guard] What can we do for you?

391
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,682
I am here to search
the servants' quarters. It is urgent.

392
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,310
We cannot let anyone
enter these grounds at the moment.

393
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,688
Surely the servants' quarters
cannot be off limits.

394
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,649
We are looking for evidence
of a serious crime.

395
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,319
Step aside.

396
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,135
[Queen's court lady]
What is the meaning of this?

397
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,513
Her Majesty
is in the middle of childbirth.

398
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,474
You dare make a scene?
This will not go unpunished.

399
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,894
The guards in the East Gate informed us
at around 10 p.m. last night,

400
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,564
they saw three palanquins
entering the Queen's private residence.

401
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,942
Wet nurses came to breastfeed the baby.

402
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,693
That's not a crime, is it?

403
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,653
Of course not.

404
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,113
The guards also mentioned

405
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,616
these palanquins entered the residence
without being questioned who was inside.

406
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,453
You instructed the guards not to ask,
but I must know.

407
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,123
And I already told you,
it was the wet nurses.

408
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,332
Step aside.

409
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,149
[second state] What on earth happened?

410
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,276
We arrested him at the Queen's Palace.

411
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,319
He had entered
the Office of Royal Delivery.

412
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,947
You dare barge into the Queen's Palace,

413
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,199
knowing full well
that Her Majesty is in labor?

414
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,703
[third state] Not even a king can enter
the Office of Royal Delivery.

415
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,123
I understand that you are the head
of the Royal Commandery Division,

416
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,834
but this is a serious offense
that will not go unpunished.

417
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,920
They arrested the head
of the Royal Commandery.

418
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,548
The soldiers investigating Naeseonjae
have left.

419
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,592
That matter is done.

420
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
[scoffs]

421
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,187
They dare to get in my way?

422
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,523
Those Royal Commandery rats
are as good as dead.

423
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,442
[Queen's court lady] It's as I said.

424
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,153
No one can outsmart Your Majesty.

425
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,906
Now that they have lost their power,

426
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,949
the Royal Commandery is finished as well.

427
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,618
No one stands in your way.

428
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,913
So then,

429
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,957
what of the baby?

430
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,711
The remaining pregnant women
have been sent back to Naeseonjae.

431
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,128
I...

432
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,758
believe they can expect
very good news soon.

433
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,595
[creaking]

434
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,722
- [Mu-yeong] Hyah!
- [Seo-bi groans]

435
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,436
Hey, sir!
We have to stop right now, please.

436
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,399
Sir!

437
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,735
Please, his condition is worsening.

438
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,402
[Seo-bi] Sir!

439
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,448
- [grunts]
- [horse neighs]

440
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,618
[sighs]
His body is ice-cold.

441
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,578
I could barely feel his pulse.

442
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,790
How much longer will he last?

443
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,126
Well, at this rate, he will die very soon.

444
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,754
[panting]

445
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,007
Please, good sir,
we must find a place to lie him down.

446
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,592
[panting]

447
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,154
[stuttering]
Wait...

448
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,281
Wait, Seo-bi.

449
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,159
[gasping]

450
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,121
[groans]

451
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,124
Uh...

452
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,961
[mumbling]

453
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,429
- [clinking]
- [blows air]

454
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,057
[sizzles]

455
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,937
[door opens]

456
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,361
[suspenseful music]

457
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,013
[horses galloping]

458
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,183
- [horse neighs]
- I'm certain they went that way.

459
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,352
It's the only route to Hanyang.

460
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,812
So we should be able to catch them now.

461
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,814
[panting]

462
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,236
Why did you do nothing?

463
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,950
Your Highness, he betrayed you.

464
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,869
And you knew it just as well.

465
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,502
I wasn't ready to lose anyone else.

466
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,339
That's why...

467
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,259
I wanted to trust him.

468
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,221
[dramatic music]

469
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,193
[Seo-bi] Excuse me, sir.

470
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,697
Do you know when His Highness will arrive?

471
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,324
You said he would follow
behind us shortly.

472
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,540
How is Lord Cho?

473
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,086
His condition is stable for now, however,
he does not seem to be doing well.

474
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,673
If it's safe here, we should continue
to wait for His Highness.

475
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,636
No, we have to leave now.

476
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Gather His Lord.

477
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,223
Tell me the truth.

478
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,435
Prince Chang did not request
we leave, did he?

479
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,733
And you have no intention of waiting
for His Highness to catch us?

480
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,318
I know not why you are acting this way,

481
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,531
but I implore you to reconsider.

482
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,076
I could tell His Highness
is very fond of you,

483
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,619
He relies on you as well.

484
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,999
So, I thought you made it your duty
to keep His Highness safe.

485
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,296
I told you we're leaving.

486
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,214
No. I will not go.

487
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,884
There is something important
I must tell the Prince.

488
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,891
Look, this is sappanwood,
a tree that only grows in Japan.

489
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,478
It's medicinal.
It's very rare and expensive to procure.

490
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,147
- What of it?
- Traditionally...

491
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,567
it is used to remove blood clots
after a miscarriage or birth,

492
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,321
or to alleviate symptoms related
to improper or lack of postpartum care.

493
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,364
This medicine is very strong.

494
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,493
Women who are pregnant
should not be using it at all.

495
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,787
I have no time for this.
What are you trying to say?

496
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,121
The Queen...

497
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,083
I know Her Majesty is using sappanwood.

498
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,627
What do you mean "Her Majesty"?

499
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,689
You just said that it cannot be taken
while carrying a child.

500
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,966
Exactly. The Queen cannot be taking this
if she is still pregnant,

501
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,843
but the magistrate told me that she is.

502
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,428
Then he must be mistaken.

503
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,722
Sir, I am as confused as you are, however,

504
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,724
if what he said is true,

505
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,353
then we have to tell His Highness
as soon as we can.

506
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,190
And if Her Majesty is truly taking this,
we must find out why that is.

Did you say...

512
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,444
it's taken after birth or a miscarriage?

513
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
Normally, yes.

Where are we?

I want answers.

519
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,303
What is this?

520
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,388
What is it used for?

521
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,808
I'm not sure.

522
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,728
Naeseonjae boarded several women
late in pregnancy.

523
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,314
Why were they gathered there?

524
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,527
What are you scheming
with those women at Naeseonjae?

525
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,072
You will tell me right now.
