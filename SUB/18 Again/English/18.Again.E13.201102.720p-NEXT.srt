7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,080
Da-jung, I have been

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,120
proposed to.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,550
Really?

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,420
Congratulations.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,060
But I'm not going to marry him.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,660
Why not?

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,130
There are no butterflies.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,300
- What?
- I want my heart to flutter

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,330
even in my last moment.

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,070
I want my heart to pound fast.

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,540
Ae-rin, if your heart
keeps pounding like that,

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,810
you'll die.

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,810
And all those butterflies

20
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,710
go away once you get married.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,680
You don't get any butterflies
in front of Dae-young?

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,290
What kind of wife would get
butterflies in front of their husbands?

23
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,790
It's been so long that I forgot
how it felt to have my heart fluttered.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,870
<i>Episode 13,
The Man That Makes My Heart Flutter</i>

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
What?

26
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,870
It's a half-moon.

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,580
Look. It's a half-moon.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,120
I like full moons.

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,250
Half-moons

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,120
look lonely for some reason.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,360
Gosh. They aren't lonely.

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,900
Even if you can't see it,
the other half is right next to it.

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,729
Just like your other half right here.

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,370
This is nice.

35
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,580
It's been a while

36
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,920
since I saw a half-moon.

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,990
I hope

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,830
the other half is doing okay.

39
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,370
Even if I can't see it,

40
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,570
I hope it's doing well.

41
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,350
Is that Ms. Jung?

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,580
My gosh.

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
I...

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,710
Da-jung.

45
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,680
Da-jung, just now—

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Please.

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,220
Don't ask me any questions.

48
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,660
Wait.

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,390
Da-jung!

50
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,770
Da-jung.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,170
Are you going home now?

52
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,640
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

53
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,810
Okay.

54
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,830
Taxi!

55
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,430
What will you say to her?

56
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,700
I'll tell her everything.

57
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,400
That I'm Hong Dae-young.

58
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,970
What? Why all of a sudden?

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,070
I can't lie to Da-jung anymore.

60
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,010
Exactly. Why do you want to
tell her the truth now?

61
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,180
Because

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,780
I love her.

63
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,060
I don't know anymore.

64
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,370
We're almost there.
Let me drop you off at your house.

65
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
I just want to walk for a bit.

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,950
Did something happen?

67
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
Pardon?

68
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,290
Earlier,

69
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,960
I saw Go Woo-young running after you.

70
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,730
Did he—

71
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,490
No. Nothing happened.

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,200
Well, thank you. Get home safely.

73
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,630
You...

74
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,360
I know I surprised you,

75
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,570
but let's talk for a moment.

76
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,740
I don't have anything to say to you.

77
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,570
Please listen to what I have to say.

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,910
What are you doing? Let go of me.

79
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,810
Please listen to me for a moment.

80
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,750
Let go of her.

81
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,920
Ji-hoon.

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,290
This has nothing to do with you,
so stay out of it.

83
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,159
There's a limit to what you can
get away with because you're young.

84
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,400
If you keep crossing the line,

85
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,000
especially if you're doing this
to Da-jung, I won't stay still.

86
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
You won't stay still?

87
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,140
Who are you to say that?

88
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,280
The third-party should stay out of it.

89
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,750
Don't talk to him like that.

90
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,650
He's my boyfriend.

91
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,420
Stop lying.

92
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
It's not a lie.

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm Da-jung's boyfriend.

94
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,140
Let's go.

95
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,830
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,140
I made you lie for no reason.

97
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,840
Lie?

98
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,310
About

99
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,880
being my boyfriend.

100
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,780
It's okay.

101
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,620
I can be your real boyfriend.

102
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,090
What?

103
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,990
I'll be your boyfriend

104
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,430
in front of that kid.

105
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,400
That's the only way he'll give up.

106
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,470
I saw you earlier,

107
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,040
and it seemed you couldn't handle him
on your own.

108
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,409
I'm embarrassed that you saw that.

109
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,350
Thank you for everything today.

110
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,950
I'll go in now.

111
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,630
What on earth happened?

112
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,770
<i>The person you have called...</i>

113
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,940
That's odd.
Why isn't she picking up the phone?

114
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,980
<i>Ms. Ok. I called to see</i>

115
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,550
<i>if you were free
for some coffee tonight.</i>

116
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,590
<i>Jung Da-jung</i>

117
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,260
Why is she calling?

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,160
- What?
- Where are you?

119
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,630
Da-jung said that she's coming
to my office to meet with me.

120
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,200
What? Okay. I'll be right over.

121
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,980
What brings you here in the morning?

122
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,050
The thing is...

123
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,390
I thought we needed to talk about
what happened yesterday.

124
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,360
What happened yesterday?

125
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,060
I'll apologize for
what happened yesterday.

126
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,500
I should've been careful as an adult.

127
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,770
From now on,
that will never happen again.

129
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,410
Oh, right. From now on.

130
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>Oh, My Teacher</i>
<i>Mr. Go. This is Ok Hye-in.</i>

131
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,580
<i>I'm texting you back after realizing
the distance between us last night.</i>

132
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,320
<i>I will draw a clear line from you
from now on.</i>

133
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,490
From now on...

134
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,520
What?

135
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,430
I'll be careful from now on.

136
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,960
<i>With Woo-young kissing your friend,</i>

137
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,370
<i>I don't think it's appropriate
for us to meet each other.</i>

138
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,130
<i>We should each focus on Woo-young
from now on.</i>

139
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,140
<i>With that in mind,
any personal calls from you</i>

140
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,910
<i>will be blocked.</i>

141
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,850
Because of that punk's kiss...

142
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,180
I'm sorry. You're really upset, right?

143
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,490
This is nonsense.

144
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,820
This doesn't make any sense.

145
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,390
I know that it doesn't make any sense.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,930
I'm really sorry.

147
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,800
- I will never do that with your son...
- Who's my son?

148
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,340
That punk isn't my son!

149
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,080
I know you're mad, but don't worry.

150
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,610
I drew a clear line,

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,320
- so your son—
- I said he's not my son!

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,520
He's really not my son.

153
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,020
Deok-jin is really mad.

154
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,860
He is?

155
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,030
Why is he mad?

156
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,460
Of course he's mad.

157
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,000
He's a parent too.

158
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,540
What?

159
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,910
<i>Hong Dae-young. You said you would
tell her everything. What happened?</i>

160
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,310
Ae-rin, do you remember the girl
you spoke about before?

161
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,210
The crazy idiot whose heart fluttered

162
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,310
when she saw a high school student.

163
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,120
That girl got rid of her feelings.

164
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,790
But why are you bringing that up now?

165
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,560
I realized

166
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,860
that the crazy idiot was me.

167
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,530

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,700

The truth is...

178
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,690
Right. It's my fault.

179
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,660
I should draw a line starting right now.

180
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,200
I should tell him that I'm a parent
and he's a student.

181
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,470
I'll get going now.

186
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,980
Of course I am.

Are you really okay?

190
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,920
Don't worry about it.

191

Fine. Let's talk.

You know that

197
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,590
your behavior yesterday
was inappropriate, right?

198
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,560
- I know you're upset, but...
- If my behavior

199
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,060
made you have a misunderstanding,

200
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,930
I'll apologize to you as an adult.

201
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,430
But from now on,

202
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,060
I don't want to see you again.

203

Wait. Hold on.

This isn't a request. It's a warning.

207
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,080
If you don't do as I say,
your father will talk to the school,

208
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,250
and we'll come up
with other arrangements.

209

Oh, my. What's wrong?

334
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,410
Did you hurt yourself?

335
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,850
I guess my shoe broke.

336
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,950
That's bad.

337
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,990
Aren't those from your number one fan?

338
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,030
It's fine. I can go to
a shoe repair shop later.

339
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,930
Do you have shoes to change into?

340
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,230
Yes, I do. I'm fine.

341
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,830
Why didn't you just let me apologize
and end it?

342
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Sorry?

343
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,210
He's the producer that grades us.

344
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,010
Ms. Kwon,

345
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,110
even if he was the CEO of this company

346
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,850
and not just a producer,

347
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,580
you're still the victim.

348
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,920
Why should the victim apologize?

349
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,450
But still.

350
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,590
What if he gets back at us for this?

351
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,920
Ms. Kwon,

352
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,360
you really think
you should be saying that?

353
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,590
But still.

354
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,760
I did it because I was reminded
of my daughter.

355
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,160
Your daughter?

356
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,300
If my daughter was

357
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,970
in the same situation,

358
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,840
and nobody was helping her out,

359
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,680
I feel like it'd have traumatized her
for life.

360
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,880
That's why I did what I did.

361
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,150
If I was being nosy,

362
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,350
Yu-mi!

364
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,830
I'll get going first.

365
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,900
How can she not even thank you?

366
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,300
It's fine.

367
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,040
She must be upset about the incident.

368
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,380
Let's not scrutinize her.

369
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,710
Fine.

370
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,596
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>

371
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,530
Ji-hoon!

372
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,660
Hello.

373
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,000
You're doing quite well these days.

374
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,230
I enjoyed your interview.

375
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,340
Thank you.

376
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,540
Just one thing,

377
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,710
do you have a crush on that news anchor?

378
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,280
- Sorry?
- You know,

379
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Kwon Yu-mi. Right?

380
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,850
- No.
- Come on. What do you mean, no?

381
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,750
When I watched your interview, I knew
you were talking about Kwon Yu-mi.

382
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,250
Focus on your game.

383
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,560
You know that a lot of pitchers
allowed me to hit a home-run

384
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,790
because they were occupied
with their love life, right?

385
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,990
We, baseball players,
must be good at playing ball.

386
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,160
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>

387

I'm telling you. It's her.

388
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,130
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>
See? I told you.

389
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,610
He's the fourth pitcher of Daehan.

390
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,550
Kang Sin-woo is walking
to the batter's box.

391
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,810
It's a face-off between

392
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,950
the star pitcher and the star batter.

393
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,390
Given the moment
Kang has been building lately,

394
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,120
even Ye must be under a lot of pressure.

395
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,300
Strike.

396
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,340
Strike.

397
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,950
Strike. Out!

398
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,490

<i>Seum wins the match against Daehan.</i>

401
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,340
<i>Ye was able to strike out
Kang right away.</i>

402
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,440
- Hey.
- I'm not giving it to you.

403
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,680
- Dad.
- You can call me whatever you want.

404
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,040
I said no.

405
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,780
Mr. Go, I'm here.

406
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,520
Si-woo, do you want
to eat ramyeon with me?

407
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,590
No.

408
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,790
Forget it.

409
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,460
I'll cook for you, Si-woo. Wait.

410
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,560
Okay.

411
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,840
<i>- Seum! Seum!

- My gosh.

413
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,550

414

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm really glad that
our program was well-received.

420
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,970
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Jung.

421
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,840
Gosh. I didn't do much.

422
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,670
It was all you.

423
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,140
So you heard that our show
will be a regular show now, right?

424
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Yes.

425
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,910
All right. You guys can go home now.

426
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:42,180

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,650
This isn't right!
Da-jung saved the show!

437
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,050
Exactly.

438
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,650
People watched the show for her!

439
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,360
This has to be Da-jung's show.

440
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,090
How can this happen?

<i>Check out her new challenge
in our regular episodes.</i>

442
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,800
I thought my mom would be the MC

443
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,570
if the show became a regular show.

444
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,050
I really kept pushing
that you should be the MC.

445
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,050
But the higher-ups told me to change it
to someone with more popularity.

446
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,990
That was the order.

447
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,160
I am so sorry.

448
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,730
I understand.

449
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,960
Really?

450
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,500
Even so,

451
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,200
I am a bit disappointed.

452
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,270
Of course.

453
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,170
You worked really hard for our show.

454
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,740
Not about that.

455
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,510
Then...

456
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,680
I understand that last-minute notices
are common in TV industry.

457
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,650
But I think you should have told me

458
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,320
that you were getting
a new MC beforehand.

459
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,050
This is

460
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,590
the least you can do for a colleague
who worked hard alongside you.

461
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,160
It's uncomfortable to bring this up,

462
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,000
but I thought I should address this.

463
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,670
I'll get going then.

464
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,980
Da-jung.

465
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,220
What? Ji-hoon.

466
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,490

468
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,690
I'm your boyfriend.

469
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,460
Pardon?

470
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,800
<i>And here is</i>

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,870
to comfort me?

474
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,640
You comforted me
when things were tough for me too.

475
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,820
Allow me to return the favor.

476
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,320
There's somewhere we must be.

477
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,250
I see. But I have to

478
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,790
be somewhere too.

479
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,260
Do you have plans again?

480
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,730
No, I don't.

481
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,030
I have to get my shoes repaired.

482
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,400
What a relief.

483
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,300
Then, we can stop by the shop.

484
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:24,492
Nice.

485
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:27,432
How dare you?

486
00:32:27,602 --> 00:32:29,002
What do you think you're doing?

487
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:31,802
I'll take this with me.

488
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,412
Hey, Mr. Ye.

489
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:39,612
You must be scared that
there might be a scandal.

490
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:40,742
A scandal?

491
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,882
Most of the articles you wrote about me
are all false.

492
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:50,292
I'm sure you know
that better than anyone.

493
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:54,262
If I were to sue you for defamation,

494
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,232
who will read your articles, then?

495
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:00,132
- Are you threatening me?
- Yes.

496
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:01,762
This is a threat.

497
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,432
If you write a word about Da-jung,

498
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:07,502
I will sue you and your agency.

499
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:09,242
Consider yourself warned.

500
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:13,042
I won't let it slide this time.

501
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:28,862
I'm sorry for making you wait.

502
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:31,692
No, it's fine. I like waiting.

503
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,572
By the way, I noticed that
you wear dress shoes more often.

504
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:41,572
Had I known, I should have bought you
dress shoes, not sneakers.

505
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:47,012
The shoes I dropped off
were from my number one fan.

506
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,012
Weren't they from you?

507
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:50,482
From your number one fan?

508
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:54,052
Gosh. I had competition.

509
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:57,792
They really weren't from you?

510
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:00,062
No. They aren't really from me.

511
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,262
Really?

512
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:05,062
Then, who are they from?

513
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,172
By the way, where do we need to go?

514
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:22,881
We've been here before.

515
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:24,881
Right.

516
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:27,881
Back then, it was a bit chilly.

517
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:30,051
So much time has passed since then.

518
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:32,122
Back then,

519
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:34,792
there were a lot of
cherry blossom flowers.

520
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:39,162
Do you remember making a wish here?

521
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:53,781
Hey, did you see that?

522
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:55,381
What's your wish?

523
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:57,082
It's a secret.

524
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:00,322
I remember.

525
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:03,352
Did the wish you made
back then come true?

526
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:06,322
Can you give me your hand?

527
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:16,002
I'll give you my wish.

528
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,052
I wished

529
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,092
that you would only smile in the future.

530
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,662
I really like it when you smile.

531
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:49,032
After what happened to my brother,

532
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:51,472
I had nobody beside me.

533
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:54,972
There was no one to listen to me

534
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,542
or worry with me.

535
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:02,752
Is there a person that comes to mind
when you're struggling?

536
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:07,782
A person that comes to mind
when I'm struggling?

537
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:12,662
<i>It's okay.</i>

538
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:15,162
You did well.

539
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,232
It's okay.

540
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:22,802
You did well.

541
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:33,382
Whenever something happens
to me these days,

542
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,212
you're the first person
that comes to mind.

543
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:40,352
I want to be that kind of person to you.

544
00:36:43,322 --> 00:36:44,422
I want to be the first person

545
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:47,322
you think of when you're struggling.

546
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,462
I want you to be happy.

547
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:55,032
I will

548
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:58,302
make you happy.

549
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:07,242
I like you, Da-jung.

550
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:21,022
I'm sorry, Ji-hoon.

551
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:27,662
You're a really good person.

552
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:31,732
But this is

553
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,972
not because of you.

554
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,082
Is it

555
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,242
because of him?

556
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,582
I'm sorry.

557
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,522
I'll get going now.

558
00:38:29,992 --> 00:38:30,992
<i>Are you okay?</i>

559
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:32,932
About what?

560
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:35,002
I saw the preview.

561
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:36,772
They changed the MC.

562
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:38,302
So?

563
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:40,542
I was worried.

564
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:43,942
Don't pretend like you're worried.

565
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:47,242
What?

566
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:51,682
You were

567
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,422
never by my side when I was struggling.

568
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:58,692
You never came to court,

569
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:00,322
<i>and when our kids were sick,</i>

570
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,762
<i>you said it wasn't a big deal.</i>

571
00:39:03,392 --> 00:39:05,092
You suddenly called
to say you wanted to meet,

572
00:39:05,432 --> 00:39:06,802
but you never showed up.

573
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:10,272
- That was because...
<i>- I know you're not in Busan,</i>

574
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:12,032
<i>so don't even think about lying to me.</i>

575
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,472
Even though we split up,

576
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:19,512
we spent half of our lives together.

577
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,452
I didn't realize it before,

578
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:25,082
but I guess that time

579
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,222
was significant to me.

580
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:30,052
<i>Whenever something good</i>

581
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:31,952
<i>or something bad happens to me,</i>

582
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:36,362
you were always the first person
to come to mind.

583
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:39,132
But what about you?

584
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:47,302
You were never there for me.

585
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:50,272
- Da-jung.
<i>- So</i>

586
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:53,312
don't call me acting like you're worried
out of obligation.

587
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:55,242
I'm hanging up.

588
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:56,682
I was always next to you.

589
00:39:58,952 --> 00:39:59,952
What?

590
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:06,092
I was next to you.

591
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:09,232
Stop lying already.

592
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,262
I'm tired of getting
disappointed in you.

593
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:42,662
I'll be right there.

594
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,402
I'm telling you I didn't do it!

595
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:53,402
Then why is money missing?

596
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,482
I'm Si-ah's mom.

597
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:09,922
What's going on?

598
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,722
She stole money from the store.

599
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,062
It wasn't me.

600
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:16,762
Hong Si-ah. Be quiet.

601
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:22,732
Can I take a look at your CCTV footage?

602
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:25,302
The CCTV camera is broken.

603
00:41:26,002 --> 00:41:28,542
In any case, she was the only
part-time employee today,

604
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:30,972
so who would've stolen the money?
It's obvious.

605
00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:36,082
Sir, I'm sure you were surprised,

606
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:40,882
but I don't think that Si-ah would
steal money from you.

607
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,122
Don't just assume
that my child stole it,

608
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:49,792
look for it one more time,
and give me a call.

609
00:41:54,902 --> 00:41:57,202
If you still can't find it,

610
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,572
then I'll take responsibility for it
and compensate you.

611
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:02,942
Okay, then.

612
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:05,072
I'm really sorry.

613
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:16,752
Hong Si-ah.

614
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:18,822
Why did you do it?

615
00:42:20,222 --> 00:42:21,522
I'm sorry.

616
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:24,632
But I really didn't steal it.

617
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,862
I know that you didn't steal it.

618
00:42:27,232 --> 00:42:30,172
But why did you hide the fact
that you had a part-time job?

619
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,172
To be honest,
I want to attend a makeup academy,

620
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:38,442
so I was saving up to pay for it.

621
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:41,382
A makeup academy?

622
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:45,452
You were interested in doing makeup?

623
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,022
Yes.

624
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:49,992
Did you think

625
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:52,692
that I couldn't pay for your classes,

626
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:55,932
so you got a job without telling me?

627
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:57,932
No.

628
00:42:58,532 --> 00:42:59,532
I just

629
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:02,032
wanted to do it on my own.

630
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:03,272
On your own?

631
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:06,372
How can an 18-year-old
do anything on her own?

632
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:08,142
I'll pay for your classes,

633
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:10,912
so quit your part-time job immediately.

634
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:12,742
How will you

635
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,812
prepare for college
while working a part-time job?

636
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:18,212
I'm not going to college.

637
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:21,922
Hong Si-ah.

638
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:25,752
When you enter the real world,
no matter how skilled you are,

639
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:28,462
people will judge you
based on the college you attended.

640
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,832
They won't even give you a chance,

641
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:31,292
so why won't you go to college?

642
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:33,862
Why are you getting mad
without listening to me?

643
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:36,902
I have been looking into it for a year,

644
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:39,072
and I thought about it carefully
before making my decision.

645
00:43:39,502 --> 00:43:42,002
You don't know
anything about this field.

646
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:44,612
I'll take care of it on my own,

647
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:47,642
so don't interfere
if you don't know about it.

648
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:49,552
Don't interfere?

649
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:51,182
I do my best to make sure

650
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:53,482
you can learn, eat, and do
whatever you want.

651
00:43:54,752 --> 00:43:56,322
But how can you say that to me?

652
00:43:59,622 --> 00:44:02,392
Are you saying that the reason you
live like this is because of me again?

653
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:05,292
I know that

654
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:08,062
I was born because of a mistake
you and Dad made.

655
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:11,202
That's why I'm trying not to burden you.

656
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,042
What?

657
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:15,742
It's true that I'm a burden
in your life and Dad's.

658
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,252
You had no interest in me ever,

659
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:26,982
so stop pretending to care now.

660
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:31,392
Si-ah.

661
00:44:57,512 --> 00:44:59,322
Goodness, Si-ah!

662
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:01,322
How can she be so mean to her mother?

663
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:06,962
You must've been surprised.

664
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,062
I think Si-ah is
misunderstanding something.

665
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:10,892
I'll have a talk with her.

666
00:45:10,962 --> 00:45:13,432
Don't worry and just head home.

667
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:24,042
It's fine.

668
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,812
She doesn't know what you went through
to raise her.

669
00:45:28,612 --> 00:45:31,082
What an ungrateful girl.

672
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:49,162
What?

673
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:52,092
I wasn't even trying to listen to you.

674
00:46:53,132 --> 00:46:54,432
I'm sorry for getting mad.

675
00:46:59,972 --> 00:47:02,872
But Si-ah, I don't see you

676
00:47:02,942 --> 00:47:05,442
as a child I had accidentally.

677
00:47:08,112 --> 00:47:09,712
To me,

678
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,722
you're the biggest blessing in my life.

679
00:47:14,052 --> 00:47:15,522

680
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:20,222

682
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:28,062
I'm sorry.

I'll always listen to you first now.

684
00:47:33,302 --> 00:47:34,802
So, whatever it is,

685
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:36,942
feel free to tell me.

686
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:40,282
I'm always curious

687
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:42,282
about what you're thinking about

688
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:44,682
and what aspirations you have.

689
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,722
I certainly care.

690
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:54,462
And as for going to college,

691
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:57,132
I was wrong.

692
00:47:57,592 --> 00:48:00,662
When I was younger,
my lack of education stopped me

693
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:03,302
from doing what I wanted.

694
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:05,372
So hearing you

695
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:08,002
say that you don't want to go to college

696
00:48:09,072 --> 00:48:10,612
scared me.

697
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:15,582
But I've looked into it,

698
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,352
and apparently, work experience
matters more

699
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:19,312
for makeup artists.

700
00:48:20,222 --> 00:48:21,252
Yes.

701
00:48:21,622 --> 00:48:24,992
I'm going to get my makeup certificate
instead of studying for college

702
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,662
and polish my skills
by gaining more work experience.

703
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:31,462
From next year, I'm going to prepare
and enter contests.

704
00:48:32,332 --> 00:48:34,802
If I get awards from the contests,
I'll get employed faster.

705
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:36,632
Right.

706
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:40,742
Okay. Do that.

707
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:42,442
Really?

708
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:44,042
But one thing.

709
00:48:45,242 --> 00:48:46,982
You should quit your part-time job.

710
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:50,052
I can support you.

711
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:55,152
Okay.

712
00:49:00,222 --> 00:49:01,262
What?

713
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:03,932

714

Well,

716
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,432
I got a little something
to make you feel better.

717

and this is all that I can do
on a day like this too.

731

I could never pay back for your love.

00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:41,652
I'm

825
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:44,392
in Busan.

826
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:46,322
Did you eat?

827
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:49,092
Are you eating your meals?

828
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:51,092
<i>Gosh.</i>

829
00:56:51,892 --> 00:56:52,962
<i>Of course.</i>

830
00:56:53,232 --> 00:56:56,732
<i>Gosh. You're worried about my meals now.</i>

831
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:03,742
What's wrong, Si-ah?

832
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:07,682
Dad.

833
00:57:09,812 --> 00:57:11,352
I miss you.

834
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:14,822
<i>I miss you.</i>

835
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,292
I miss you, Dad.

836
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:35,942
I'm sorry.

837
00:57:38,012 --> 00:57:39,242
I'm sorry, Si-ah.

838
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:45,582
Dad. You'll come and see me, right?

839
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:16,482
Si-ah.

840
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:19,252
I will make sure

841
00:58:24,522 --> 00:58:25,692
to be there.

842
00:59:12,902 --> 00:59:16,372
<i>Hong Dae-young</i>

843
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:23,782
Why did you call me again?

844
00:59:25,682 --> 00:59:27,022
I have something to tell you.

845
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:29,322
I have nothing to tell you.

846
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:31,292
I'm near our house.

847
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:34,992
I want to tell you this in person.

848
00:59:39,762 --> 00:59:40,762
Okay.

849
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:36,622
Where are you?

850
01:01:11,552 --> 01:01:12,552
Da-jung.

851
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:15,692
I'm Dae-young.

852
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:20,802
I'm not Go Woo-young.

853
01:01:22,602 --> 01:01:23,672
I'm Hong Dae-young.

854
01:01:59,102 --> 01:02:00,649
- <i>3 years ago</i> Over here.
- She's gorgeous.

855
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:02,672
- In 1, 2.
- Look here!

856
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:04,572
- Look over here too.
- Great.

857
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:06,672
Hey, can you look over here too?

858
01:02:07,742 --> 01:02:09,142
- You look so pretty.
- You look beautiful.

859
01:02:09,212 --> 01:02:11,782
Bride, please look over here. 1, 2.

860
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:14,452
- All right. Great. How beautiful.
- So pretty.

861
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:17,992
Hey, girl!

862
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:19,952
My gosh. Hey, you!

863
01:02:20,022 --> 01:02:21,722
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

864
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:24,462
- Your dress looks so beautiful.
- Look at her.

865
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,132
All right. Let's take another one.

866
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:28,032
- Okay. 1, 2.
- No.

867
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:30,472
Your dress looks gorgeous.

868
01:02:47,782 --> 01:02:50,792
The bride looked really pretty.

869
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:55,962
I know it's late,
but should we have a wedding?

870
01:02:57,792 --> 01:02:58,792
No.

871
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:02,262
It'll cost a fortune to plan a wedding.

872
01:03:02,632 --> 01:03:06,332
Let's go on a trip with Si-ah and Si-woo
with that money instead.

873
01:03:06,402 --> 01:03:08,242
I really want to make

874
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:11,712
a lot of good memories for our children.

875
01:03:13,112 --> 01:03:14,112
That's all I want.

876
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:19,212
- Here.
- What?

877
01:03:19,852 --> 01:03:20,922
I'm fine.

878
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,752
I'm not fine with that.

879
01:03:23,692 --> 01:03:24,822
Cover yourself with that.

880
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,092
I'll go buy an umbrella.

881
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:41,942
What were you looking at?

882
01:03:42,742 --> 01:03:43,712
Nothing.

883
01:03:44,142 --> 01:03:47,642
I didn't know I would change like this
when I was young.

884
01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:50,142
"Change"?

885
01:03:50,852 --> 01:03:52,252
You haven't changed one bit.

886
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:57,622
You must be cold.

887
01:03:58,152 --> 01:03:59,122
I'm fine.

888
01:03:59,692 --> 01:04:00,622
Well,

889
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:03,222
can you accept this?

890
01:04:05,732 --> 01:04:06,962
What a surprise.

891
01:04:07,202 --> 01:04:08,202
Thank you.

892
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,742
Why are you staring at me?

893
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:20,212
Because you're pretty.

894
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:35,392
I'm sorry.

895
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:39,032
And thank you.

896
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:40,962
To me, you are still

897
01:04:42,362 --> 01:04:44,472
the most beautiful woman in this world.

898
01:04:57,912 --> 01:04:58,952
Let's go now.

899
01:05:07,022 --> 01:05:08,222
<i>To be honest,</i>

900
01:05:08,722 --> 01:05:11,062
<i>my heart fluttered</i>

901
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:13,462
for Woo-young.

902
01:05:14,002 --> 01:05:16,632
But the thing is

903
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:21,042
I'm not sure if my heart fluttered

904
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,812
because it was Woo-young

905
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,772
or because he resembled Dae-young.

906
01:05:27,182 --> 01:05:28,442
Woo-young

907
01:05:29,812 --> 01:05:32,952
has his looks and his voice.

908
01:05:34,322 --> 01:05:36,552
He even behaves like Dae-young.

909
01:05:38,692 --> 01:05:40,152
When I see Woo-young,

910
01:05:43,062 --> 01:05:44,932
I keep thinking about Hong Dae-young

911
01:05:46,462 --> 01:05:48,402
whom my heart fluttered for before.

912
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:53,232
But why is he acting

913
01:05:53,332 --> 01:05:56,902
just like Dae-young with the same looks?

914
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,172
Da-jung.

915
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,712
- The truth is...
- Right.

916
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,442
It's my fault.

917
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:07,352
I should draw a line starting right now.

918
01:06:07,782 --> 01:06:10,282
I should tell him that I'm a parent
and he's a student.

919
01:06:10,452 --> 01:06:11,522
I'll get going now.

920
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,392
Da-jung!

921
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:21,602
Gosh. I don't know anymore.

922
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:23,972
But

923
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:27,302
she told me her heart
didn't flutter for her husband.
