00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:24,315
anyone could answer who is.

166
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,245
You think this very old man
wouldn't know and just stubbornly argue

167
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:28,785
that he's right?

168
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,315
That's only what uneducated people do.

169
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:34,055
People aren't that stupid nowadays.

170
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,755
And I know I should've thought twice
when you started learning martial arts!

171
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:42,365
You can't just beat people up like that.

172
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,735
You have to stay calm

173
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:47,705
even when some brat comes along
and ticks you off.

174
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,165
If you go ahead and punch them,

175
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:51,335
you could easily knock their ribs out.

176
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,075
Look how tiny they are!

177
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,275
Now,

178
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,445
shall we go over what really happened?

179
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,145

180
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:05,655
Who wants to speak up?

181
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,955
Yes, that girl is right.

182
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,525
That girl started the fight,

183
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:11,725
and she tripped over while trying
to trip your daughter over.

184
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,665
Apologize to her.

185
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:21,335
Yes, you should apologize.

186
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:26,935
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,785
You too. You should apologize too.

188
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:37,385
I'm an old man.
How can I possibly apologize

189
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:38,715
to some young girl?

190
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,885
Age doesn't mean anything.

191
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,585
You said yourself that you need
to apologize if you did wrong.

192
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,695
My daughter is as precious to me

193
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,295
as yours is to you.

194
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:49,065
I'm being very civil right now,

195
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,865
despite how frustrated
my daughter feels.

196
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,265
So, just apologize and leave.

197
00:14:58,505 --> 00:14:59,505
All right.

198
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:03,045

212

because of us.

214
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,985

215
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,855
for scarring both of you.

216

I'm sorry.

218

If you will allow us,

we'd love to live together as a family.

220

May I?

221
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:43,475
Why are you even asking that?

222
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,245
Of course we'd be happy

223

to have you back.

224

00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:28,425
Yes, the meeting ran long.
Go take a break.

331
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:29,585
All right, then.

332
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:34,102
<i>All about real sports, "Sports Mate"</i>

333
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,225
What do we start with?

334
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:37,365
This.

335
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:56,545
That video.

336
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,855
You uploaded that, didn't you?

337
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,255
Well,

338
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:05,895
yes.

339
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:09,395
It could've put you at risk too.

340
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:11,195
Why did you upload it?

341
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,435
The truth is,

342
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,205
I was very mean to you.

343
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,605
But you

344
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,935
ended up getting fired
because you helped me.

345
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:21,505
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:24,205
Don't be.

347
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:28,445
But you didn't have to
post something like that.

348
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:32,615
I thought about what I might do

349
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,125
if my older sister
were in that situation.

350
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:41,055
And this was the only thing
I could think of.

351
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,295
Thank you.

352
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:48,705
Let's have a meal together next time.
It's my treat.

353
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:51,805
Sounds good, Da-jung.

354
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:18,195
What are you doing?
Why are you just standing there?

355
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:19,635
Because I'm happy.

356
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:21,635
About what?

357
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,205
When I was looking at you from here,

358
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,975
I was happy that I didn't have to worry
in case you saw me.

359
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:28,845
And I was happy that I didn't have to

360
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,345
make up a lame excuse to talk to you.

361
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:36,545
I'm also happy
that you are waiting for me.

362
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:39,815
Gosh. Come on.

363
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:42,725
I'm going to be honest from now on.

364
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:45,495
Some things still have to be said
between spouses.

365
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:47,895
A popular anchorwoman said that.

366
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,165
Gosh.

367
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:53,095
Let's go.

<i>Serim High School</i>

369
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:04,645
- Dad.
- My princess.

370
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,645
I'm glad I ran into you.

371
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,985
- Hello.
- Hey.

372
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:10,745
You're Bo-bae and Young-seon.

373

You girls...

374
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:21,825
It's so nice to see you girls.
It's been a while.

- Pardon?
- Pardon?

376
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,395
Are you here to talk to my teacher
about college?

377
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:27,465
Yes.

378
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:30,105
Where are you girls going?
To the snack bar?

379
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:31,265
How did you know?

380
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:34,705
If you're heading there around this time
of the day, it's the snack bar.

381
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:37,945
Here. You three can go
and buy yourself a nice treat.

382
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:40,375
No. It's okay, Mr. Hong.

383
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:43,045
Don't be shy.
You guys are still growing.

384
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:44,855
Eat a lot and study hard.

385
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:45,955
Okay?

386
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:52,495
I think I heard that from somewhere.

387
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:54,095
Thank you, Dad.

388
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,695
- Sure thing. I'll get going.
- Okay.

389
00:25:57,865 --> 00:25:59,195
Thank you.

390
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:02,805
Hey, that's new.

391
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,905
Your dad usually gives you an earful.

392
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,335
What are you talking about?

393
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,775
He's telling me all that for my sake.

394
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:12,545
Let's go.

395
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,545
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

396
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,115
I didn't know that
you would be coming, Mr. Hong.

397
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,285
I heard that you were in Busan.

398
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,985
I recently came back to Seoul.

399
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:26,755
Then, you must be in the dark
about Si-ah's decision for her career.

400
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,295
I know.

401
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:33,265
And that Si-ah does not plan
to go to college?

402
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,605
Yes.

403
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:37,735
Aren't you sad?

404
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,335
At first, I was.

405
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:43,475
But there was something else
Si-ah really wanted.

406
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:47,315
And I would like to
support her decision.

407
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,655
You are a cool dad.

408
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:54,155
Naturally, I thought
you would be against it.

409
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:56,925
I was trying to come up with a way
to persuade you.

410
00:26:57,855 --> 00:26:59,455
I'm ashamed to think that.

411
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:01,425
Gosh. No.

412
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,495
I should thank you for trying to
see this from Si-ah's perspective.

413
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:06,695
Gosh, don't mention it.

414
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:09,365
Then,

415
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:14,735
thank you so much
for taking good care of her.

416
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:17,975
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

417
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:34,395
Gosh. I swear I've seen him somewhere.

418
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,145
Woo-young.

419
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:56,815
Let's win the playoffs and go
to Hankuk University together.

420
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:02,155
Si-woo.

421
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:04,455
I don't think I can go
to Hankuk University with you.

422
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:08,325
What do you mean?

423
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:14,535
I'm going back to the US
as soon as I can.

424
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:15,605
To the US?

425
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:17,665
Yes.

426
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,845
How can I do this without you?

427
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:26,575
Si-woo.

428
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:29,645
You can be a cool guy
without anybody's help.

429
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:34,155
And now, you have the guys
from the basketball team.

430
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:37,385
Won't you regret it
if you don't go to Hankuk University?

431
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:44,325
No.

432
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:48,095
Si-woo, there are
too many things I cherish

433
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:49,635
more than basketball.

434
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,535
And I realized that too late.

435
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,375
That's what I regret the most.

436
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:02,645
You should always live your day
to the fullest.

437
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:05,585
And never forget your loved ones
around you.

438
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:10,855
I want you to remember your days
as an 18-year-old

439
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:14,455
filled with good memories
instead of regrets.

440
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:25,975
Hey, Si-woo.

441
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:27,805
Woo-young?

442
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,545
What? Dad.

443
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:34,975
Good job.

444
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:37,745
I'm pretty good at basketball too.

445
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:41,315
But I'm pretty good at basketball too.

446
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:42,385
What?

447
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:46,925
What's that face? Do you not believe me?

448
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:48,625
Give me the ball.

449
00:30:03,045 --> 00:30:06,475
What do you say? Whoever scores
ten points first gets a free drink.

450
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:09,145
- I'm in.
- Nice!

451
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:10,785
I won't go easy on you.

452
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,385
Same here.

453
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:15,055
Look at that. Come.

454
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,625
Hey, get ready. Go.

455
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,665
Gosh. I was so close.

456
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,465
My body is failing me.

457
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:32,635
Playing basketball with you

458
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:34,835
reminds me of Woo-young.

459
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,275
Woo-young?

460
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,245
Yes.

461
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,615
He was my friend

462
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:49,385
who was always next to me
whenever I needed him.

463
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:53,855
Si-woo.

464
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:55,895
Starting now,

465
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,195
can I take Woo-young's spot

466
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:00,465
and be your friend?

467
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:04,235
- You?
- Yes.

468
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:06,875
When you need me,

469
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:09,545
I'll be right there with you.

470
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:13,175
Sounds good.

471
00:31:16,385 --> 00:31:17,515
Okay.

472
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,665
It feels like yesterday

473
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:31,595
when we had those two toddlers
crawling in our small studio.

474
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:33,895
Time flies, doesn't it?

475
00:31:34,465 --> 00:31:35,465
Right.

476
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:38,735
Treating my time with
you guys as a regret

477
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:42,205
was the biggest mistake of my life.

478
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,775
Wait. Don't tell me
that you have another regret now.

479
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:52,555
There is one thing I learned
after getting young.

480
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:53,885
What is it?

481
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:56,125
No matter how old you get,

482
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,625
there is always something new to learn.

483
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:01,455
If you think of it as a regret,
that's the end of it.

484
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,395
But when you think of it
as a lesson learned,

485
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:05,535
it brings a new beginning.

486
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:08,165
I'll try to learn more from now on

487
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:11,335
whether it's about work, life,

488
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:12,705
or love.

489
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:18,715
So I'll try to find
what I love to do again.

490
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:20,445
That's great.

491
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:23,015
I wanted to tell you that too.

492
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:24,845
Yes.

493
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:27,155

It was a gift from a fan.

the person you know as my dad

What?

606

by pretending to be my dad.

608
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,435
He's not even my biological dad,

609

but he went through so much trouble
by taking me in.

He even

for my sake.

00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,646
Drink up.

659
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:05,516
Drink up! Drink up!

660
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,486
What took you two so long?

661
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:12,856
- I had a practice.
- I had practicum.

662
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,686
On a weekend?

663
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:16,156
I guess med school is intense.

664
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,456
Don't even get me started.

665
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,306
How's med school? Intense, right?

666
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,676
I never get a break.

667
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:33,906
Why did you have to go to med school?

668
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:35,046
What?

669
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:38,846
I don't know. Because of someone.

670
00:43:43,616 --> 00:43:44,656
Si-ah.

671
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:48,356
Hey, Si-ah isn't into things like that.

672
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:53,366
You knew it was
our 800th day anniversary?

673
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:55,966
Of course.

674
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:59,806
I'm sorry I've been so busy lately.

675
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,406
When it's someone you love,
anything is great.

676
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:07,476
You should give up now.

677
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,846
Let's do a toast. We haven't seen
each other in so long.

678
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:15,986
All right.

679
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:20,826
What's wrong with him?

680
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:26,796
Cheers to the 39th class of Serim!

681
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,626
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

682
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:34,806
What about Si-woo?
He can't make it today?

683
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:35,936
Hong Si-woo?

684
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,406
Probably in a fight.

685
00:44:38,606 --> 00:44:39,976
Did I do something wrong again?

686
00:44:40,046 --> 00:44:42,106
- You go and think about it on your own!
- Come on.

687
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:46,046
You have to tell me so that I'd know.

688
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,446
Do you really not know?

689
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:49,016
You keep smiling at your fangirls!

690
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,116
Don't you think I'd get scared
that I might lose you?

691
00:44:51,186 --> 00:44:53,486
You changed after going to college.

692
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,296
What?

693
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:01,266
All right. I won't ever do that again.

694
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:02,596
But So-mi,

695
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,136
my dad said

696
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:08,266
that a man must not ever
let go of a woman

697
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,336
who was there for him
during his difficult times.

698
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,446
So, don't you ever worry.

699
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:14,846
Gosh.

700
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:17,676
Come here.

701
00:45:20,446 --> 00:45:23,756
Talking about Si-woo reminds me
of Woo-young.

702
00:45:23,816 --> 00:45:25,926
Woo-young was so cool
when he played basketball.

703
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,756
He was a great basketball player
and a listener.

704
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:32,766
Yes, it was like it was his second time
living life.

705
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:37,566
Woo-young must be even more mature
and even better-looking now, right?

706
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,376
Why did he suddenly leave?

707
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,006
I don't know. And we can't get in touch
with him.

708
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,306
I'm worried for him.

709
00:45:46,806 --> 00:45:49,616
I'm sure the man is doing just fine.

710
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:53,186
"The man"? You're talking
as if he's an old man.

711
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:54,516
What?

712
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:02,396
Talking about Woo-young is making me
miss him.

713
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:06,726
You're right. I hope he's doing well.

714
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:14,906
You know that this game is
your last chance if you lose, right?

715
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,368
But I know that this is

716
00:46:18,606 --> 00:46:19,665
only the start for us.

Gather up.

719

We can do it as long
as we don't give up.

<i>"Jung Da-jung's Sports Fan Meet"</i>

734
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,416
We thought we'd visit you.

735
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:03,216
You look like a professional golfer.

736
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,486
You look stunning.

737
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:06,686
Are you getting jealous of her again?

738
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:09,026
It's nothing like that.

739
00:47:09,956 --> 00:47:11,796
Isn't it ridiculous?

740
00:47:11,856 --> 00:47:13,866
Hey, Seul-hye!

741
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:18,166
I can't believe it.

742
00:47:18,696 --> 00:47:20,906
She saw me,

743
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,736
but completely ignored me, right?

744
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:26,746
I don't know. She might've been
distracted by her call.

745
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:30,216
She's been like that
ever since she came in.

746
00:47:30,276 --> 00:47:33,216
She keeps looking down on me
because I'm her age but more senior.

747
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:36,386
It's like newbies these days don't know
what manner is!

748
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:44,356
I know I was one of them before.

749
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:47,366
Is that right? Look at you.
You've grown.

750
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:48,426
Yes.

751
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,936
How's the director doing?

752
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:53,466
I haven't seen him in a while.

753
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,006
Director? Which one?

754
00:47:56,076 --> 00:47:58,176
- What?
- You probably don't know.

755
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:00,706
We've had some promotions recently.

756

00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,426
to dinner together tonight, then?

760

- That sounds great!
- That's too bad.

I have to see my husband today.

Let's have it some other time.

I wanted to impress you today.

771
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:04,936
- Me?
- Yes.

772
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:11,076
What are you doing?
What if people see us?

773
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,586
What's wrong with that? We're lovers.

774
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:17,216
You've become bolder
after living young once.

775
00:49:17,616 --> 00:49:18,616
Of course.

776
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:21,226
What's there to fear
when we only live once?

777
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:24,226
We have to be bold and do whatever
we want to do in life.

778
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,366
That being said,

779
00:49:27,126 --> 00:49:28,666
there's somewhere we have to go.

780
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:30,466
Where?

781
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:42,006
Grant me a wish if I shoot the ball
into the basket.

782
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,946
Gosh. Come on.

783
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:48,116
You'll grant my wish, right?

784
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:54,556
Da-jung,

785
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:57,056
will you marry me again?

786
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:08,906
Yes!

787
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:19,546
Da-jung,

788
00:50:20,546 --> 00:50:23,456
let's have a wedding.

789
00:50:25,686 --> 00:50:27,686
You said that you're fine,

790
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:31,926
but when we were young,
we couldn't afford a wedding,

791
00:50:33,126 --> 00:50:35,826
and when we got older,
we didn't have the time for it.

792
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:38,966
But our kids are in college now,

793
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,266
so let's not push it back any longer.

794
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,436
And I

795
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,246
really want to see you
in a wedding dress.

796
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:55,146
Do you think I'll still look nice

797
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:57,286
even if I wear it now?

798
00:50:58,216 --> 00:50:59,456
In my eyes,

you're the prettiest woman as you are.

I know

802
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,246
I might not be able to give you things
as expensive as other men,

803
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:24,676
but I'll only give you

804
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,086
the best of things that I can.

805
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:00,316

Hey, forget it. I don't need a wedding
present. Just come to the wedding.

871
00:55:29,286 --> 00:55:31,956
No, don't say that. My friend
of 20 years is getting married.

872
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:33,826
I can't go there empty-handed.

How about this for a wedding present?

What?

877
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,576
This isn't right.

878
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,516
