Yes.

Thank you for today.

10
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:42,166
Well...

13
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,376
- Hello.
- Bye, Seo-yeon.

14
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,876
- Bye.
- Take photos of her now. Hurry.

15
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:09,026
<i>Seo-yeon was quite shocked.</i>

16
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:15,096
<i>I comforted her, and
she got over it today.</i>

17
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,696
<i>But I'm worried that
reporters will continue</i>

18
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:19,466
<i>to come and see her.</i>

19
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:30,276

I feel really betrayed by you.</i>

20
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:32,222

23
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,156

24
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:47,526

26
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,265
Hong Dae-young. How can
my own friend say that to me?

27
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:00,506
Hong Dae-young?

28
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:04,016
I should have been the one
who got younger, not you.

29
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:06,816
Why do you only get lucky like that?

30
00:02:07,716 --> 00:02:09,186
Do you think this is good for me?

31
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,156
I can't even tell Da-jung who I am.

32
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:15,486
All I can do is hover around her.

33
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:19,326
Hong Dae-young.
Can you drink with me tonight?

34
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:21,896
Woo-young,

35
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,896
you're Hong Dae-young?

36
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,806
Have I truly gone mad now?

37
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,306
Ae-rin, that's not it.

38
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,046
"Ae-rin"?

39
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,486
Well, that's not it, Ms. Chu.

40
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,256
I didn't know you two were here.

41
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,226
I'm sorry, Ae-rin. I have to get
going. I have somewhere to be.

42
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:56,396
What? Hold on.

43
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,372
It sounds like it's urgent.
You should go, Da-jung.

44
00:02:58,457 --> 00:02:59,596
Yes. You should hurry.

45
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,936
I mean, bye.

46
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,806
Okay. See you later.

47
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:06,906
Okay.

48
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,276
Wait, Da-jung.

49
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:12,916
Yes?

50
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,186
I have

51
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,756
something to tell you.

52
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,396
Something to tell me? What is it?

53
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:28,866
So...

54
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,666
He...

55
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,966
He...

56
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,476
He...

57
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:40,136
Ae-rin. I'm sorry. I really need to go.

58
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,376
Let's talk on the phone later. Bye.

59
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:46,916
Wait. I...

60
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:51,886
Gosh.

61
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:53,856
What is it?

62
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,986
Why do you look so relieved?

63
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:59,996
Are you really Hong Dae-young?

64
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,426
Does that even make sense?

65
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:03,796
No, it doesn't.

66
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,806
How could you make
such a ridiculous mistake?

67
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:11,106
You just called him Hong Dae-young.

68
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:13,016
I was talking to him
through the speakerphone.

69
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,876
You weren't on the speakerphone.

70
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,146
- Do you want to continue insisting on it?
- Dad!

71
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:18,546
Restrain yourself.

72
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,516
It's understandable to be mistaken.

73
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:21,946
How can I tolerate this?

74
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:26,316
Chu Ae-rin. This is insulting.

75
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,926
Really?

76
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:30,026
Then let's check.

77
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,156
What is she doing?

78
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,766
<i>Chu Ae-rin</i>

79
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:50,176
Why is Hong Dae-young's phone here?

80
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:52,316
Darn it.

81
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:54,716
I told you to get another phone!

82
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,006
Why are you bringing that up now?

83
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,956
Be honest with me right now!

84
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,686
If you confuse me, I'm going
to call Da-jung and check.

85
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:02,826
No.

86
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,696
So...

87
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:08,926
I...

88
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,496
I am Hong Dae-young, but...

89
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,266
You are?

90
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,306
You're really Hong Dae-young?

91
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:23,376
But please don't tell Da-jung.

92
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,476
I have my reasons.

93
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,686
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back  second.

94
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:34,486
Let's eat together sometime.

95
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:37,056
Let's eat together sometime.

96
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:41,226
Deok-jin. Why don't we become in-laws?

97
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:47,536
Reasons, my foot.

98
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:49,536
Just you wait. I'm going to

99
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,376
find an appropriate
punishment for your lies.

100
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,006
- Hold on.
- Live your life honestly!

101
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,176
Ae-rin!

102
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,046
Chu Ae-rin.

103
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,746
Darn it.

104
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,666
I'm sorry for leaving
like that the other day.

105
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:13,696
There's no need to be.

106
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:17,796
Right. What about your
daughter? Where was she?

107
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,436
She was at the police station.

108
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:24,206
She left to look for
her mom and got lost.

109
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:26,876
You must've been surprised.

110
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:28,506
I was.

111
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,846
In any case, she's the
most difficult girl in my life.

112
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:38,786
How long have you been
raising your daughter alone?

113
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,486
It hasn't been long.

114
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:44,826
Then did her mom raise her before?

115
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:47,226
No.

116
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:49,326
Her dad.

117
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:51,466
What are you saying?

118
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:54,665
Aren't you her dad?

119
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:59,576
I'm her adopted dad.

120
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:02,446
I was talking about her biological dad,

121
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,316
my older brother.

122
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,356
<i>My brother was an incredible person.</i>

123
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,056
<i>He would deliver newspapers at dawn,</i>

124
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,996
<i>-tutor 2 to 3 kids during the day,</i>
- If you apply this...

125
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,466
<i>and work at a restaurant at night.</i>

126
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,416
<i>He did that all throughout college.</i>

127
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,176
Ji-hoon. What are you doing here?

128
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,216
I was scared to be alone.

129
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:42,816
I'm not done with work.

130
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,816
Ji-hoon. Can you

131
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:48,026
wait for me while you eat this?

132
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,226
Yes, I can.

133
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:58,496
- Ji-hoon. Hold on.
- Okay.

134
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,636
I got a page.

135
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,156
- Should we go home like this?
- Yes, I'd love to!

136
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,356
- Okay!
- Wow!

137
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:28,296
- Is it fun?
- Yes, it is. Yes!

138
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,905
- There's one over there too.
<i>- Our parents passed away when he was 20.</i>

139
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:32,897
You're right.

140
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,136
I'm sure he was overwhelmed with
his own tuition and living expenses,

141
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,576
but he had to raise me too.

142
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,946
He went through a lot.

143
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,106
To me, he was my brother

144
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:47,046
as well as my parents.

145
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,656
<i>Enough already.</i>

146
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:54,786
So when is Ji-hoon going to
become a pro baseball player?

147
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:56,756
Will he even become one?

148
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,696
Why would you say that?

149
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,402
It's like you're hoping
he doesn't become one.

150
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:01,608
Am I saying this for no reason?

151
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:05,196
You keep pushing off our
wedding to take care of him.

152
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:09,336
Why does your brother always come
first? Shouldn't that person be me?

153
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:13,676
I can't endure this anymore.

154
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,076
Let's break up.

155
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,606
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

156
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:21,616
Darn it.

157
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:27,716
<i>I felt bad.</i>

158
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:32,096
<i>He broke up with his long-term
girlfriend like that because of me.</i>

159
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,226
<i>I thought it was all over, but...</i>

160
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,096
<i>I still remember it clearly.</i>

161
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,882
<i>It was the day I got selected
in the first draft.</i>

162
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:42,812
<i>Seum Wolves</i>

163
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:44,506
Hey!

164
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:47,306
- Hey, I...
- Welcome home.

165
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:52,616
Who's this baby?

166
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:55,216
Isn't she pretty? She's my daughter.

167
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:56,646
She's your daughter?

168
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:59,686
Is Mi-ah her mom?

169
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,556
I decided to raise her.

170
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:04,556
My gosh!

171
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,196
Hey, the baby will be surprised.

172
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:09,966
It's okay.

173
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,436
Didn't you have something to tell me?

174
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:15,936
I got it.

175
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:19,236
I made the rookie draft.

176
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:20,636
Really?

177
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:24,376
Oh, my.

178
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:28,286
Really? Good job.

179
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:30,586
Good job, Ji-hoon. Seriously.

180
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:31,756
Well done.

181
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:34,416
- Congratulations.
<i>- My brother was always like that.</i>

182
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:36,456
Goodness. It's okay.

183
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,196
<i>What happened to me came first</i>

184
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>to whatever problem
he had in front of him.</i>

185
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,026
<i>If something good happened to me,</i>

186
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,426
<i>he was happier than I was.</i>

187
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,566
Are you training?

188
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:50,106
Your phone is off.

189
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:53,876
Ji-hoon. Eat well while
you're in the States

190
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:56,206
and don't over strain yourself.

191
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,076
Have a Merry Christmas!

192
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,866
<i>I thought, "Is this what it feels
like to suddenly be orphaned?"</i>

193
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,766
<i>I was only thinking of myself,</i>

194
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:56,966
<i>but then, I saw Seo-yeon.</i>

195
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:02,276
Seo-yeon.

196
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:06,816
<i>That's when I decided</i>

197
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:09,476
<i>that just like how my
brother became my parent,</i>

198
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,956
<i>I will become her father.</i>

199
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,636
That's amazing, Ji-hoon.

200
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,306
It's nothing.

201
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,776
As much as I had wanted to be,

202
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,916
I haven't done much
for her as her father.

203
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,076
And with the public finding
out through the news,

204
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,916
I'm only breaking her heart even more.

205
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:53,256
I'm thinking

206
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,296
of retiring.

207
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,366
Retiring?

208
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,466
If I don't explain myself clearly,
people will only make more assumptions.

209
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:06,006
Before Seo-yeon get
sold enough to understand,

210
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:08,846
I should retire.
I think that's only right.

211
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:11,846
Are you sure you won't regret it?

212
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:14,846
Regret it?

213
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,186
I might at times.

214
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,286
Then don't retire.

215
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:23,926
Can you imagine how Seo-yeon will feel

216
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:26,396
when she becomes older and realizes

217
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,766
that you gave up on your
career because of her?

218
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,836
As grateful as she would feel,

219
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:37,906
she will also feel terribly guilty.

220
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:43,576
It'll also feel pressuring
because she'll feel like

221
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:47,746
she's a burden to you.

222
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:57,356
Happy parents raise happy children.

223
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:59,956
If you feel like you're
going to regret it,

224
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,526
don't stop. Keep going.

225
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,566
Both for Seo-yeon and yourself.

226
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:10,466
Thank you for telling me that.

227
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,306
It's nothing. I'm just offering help

228
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,976
as your fan.

229
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,516
I thought you said
that you weren't my fan.

230
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,246
I'm your fan from now on.

231
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,616
Seo-yeon's dad, Ye Ji-hoon,

232
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:25,686
is absolutely amazing.

233
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:28,426
So, no matter what people will say,

234
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,486
I will forever be your fan.

235
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:37,596
Don't let people who don't know you

236
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,166
get to you.

237
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,966
To me, Ji-hoon, you're
the greatest baseball player,

238
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:49,476
and no matter what happens,
I will forever be your fan.

239
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,016
<i>So, no matter what people will say,</i>

240
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,246
I will forever be your fan.

241
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:59,116
Okay? So feel better.

242
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,156
You two look alike.

243
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:04,686
My brother and you.

244
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:22,576
<i>Episode 7:
Someone Who Gives Courage to Me</i>

245
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:26,846
- Hello.
- Hello.

246
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,316
Things are looking good today.

247
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:38,326
- Boss!
- Hey!

248
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,956
I told you not to call me that.

249
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,166
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,966
How many times do I have to tell you?

251
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:45,896
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,366
Let's see how much we've made tonight.

253
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,836
Choi Il-kwon?

254
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:57,646
You own this place?

255
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,876
You work really hard.

256
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:02,246
You're a teacher, and you own a bar?

257
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:06,286
Hey. Stop the nonsense.

258
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,156
Are you drunk?

259
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:10,586
Of course I am!

260
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:14,356
Hong Dae-young messed me up.

261
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:17,996
I don't know what it is,

262
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:20,112
but I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose.

263
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:24,206
He definitely did this on purpose!

264
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,106
I bet you were fooled too.

265
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:28,676
Me?

266
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:31,746
I haven't seen Dae-young in years.

267
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,476
You saw him. Go Woo-young.

268
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:35,286
What about Woo-young?

269
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:36,916
You idiot.

270
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:41,016
Go Woo-young is Hong Dae-young.

271
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:45,656
Hong Dae-young is Go Woo-young!

272
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,466
What's wrong with her?

273
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:53,396
Chu Ae-rin.

274
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,916
I don't really know how
I'm supposed to play with Seo-yeon.

275
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:09,615
Just talking like this is good too.

276
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:12,316
- Is that right?
- But the key is

277
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,186
to do something active.

278
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,386
How?

279
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:18,396
For example, you could tell her

280
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,125
that her wish will come true if
she can catch a petal in the air.

281
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,696
Just that, and she'll be running around.

282
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,596
She'll probably spend

283
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,866
half an hour at least, catching a petal.

284
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,536
I don't think it'll take that long.

285
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:34,106
Give it a try.
It's harder than you think.

286
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:39,116
- What?
- What?

287
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:40,646
See? I caught one in one try.

288
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:42,486
What's your wish?

289
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:47,156
My wish is...

290
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,926
Well,

291
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,026
it's a secret.

292
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:54,966
That's no fun.

293
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,296
Isn't that Ye Ji-hoon? No way!

294
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:02,666
- Right?
- Who's that woman with him?

295
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:04,266
Is he seeing someone?

296
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:06,676
No way.

297
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:10,706
Hold on.

298
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:30,896
They must be dating.

299
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,266
Are they gone?

300
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,136
Not yet.

301
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,236
<i>Hong Dae-young</i>

302
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,106
Ae-rin.

303
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:23,146
Why are you here?

304
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:25,116
To ask you

305
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,856
to not tell Da-jung.

306
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:29,826
Why should I not?

307
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,326
I'm her friend, not yours!

308
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:35,396
I'm asking you to do it for her.

309
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,096
For her?

310
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:41,136
How is any of this for Da-jung?

311
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,506
I can help her when she needs it.

312
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,676
After getting divorced and all?

313
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:49,846
You should've done better before.

314
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:56,986
I should have,

315
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,656
but I finally realized.

316
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,756
I said that I was busy all the
time so that I can come home late,

317
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:08,466
and was always drunk at home,
with the excuse being that I'm tired.

318
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,196
I missed it all.

319
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,736
The times my family really needed me.

320
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,236
I'm trying to be good now.

321
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,036
I stopped drinking too.

322
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:22,606
But

323
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,576
if she finds out that
I'm Hong Dae-young,

324
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,676
Da-jung will

325
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,786
certainly feel uncomfortable.

326
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,216
So, please, Ae-rin.

327
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,156
Please don't tell her.

328
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:44,226
All right. I'll think about it.

329
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:47,796
Thank you for understanding, Ae-rin.

330
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,506
I'm still thinking about it,
so don't thank me just yet.

331
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:11,056
Please keep it a secret.

332
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:12,826
He's trying his best.

333
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,926
Trying his best? As if.

334
00:21:14,996 --> 00:21:17,296
Don't you know Si-woo
started playing basketball?

335
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,366
I don't.

336
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,436
Why are you bringing
that up all of a sudden now?

337
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:24,406
Si-woo is great at basketball,
but he's just not confident,

338
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,720
so he acted as if he wasn't
interested in basketball to Dae-young.

339
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:29,476
But when he approached Si-woo
as his friend, Go Woo-young,

340
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:32,816
they've been practicing together
and decided to go for the tryout.

341
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:34,816
This shows how much he's trying.

342
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,716
Can't you understand

343
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:40,056
why Dae-young keeps lying?

344
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:43,256
So can you just
help him out too? Please?

345
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:44,726
Please?

346
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:46,426
Please.

347
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:49,096
Gosh, fine. Get off the elevator now.

348
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,896
That's a promise.

349
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,396
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

350
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:12,686
I had them with me.

351
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,196
Darn it!

352
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:31,506
I should be the only one to
go through such humiliation.

353
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:40,216
<i>Document approval</i>

354
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,216
Hey, Ae-rin.

355
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,377
Da-jung, I'll meet you in
front of your house tonight.

356
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:48,416
There's something you must know.

357
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:51,996
Okay. See you later.

358
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:03,890
Close the gate. Close it!

359
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:04,906
- Come here.
- No!

360
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,576
- No!
- Come on, sir.

361
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,606
- Can you let this slide just once?
- Please! Just this once.

362
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,546
- Please.
- Can you please let me go this once?

363
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,146
- Please, sir.
- Come on.

364
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:15,246
Hey, be quiet. Tell me
your classroom number.

365
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:17,716
- Just this once! Please.
- Can you please let me get in?

366
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:19,216
- No.
- Please.

367
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,516
- You can run the laps in the field.
- No. Please.

368
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:24,026
- Please, sir.
- Come on.

369
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:31,196
Finish your laps quickly
and get back in class!

370
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,366
- Why are you always late to school?
- Darn it.

371
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,066
I'm out of breath. Don't talk to me.

372
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:40,519
Yes, I can see that. Do you
want me to carry your bag?

373
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:42,076
Gosh, forget it.

374
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,206
Give me that.

375
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,716
What? You weren't late to school.

376
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,086
I'm volunteering.

377
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:50,822
You've been on time lately,
but not today.

378
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,116
Darn it. Stop teasing me.

379
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:53,216
I won't.

380
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:56,926
What are you doing?
Focus on your running!

381
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,026
Darn it.

382
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:01,856
If you're volunteering, carry mine too.

383
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,266
Gosh.

384
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:06,666
Hey.

385
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,136
Come on. Hey!

386
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,646
Gosh, that jerk.

387
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:21,635
Who wants to go to the snack bar?

388
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:23,286
- Me.
- I want to go.

389
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:24,446
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

390
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,786
Let's go.

391
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:41,896
Aren't you a hard-working volunteer?

392
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:43,666
Yes. Why don't you let that go?

393
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:45,736
Let me have this one.

394
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:47,706
Let you have this one?

395
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:58,186
What are you doing? It's my pencil case.

396
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:02,226
Gosh.

397
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:22,946
<i>Serim High School</i>

398
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:26,776
What are they watching?

399
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,786
Bo-bae, what are you watching?

400
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:33,456
Hey. Oh, this?

401
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:36,476
It looks like Si-woo and Woo-young
are trying out for the basketball team.

402
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:37,956
Si-woo?

403
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,496
<i>Go, Serim High. You can do it!</i>
Yes. I can see you guys have good basics.

404
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:46,336
The last part of your
test will be a 1-on-1 play.

405
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:47,816
Woo-young, you're up first.

406
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:50,206
<i>Let's go, Serim High Basketball Team!</i>

407
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:04,516
<i>Victory, Serim High School</i>

408
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,086
<i>Park Jung-min</i>

00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,816

<i>Go Woo-young is Hong Dae-young.</i>

412
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,696
Hong Dae-young is

413
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,996
Go Woo-young!

414
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:57,266
- He's so cool, isn't he?
- Yes.

415
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,516
Okay. Si-woo, it's your turn.

416
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,006
That was cool.

417
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:20,256
Well, yes. I will talk to your parents

418
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:23,056
this week. And if there
aren't any problems,

419
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:25,726
you'll join the team.

420
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:27,326
Guys, gather up in the center.

421
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,966
- Well done.
- I was so nervous.

422
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:36,466
You were great, Si-woo.

423
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,606
<i>Wisely, Beautifully, and Diligently</i>

424
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,006
Does the coach have
to talk to my parents?

425
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:14,376
Why is there a problem with that?

426
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:15,476
No.

427
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:18,376
The kids will recognize my mom.

428
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:21,616
And she might hear all those nasty
things they say when she comes to school.

429
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:25,446
And my dad is in Busan.

430
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:33,256
Oh, right. Should I ask
my grandpa to come?

431
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:35,866
- Your grandpa?
- Yes.

432
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:37,826
Come with me.

433
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:49,706
All right. Come on in.

434
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:51,846
All right.

435
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:56,116
You wait here.
Let me bring you some juice.

436
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:57,846
- I can do that, Grandpa.
- Sure.

437
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:29,616
Gosh.

438
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,886
You know, things can get a bit messy
when an old man lives by himself.

439
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:37,156
Give me a second.

440
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:44,596
- Here. Have some juice.
- Thank you.

441
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:48,466
So you also decided to
play basketball in the end

442
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,966
just like your father.

443
00:30:50,406 --> 00:30:52,206
If your grandmother heard the news,

444
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:55,436
she would have been
the happiest for you.

445
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:05,186
Your father was an
amazing basketball player.

446
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:08,586
That was the only thing
we could brag about him.

447
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:11,486
But other than basketball,
he didn't excel at anything.

448
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:12,756
And he never listened to us.

449
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,126
He was quite the troublemaker.

450
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,036
Si-woo, you can't take
after him in that way, okay?

451
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:27,076
Okay.

452
00:31:29,746 --> 00:31:30,806
Grandpa.

453
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:33,576
Can you come for a
parent-teacher conference?

454
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,146
It's necessary if I want to
join the basketball team.

455
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:37,326
Parent-teacher conference?

456
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:39,986
If an old man goes,

457
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:42,086
he wouldn't even understand
what they're saying.

458
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,262
I'm sure it's completely different
from when your dad played.

459
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:46,496
They called the parents
to ask them for money.

460
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:47,696
They asked you for money?

461
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:50,326
Did you ever give the coach money?

462
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,736
No. I never gave him any.

463
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,936
I knew that my son would
do good with his skills.

464
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,736
Parents need to trust their kids

465
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:02,476
and be confident so that
their kids can be confident too.

466
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,316
But why aren't you telling your mom and
dad about the parent-teacher conference?

467
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,616
Oh, it's because I thought
my mom would be busy,

468
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:14,956
and my dad is in Busan on business.

469
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:16,086
Busan?

470
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:20,026
He doesn't even know anyone there.

471
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:25,196
Si-woo, you should ask
your mom and dad first.

472
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:27,666
If they both can't make it,

473
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:30,406
I'll go in their place then.

474
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:32,066
Really?

475
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,176
Thank you, Grandpa.

476
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,516
Right. Goodness, you punk.

477
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:40,976
Thank you.

478
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,386
Si-woo.

479
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:51,986
Yes?

480
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:53,826
You should tell your mom

481
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,166
that you're playing basketball.

482
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:01,376
If she finds out you didn't tell her
because you were worried about her,

483
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,866
she'll be hurt.

484
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:06,106
That's how parents are.

485
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,936
They don't want to worry their children.

486
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:10,806
You're right.

487
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:14,476
Okay.

488
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:18,116
- Let's go.
- Okay.

489
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,516
Oh, Mom.

490
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:51,986
Hello, Aunt Ae-rin.

491
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:53,316
Hi.

492
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,406
I heard everything.

493
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:16,946
You...

494
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:26,886
I heard everything.

495
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,156
- You...
- Hold on.

496
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,156
I would like to

497
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:36,866
discuss that later by ourselves.

498
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:38,796
Even if you heard it all,

499
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,489
you should listen to
what I have to say...

500
00:34:40,566 --> 00:34:41,566
Why?

501
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:45,705
So... Even if you get angry,

502
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,356
you should hear me out first...

503
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:48,636
What are you talking about?

504
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:52,745
Should I be mad that you
play basketball with Si-woo?

505
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:54,846
Pardon?

506
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:58,786
Now that I think about it,

507
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,016
I'm a bit hurt.

508
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:07,056
Si-woo. Must I hear that you're
playing basketball from Aunt Ae-rin?

509
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:08,926
I'm sorry, Mom.

510
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:13,466
Are you coming back
from playing basketball?

511
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,366
Mom, I passed the try-outs
for the basketball team.

512
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:18,366
Oh, my. Really?

513
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:19,436
Yes.

514
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,706
That's incredible. I'm so proud of you!

515
00:35:22,776 --> 00:35:24,306
What do you want to eat?

516
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:25,676
I want kimchi fried rice.

517
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:26,713
Really?

518
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,046
I'll make it for you.

519
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:29,116
Okay.

520
00:35:33,886 --> 00:35:35,786
My son is amazing.

521
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:43,496
Did you think I told her everything?

522
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:46,936
I just felt guilty.

523
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:48,836
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

524
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:51,806
It's okay.

525
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,936
It's true that I went to tell her.

526
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:55,006
What?

527
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:56,376
But

528
00:35:58,506 --> 00:35:59,846
I couldn't tell her.

529
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:14,226
What do you think about Go Woo-young?

530
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:15,656
Woo-young?

531
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,026
Why are you asking about Deok-jin's son?

532
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:21,196
Answer me. What do you think about him?

533
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,676
Maybe it's because he
lived abroad long time,

534
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,346
he's a bit rude.

535
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,216
But overall, I think he's a nice kid.

536
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,216
What? Are you...

537
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,356
You should stop.

538
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:44,926
<i>He shows up when I'm
in danger and helps me.</i>

539
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:46,126
Be strong.

540
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:49,096
What?

541
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,126
It was hard to achieve your dream.

542
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,126
so you shouldn't get
hindered by things like this.

543
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,866
Don't worry about Si-ah and Si-woo,

544
00:36:58,406 --> 00:36:59,506
and focus on your work.

545
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,406
I'll take care of the kids at school.

546
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:05,576
<i>And he comforts me when I'm troubled.</i>

547
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,146
<i>This is a letter that Mr. Hong
asked me to give her.</i>

548
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:12,416
<i>He even gave me the
letter that Dae-young wrote.</i>

549
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:13,986
Hong Si-ah. Hong Si-ah!

550
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:15,286
I'm going to call 911.

551
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:16,596
What do you think you're doing?

552
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:18,684
It's faster to run to the
hospital right by the school!

553
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:20,056
<i>Woo-young was the one</i>

554
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:22,056
<i>who brought Si-ah to the emergency room</i>

555
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:23,726
when she was sick.

556
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,416
He was there when you needed someone.

557
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:30,806
What?

558
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,076
Woo-young.

559
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,236
He was there when you needed someone.

560
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:40,946
You're right. Now that I said it,

561
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,446
I'm very grateful to him.

562
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:46,616
You're right.

563
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:48,556
But you're acting weird.

564
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:50,626
Why did you ask about
Woo-young all of a sudden?

565
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:54,356
It's because...

566
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:56,096
Hey. No way.

567
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:58,666
Was that story about minor about you?

568
00:37:58,826 --> 00:37:59,836
Hey!

569
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,666
What do you take me for?

570
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:04,736
I heard that Woo-young

571
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,406
is playing basketball with Si-woo.

572
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,676
- Really?
- I knew it.

573
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,176
I knew you didn't know.

574
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,376
I heard the two of them
are busy preparing for

575
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:16,116
the basketball team try-outs.

576
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:20,316
I called you here because I
thought that I should tell you this.

577
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:23,486
What's more important
to you than your children?

578
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,226
I thought that

579
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:30,696
you might be right, and it would
be better if she didn't know the truth.

580
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:37,906
But let's make one thing clear.

581
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,136
Do you want to get back
together with Da-jung?

582
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:43,306
Gosh. How can I do that?

583
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:45,606
I'm going to school
with our kids right now.

584
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:49,946
I guess you still love her.

585
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:55,086
No.

586
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:58,256
I just

587
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,896
want to do everything

588
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:05,826
I couldn't do for her now.

589
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:12,236
Let's go.

590
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:21,316
How did you get younger?

591
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:22,746
Let me know your secret.

592
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:25,546
I don't know how this happened.

593
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,486
You don't know? Gosh!

594
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,986
I want to get younger
too. That's disappointing.

595
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,926
You look exactly like you did back then.

596
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:35,396
You're just saying that to be nice.

597
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:38,866
No. If you put on a school uniform,
you'd look like you did in high school.

598
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:42,096
Gosh. You know how
to have a good social life.

599
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,536
It's true.

600
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,006
Forget it. Goodness.

601
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:53,446
<i>Lee Chul-young,
Chu Ae-rin, Choi Min-jung</i>

602
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:57,046
<i>Chu Ae-rin</i>

603
00:39:57,446 --> 00:40:00,656
She looks just like she did back then.

604
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:03,756
<i>Class 3-5</i>

605
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:12,296

606
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:16,415
<i>Go Woo-young is Hong Dae-young.</i>

607
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:18,566
<i>Hong Dae-young is</i>

608
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:20,936
<i>Go Woo-young!</i>

609
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:23,546
<i>Hong Dae-young</i>

610
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:37,356
Da-jung! Come in.

611
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:50,106
Why are you just
standing there? Come in.

612
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:05,686
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:10,086
I'm sorry I took so long.

614
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:14,356
What are you doing? Have a seat.

615
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:25,266
These three are college
varsity team coaches.

616
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:28,276
Hello.

617
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:32,506
Why are you being so awkward?

618
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:35,316
This is all for Si-woo.

619
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:38,216
I don't introduce them to other
parents even when they plead.

620
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:41,386
You're getting some
real special treatment.

621
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:43,426
Sure.

622
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:45,656
I told you.

623
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:47,855
She's Hong Si-woo's mother,
the kid who just joined this term.

624
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:49,926
She's Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

625
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:52,126
You all know her from the news, right?

626
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:53,596
The water bomb.

627
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,066
Yes, the water bomb! I saw that!

628
00:41:56,136 --> 00:41:57,736
I watched it multiple times.

629
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,606
Her body is quite amazing.

630
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,406
I really enjoyed watching that.

631
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,076
Sure.

632
00:42:05,446 --> 00:42:09,146
You really had children with that body?

633
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:13,216
Your waist tells me otherwise.

634
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:14,316
Right?

635
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:17,026
Why don't we all
toast to start the night?

636
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:21,926
I've never had an anchorwoman
pour me a drink before.

637
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:23,826
Please pour me a nice glass.

638
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:25,096
I'm sorry,

639
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:28,236
but I'm here as Si-woo's mother.

640
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:30,906
I'm not here to pour anyone drinks.

641
00:42:31,136 --> 00:42:33,306
Please do not cross the line.

642
00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:39,276
- Not cross the line?
- I didn't know,

643
00:42:40,576 --> 00:42:42,046
but she's quite tactless.

644
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:45,016
Whatever. Don't even bother.

645
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:47,986
Il-kwon, we'll give you two some space.

646
00:42:48,156 --> 00:42:51,526
Have a great parent-teacher conference.

647
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:52,756
Let's go.

648
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:54,756
Coach Jung, come on.

649
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:56,896
Let's just enjoy the night.

650
00:42:57,396 --> 00:43:00,296
Da-jung, apologize to them already.

651
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:06,266
I'm sorry.

652
00:43:07,076 --> 00:43:08,576
I'll get going first.

653
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:11,306
Next time, why don't we
meet somewhere else?

654
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:13,516
Wait.

655
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:15,516
Da-jung!

656
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:18,246
Hold on.

657
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,356
I'm going to report you
to the police right now.

658
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:30,966
You really don't know
much about sports, do you?

659
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,866
It was like this when I was
a player. It was even worse.

660
00:43:33,936 --> 00:43:36,606
It will all come back to your
son if you keep acting like this.

661
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,006
Okay.

662
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,976
I'll wrap it up here tonight.

663
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:47,176
Here.

664
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:50,086
Send me the money to that account.

665
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:52,646
Why should I?

666
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,716
Come on! Don't be so stiff!

667
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:57,656
You have to pay if you
want Si-woo to play games.

668
00:43:57,726 --> 00:44:00,356
Choi Il-kwon! Is this how
you've been coaching kids?

669
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:02,326
It's not just me.

670
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,096
It's not like I'm desperate.

671
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:07,166
This night was organized
for Si-woo, but you ruined it.

672
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:08,766
And if you don't send the money,

673
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:11,506
you're putting an end
to his basketball career.

674
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:16,136
Da-jung, isn't it a priority
to have Si-woo succeed?

675
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:19,106
Are you really going to let mere money

676
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:20,846
get in the way of Si-woo's dream?

677
00:44:20,946 --> 00:44:22,246
You're his mother.

678
00:44:35,996 --> 00:44:38,426
<i>Hong Dae-young</i>

679
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:49,336
I'm helping you for the
last time, Dae-young.

680
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:54,046
Why would Il-kwon hold a
parent-teacher meeting here?

681
00:44:58,186 --> 00:44:59,916
Hey!

682
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:01,086
Stop the music.

683
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,026
I need to talk to him, girls.
Step out  moment.

684
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:08,096
Come on.

685
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:11,426
You're so late. Do you
know what time it is?

686
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:13,866
Aren't you dating Ms. Ok?

687
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:15,536
I am.

688
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:21,376
I think it's been about a month.

689
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:23,706
And you're here, with women?

690
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,076
This is just me doing my business.

691
00:45:27,176 --> 00:45:29,846
Why can't you separate
business from personal life?

692
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,275
Are you going to be like
this when you get married?

693
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:34,016
Are you insane?

694
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:36,256
Why would I get married?

695
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:39,286
People become nothing
when they have kids.

696
00:45:40,926 --> 00:45:43,156
I've seen enough parents to testify.

697
00:45:43,226 --> 00:45:45,426
"Coach, please let my son play"

698
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:47,636
"the next game."

699
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:51,406
"Coach, please help my
son get into a university."

700
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:52,406
Seriously.

701
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:53,876
I'm not going to live like that.

702
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:57,106
I'm not letting everyone step
over me just because of a kid.

703
00:45:58,146 --> 00:45:59,406
Goodness.

704
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:04,935

707
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:18,896
I did. I paid 2,000 won for my Coke.

708
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:21,496

709
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:23,836
Forget it.

710
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,406
Whatever.

711
00:46:27,106 --> 00:46:28,952
Just send money to these people.

so that your son can play a game.

715
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:38,786
Understood?

716
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:41,556
I understand.

your son play basketball?

720
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:52,826

should that be my fault?

725
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:09,176

727
00:47:15,956 --> 00:47:17,856

729
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:21,726

730
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:24,266
Yes, I did. My mind sure did.

731
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:27,636
Choi Il-kwon called me to a bar
to have a "parent-teacher meeting",

732
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:30,436
and he was drinking with women!

733
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:31,566
What?

734
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:35,736
Not only that,
he gave me the bill to pay

735
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:37,676
and told me to send
money to some people.

736
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:39,006
He's like that.

737
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:41,116

739
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:47,486
I thought he really cleaned his
acts up when he became a teacher.

740
00:47:47,556 --> 00:47:48,986
He did.

741
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:50,556
He cleaned himself up so well,

742
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:52,626

743

744

750

751

I was wondering how
your mom's meeting went.

752
