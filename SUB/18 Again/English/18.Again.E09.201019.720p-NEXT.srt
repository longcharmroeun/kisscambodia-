Yes.

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,290
Wasn't Si-woo amazing today?

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,100
He's improving day by day.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,370
I see.

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,770
Right. Congratulations
on winning the game today.

15
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,880

- I'm done.

I tied it twice,

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,630
so it doesn't get loose.

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,680
I heard when your shoelace comes undone,

21
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,410
it means you have met the one.

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,880

I'm glad that you got to watch
Si-woo's last game of his life.

32

What do you mean?

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,850
I thought the team advanced
to the next round.

34
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,220
My team did advance to the next round,

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,650
but players like Si-woo will
only play these preliminary games.

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,320
Players who have shown me gratitude
ought to play in important games.

How could you?

38
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,790
Aren't you ashamed to face
your hardworking players?

39
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,300
Gosh.

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,270
Anyway, before I decide on my lineup
for the next game,

we have nothing to discuss.

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
If you change your mind,

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
call me.

No. I'll call him myself.

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,659
Don't get your hopes up.

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,400
If the starting lineup changes, I might
not be able to play in the main game.

80
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,000
What?
Why would the starting lineup change?

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,070
I don't know.

82
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,840

sending your kids to the finals.

83
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,810
Gosh, high school finals isn't
something to congratulate me about.

84
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,820
I'm going to move up
to the college league next year,

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,320
so I'm not really that impressed.

86
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,590
Oh, right.

87
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,090
They decided on someone else
for that position.

88
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,930
Wait.

89
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,660
What?

90
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,730
We had no choice.

91
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,140
You're not upset, right?

92
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,470
Why would I be?

93
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,480
If a position at Hankuk University
opens up, I'll make you coach.

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,050
Just stay in the high school league
until then.

95
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
That's right. Okay?

96
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,350
Okay.

97
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,820
Oh, Mr. Bang. You're finally here.

98
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,590
Right. Come over here.

99
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,190
They are the coaches
at Hankuk University.

100
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,100
They're going to help Gi-yong a lot
when he goes to college,

101
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,860
so I thought it'd be nice
for you to meet them.

102
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, I see. Hello.

103
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,470
Hello. We heard a lot about Gi-yong.

104
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,200
Right. Thank you.

105
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,010
- Please take good care of him.
- But

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,280
it's too late tonight.

107
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,210
It's too bad, but let's make plans
to meet another time.

108
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,620
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Bang.

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,690
Mr. Bang.

110
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,990
We enjoyed our drinks today and
you don't need to worry about Gi-yong.

111
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,190
Understand?

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,960
Thank you. Goodness.

113
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,180
Hey.

114
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,080
Next time, be sure to secure me a spot.

115
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,620
Of course.
We'll make sure of it for next time.

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,620
- Right.
- Do me the favor.

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,890

- I'm serious.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,070

128
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,130
So what?

129
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,130
Isn't making a living teaching basketball,
the sport you love, enough for you?

130
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,330
Why are you trying to make money
off of the kids?

131
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,370
The sport I love?

132
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,000
Who?

133
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,400
Me?

134
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,270
All throughout high school and college,
I gave tens of thousands to my coaches

135
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,039
for a chance to play a game,

136
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,409
but I was always on edge worried
that I would get kicked out.

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,750
If you know that feeling,
that's more of a reason not to do this.

138
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,620
Why are you trying to live like them?

139
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,350
Hey. Shouldn't I get to reap
as much as I sowed,

140
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,490
<i>you jerk?</i>

141
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,760
Even though I lived my life
getting money to have kids play,

142
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,990
don't you think
I'm living better than you?

143
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,230
<i>How dare someone as foolish as you
try to lecture me?</i>

144
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,230

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,810
Are you Gi-yong's father?

147
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,950
Who are you?

148
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm Si-woo's mom. I called you before.

149
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,890
You said you were busy,
so I came to you.

150
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,960
We'll take care of our son,
so don't worry about us.

151
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,040
<i>I want to gather the basketball team's
parents on Saturday night and talk,</i>

152
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,510
<i>can you come?</i>

153
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,302
<i>Beef entrails, pork galbi, pork belly</i>

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,580
<i>I can go, but will everyone come?</i>

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,180
<i>Don't worry.</i>

156
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,050
<i>There's a way for everything.</i>

157
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,790
What are you guys doing with my phone?

158
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,490
Accomplice. You have to include
the world "accomplice".

159
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,530
Next, "lawsuit".

160
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,330
"File a lawsuit".

161
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,770
I sent it.

162
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,210
<i>I'm Go Deok-jin, father of Go Woo-young,

168

<i>Then I will see you all on Saturday
night at 8 p.m. in the gymnasium.</i>

169
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,570
- I know.
- Seriously.

170
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,300
<i>- I won't go. I refuse to go!</i>
- What's going on?

171
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,500
Why should I go to the parent meeting?

172
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,570
I'm asking you for this favor.

173
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
In return, I'll clean the house,
do the laundry,

174
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,210
cook, and wash the dishes.

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
Those are all things that
you're supposed to do anyway.

176
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,510
Right. Of course I should do that.

177
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,850
Is he really a parent?

178
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,150
Is his son a maid?

179
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,820
Then I'll give you more money
for my living expenses.

180
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,850
Hey.

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,020
Has he been giving you money too?

182
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,160
Of course.

183
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,560
Should I let him live with me for free?
Am I a philanthropist?

184
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,630
My gosh.

185
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,630
He takes money from
a high school student.

186
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,360
Regardless, I can't help you.

187
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,530
Hey!

188
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
She's helping me, so why won't you?

189
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,170
Honestly, she has no reason to help me.

190
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,340
But you have to help me.

191
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,510
Why should I?

192
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,880
You're my dad! Darn it!

193
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,180
You punk. You only call me
Dad when you need something.

194
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,420
Do you see me as a pushover, you jerk?

195
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,080
I asked to act like my dad,
so why are you cursing at me?

196
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,120
That's what I'm saying. Why must I
act like your dad, you punk.

197
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,020
Darn it. Have you ever acted
like a proper dad to me?

198
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,160
I pay for living expenses.

199
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,490
Really, you jerk?
Pay for the water bill then, you punk.

200
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,030
Pay for my property tax too, you jerk.

201
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,630
Gosh, darn it.
I don't have money for that.

202
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,200
Do you even know
when to pay property tax?

203
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,400
- What?
- It's around this time.

204
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,140
Then put it under my name,
I'll pay for it then.

205
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,970
Both of them aren't normal.

206
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,110
- That woman is strange too.
<i>- Are you serious, you jerk?</i>

207
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,640
- Let's go. Hurry.
- Goodness.

208
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,680
I refuse to go.

209
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,950
My gosh. I'm so busy,
why did he call us here?

210
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,920
- What does he want?
- I don't have time for this.

211
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,550
- My gosh.
- Why would he ask us to come?

212
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,590
What a waste of time.

213
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,090
What is this?

214
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,030
What kind of punk is he?

215
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,200
- Why did he call us here?
- Why would he ask us to come?

216
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,600
Thank you for taking time from your busy
schedules to come here.

217
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,700
I refuse to go!

218
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,770
I'm going to call Ms. Ok
to the meeting too.

219
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,740
- Ms. Ok?
- Yes.

220
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,040
She thinks a lot about the students.

221
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,080
But imagine what would happen
if you lead the parents

222
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,280
to resolve this issue.

223
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,050
She wouldn't be able to help
but fall in love.

224
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,250
Really?

225
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,130
Thank you for coming.

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,060
Of course I should be here.

227
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
The reason I gathered all of you here

228
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,770
is so that we can get rid of
Coach Choi Il-kwon.

229
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,670
- That's enough.
- My gosh.

230
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,240
18 years ago, I was also a known member

231
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,280
of Serim High School's basketball team.

232
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,410
My son learned how to play basketball
from me, so he's a great player.

233
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,220
Really?

234
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,650
Yes.

235
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,660
To be honest, there was a coach

236
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,630
who asked for money 18 years ago too.

237
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,770
However, my parents
didn't give him money.

238
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,300
Why?

239
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,370
Because they believed in me.

240
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,140
That's the reason why I can stand here
without shame

241
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,910
in front of all of you today.

242
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,980
Excuse me.

243
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,280
What does that have to do
with Coach Choi Il-kwon?

244
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,880
My fellow alumnus, Choi Il-kwon,
wasn't always such a bad guy.

245
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,050
But

246
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,490
do you know when he started
acting this way?

247
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,120
<i>Choi Il-kwon</i>

248
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,030
Did you get it ready?

249
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,090
<i>Serim High School</i>

250
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,530
There won't be a problem with
the starting lineup, right?

251
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,700
Of course not.

252
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,410
<i>Choi Il-kwon</i>

253
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,720
Go Deok-jin, listen carefully.

254
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,020
If you tell anyone about what you saw,
I won't leave you alone.

255
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,890
Okay. I won't tell anyone that your dad
gave the coach money.

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Shut your mouth!

257
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,190
<i>Choi Il-kwon</i>

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
<i>After that day, Choi Il-kwon</i>

259
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,430
took money from me,

260
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,670
and he started hitting me.

261
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,400
I thought he came to his senses
when he became a teacher,

262
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,470
but he's still taking money from people.

263
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,510
Just like what that coach
did 18 years ago

264
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,540
to Choi Il-kwon's father.

265
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,810
But he's doing that to us.

266
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,210
Are we going to raise

267
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,420
our children to become a bad adult like
Choi Il-kwon?

268
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,620
- Really?
- Gosh, he's a really bad guy.

269
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,660
- This seems true.
- He has a point.

270
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,460
I'm against it.

271
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,430
If we testify,

272
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,460
we're all going to be punished.

273
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
That's right.

274
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,370
It'll forever haunt our kids as well.

275
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,400
Why should we ruin
our children's future?

276
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,270
- He's right.
- We can't do that.

277
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,910
- We can't do that.
- Absolutely not.

278
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,440
I can't do that to my kid.

279
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,840
That's terrible.

280
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,590
Can any of you stand tall
in front of your kids?

281
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,720
Has anyone

282
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,690
told their kid that they've been paying
the coach

283
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,260
so that they can go to college?

284
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,660
<i>Let's go, Serim High Basketball Team!</i>

285
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,570
We may not be

286
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,310
parents who make their kids proud,

287
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,270
but that doesn't mean we should be
such shameful parents.

288
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
I'm

289
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,380
so embarrassed of you.

290
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,350
Basketball is a dream
to all of our kids.

291
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,990
If they found out that their dreams
came true by going against the law,

292
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,260
how do you think they'd feel?

293
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,100
More than being disappointed
in their parents,

294
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,700
they're more likely to place blame
on themselves.

295
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,100
They may blame themselves

296
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,640
for being not good enough

297
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,670
that their parents
had to commit a crime.

298
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,380
But we have an important game coming up!

299
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
We can't let this issue get big.

300
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,180
You're right. If the Ministry of Education
starts looking into this,

301
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,120
it's going to take a long time.

302
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,450
Are you giving up on the games?

303
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
You can't do that!

304
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,050
- We can't do that.
- Absolutely not.

305
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,190
Exactly.

306
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,390
Come on.

307
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,660
What about this?

308
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,590
According to my research,

309
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,300
Mr. Choi runs a bar.

310
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,130
- What?
- Is he insane?

311
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,470
- My goodness.
- Unbelievable.

312
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,870
I'll report him
to a current affairs program.

313
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,370
If this snowballs,

314
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,970
they might expedite the investigation.

315
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,660
Thanks for the documents.

316
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,089
Mr. Nam, please have a look at this.

317
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,890
<i>Financial Transaction Records</i>

318
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,930
<i>Recipient: Choi Il-kwon</i>

319
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,200
Is this true?

320
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,500
Do you think this can be evidence?

321
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,440
This is enough for us
to start investigating right away.

322
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,410
Who are you? Please leave.

323
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,780
I'm Anchor Nam Gi-tae
of "On the Site, 25 Hours".

324
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,520
You're Coach Jung, right?

325
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes. What brings you here?

326
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,520
There was a report
that you've been taking

327
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,190
bribes to admit students
to Hankuk University.

328
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,460
Could we interview you?

329
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,590
I've never done such a thing.

330
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,700
Sir, you know this is
very important, right?

331
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,030
I've never done such a thing!
What are you talking about?

332
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,430
Turn the camera off and leave.

333
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,940
Please calm down.

334
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,870
I'm almost there.

335
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,580
Why did the police come?

336
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,010
<i>I have no idea.</i>

337
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,650
<i>Just get here quickly!</i>

338
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,850
All right. See you soon. Bye.

- Yes?
<i>- You!</i>

340
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,920
What have you been doing?

341
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,330
What's wrong?

342
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,790
JBC came to my school to investigate

343
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,300
on corrupt admissions.

344
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,000
What? JBC?

345
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,680
Da-jung, as you said, this bar belongs
to Choi Il-kwon.

346
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,280
The part-timer here confirmed it.

347
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,220
Darn it, Jung Da-jung!

348
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,520

350
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,260
<i>I'm giving you your last chance.</i>

351
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,430
Last chance? All right.

352
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,430
That's what I'm giving you.

353
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,860
How dare...

354
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,910
I'm not recording you.

355
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,890
All right. Let's hear it.

356
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,120
What last chance are you giving me?

357
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,460
Your part-timer

358
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,590
has testified for us.

359
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,790
You're going to get a search and seizure
of your bar

360
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,560
for illegal operation of it.

361
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,630
That will then expose you

362
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,030
of taking bribes from parents

363
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,270
and paying the college coaches.

364
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,040
Turn yourself in before it's too late.

365
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,640
You're really trying hard.

366
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,250
But you know,

367
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,280
the bar is owned by my brother.

368
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,250
Even if you report me, you can't get me.

369
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
That's too bad.

370
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,290
It'll be possible

371
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,190
if the parents testify.

372
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,930
Are you serious?

373
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,030
I'm letting their untalented kids
play basketball.

374
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,700
Who'd turn their backs
on such a great teacher?

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,870
You call yourself a teacher
when you take bribes

376
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,710
to have kids play at games
and go to college?

377
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,140
When did I ever promise that?

378
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,880
- What?
- They don't believe in their kids,

379
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,850
so they just keep coming to me.

380
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,910
That's why I took some money

381
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,880
and consoled them,
saying their kids can go to college.

382
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,250
They were probably happy

383
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,790
just imagining their kids in college.

384
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,220
They got their money's worth, then, no?

385
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,690
How can someone like you be a teacher?

386
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,630
How dare you try to teach a teacher?

387
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,660
I'm telling you.

388
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,300
I'm not going to go down alone.

389
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,130
If something bad happens to me,

390
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm going to say that I got money
from you as well.

391
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,810
You think you'll be able to
keep your job as an anchorwoman?

392
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,070
I have

393
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,780
never paid you anything.

394
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,050
Is that right? Let's see.

395
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,120
Maybe I can say that
I got something else.

396
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,550
Choi Il-kwon.

397
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,160
You missed your last chance.

398
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,360
You're so annoying.

399
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,830
Who are you to give me a chance?

400
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,440
Who are you to give me a chance?

401
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,220
Who's that?

402
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,090
Seriously?

403
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,790
Why are you here?

404
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,930
To send a corrupt teacher to jail.

405
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,230
Maybe I didn't beat you up enough
when you were young.

406
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
How haven't you changed
in all these years?

407
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,930
Il-kwon, when are you going to grow up?

408
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,440
What are you doing?

409
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,840
You!

410
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,810
Stop it!

411
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,880
Look at that.

412
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,990
Hey.

413
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,730
Your arm is going to break.
Get it out of my way.

414
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,700
Who do you think you are?

415
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,400
You are nothing.

416
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,230
Stop it!

417
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,710
How long have you been there for?

418
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,980
I'm going to be

419
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,880
testifying.

420
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,450
What you've heard up to now is

421
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,350
all a misunderstanding.

422
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,960
These two keep messing
with the basketball team,

423
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,390
so I just made things up to scare them.

424
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,360
Right. You know that I've talked Ja-sung
into Hankuk University, right?

425
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,930
You need to get Ja-sung
into Hankuk University.

426
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,100
University?
You don't even deserve to be a teacher.

427
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
What did you just say?

428
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,170
I guess

429
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,280
I'll just let Ki-woong take
Ja-sung's spot.

430
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,980
I'm also going to testify!

431
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,420
What?

432
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,550
I'm joining in!

433
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,950
- Me too.
- Myself as well!

434
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,520
- I'm going to testify.
- Me too.

435
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,750
Me too.

436
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,400
My gosh. Why are you all here?

437
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,770
I'll report him
to a current affairs program.

438
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,410
If this snowballs,

439
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,880
they might expedite the investigation.

440
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,810
But do you think reporting him
to a TV station will

441
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,280
solve this problem?

442
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,880
We can solve it

443
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,220
as long as

444
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,680
everyone

445
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,290
testifies.

446
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,660
But I'm not sure

447
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,560
with whom I should side with.

448
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,290
To be frank, I can't believe
everything you say either.

449
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,430
Then,

450
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,100
I'll show you what kind of man

451
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,670
Choi Il-kwon is.

452
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,350
Please hear me out.
I can explain everything.

453
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,080
I have kept all the receipts
of the drinks I paid for you.

454
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,750
No. You just wanted
to buy those drinks for us.

455
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,950
Well,

456
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,360
Ja-sung's spot at Hankuk University

457
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,620
will be Gi-yong's now.

458
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,460
You'd better think carefully about it.

459
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,360
He won't go!

460
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,430
I'm going to make sure

461
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,370
to lock you up with those coaches
from Hankuk University.

462
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,340
Darn it!

463
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,310
Do you think people will believe you?

464
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,370
I'm going to

465
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,610
sue all of you for defamation.

466
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,910
And

467
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,280
your sons won't be able to play
basketball for the rest of their lives.

468
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,780
- A lunatic.
- What a jerk!

469
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,390
- How could he say that?
- He's unbelievable.

470
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,650
What? "Lunatic"?

471
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,160
Hey.

472
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,460
I really want to punch you right now,
but I'm trying very hard not to.

473
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,560
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

474
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,370
I'm sure you know it's over for you.

475
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,670
Come to your senses
and admit to your crimes.

476
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,200
Admit to my crimes?

477
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,740
How dare you treat me, a teacher,
like some kind of criminal?

478
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,880
- Gosh.
- What?

479
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,750
Hey! Gosh.

480
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,020

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,540
<i>Choi violated</i>

533
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,070
<i>the Public Officials Act and encouraged
bribes for college admission.</i>

534
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,540
<i>He demanded money from the parents
for a spot in the lineup</i>

535
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,780
<i>and forced them to pay
for his entertainment expenses.</i>

536
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,680
What's more shocking is

537
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,020
that he assaulted a parent.

538
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,380
<i>Assaulted parent</i>
<i>That jerk...</i>

539
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,650
<i>I mean I heard that she was watching.</i>

540
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,590
<i>Gosh, had he not lied...</i>

541
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,190
<i>As you can see, the assaulted parent</i>

542
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,560
<i>made no sense with his statement
and seemed very shocked.</i>

543
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,660
Who is that?

544
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,000
<i>- Is it swollen?</i>
- I don't know. Who is it?

545
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,700
Gosh, what on earth is happening?

546
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,870
<i>Choi, the high school coach,</i>

547
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,670
<i>two coaches at Hankuk University,
Jung and Lim,</i>

548
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,180
<i>were sentenced to serve time in prison
for taking bribes</i>

549
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,480
<i>and will be detained.</i>

550
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,110
<i>The Basketball Association announced
of using this incident to launch</i>

551
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,620
<i>an investigation at every high school</i>

552
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,820
<i>in Korea to make sure there is
no foul play for college admission.</i>

553
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,250
As 13 parents complied
and paid the bribe,

554
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,390
due to their wrong decision,
they were put on probation.

555
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,830
But I would like to sincerely
offer my gratitude

556
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,360
for courageously telling the truth.

557
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,600
<i>I'm Nam Gi-tae
of "On the Site, 25 Hours".</i>

558
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:33,499
<i>File a report to
for college admission corruption.</i>

559
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,220
I knew

560
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,120
you would cause trouble one day.

561
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,190
You always disappointed me.

562
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,390
And you still do.

563
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,700
Have you

564
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,570
ever believed in me?

565
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,740
What?

566
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,140
Have you ever

567
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,440
sided with me?

568
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,050
If you have ever made me proud,

569
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,620
I would have!

570
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,160
Do you know how much mopey
I invested in you?

571
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,890
But you ended up
as a lowly high school coach?

572
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,460
You're pathetic.

573
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,970
Gosh. You're pathetic.

574
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,340
Do you know how much money
I invested in you?

575
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,410
I wanted you

576
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,480
- to succeed.
- But I didn't!

577
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,250
Okay?

578
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,720
I didn't succeed.
Why do you think I'm here?

579
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,850
How

580
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,090
do you think I ended up here?

581
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,630
You're a failure.

582
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,500
<i>Keep silence</i>

583
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,910
Due to the distasteful incident,

584
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,780
we have caused a lot of pain

585
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,050
on both the students and the parents.

586
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,120
As the principal, I would like to deeply
apologize for the wrongdoing.

587
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,920
I promise to do my best

588
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,590
to bring a healthy change
to our basketball team from now on.

589
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,930
On that note,
I'd like to introduce a new coach

590
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,330
and a parent representative
who will help bring that change.

591
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,840
This is the statement from the parents.

592
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,780
It's basically saying they won't give
you any money even if you ask.

593
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,580
Okay. Please don't worry.

594
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,080
- Okay. I look forward to working with you.
- I'll do my best.

595
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,550
That's all.

596
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,450
Thank you.

597
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,050
Are you all right?

598
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,360
You were interrogated by the police.
So the people at the company...

599
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,060
My company is strong.
It won't crumble because of that.

600
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,930
Don't worry about me.

601
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,970
Now, you have to do this on your own.

602
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,200
Okay.

603
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Mom.

604
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,650
Thank you.

605
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,520
- I hope we can work well together.
- Okay. Bye.

606
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,620
Bye.

607
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,190
I'm not even his real parent.
Why am I the representative?

608
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,500
Darn it.

609
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,900
Mr. Go.

610
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,070
Ms. Ok. When did you get here?

611
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,240
From the beginning.

612
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,370
You were very cool today.

613
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,740
"Cool"?

614
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,810
I know that you worked very hard
to solve this problem.

615
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,310
It's late,

616
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,520
but I still wanted to thank you.

617
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,250
And thank you for today as well.

618
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,390
See you around.

619
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,890
She'll see me around?

620
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,100
Ms. Ok.

621
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,160
Would you like to have coffee next time?

622
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,390
Okay.

623
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
Hong Si-woo.

624
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,120
I want to apologize for everything

625
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,889
that I did to you.

626
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,120
The fact that you saw me
get hit by my dad

627
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,760
hurt my pride.

628
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,830
It wasn't your fault,

629
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,630
but I

630
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,040
let my anger out on you.

631
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,870
I'm really sorry.

632
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,050
Wait.

633
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,220
- Jin-cheol?
- Da-jung.

634
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,860
<i>Seongjong Electronics Service Center</i>

635
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,790
Have you been well?

636
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,530
Is Young-jun growing up well?

637
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,830
<i>Seongjong Electronics Service Center</i>
Yes, of course he is.

638
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,540
You used to send us gifts
through Dae-young.

639
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,040
We received so much from you,

640
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,740
but we didn't do anything in return.

641
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,440
No, it's fine.

642
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,850
I wonder if Dae-young is doing well.

643
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,950
He must be so upset after getting fired
from the company.

644
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,950
Pardon?

645
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,620
He was fired from the company?

646
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,760
You didn't know?

647
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,960
Dae-young didn't get the promotion
that he was waiting for,

648
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,600
and he got transferred to Busan.

649
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,100
He went to the head of the center
to complain about it...

650
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,900
I'm only holding back

651
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,300
for my family.

652
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,880
Family?

653
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,150
How pathetic for a woman and a child

654
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,350
to depend on a man like that?

655
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,220
They're obviously failures in life.

656
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,990
You!

657
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,660
I am quitting today!

658
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,730
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

659
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,760
What kind of man

660
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,670
can stay quiet when someone
curses their family?

661
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,000
He hit the head of the center,
and as of that day,

662
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,500
<i>Seongjong Electronics Service Center</i>
he was fired from the company.

663
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,620
Here. Eat up.

664
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,590
Since when did you
like things like this?

665
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,400
You liked toast.

666
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,170
You remember.

667
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,330
But as I got older,

668
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,740
my palate changed.

669
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Really?

670
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,640
What do you like now?

671
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,570
I still like toast,

672
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,440
but I enjoy sundaeguk too.

673
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,710
Just like you.

674
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,280
I guess you're old now.

675
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,330
Of course.

676
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,230
But today, I feel like I'm young again.

677
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,870
I got to come here
and have this with you.

678
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,600
Si-ah likes this, so I had it often.

679
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,470
Okay. Let's eat.

680
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Okay.

681
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,450
Gosh. This is dry cleaning only.

682
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,690
It's like I'm raising two kids.

683
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,760
Come here.

684
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,530
Your mom used to say that all the time.

685
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,330
Mom too?

686
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,740
Da-jung used to nag and say
she was raising three kids.

687
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
When I think about Da-jung,

688
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,740
I still feel sorry for her.

689
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,840
She was so young,

690
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,810
but she was busy raising the kids
and working.

691
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,150
I'm sure it was a lot to handle,

692
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,310
but up until now,

693
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,980
Da-jung took care of me often.

694
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,890
Father. Does it taste okay?

695
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,130
Why did you make so much?

696
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,600
I put in plenty of side dishes
in the fridge,

697
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,330
so don't skip any meals.

698
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,270
As for the beef bone broth,
heat it up in the pan

699
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,810
and add some scallions on top.

700
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,410
All right.

701
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,680
Father. Don't forget to check
your blood pressure every day.

702
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,510
- Okay.
- Also,

703
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,250
I wrote the instructions
in bigger handwriting for you.

704
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,690
<i>How to use the blood pressure machine</i>

705
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,290
I set the temperature, so it's warm.

706
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,400
You'll be comfortable
when you sleep now.

707
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,660
Why did you buy this for me?

708
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,830
Goodness.

709
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,040
Da-jung took really good care of me.

710
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,440
She

711
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,410
went through a lot because of me.

712
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,840
How is work these days?

713
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,980
It's good.

714
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,620
Take care of your health as you work.

715
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,990
Thank you for worrying about me.

716
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,090
You should take care of your health
as you practice.

717
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Okay.

718
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,830
Mom.

719
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,200
Oh, Si-ah.

720
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,430
Are you just getting home?

721
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,800
Yes. What about you?

722
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,700
I'm going to meet Si-woo.

723
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,010
Gosh, I don't want to go to school.

724
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,270
What is it this time?

725
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,540
It's the festival.

726
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,580
It's so loud, and it's just a formality.

727
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,150
Why? When you look back,
it will be a good memory.

728
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,020
He's right. When you look back,
it will be a good memory.

729
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,020
Did you have a good memory
of the festival?

730
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
A good memory?

731
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,810
What kind of memory was it?

732
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,870
What?

733
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,540
You know.

734
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,550
It was loud and just a formality.

735
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,490
Now that I think about it,
festivals aren't that great.

736
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,060
Gosh. I knew it.

737
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,800
<i>Festival preparations, Photo exhibit,
Outdoor stage setup, Clean the gym</i>

738
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,430
- You know the festival is coming up?
- Yes.

739
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,170
Take a look at what's written

740
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,100
and raise your hand for the thing
you want to do.

741
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,000
Who wants to help prepare
for the photo exhibit?

742
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,110
Three people?

743
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,410
The basketball team cleaned up
the entire gym yesterday.

744
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,310
Cleaning the gym is the easiest.

745
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,980
Forget it. Stop.

746
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,750
Me too!

747
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,160
Okay, then Woo-young can also join
in preparing for the photo exhibit.

748
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,360
Then grab the photo albums
and move to the music room.

749
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

750
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,730
I...

751
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,770
Next up. Who wants to help set up
the outdoor stage?

752
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Anyone else?

753
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,200
- Gosh.
- The remaining kids will clean.

754
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,640
Done.

757
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,000
Are you okay?

758
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,400
Gosh. I'm okay.

759
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,400
You're not okay.

760
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,470
Goodness. That's going to bruise.

761
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Let's take a look.

762
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,450
Don't touch her.

763
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,350
Why? Am I not allowed to touch her?

764
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,820
No, you're not.

765
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,090
Why not?

766
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,360
Because

767
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,610
you have dust on your hands.

768
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,270
What? Dust?

769
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,510
Gosh. I have dust on my hands.
What is this?

770
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,510
Gosh, you touched me with those hands.

771
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,110
Gosh.

772
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,650
Goodness.

773
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,150
Hey, Bo-bae.
Let's go get the photo albums.

774
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,820
- Okay.
- Gosh.

775
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,790
Are you okay?

776
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,690

00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,970
What?

778
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,440
Do you have

779
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,480
a crush on Si-ah?

780
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,710
That's none of your business.

781
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,590
Look at that.

782
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,690
He must be serious.

783
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,960
Goodness.

784
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,990
He was such a baby,
but now he even gets jealous.

785
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,930
How adorable.

786
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,000
But you can't have Si-ah.

787
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,140
No man can take Si-ah!

788
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,300
Absolutely not.

789
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,670
No, nobody.

790
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,580
What are you doing here alone?

791
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,940
Why are you here?

792
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,320
This would've been my zone
if it weren't for someone.

793
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,350
Do you

794
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,850
like Si-ah?

795
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,020
Of course.

796
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,430
As a woman?

797
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,760
Are you insane?

798
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,500
That's disgusting!

799
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,500
- No?
- Absolutely not!

800
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,930
How does that make sense in your head?

801
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,240
- It does.
- What?

802
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,140
I like Si-ah as a woman.

803
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,180
So, whatever happens,

804
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,280
don't dare to interrupt.

805
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,180
Si-ah is mine.

806
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,190
- What did you just say?
- Are you deaf?

807
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,560
Si-ah is mine.

808
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,700
"Mine"?

809
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,740
I...

810
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,170
I'm sorry.

811
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,080
Sir, who are you?

812
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,150
What? Sir?

813
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,890
What's with that reaction?

814
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,530
Don't act like you know this
in front of the other kids.

815
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,160
Just stay quiet.

816
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,480
<i>I can never stay quiet!</i>

817
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,210
<i>I'll protect my daughter.</i>

818
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,980
Goodnight.

819
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,590
Do you have something to say?

820
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,060
- Yes.
- What is it?

821
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,930
I actually...

822
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,740
Hello.

823
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,610
What?

824
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,580
- Why are you here?
- Why would I be at a convenience store?

825
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,190
I hear that the basketball team has
a new coach.

826
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,490
How is he?

827
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,230
He's good.

828
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,100
Did you just worry about me?

829
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,570
Worry? No. I'm just curious.

830
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:30,610
Here.

831
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,350
You can drink this one.

832
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,850
Why are you giving this to me?

833
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,380
It's buy 1 get 1 free.

834
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,820
I just want one,
and I can't throw the other away.

835
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,760
Seo Ji-ho!

836
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,400
What? I thought you were
getting rid of it.

837
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,810
Why are you two here?

838
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,360
Aren't you two going to go home?

839
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,360
You're not going, either.

840
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,060
I'm waiting to walk Si-ah home.

841
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,130
Why would you do that?

842
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,570
"Why"?

843
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,100
Because it's a scary world out there.

844
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,300
<i>- I'm leaving now!
- Good work. Get home safely.</i>

845
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,470
<i>Thank you. Goodnight.</i>

846
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,680
- Si-ah, let's go.
- Sure.

847
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,080
Why are you all still here?

848
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,320
Your father asked me to do something.

849
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,290
What did he ask you to do?

850
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,890
I'll tell you as we walk.

851
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,790
Get home safely, you two.

852
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,760
Let's go.

853
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,430
What are you doing? Come on.

854
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,200
All right.

855
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,640
Bye.

856
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,340
- That punk!
- That punk!

857
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,450
Come on.

858
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,750
What do you

859
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,050
think of those two?

860
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,820
Those two?

861
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,960
Seo Ji-ho and Gu Ja-sung.

862
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,560
Not as friends, but as men.

863
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,700
Are you insane?

864
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,930
I've been friends with Ji-ho
for ten years!

865
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,730
How can I see him as a man?

866
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,940
And I get furious

867
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,610
just thinking about
how Ja-sung bullied Si-woo.

868
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,540
Goodness, he's annoying.

869
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,950
Wait.

870
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,780
Why are you going the dark way?

871
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,590
This is the faster way.

872
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,390
There's not a lot of people around,
and it's dark.

873
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,190
There are no surveillance
cameras, either.

874
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,830
Go through a brighter area.

875
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,860
It's already dangerous for you
to be out so late.

876
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,870
Stop nagging.

877
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,070
- Am I a kid?
- Yes, you are.

878
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,270
And

879
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,370
take this around with you.

880
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,240
It's an alarm in case of danger.

881
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,140
You can use it.

882
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:21,810
Your father asked me to give it to you.
Take it.

883
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,550
Goodness.

884
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,090
Si-ah!

885
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,930
Mom!

886
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,530
You two are coming together?

887
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,670
No, he just walked me home.

888
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,610
You're coming home quite late.

889
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,740
Yes, work ended late.

890
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,310
It's late. You should get home quickly.

891
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,380
Yes, ma'am.

892
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,350
- Get home safely.
- All right.

893
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,620
Let's go.

894
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,250
Bye.

895
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,820
Did I interrupt you two?

896
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,930
What are you talking about?

897
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,090
He and I are nothing like that.

898
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,500
It's more suspicious
that you're getting so mad.

899
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,930
I'm telling you!

900
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,140
Gosh, I mean it!

901
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,040
<i>Observation report 25</i>
<i>10:10 p.m.</i>

902
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,640
<i>Met up with his family.</i>

903
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,180
<i>10:30 p.m.</i>

904
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,410
<i>Hasn't left the house since coming back.</i>

905
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,420
<i>Observation complete.</i>

906
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,520
<i>Carrying out</i>

907
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,090
<i>the plan tomorrow.</i>

908
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,500
Hey, can we talk for a moment?

909
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,780
What's wrong?

910
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,480
Don't be too shocked.

911
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,350
I heard from Producer Park,

912
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,460
but apparently, only three of us will be
signing full contracts.

913
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,090
What about the other one?

914
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,390
They're going to get fired.

915
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,130
You all didn't know about this, right?

916
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,470
I had no idea.

917
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Same here.

918
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,070
Me neither.

919
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,670
Shouldn't we do something about it?

920
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,240
Let's check with HR first.

921
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,950
And if it is true,
why don't we tell them

922
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,450
as a group that
the decision they made isn't fair?

923
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,220
The company already made a decision.

924
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,720
Do you think by taking action,
we'll be able to change anything?

925
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,260
Then, do you just want to sit back
and do nothing?

926
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,990
This is the reality we are in.

927
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,030
We must do our best to survive here.

928
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,640
Ms. Kwon, if we don't have
a united front, this is useless.

929
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,010
I think you're letting your emotions
make decisions for you right now.

930
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,940
Why don't you be rational?

931
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,040
And if you want to bring this up,
count me out.

932
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,780
Then, I'll get going.

933
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,220
Oh, my. She's so cold.

934
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,620
So she sees us as competition, right?

935
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,260
What programs are you on?
I have a current affairs program.

936
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,260
Ja-young is on a culture program
and a radio show.

937
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,800
That... Yu-mi has

938
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,770
variety shows and baseball interviews.
And you, Da-jung...

939
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,940
Only I don't have a fixed program.

940
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,140
I'm sure you'll get offers
to be on another show soon.

941
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,780
Right.

942
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,450
Don't worry.

943
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,660
Hello.

944
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,160
You're Ms. Jung Da-jung, right?

945
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,660
I'm Park Gi-seong,
a variety show producer.

946
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,530
This is Lee Bo-ra,
a variety show writer.

947
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:35,870
Hello.

948
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,700
- The producer came in person.
- Right.

949
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,510
It's a pilot program for the holiday.

950
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,940
And we really want
to hire you as the MC.

951
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,310
If this does well,
this might become a regular show.

952
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,280
MC?

953
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,080
Awesome!

954
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,850
But why are you offering me that job?

955
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,220
<i>Program Proposal for "Couples in Crisis"</i>

956
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,090
This show is about divorce.

957
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,360
We really want you to host the show.

958
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,090
I see.

959
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,830
<i>Program Proposal for "Couples in Crisis"</i>

960
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,300
This is the data we have
from last year's events.

961
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:13,310
There are some overlapping parts
with this year.

962
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,440
I have someone bringing me
this year's version from my house.

963
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,480
I hope you're not trying
to stall time like last time.

964
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,450
To wait for your son who's my fan.

965
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,280
He's not your fan anymore.

966
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,590
Actually, he hates you now.

967
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,550
That's odd.

968
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,820
I'm performing better these days.

969
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,890
I guess he's even more jealous
because you're performing better now.

970
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,400
As a matter of fact, you're better
than him in so many ways.

971
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,170
Pardon? What do you mean?

972
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,770
Am I your errand boy now?

973
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,070
Wait.

974
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,850
You were his son?

975
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,310
Hey, nice to see you.

976
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,880
You needed this, right?

977
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,550
Right. That's the one.
Wait for me outside.

978
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,460
He must really hate me.

979
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,730
I told you so.

980
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,630
Anyway, you have the new files.

981
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,540
Let's go over them
and talk business first.

982
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:18,970
Sure.

983
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,970
They've gone mad. They want you
to host a show about divorce?

984
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,210
If I don't take this show,

985
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,740
I might get fired.

986
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:56,980
What?

987
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,480
Why?

988
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:02,180
They'll only hire three people
after the probationary period.

989
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,950
And I'm the only one without a show.

990
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:09,950
Ae-rin, if I do take this show,

991
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,260
can you help me?

992
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,990
I'm livid,

993
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,190
so let's eat something spicy
that burns our stomachs.

994
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,960
No. I don't have an appetite.

995
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,870
Don't be like that. Come with me.

996
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,640
You always ate spicy food
when you were stressed out.

997
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Next time.

998
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:31,310
I can tell from your face that
you haven't eaten a single meal today.

999
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,820
Ms. Jung.

1000
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,260
What? Mr. Ye.

1001
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,960
Gosh, this area must have good chi.

1002
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,760
I run into you whenever I'm here.

1003
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,030
Well, are you here because of work?

1004
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,540
Yes. I am. Because of you.

1005
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,970
- Pardon?
- I came here because of you,

1006
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,710
so I can see you.

1007
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,840
I mean it.

1008
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,010
Look.

1009
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,420
- What?
- I was leaving after a business meeting.

1010
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,850
And I saw you walking
on the street, passing by.

1011
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,260
If you haven't had dinner,
can you join me?

1012
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,000
Well, I had a late lunch.

1013
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,700
Then, can you sit in front of me?

1014
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,570
I can't eat at restaurants by myself.

1015
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,740
Gosh. I'm starving. Goodness.

1016
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,440
I'm out of energy too.

1017
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,320
The chef here serves amazing food.

1018
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,220
Her spicy stir-fried pork is to die for.

1019
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,160
- Ma'am.
- Look at you, Ji-hoon.

1020
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,490
Where have you been all this time?
You're making me sad.

1021
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,100
I'm sorry. It's the baseball season.
I've been busy.

1022
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
What?

1023
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,740
Aren't you Ms. Jung Da-jung?

1024
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,270
Do you know me?

1025
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,640
Of course! I'm a huge fan of yours.

1026
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,880
By the way,
what's going on between you two?

1027
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,920
You've never brought a lady here.

1028
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,450
She's a close colleague.

1029
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,350
Don't get the wrong idea.
Spicy pork, please.

1030
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,020
Sure.

1031
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,190
Oh, right. Ma'am,
put a lot of chili pepper powder!

1032
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,860
Make it spicy that it
burns our stomachs!

1033
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,130
A lot of chili pepper powder?

1034
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,230
He can't even handle spicy food.

1035
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,370
Whatever.

1036
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,670
All right. Let's do this, then.

1037
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,860
My gosh, it's so good.

1038
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,960
My stress is gone now!

1039
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,630
Oh, right.

1040
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,260
You should try it.

1041
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,600
No. I'm good.

1042
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:11,200
It's really good.
Just have one bite. Please?

1043
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,570
All right, then.

1044
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,850
My gosh, it's so good.

1045
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,980
Right? Eat with me.

1046
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,220
Ma'am, one more bowl of rice!

1047
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,100
Ms. Jung!

1048
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,970
Can you give me an autograph?

1049
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,440
An autograph?

1050
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,080
A celebrity came to my restaurant.
I should hang it up.

1051
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,010
<i>Ma'am!</i>

1052
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,320
I'm coming!

1053
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,550
Can you sign it and
put it on the counter?

1054
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,220
You look much prettier in person.

1055
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:09,460
This feels weird.

1056
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,530
I've only signed contracts up until now.

1057
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:15,900
Hold on.

1058
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,100
Don't sign it yet.

1059
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,480
Here.
This is the glove I wear for my games.

1060
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,750
- And?
- Sign my glove first.

1061
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,020
I'm your number one fan, remember?

1062
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,690
- What?
- Come on. Please.

1063
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,630
This is really important to me.

1064
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,370
Okay.

1065
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,410
Thank you.

1066
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,060
Gosh, it burns. It's killing me.

1067
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,110
<i>I'll always root for you.
From Jung Da-jung.</i>

1068
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,320
- She lost all of her shows?
- Yes.

1069
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:42,120
But she got an offer to host
a show about divorce.

1070
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,120
What does she want to do?

1071
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,390
She thinks it's her last chance.

1072
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,700
Then, she should take it.

1073
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,330
What?

1074
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,140
If the show airs, people will talk.

1075
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,170
We don't even know
how people will react.

1076
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:03,110
This might take a toll on Da-jung
and your kids.

1077
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,840
I'm sure she's aware of it.

1078
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,780
But if she thinks
this is her last chance

1079
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,480
and if she must do it,

1080
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,690
I don't think

1081
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,630
she's making this decision
just for herself.

1082
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,710
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

1083
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:46,120
- This is beautiful.
- Awesome.

1084
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,890
It's so pretty.

1085
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,890
Gosh.

1086
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,660
- This is amazing.
- Kids grow up so fast.

1087
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,560
I want them to slow down a bit.

1088
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,730
Right. It's sad to see them
grow up so quickly.

1089
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,500
Once they all grow up, they won't
join us for the fireworks, right?

1090
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,100
That's all right. We have each other.

1091
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,370
Dae-young.

1092
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,110
Actually,

1093
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,180
I got the result from the interview
for the anchorwoman position.

1094
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,110
Really? Did you get it?

1095
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,320
I didn't get it.

1096
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,490
Why would you say that with a smile on?

1097
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:23,220
I was happy.

1098
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,490
When I went for the interview,

1099
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,790
the fact that I was at a TV station

1100
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,760
made me so happy.

1101
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,670
So I'm going to give it my all.

1102
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,740
I want to show our kids how I'll keep

1103
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,540
trying and challenging myself.

1104
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,610
And I'll make my dream come true

1105
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:46,210
and make them proud as a cool mother.

1106
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,380
Yes. I'm sure you can do it.

1107
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:58,560
- Come here.
- My goodness. Look!

1108
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,760
- That one too.
- That's pretty too.

1109
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,420
<i>Are you all coming home late tonight?</i>

1110
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,780
<i>Group Chatroom, 4</i>

1111
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,820
<i>I have plans. I'll be late.</i>

1112
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,890
<i>I'm going to practice basketball
before I go home.</i>

1113
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,990
<i>I'm coming home late today.</i>

1114
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,730
I don't want to watch it alone.

1115
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,040
What?

1116
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,080
I have something to give you.

1117
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,560
Gosh, I didn't know
these photos still existed.

1118
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,060
I was preparing for the festival.
I thought they were cool.

1119
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,160
By the way,

1120
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,560
how did you know this was me
in the photos?

1121
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,100
I changed a lot.

1122
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,930
Gosh, you didn't.

1123
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,870
You're still pretty.

1124
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,640
What?

1125
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,380
Si-ah is the spitting image of you.

1126
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,850
Oh, right. Do you want
to see her photos?

1127
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:37,920
She's cute.

1128
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,600
Is that Si-woo?

1129
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,660
Isn't he amazing?

1130
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:49,570
His eyes change
whenever he plays basketball.

1131
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,210
I should have gone
to his games more often.

1132
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,040
What a shame.

1133
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,440
You've been busy with work.

1134
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,880
You raised them as a working mom.

1135
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,650
You're incredible.

1136
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,150
Why do you

1137
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,320
talk like a grown-up?

1138
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,520
I might not look old,
but I'm very old on the inside.

1139
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:17,330
I still get nervous of making mistakes

1140
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,900
before my games.

1141
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,170
But

1142
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,100
when I see you on TV,

1143
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,000
you don't seem nervous at all.

1144
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,640
And you never make mistakes.

1145
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,340
Whenever I see you on TV,

1146
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,410
I always think you're so cool.

1147
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,080
Gosh. No, I'm not.

1148
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,350
I mean it.

1149
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,090
Si-ah and Si-woo
are rooting for you too.

1150
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,420
- Really?
- Yes.

1151
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:48,930
So you should continue showing them
how great you are on TV.

1152
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,960
Thank you.

1153
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,110
It started.

1154
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,960
<i>Da-jung,</i>

1155
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,229
<i>you are</i>

1156
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,460
<i>doing a great job.</i>

1157
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,970
<i>So don't worry.</i>

1158
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,109
<i>I'm sure</i>

1159
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,580
<i>you'll do a great job again.</i>

1160
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,920
How beautiful.

1161
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,240
<i>There are some things you notice
only after you have lost them.</i>

1162
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:11,880
Thank you for today. Get home safely.

1163
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,950
<i>A smile of my loved one.</i>

1164
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,450
<i>All right. Raise your left hand!</i>

1165
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,460
<i>Time you spent with your family.</i>

1166
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,830
<i>When I had them,</i>

1167
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:33,160
<i>I didn't know</i>

1168
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,200
<i>how precious</i>

1169
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,870
<i>they had been.</i>

1170
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,880
Yu-ju!

1171
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,090
Mom!

1172
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,700
<i>Van Parcel Service</i>
No, Yu-ju!

1173
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,370
Yu-ju!

1174
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,450
All right. Transport him
to the OR slowly.

1175
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:35,360
He was in a car accident. His name is
Hong Dae-young. He was born in 1983.

1176
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,740
<i>8 years ago</i>

1177
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,020
Dae-young. Hong Dae-young!

1178
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,820
- Dae-young!
- Hold on.

1179
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,890
Dae-young.

1180
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,260
Your mom is calling you.

1181
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,790
Okay!

1182
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,070
Let the kids play a bit more. Okay?

1183
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,840
They are having fun.

1184
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,310
Kids' cafes are so convenient.

1185
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,410
But why now,
when our kids are all grown up?

1186
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,750
Right.

1187
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,410
Do you want to play with me?

1188
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,080
Sure.

1189
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,060
Who is that guy?
Why is he holding her hand?

1190
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,720
He must be Si-ah's friend.

1191
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,130
Ja-sung.

1192
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:45,800
"Ja-sung"?
I don't think he's her friend.

1193
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,730
I bet when Si-ah brings
her future husband home,

1194
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,400
you're going to throw a fit.

1195
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,070
- What?
- Isn't it obvious?

1196
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,940
She's going to date
and have boyfriends later.

1197
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,510
And she'll get married too.

1198
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,910
What will you do
when she brings her boyfriend home?

1199
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,120
First, I'm going to break his leg.

1200
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,450
- What?
- And then,

1201
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,150
if he's a nice man, I'll fix his leg.

1202
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,060
And if he's a bad man,
I'll break his other leg.

1203
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,190
Goodness.

1204
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:15,390
I don't think Si-ah will be able to
get married in this life.

1205
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,190
Don't bring up stuff like that.

1206
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,760
I'm already tearing up.

1207
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,670
It looks like I'm raising 3 kids, not 2.

1208
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,210
Come here, my baby. My poor baby.

1209
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,680
Were you sad? Is that it?
