00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,700
- Let's finish up quickly and rest sooner.
- Okay then.

180
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,310
I'll see you tomorrow.

181
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Hey.

182
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,460
Go first.

183
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,670
<i>Serim High School</i>

184
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,810
I put in 50 percent more,
like you asked.

185
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,920
Gosh, you're so exact.

186
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,820
<i>Don't worry about Ja-sung starting.</i>

187
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,820
Okay.

188
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,890
Please continue to show your support.

189
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,760
Right.

190
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
<i>Serim High School</i>

191
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,240
What was that just now?

192
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,440
Let's talk later.

193
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,080
Have you been paying
him off so that I could play?

194
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,620
Tell me!

195
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,050
I only filled in for
what you were lacking.

196
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,330
Is that something a father should say?

197
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,200
If you could play and go to college on
your own, I wouldn't have given him money!

198
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,270
Then don't give him any money.

199
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,500
I won't go either.

200
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,840
I'm

201
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,540
embarrassed of you.

202
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,940
You punk!

203
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,350
You're always whining,
just like that mother of yours.

204
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,590
You just need to do
what I tell you to do!

205
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,590
If not, I'll kick you out of the
house just like I did to your mother!

206
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,700
Gu Ja-sung!

207
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,590
Did it hurt?

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,060
Are you okay?

209
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Why do you care?

210
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,470
You and Hong Si-woo always
show up at times like this.

211
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,300
Hong Si-woo?

212
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,640
Are you

213
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,210
bullying Si-woo because of that?

214
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,940
How embarrassing.

215
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,350
Hey, Go Woo-young. I'm warning you.

216
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,180
Watch your mouth.

217
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,050
Drink this.

218
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,520
You can drink on a day like this.

219
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,720
I told you to mind your own business.

220
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,030
Why are you bothering me?

221
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,770
I don't want you to have regrets.

222
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,770
I got hit by my father a few times too.

223
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,640
He wasn't always like that,

224
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,910
but after my mother passed
away, that's when it started.

225
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,080
You're not the one who
did something wrong,

226
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,510
so why should you do
something you're going to regret?

227
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,020
I didn't mean to see what happened,

228
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,060
but I'm sorry anyway. I'll keep
what happened today a secret.

229
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,790
To be honest, I quit drinking.

230
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,130
But I'll drink today with you.

231
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,530
Stop bluffing.

232
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,339
Are you trying to comfort me?

233
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,700
Why?

234
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,050
After hearing that I'm not good enough
and I only played thanks to my dad's money,

235
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,010
are you taking pity on me?

236
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,710
You're

237
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,820
a good player.

238
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,190
You would've been
good enough on your own,

239
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,360
but your father just
met the wrong people.

240
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,470
So don't you ever think
that you're not good enough.

241
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
And

242
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,600
don't do things that
you'll regret later.

243
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,870
Even if it's someone you hate,

244
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,340
<i>turning your back on someone</i>

245
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
<i>for good</i>

246
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,210
will bring more sadness
to you than you think.

247
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,600
What? This is non-alcoholic.

248
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,555
<i>Fresh Zero</i>

249
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,630
Hey!

250
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,970
How do I take him home?

251
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
My back hurts.

252
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,480
My gosh.

253
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,220
How can he get drunk
on non-alcoholic beer?

254
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,070
He's still a kid, indeed.

255
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,790
<i>I knew it. I trusted you
from the start.</i>

256
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,816
<i>Everyone is gathering because
we know you had it hard.</i>

257
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,020
<i>You have to come.</i>

258
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,960
<i>We'd like you to be
KD Bank's model again.</i>

259
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,690
<i>Please give me a call
when you're free.</i>

260
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,630
How can everyone change just overnight?

261
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,440
Da-jung must've watched
the press conference too.

262
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,040
We're all here.
Aren't you going to come?

263
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,290
I couldn't record him.

264
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,690
What should I do now?

265
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,890
Then the only way

266
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,030
is for a parent who has made a deal

267
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,900
with Choi Il-kwon to come forward.

268
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,730
If a parent who paid him testifies,

269
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
will they be punished?

270
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,470
They will be,

271
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,210
which is why it'll be hard
to get any parent to testify.

272
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,750
Give me a moment.

273
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,390
What?

274
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,620
Get out right now.

275
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,560
Do you even know where I am?

276
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,730
I'm busy working.

277
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,660
Your job requires you to slice
pork cutlet while you work?

278
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,430
What?

279
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Hey!

280
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,860
What, you're following me now?

281
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,190
Hop in.

282
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,430
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

283
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,530
Let's talk inside then.

284
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,860
You have one minute.

285
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,310
Hey! What are you doing?

286
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,760
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>

287
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,160
Hey, Mr. Ye.

288
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,730
<i>What's up?</i>

289
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,470
What are you doing?

290
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,640
Just having dinner.

291
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,710
Really? I was just going to eat too.

292
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,670
Enjoy your dinner.

293
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,340
All right. You too.

294
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,550
That's all?

295
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,480
<i>It's such a relief</i>

296
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,420
<i>that you aren't going to retire.</i>

297
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,420
- Here!
- What took you so long?

298
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,620
Where are you going?

299
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,520
- Ji-hoon,
- He ignored us.

300
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,930
I'm sure you'll do well.

301
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,030
Where is he going?

302
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll cheer you on as your fan.

303
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Thanks.

304
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
What?

305
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,440
What brings you here?

306
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,670
I have to eat too.

307
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,610
And you just happen to be here.

308
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,480
What a coincidence, right?

309
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,250
Yes.

310
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,250
Did you come alone?

311
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,890
No, with my friends.

312
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,960
Why are you alone?

313
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,590
My friend stepped out for a moment,

314
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,660
but she's taking so long.

315
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,410
Are you crazy?
Why did you bring me here?

316
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,580
This is where our history began.

317
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,680
How could you forget all about us?

318
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,520
I can't forget until I die.

319
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
You are

320
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,360
my first love!

321
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,330
Do you realize how old you are?

322
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,730
Goodness!

323
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,288
You can all go home from here.

324
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,370
What?

325
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,930
- Bye!
- Bye!

326
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,270
<i>Stop acting this way!</i>

327
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,400
<i>I can't!</i>

328
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,070
<i>- This has been going on for years.
- I can't give you up.</i>

329
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,740
Why are you so in love with me?

330
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,640
You're daintier than
Kim Ha-neul in my eyes,

331
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,506
prettier than Kim Tae-hee,
and cuter than Suzy.

332
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,910
I can't stop thinking about
you all day. What do I do?

333
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,210
You need to take responsibility for it!

334
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,950
She said no!

335
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Who are you?

336
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,030
Me?

337
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
<i>Don't do it. Don't you dare.</i>

338
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,900
<i>Please don't.</i>

339
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,130
<i>All right. I'll help you out.</i>

340
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,440
Who are you?

341
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm Ae-rin's boyfriend.

342
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,110
You broke up with me to
get with someone like that?

343
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,020
In my eyes,

344
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,590
he's the sexiest man ever!

345
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,490
She thinks he's sexy?

346
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,360
Good one.

347
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,960
You two look great together.

348
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,530
I must be the weird one here.

349
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,770
Have a good life!

350
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,440
Thanks for helping out.

351
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,850
I'll get going first.

352
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,920
What a day.

353
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,460
What should we eat?

354
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,030
- Pasta!
- Pasta?

355
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,130
- Yes.
- Is that good enough?

356
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,960
Maybe steak, then.

357
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,300
Steak! That sounds great!

358
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
You scumbag!

359
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,640
That's ridiculous.

360

<i>My head is all over the
place, so I'm going home.</i>

362
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,210
All right. Don't worry about me.

363
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,510
Go home and rest.

364
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,620
Your friend isn't coming back?

365
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,490
No.

366
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,220
You can go talk to your friends now.

367
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,030
I'll get going first.

368
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,030

369
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,940
I'll take you home.

370

It's fine.

371
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,410
Why? Is there a bus that gets
you straight to home this time too?

372
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,650
No,

373
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,650
but your friends are waiting.

374
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,490
I don't feel good
about taking your offer.

375
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,120
I hope you wouldn't think so much.

376
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,830
Sometimes,

377
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,330
thinking and acting simple is the best.

378
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,470
Simple.

379
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,170
Thank you.

380
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,550
You're going to say no
anyway, so why thank me?

381
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,250
Are you saying that in advance
for when you get a ride later?

382
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,910
It's not that.

383
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,380
I'm just going through something
very complicated right now.

384
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,490
But thanks to you, I cleared my mind.

385
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,230
I'm only going to
look ahead from now on.

386
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,760
I'll have your back, then.

387

388
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,370

Get home safely.

392
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
It's okay.

393
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,850
I told you.

394
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,580
I'll always have your back.

395
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,700
No, he punched me first.

396
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,840
Gosh. It hurts.

397
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,670
Did you really punch him first?

398
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,940
Yes.

399
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,570
Since you're not hurt at all,

400
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,360
you should just settle
and let this one go.

401
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,050
My lawyer will take care
of the settlement.

402
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,280
I was talking to him, not you.

403
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,250
Can I make a call?

404
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,020

405
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,190

No, that's not true.

He told me it was a secret.

- Are you not well?
- Get your hands off me.

You said that on the day
you asked to meet

- Stop that.

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,850
This is something the
adults should sort out.

539
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,620
You can just

540
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,430
focus on getting ready for the game.

541
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,730
Okay.

542
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,270
Wait here.

543
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,400
What?

544
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,630
Take this.

545
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,940
It's a digestive pill.

546
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,570
Okay. Thank you.

547
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,150
Oh, right.

548
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,120
How did you know I have indigestion?

549
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,690
I get like that when I'm stressed out.

550
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,530
Are you okay?

551
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,270
Yes, I am.

552
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,600
You don't look like it.

553
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,210
Give me your hand.

554
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,870
This is really effective.

555
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
How do you feel?

556
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,240
I feel like I'm getting better.

557
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Right?

558
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,180
What stressed you out this time?

559
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,590
Who gave my woman trouble?
I'm not going to leave them alone!

560
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,370
Okay.

561
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,910
I'm fine now.

562
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,280
I'll get going first.

563
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,030
Mom.

564
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,830
What's wrong with your
face? Is something wrong?

565
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,030
What could be wrong?

566
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,600
You can't fool me.

567
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,170
You can tell whenever Si-ah lies, right?

568
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,140
It's the same with me.

569
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,510
There's nothing wrong.

570
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,580
You will never be able to fix that
habit of never sharing how you feel.

571
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,810
You're not a child anymore.

572
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,680
You have to take
responsibility of your child too.

573
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,150
Thank you, Mom.

574
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,380
I'm sorry.

575
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,970
Time flies.

576
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,210
Mom. Did you throw out the
papers that were on my desk?

577
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,710
Yes.

578
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,010
I organized your desk
while I was cleaning.

579
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,520
My gosh. I told you
not to touch my things!

580
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,620
Why are you getting mad?

581
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,220
Then why didn't you clean your room?

582
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,650
Who asked you to clean for me?

583
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,290
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

584
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,490
"Annoyed"?

585
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,111
Is that appropriate to say to your mom?

586
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,590
You touched my stuff without
asking. Of course I'm annoyed.

587
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,100
Grandma, tell Mom to stop.

588
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:06,400
Hong Si-ah.

589
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,100
Why are you acting
like that to my daughter?

590
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,570
Pardon?

591
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,340
I won't forgive anyone
who upsets my daughter.

592
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,010
Even if that person is my granddaughter.

593
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,880
Apologize to your mom now.

594
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,450
Okay.

595
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,750
Mom, I'm sorry.

596
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,560
I had a daughter who's just like me,

597
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,800
just like you said I would.

598
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,600
Children are all immature.

599
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,370
I'm a mom and grandma because I'm here,

600
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,080
but in front of my mom,
I'm just her daughter.

601
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,520
So you can live as a
mom in front of your kids,

602
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,620
but to me, you can be
a daughter forever.

603
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,290
If anyone upsets you, tell me.

604
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,220
I'm always on your side.

605
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,730
I haven't even eaten yet,
but I feel so full already.

606
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,630
What did you do until
now without having dinner?

607
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,540
I'll make you something to
eat, so go and get changed.

608
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Thank you, Mom.

609
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,610
Goodness.

610
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,820
I'm here, Mom.

611
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,560
Do you remember your son's face?

612
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,230
Are you more familiar with this face?

613
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,080
I went home for the
first time in a while.

614
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,010
<i>I saw a picture of you on the wall,</i>

615
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,340
<i>and you looked exactly the same.</i>

616
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,410
<i>It was a face</i>

617
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,280
<i>that I longed so much to see.</i>

618
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,250
<i>Good job, everyone.</i>

619
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,290
<i>Mom. Good job.</i>

620
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,500
<i>I'll wait outside.</i>

621
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,800
<i>Okay. I'm almost done.</i>

625
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,660
What are we going to do about Dae-young?

626
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,810
I'm home.

627
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,960
Mom. Why does Dad
drink so much these days?

628
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,570
Did you pack your socks?
What about a towel?

629
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,370
I packed everything.

630
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,840
Don't overexert yourself
because it's an away game

631
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,070
and don't get hurt.

632
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,140
Okay.

633
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,810
But

634
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,880
are you sick?

635
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,720
Why are you wasting your
energy worrying about me?

636
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,180
Just focus on yourself
during the game, okay?

637
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,620
Okay.

638
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,050
Dae-young.

639
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,360
You know

640
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,830
that I love you so much, right?

641
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,390
Gosh, that gave me chills.
Why would you say that?

642
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,240
Hurry up and go.

643
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,710
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

644
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,690
You should go in.

645
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,550
Okay. Go ahead.

Your mom's

surgery didn't go well.

655
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,900
What kind of surgery?

656
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,870
Why would Mom get surgery?

657
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,010
Wake her up.

658
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,670
Dae-young.

659
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,510
Wake her up!

660
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,450
Wake her up.

661
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,880
Your mom

662
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,050
was really sick.

663
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,190
Why am I just finding
out that she was sick?

664
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,630
Why didn't you say anything?

665
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,630
Why didn't you tell me anything?

666
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,630
It was all for your sake.

667
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,270

00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,860
Mom.

<i>Hey! No parents would want
to ruin their children's lives!</i>

672
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,880
You sound like you
actually care about me.

673
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,020
You punk!

674
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,090
Do you actually care about me?

675
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,590
You care so much that you
hid Mom's illness from me?

676
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,030
That's why you told
Da-jung to get an abortion?

677
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,770
Did you ever think in my place?

678
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,770
You're just drinking every day.
Don't say that it's for the family.

679
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,540
You did nothing for the family.

680
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,980
No, don't do that.

681
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,180
Stop it!

682
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,430
If you leave now,

683
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,500
I will disown you!

684
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,820
Aren't you Woo-young?

685
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,660
- Hello.
- Anyway,

686
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,760
what brings you here?

687
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,400
My mother is resting here.

688
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,600
You're so young. It's unfortunate.

689
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,100
You can go on.

690
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:00,970
Yes, sir.

691
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,950
You can give that to me. I'll carry it.

692
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,020
- I'm fine.
- I'll take it.

693
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,960
It's fine.

694
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,830
Is it her death anniversary today?

695
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,340
Yes.

696
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,240
That's the same as my wife.

697
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,010
My wife also passed away
years ago today.

698
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,550
It's been years

699
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,710
since I came on her anniversary.

700
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,650
Why is that?

701
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,390
My son couldn't be

702
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,260
with his mother in her
deathbed because of me.

703
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,660
I should've given him
time to bid her farewell.

704
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,660
I regret not doing that.

705
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,700
Since then,

706
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,500
I wanted him to at least have some
time with her on her anniversaries,

707
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,610
so I always came a day later.

708
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,150
But he's in Busan this year,

709
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,580
so I came right on the day.

710
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,080
Even then,

711
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,450
it seems like he came by earlier.

712
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,750
I see those flowers every time,

713
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,790
but I don't know what they are.

714
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,490
They're hyacinths.

715
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,830
What a difficult name that is.

716
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,500
I'm sorry.

717
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,440
Please forgive me.

718
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,380
What?

719
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,670
That's the meaning of the flowers.

720
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,420
He shouldn't be sorry.

721
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,890
We're sorry as his parents.

722

<i>But...</i>

731
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,750
My dad can't come to watch me play.

732

Are you sad?

733
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,990
It's fine. He's always
like this, anyway.

What do you mean?

735
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,430
He always says that he cares and nags,

- To meet a friend.

<i>just like my father</i>
