I'll only give you the stars.

Gosh. They aren't lonely.

51
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,630
Even if you can't see it,
the other half is right next to it.

Yes.

Chocolate milk will do the trick.

Are you a kid? Why would you cure
your hangover with chocolate milk?

81
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,510
Chocolate milk always works best for me
when I'm hungover.

82
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,680
It was even on TV
that it's the best hangover cure.

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,070
You're right.

364
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,940
It is beautiful in person.

365
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,640
Actually,

366
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,450
I've always wanted to come here.

367
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,110
<i>I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.</i>

368
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,880
<i>Take care of my son for me.</i>

369
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,290
<i>Okay. I'll enjoy the food too.
Thank you for the food.</i>

370
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,730
<i>I helped you out today. You owe me one.</i>

371
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,170
Your dad must be very busy.

372
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,800
I guess so.

373
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,750
- Hello.
- It was quite expensive.

374
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,980
- Hello.
- Hi.

375
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,650
See you later.

376
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,820
- Check out this place.
- Hi.

377
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,660
- I know.
- Exactly.

378
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,660
Ms. Ok. Where are you?

379
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,730
<i>Mr. Go. I'm sorry.</i>

380
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,340
<i>No matter how much I think of this,
I don't think this is right.</i>

381
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,740
<i>I will not answer your calls
regarding personal matters. Bye.</i>

382
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,810
What? Ms. Ok!

383
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,680
Ms. Ok!

384
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,360
Hello?

385
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,630
Gosh. My plan tonight just fell through.
I'm by myself.

386
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,600
- Do you want to join me?
- Now?

387
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,900
I'm not fit to be seen right now.

388
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,540
And has there been a time
when you looked presentable?

389
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,640
Don't be like that. Just come over.
I'll buy you a drink.

390
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,110
A drink?

391
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,810
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

392
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,210
- How could he wear that?
- Unbelievable.

393
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,720
I got dumped today.

394
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,920
No wonder. Just look at your outfit.

395
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,700
Did you not bring an umbrella?

396
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,600
It wasn't raining when I got here.

397
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,400
Is that so? Then, wait here.
Let me go buy one.

398
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,470
Gosh.

399
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,410
I know you don't want to spend money
on umbrellas at the last minute.

400
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,910
What?

401
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,680
<i>How did he know that?</i>

402
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,380
Your house is on the way.
Let me walk you home.

403
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,750
And let me borrow your umbrella.

404
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,690
Okay. Let's do that.

405
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,660
Let me.

406
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,610
What? He left an umbrella.

407
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,990
Your shoulder is going to get all wet.

408
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,220
It's all right. This is nothing.

409
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,290
This is a small umbrella, isn't it?

410
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,260
Should we get a cab since it's raining?

411
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,430
It's fine.

412
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,370
You walk home when it's only
two stops away to save money.

413
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,470
<i>How does he know so much about me?</i>

414
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,750
Are you okay?

415
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,420
Yes. I'm fine.

416
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,390
Oh, no. You're completely soaked.

417
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,800
You can put these on.
You'll catch a cold.

418
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,010
Okay.

419
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,880
Gosh.

420
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,580
Goodness.

421
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,380
I'll stay in my room.

422
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,219
Let me know once you're fully dressed.

423
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,500
Well, okay.

424
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,400
I'm at home, so I let my guard down.

425
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,550
Gosh. I can't believe
I'm wearing Si-woo's clothes.

426
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,960
Jung Da-jung, get a grip.

427
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,160
He's a student. And I'm a parent.

428
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,870
Why would you be flustered?

429
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,670
Goodness.

430
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,010
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>

431
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,420
Hello, Mr. Ye.

432
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,420
Ms. Jung. I'm in front
of your house now.

433
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,260
Can I see you for a moment?

434
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,660
Pardon? In front of my house?

435
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,800
Were you waiting for me?

436
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,970
I enjoyed watching your show.
Congratulations.

437
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,910
That jerk. Why is he back here again?

438
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,180
Here.

439
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,420
This is a gift from your number one fan.

440
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,020
Gosh. I'm her number one fan.

441
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,520
Thank you. These are beautiful.

442
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,530
- Oh, right. This too.
- What's that?

443
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,460
Go Go Play is having an event.

444
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,100
I'm sure you got invited.

445
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,630
That's for your daughter.

446
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,970
I'm having a signing event that day.

447
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,210
My daughter will love it.

448
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,780
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

449
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,290
What? Woo-young.

450
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,900
I heard you were friends with her son.
I guess you're here to see him.

451
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,830
Sure. Why not?

452
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,770
Are you coming to the
event tomorrow too?

453
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,430
Your father's company is hosting it.

454
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
No.

455
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,570
You're not?

456
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,940
That's too bad.
It would be nice for you to come.

457
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,240
Gosh. Why would I go?

458
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,280
What do you mean? You're my fan.

459
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,610
Let's forget about my embarrassing past.

460
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
What?

461
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,490
You know how people change
who they like overnight.

462
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,130
Gosh, these flowers are so pretty.

463
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,000
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

464
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,200
I'm glad you like them.

465
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,200
Stop smiling at just anyone.

466
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,510
People will get the wrong idea.

467
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
What?

468
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,910
I'll get going.

469
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,880
It's late, so you should go in soon.

470
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
You too.

471
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,590
What's wrong with him?

472
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,730
I think I know why.

473
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,730
You know why?

474
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,140
Yes.

475
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,400
What do you know?

476
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,170
Do you really not know?

477
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
That kid

478
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,410
likes you.

479
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
What?

480
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,050
Gosh, that's nonsense.

481
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,590
He's not at an age to consider things
and like someone.

482
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,570
I'm here, Si-ah.

483
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Welcome.

484
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,010
What's wrong? Did something happen?

485
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,380
What do you think about Woo-young?

486
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,920
Go Woo-young?

487
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,780
Do you

488
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,750
like Go Woo-young?

489
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,390
- I can't like him anymore.
- Why?

490
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,130
I confessed my feelings,
and he rejected me.

491
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,030
Woo-young likes you, Si-ah.

492
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
What?

493
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,040
<i>I can't figure out how you feel.</i>

494
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,710
What do you mean you can't figure out?

495
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,710
It's obvious he likes you.

496
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
Right?

497
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,980
I'm not okay with it.

498
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,050
This is upsetting.

499
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,420
What are you staring at?

500
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,690
How beautiful.

501
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,460
<i>No way. Does Woo-young really like me?</i>

502
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,370
You'll catch a cold
if you get rained on.

503
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,570
You look pretty enough.

504
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,700
You look beautiful.

505
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,770
Are you sure you're taking it well?

506
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,610
<i>Then that was all because he likes me?</i>

507
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,910
What's wrong with you two?

508
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,980
<i>Is it best to just avoid him?</i>

509
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,050
<i>How is that possible?</i>

510
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,460
<i>I bump into him every single day.</i>

511
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,090
<i>Hold on. Why am I contemplating this?</i>

512
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,330
<i>- Right. I'm sure he doesn't like me.
- Right. I'm sure he doesn't like me.</i>

513
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,430
<i>It's true that I like you, you fool!</i>

514
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,370
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my gosh!

515
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,240
You surprised me.

516
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,610
Why are you guys overreacting?

517
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,240
He made it so obvious that he likes her.

518
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,410
I'm going to my room to get some rest.

519
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,150
Me too.

520
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,160
What's wrong with them?

521
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,730
Meet someone else.

522
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,940
I can't. I don't get butterflies
when I see other women.

523
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,200
Goodness. How is that possible?

524
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,510
It's true.

525
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,280
I don't get butterflies
when I see other women.

526
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,150
What will you do if I seduce you?

527
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,410
Will you give up on her?

528
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,350
Am I crazy to get seduced by you?

529
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,750
That will never happen.

530
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,190
Oh, is that so?

531
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,030
<i>If you got butterflies...</i>

532
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,040
But do you like that woman that much?

533
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,970
Saying I like her isn't enough.

534
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
Ms. Ok is too good for me.

535
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,050
What's wrong with you?

536
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,920
I think you're quite manly.

537
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,820
Me?

538
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,560
When you rescued me
from my ex-boyfriend,

539
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,660
you looked really reliable.

540
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
I did?

541
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,540
It made me think that

542
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,570
I'd like to lean on you
from time to time.

543
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,710
You're a good guy.

544
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,480
Be confident.

545
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,190
Okay. Thank you.

546
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
No need.

547
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,490
Excuse me for a minute.

548
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,830
Oh, my.

549
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,920
<i>If you got butterflies,
meet someone else.</i>

550
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,460
Hey!

551
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,190
Hey!

552
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,840
Hey, Chu Ae-rin.
How dare you try to seduce me?

553
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,510
You said you don't get butterflies.

554
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,880
But you fell for it.

555
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,840
No. It's not true!

556
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,950
Excuse me. The elevator stopped.

557
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,790
<i>Okay. I'll go right up.</i>

558
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,220
Goodness.

559
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,930
I can't breathe.

560
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,370
What?

561
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,000
I have a trauma.

562
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,470
Oh, my.

563
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,650
My friend isn't breathing.
Please help us!

564
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,090
<i>Pardon? Then give him CPR.</i>

565
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,090
I don't want to!

566
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,890
<i>It will take some time for
the rescue workers to get here.</i>

567
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,220
<i>Hurry up and do it.
If not, he could die.</i>

568
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,680
Deok-jin. I'm sorry.

569
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,220
I really can't bring myself to do it.

570
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,120
What are we going to do now?

571
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,920
Are you okay?

572
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,490
What are you doing here?

573
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,060
Is this a dream?

574
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,160
Or am I dead?

575
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,660
What are you talking about?

576
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,700
Mr. Go.

577
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,670
Are you okay?

578
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,000
This is the hospital.

579
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,510
Ms. Ok.

580
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,650
Do you know how worried I was?

581
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,350
You were worried?

582
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,950
You should lie down some more.

583
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,550
The doctor said you need to get rest.

584
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,020
But how did you know to come here?

585
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,060
Oh, your friend called me

586
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,960
and told me that you suddenly collapsed.

587
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,260
My friend?

588
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,120
<i>Why is he here from so early
in the morning?</i>

589
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,550
<i>Is he really here because of me?</i>

590
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,020
<i>He's crazy!</i>

591
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Hey!

592
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,790
- Hello.
- Hi.

593
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,370
<i>This won't do. I need to draw the line.</i>

594
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,600
What are you doing here so early?

595
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,310
Here.

596
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,380
What is this?
Why are you giving it to me?

597
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,210
It's Si-woo's clothes
I borrowed yesterday.

598
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,410
You didn't have to bring them
so early in the morning.

599
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,750
That's unnecessary for both of us.

600
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,320
What's wrong with you?

601
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,420
<i>You're only here for that?</i>

602
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,320
<i>What a lame excuse.</i>

603
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,690
I'm late. I'll get going.

604
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,300
What's wrong with her?

605
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,540
She must be mad because she's late.
You should get to school.

606
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,740
- You can give that to me.
- All right.

607
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,140
Thank you.

608
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,680
<i>What is he doing here?
Is he here to see me?</i>

609
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,610
<i>He's crazy!</i>

610
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,250
Si-ah, you're not late for once.

611
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,990
Why do you care if I'm late or not?

612
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,520
Why do you have to talk like that?
That's so mean.

613
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,730
<i>Why is he paying attention
to every word I say?</i>

614
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,360
<i>That's so overwhelming!</i>

615
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,330
You find everything mean.

616
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,970
What's wrong
with the mother and the daughter?

617
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,170
I'm sorry, did you wait for a long time?

618
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,440
Not at all.

619
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,350
- We'll be heading to school now.
- All right.

620
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,280
- See you later.
- Have a good day.

621
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,020
- Did you have breakfast?
- Not yet.

622
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,050
- You shouldn't skip breakfast.
- I'm hungry.

623
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,030
Those two look alike.

624
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,570
Hello.

625
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,280
Hey, how did it go with the lady
last night?

626
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,610
It went well, right?

627
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,050
No.

628
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,110
No?

629
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:12,280
How did you ruin it this time?

630
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,990
It's nothing like that.

631
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,420
Why not?

632
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,230
You're so worried for me,

633
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,200
but we still can't date?

634
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,730
I'm sorry.

635
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,870
I've thought about it, and as a teacher,

636
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,470
it'd just be so morally wrong of me
to date a student's parent.

637
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,310
Please understand me.

638
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,440
I hope you get better.

639
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,290
That's so unfair!

640
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,990
You're not even a real parent.

641
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,930
Why can't you tell her the truth?

642
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,270
How can I do that?
What would that make of Dae-young?

643
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,270
Goodness.

644
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,070
Such a loyal friend you are.

645
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,670
Give up on her, then.

646
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,070
I can't do that!

647
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,080
There's no other way.

648
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,480
Just give up!

649
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,350
- I can't!
- Just give up!

650
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,450
No!

651
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,920
My love is sincere!

652
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,260
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

653
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,170
<i>No way! I didn't know Mr. Go
was so straightforward.</i>

654
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,630
<i>Exactly. Those two look great together.</i>

655
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,370
<i>Right? I hope things work out
between them.</i>

656
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,080
The preparation for the launch party
for the new game tonight

657
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,550
is going well, right?

658
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

659
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,980
Everyone
from famous social media influencers

660
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,650
to our game's model, Ye Ji-hoon
will be present,

661
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,090
so please make sure everything is good.

662
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,920
- Yes.
- One more thing.

663
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,860
There will be an important event
at the party tonight.

664
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,260
What event?

665
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Confession.

666
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,100
I'm going to make a proper confession.

667
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,240
Good luck, Mr. Go!

668
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,270
We'll help you out! You can do it!

669
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,410
Let's go!

670
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,980
- No more being single for Mr. Go!
- No more being single for Mr. Go!

671
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,080
- No more being single for Mr. Go!
- Thanks, everyone.

672
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,080
You'll finally have someone!

673
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,390
<i>Ms. Ok, please give me one last chance
to say something to you.</i>

674
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,430
<i>Please attend the party tonight.</i>

675
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,900
<i>Sparta: The King of War,
A new world will open.</i>

676
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,710
Amazing!

677
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,750
Hello.

678
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,880
Good luck to the awesome game!

679
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,250
Nice to meet you.

680
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,890
Please give lots of support to Sparta
by downloading and playing the game!

681
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,990
Enjoy the night!

682
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:09,860
This is so nice.

683
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,930
Look at Ye Ji-hoon!

684
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,520
Deok-jin sure knows
how to throw a party.

685
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,260
He's one of the better ones
among all the anime lovers.

686
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,290
- Look.
- It's Ye Ji-hoon!

687
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,490
It's Ye Ji-hoon!

688
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,430
My goodness.
Ye Ji-hoon looks so hot in person.

689
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,730
He can destroy Persia
just with his entrance.

690
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,870
Is he that handsome?

691
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,310
You've interviewed him so many times,
and you haven't noticed?

692
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,810
- Look at him.
- Unbelievable.

693
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,040
If he wears a cape, he'd be Leonidas I.

694
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,610
"Sparta!"

695
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,350
Hey!

696
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,620
He's so handsome.

697
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,020
You look so much better in real life!

698
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,550
- Just look at him!
- He looks so good.

699
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,020
- What a good-looking man.
- Indeed.

700
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,230
- He looks great in the suit.
- You look great.

701
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,830
You look so handsome!

702
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,900
- He's smiling!
- He's so handsome!

703
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,870
- Hello, Ms. Jung.
- Hi.

704
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,370
Your photos look great.

705
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,580
- I'm a fan.
- Thank you.

706
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,410
All my fans are so beautiful.

707
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,280
He's a very honest man.

708
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,090
It's my boss.

709
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,460
Da-jung, I need to take this.

710
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,160
- See you later.
- All right.

711
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,630
What a fun friend you have.

712
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,300
And you look beautiful, as always.

713
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,140
You're being honest, right?

714
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,540
Of course I am.

715
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,740
My lips would be crooked
if I were lying right now.

716
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,180
I knew it.

717
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,890
Mr. Ye, it's time to head
to your signing event.

718
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:14,950
All right.

719
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,660
Enjoy the party.

720
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
Oh, my.

721
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,240
I thought he wasn't coming.
Why is he here?

722
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,190
Did she not see me?

723
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,090
Why is he following me around?

724
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,000
No, that's not it...

725
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,060
What?

726
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,030
No! She can't swim!

727
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,640
Gosh.

728
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,480
It's a really shallow pool.

729
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,760
Goodness.

730
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,860
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

731
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,030
Yes, I'm fine.

732
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,040
Yes.

733
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,130
Darn it.

734
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,270
You said you weren't coming.
But here you are.

735
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,900
I didn't come here to see you.

736
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,170
Then, did you come here to see Ms. Jung?

737
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,010
Of course...

738
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,710
Why does that matter to you?

739
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,150
It does

740
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
because

741
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:35,790
I like Ms. Jung.

742
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,730
If you're pursuing her
because you're undergoing puberty,

743
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,700
I hope you stop here.

744
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:49,900
Because

745
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,070
I like Ms. Jung.

746
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,980
If you're pursuing her
because you're undergoing puberty,

747
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:59,680
I hope you stop here.

748
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,620
Whatever.

749
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,860
Mr. Ye.

750
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,300
What you're seeing isn't everything.

751
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,370
Pick your match carefully.

752
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
Okay?

753
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,490
How cute.

754
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,870
I can't believe this.
I'll get to see Ji-hoon in person!

755
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,030
My heart is pounding so fast.

756
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
Right.

757
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,510
What? Woo-young is here too.

758
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,370
Woo-young?

759
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,740
Gosh, I was right.
He does have a crush on you

760
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,310
seeing how he followed you here.

761
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,750
Gosh, I told you he doesn't.

762
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,250
His dad's company
is launching this game.

763
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,690
He's here to see his dad.

764
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,860
Don't deny it. It is so obvious
that he likes you.

765
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,330
Look at him. He's coming here.

766
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,430
- Give me a second, Bo-bae.
- Okay.

767
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,500
Let's talk.

768
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,510
What?

769
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,420
- Bo-bae.
- What? Hello.

770
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
Hi.

771
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,150
Well,

772
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,390
it's about what you
just said. Is it true?

773
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,220
What did I just say?

774
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,260
I see. That Woo-young
has a crush on Si-ah?

775
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:59,630
Yes. Does Woo-young really like Si-ah?

776
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,170
Yes. He takes
such good care of her at school.

777
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,700
He makes it so obvious.

778
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:05,370
Really?

779
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,680
No, Mother.

780
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:14,480
"Mother"? I get that you like Si-ah.

781
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,850
How could you call me Mother
when you're still in school?

782
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,850
My gosh. I'm so silly.

783
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,290
It was a misunderstanding.

784
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,160
Woo-young. I'll be blunt.

785
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,430
Do you like me?

786
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,940
Of course, I do.

787
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,580
We're friends.

788
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,450
- "Friends"?
- Yes.

789
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,480
I knew it. I knew I was right.

790
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,790
Thank you.

791
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,120
"Thank you"?

792
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,330
Yes. Come to think of it,

793
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,460
you've been nice to me
on so many occasions.

794
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,100
I don't think I could have
a better friend than you.

795
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,170
On that note,

796
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,270
I hope we can be
good friends here on out.

797
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,640
"Friends"?

798
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:16,940
Yes.

799
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,780
I'll try to be a good friend to you too.

800
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:25,480
<i>Si-ah finally accepted me as her friend.</i>

801
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,120
<i>Not just any friend at that,
but a good friend.</i>

802
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,730
- I'll take photos now.
- How handsome.

803
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,016
<i>Sparta: The King of War,
A new world will open.</i>

804
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,060
- Gosh, this is amazing.
- Goodness.

805
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,070
- Hello.
- Hey.

806
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,400
You're here, Si-ah.

807
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,470
You remember my name?

808
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,940
Of course, I do.

809
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,840
Did you bring your friend?

810
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,640
Yes. You got me the tickets,
so I brought my friend with me.

811
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

812
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,180
Let's go.

813
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,690
He's so hot!

814
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:05,120
Gosh. I don't get
why Si-ah likes that jerk so much.

815
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,100
Woo-young.

816
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,740
Can we talk for a moment?

817
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:35,720
I'm sorry

818
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,490
for treating you
so harshly this morning.

819
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,800
You took care

820
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,800
of Si-ah when she was sick.

821
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,070
And you helped Si-woo
with his basketball too.

822
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,710
Whenever I was feeling down,
you comforted me.

823
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:57,640
You were always nice to me.

824
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:01,850
I'm sorry.

825
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,620
And

826
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,090
thank you.

827
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,520
Don't mention it.

828
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,830
Did I

829
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,530
offend you in any way?

830
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,760
No.

831
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,040
Just because.

832
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,670
When I see you,

833
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,270
I'm reminded of my past.

834
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,380
Did you

835
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,950
hate me because I resembled Mr. Hong?

836
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,390
"Hate"? No.

837
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,960
How could I?

838
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,790
He's someone I ought to apologize to.

839
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,500
Don't you

840
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,270
resent Mr. Hong?

841
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,940
No way.

842
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,780
There are so many things
I can thank him for.

843
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,090
What?

844
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,290
It's a half-moon.

845
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,560
Yes, it is.

846
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,570
It's exactly half.

847
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,700
It's been a while

848
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,840
since I saw a half-moon.

849
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,880
I hope

850
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,220
the other half is doing okay.

851
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,160
Even if I can't see it,

852
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,340
I hope it's doing well.

853
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,967
<i>Epilogue</i>
I would like to

854
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,160
thank everyone for coming
to the launch party of Sparta,

855
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,700
Go Go Play's new game.
Thank you, everyone.

856
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,070
Today's event is over.

857
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,710
But there is a very special event.

858
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,240
- Gosh.
- I am going to

859
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,950
publicly confess my feelings
to someone at this very event.

860
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:27,120
As all of you here know,

861
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,990
I'm a huge fan of games.

862
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,160
In other words,
I'm what you call, a successful fan.

863
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,590
People around me were
very concerned about me

864
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,160
as I was a hardcore gamer.

865
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:38,800
They were worried that
I was too caught up in my own world

866
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,530
and that I might not be able to
love anyone.

867
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,000
But

868
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,240
you changed me.

869
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,270
I was so comfortable
living in my own world,

870
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,610
but thanks to you,

871
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,450
I was able to come out
into a bigger world.

872
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,320
I still have a lot to learn,

873
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,550
- but I want to make an effort for you.
- That's so cool.

874
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,690
Please go out with me.

875
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,690
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

876
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,060
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

877
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,930
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

878
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,140
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

879
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,510
- Well...
- What are you doing here?

880
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,820
Exactly. Why am I here?

881
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,120
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

882
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:35,720
Ms. Ok...

883
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,220
- Ms. Ok!
- Hey!

884
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:41,390
Wait.

885
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:44,560
I think we messed it up.

886
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:45,960
Oh, no. What do we do?

887
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,430
Ms. Ok.

888
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,430
Ms. Ok, wait.

889
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:51,770
Is that why you wanted me to come?

890
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,040
- It's not what you think.
- Of course, it is.

891
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,610
You have it all wrong!

892
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:58,740
There must have been a misunderstanding.

893
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,450
He and I have been friends for 20 years.

894
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,350
We're practically like brothers.

895
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:07,150
And I'm rooting for you two
to become a couple.

896
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,860
- Is that true?
- Of course.

897
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,390
When you got up on the stage,

898
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,660
I was going to give this ring to you.

899
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,860
That's...

900
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,830
It was hard,
