You said it wasn't broken!

180
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,730
The cost for coming here
and repair costs are separate.

181
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,500
Then you should've told me this
in advance.

182
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,270
Do you want to get a zero
in your service ratings?

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,610
I'm sorry, ma'am.

184
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,720
What is this smell?

185
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,750
- Pardon?
- Your feet smell so much.

186
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,860
I was wondering why I smelled garbage!
It was me.

187
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,930
Gosh, do you have any common sense?

188
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,410
You'll get a call later
asking if everything was fixed well.

189
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,680
Please give me a ten out of ten.

190
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,450
Okay.

191
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,250
Can you throw this out for me?

192
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,590
I really feel like working today.

193
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,490
Sir, everything has been fixed.

194
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,500
Where did he go?

195
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,370
Gosh. I thought it was a real raccoon.

196
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,800
That surprised me.

197
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,170
"Do you want to be young again?"

198
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,340
Why bother asking?
Of course I want to be young again.

199
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,950
Gosh, he must have his doctorate.

200
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,680
He even has a lot of medicine.

201
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:42,395
<i>"A Drug That Buys Youth",
"The Time of Reverting Cells"</i>

202
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,690
He must really like raccoons.
There's another one here.

203
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,790
Did you fix everything?

204
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,830
Yes, sir. I fixed everything.

205
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,060
Is that so?
Then fix this one for me too.

206
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,530
I'm sorry, sir.
I only fix washing machines.

207
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,750
I fixed it, sir.

208
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,550
You're good at fixing things.

209
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,150
Why do you only fix washing machines?

210
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,450
I think you'd be good
at fixing everything.

211
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,860
I can fix almost everything.

212
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,390
I wish I could fix
my life like this too.

213
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,670
Do you want me to fix it for you?

214
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,250
Thank you.

215
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,020
However, it's my life,

216
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,990
so I should fix it myself.

217
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,760
Is that so?

218
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,300
- Open up.
- Open up.

219
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,100
- You're eating so well, my daughter.
- Goodness.

220
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,970
- Son, do you want to have some too?
- You're eating so well.

221
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,670
Have some fishcakes too.

222
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,640
Have this too.

223
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,210
You're eating well.

224
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,220
Hey Si-ah, you said today was
Foundation Day at your school, right?

225
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,920
Come out with Si-woo.
Let's get something to eat.

226
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Yes.

227
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,300
Si-ah, have some meat. It's expensive.

228
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,240
Gosh, why is my nose bridge so low?

229
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,910
- Should I get a nose job?
- What did you just say?

230
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,880
I told you not to touch my nose!

231
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,680
- My nose.
- Enough of that.

232
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,580
Didn't I tell you? When you go out into
society, there are three types of people.

233
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,590
Those who do really well, those who
do well, and those who just do.

234
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,920
If you don't study,
and focus only on your looks...

235
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll just enter society.

236
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,120
I see you're well aware.

237
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,360
What about your future?
Is there anything you want to do?

238
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,660
No.

239
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,900
Oh, right. Si-woo, are you really
not going to play basketball?

240
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,700
You were good at basketball
when you were younger.

241
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,140
I'm not interested.

242
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,870
What on earth are
you guys interested in?

243
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,080
Are you going to waste your good years
by doing nothing?

244
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,420
Si-ah, Si-woo. You guys don't need to
worry about your mom and me divorcing.

245
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,250
My promotion will be announced today.

246
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,520
If I get promoted, your mom
will have a change of heart too.

247
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,590
I had a dream about a fire.

248
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Do you think it was a dream
about your promotion?

249
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,560
Did you get rid of the fire or not?

250
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,960
I didn't.

251
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,370
Then it's settled.
Sell that dream to me.

252
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,670
Okay. Give me 50,000 won.

253
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,010
Gosh. It's a dream for your promotion.

254
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,940
You should pay at least 50,000 won.

255
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,880
Fine, since I'm in a good mood.

256
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,380
Hey, Bo-bae. Over here.

257
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,359
- Hello, Mr. Hong.
- Hi.

258
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
Did you eat?

259
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,099
Bo-bae, you're a student. Don't you
think you're wearing too much makeup?

260
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,170
A student should look like a student.

261
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,200
- Right.
- Stop it already.

262
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,609
If you worked out as much as you nagged,
you'd be muscular.

263
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,940
I have plans with Bo-bae, so I'm going.
Enjoy your meal.

264
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Si-ah, you should eat first.

265
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,410
It's expensive meat!

266
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,160
How is your mom these days?

267
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,590
She's really depressed, right?

I feel like I'm releasing my stress.

286
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,700
Should we all learn together?

287
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,800
Da-jung is great at dancing.

288
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,500
She was good at boxing last time too.

289
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,570
Is there anything she can't do?

290
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,440
Regardless, she's still just a mom.

291
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,780
- Good job everyone.
- Good job.

292
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,720
Ms. Jung Da-jung?

293
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,060
- Yes, Director.
- Say hello.

294
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,030
She will be taking over
your position from now on.

295
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,760
Hello.

296
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,630
Then what about my position?

297
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
It's at home. You're a housewife.

298
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,070
Gosh, Director.

299
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,170
Who's ever born to be a wife?

300
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,040
Were you born a producer at birth, too?

301
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,870
Your kids are in grade 12.

302
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,940
It's an important time for them to focus
on their studies,

303
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,110
so how interruptive would it be
if you sang and danced on TV

304
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,580
just because you want to be a reporter?

305
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,080
They're still in grade 11.

306
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,620
You're being greedy.

307
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,260
There's a different reason
why I'm being fired, isn't there?

308
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,890
What?

309
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,990
When you got drunk the last staff dinner

310
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,030
and forcefully hugged
the youngest staff,

311
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,530
I called you out on it.

312
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,230
Aren't I being fired because of that?

313
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,070
You're infuriating me.

314
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,770
You think you can say whatever you want?

315
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,770
Your job is so easy for you, isn't it?

316
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,440
You think I'll be a little kinder to you
just because you have kids?

317
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,080
Goodness.

318
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,180
<i>Employee of the Month
Hong Dae-young</i>

319
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,450
This is all a reward for your hard work.

320
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,660
The day has finally come.

321
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,120
May I say with caution,

322
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,590
congratulations, Department Head Hong!

323
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,960
Don't make a big deal out of it.

324
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,360
He's coming.

325
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,140
Everyone, thank you so much
for all of your hard work this quarter.

326
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,470
Let's give a round of applause

327
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,710
to all the engineers
that worked diligently

328
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,340
to get a promotion that only comes
every five years!

329
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,610
Congratulations!

330
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,420
I will now announce

331
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,560
the new department head.

332
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,060
Congratulations,

333
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,930
- Hong Dae-young.
- Yes, sir.

<i>Seongjong Electronics Service Center</i>

335
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,600
Could you please step aside?

336
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,670
Sure.

337
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,710
Congratulations
to Engineer Kim Hyeon-cheol.

338
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,340
Me?

<i>Best service,

341
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,520
And I have an announcement.

342
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,020
- Hong Dae-young,
- Yes, sir?

343
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,920
you're being relocated
to the Busan branch.

344
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,360
- Sorry?
- Let's go out for dinner now!

345
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,600
Let's have meat.

346
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,260

Thank you.

I should call you
Department Head Kim now!

350
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,180
How can he become the department head
when he's been here for only four years?

351
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,620
He's the branch manager's nephew.

352
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,490
It's so unfortunate for people like us,
who don't have connections.

353
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,890
At least we're better off

354
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,260
than Dae-young.

355
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,330
Sir.

356
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,600
Keep drinking.

357
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,040
What now?

358
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,910
How could I have worked for ten years

359
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,920
and still be a regular employee?

360
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,620
Your wage is still increasing.

361
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,920
You promised me that I'd get promoted
every five years.

362
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,590
You said that it's a low wage,
but with a lot of potentials,

363
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,460
I could hold onto.
That's been ten years!

364
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,130
Everything changes within three years
nowadays.

365
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,030
Did I expect so many university
graduates to come for us?

366
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,700
Hyeon-cheol graduated from a university.

367
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,240
You have to make way for him
since you only graduated high school.

368
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,910
Then can you at least

369
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,380
stop my relocation to Busan?

370
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,910
You know that I'm going
through a divorce right now!

371
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,380
Things are really over
if I move to Busan.

372
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,780
If you're so desperate,

373
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,790
why have you been skipping out
on our staff dinners?

374
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,790
Pardon?

375
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,960
I know this is an electronics company,

376
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,830
but it's a company after all!

377
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,730
If you're lacking in education,
you should've worked on your connections!

378
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,100
You think capable people are
just good at what they do?

379
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,110
You told me a month ago
that if I fulfill my share of work,

380
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,540
I'd certainly be promoted!

381
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,710
Come on!

382
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,310
Are you really going
to get so worked up,

383
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,420
just because your junior got promoted
faster than you did?

384
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,650
I worked really hard.

385
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,660
I've been treating this job
like my job for life,

386
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,260
letting customers push me around,
holding their reviews over my head,

387
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,230
spent many days putting my own money
into the repairs,

388
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,960
and have gone through thick and thin

389
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,430
in the past ten years.

390
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,870
So, why can't I get promoted?

391
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
Why am I being relocated?

392
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,840
Hong Dae-young,
this personality of yours

393
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,380
is why your life is such a mess.

394
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,550
You always do things that you'll regret.

395
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,250
Calm down.

396
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,460
It makes sense how you had
an accidental baby when you were young.

397
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,570
I'm only holding back

398
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,940
for my family.

399
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,740
Family? Gosh.

400
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,980
How pathetic for a woman and a child
to depend on a man like that?

401
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,580
They're obviously failures in life.

402
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,620
Let's keep on drinking.

403
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
You!

404
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,360
I am

405
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,600
quitting today!

406
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,020
Did you just finish work?

407
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,460
Did you drink again?

408
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,000
Should I get on my knees?

409
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,270
Why should you?

410
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,470
Because I did you wrong.

411
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,540
What did you do wrong?

412
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
You didn't get promoted,

413
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,080
did you?

414
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,560
It never mattered, anyway.

415
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,260
You know that tomorrow is
our first settlement meeting, right?

416
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,900
I'll see you at court.

417
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,630
Da-jung,

418
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,400

- Go out with me.
- What?

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,030
What was that?
That was too easy for you.

431
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,630
Easy, my foot.

432
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,200
Gosh.

433
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720

00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,080
What was that all of a sudden?

438
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,360
Did it go in or not?

439
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,400
Hey, kid. What are you doing there?

440
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,830
- Get out of here!
- I'm sorry!

of getting rid of my belly fat.

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,140
- I hope you have no regrets.
- Calm down.

monster I've kept deep down inside me.

520

00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,150
Hey.

534
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,510
Hey.

535
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,780
Hey.

536
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,960
You!

537
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,730
You!

538
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,460
No!

540
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,900
Don't call him.

541
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,170
If he finds out I'm working here,
he'll throw a fit.

542
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,770
He's not even answering anyway.

543
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,570
Gosh, it's so obvious.

544
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,070
He's probably busy
hanging out with Deok-jin.

545
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,610
Hey.

546
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,650
Gosh.

547
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,990
Do you seriously think
I'll believe that you're Dae-young?

548
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,620
Dae-young is...

549
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,130
<i>Deok-jin, it's me. Dae-young.</i>

550
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,460
<i>I'm Hong Dae-young.</i>

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,100
<i>I'm really Dae-young.</i>

552
00:38:48,098 --> 00:38:50,598
How is your hairstyle
exactly the same as when you were 18?

553
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:53,198
Have you been exposed to gamma rays
at work?

554
00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:54,768
I fix washing machines.

555
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,638
Are any of your ancestors
Dracula or a cyborg?

556
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,208
Enough already.

557
00:38:58,368 --> 00:38:59,378
Really?

558
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,238
If none of these applies to you...

559
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,338
That's right.

560
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:05,778
Did you partake in an experiment
or take any drugs?

561
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:06,948
I told you that was enough.

562
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:09,288
I didn't partake in an experiment
nor did I take any drugs.

563
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,688
After I lost my job, I was depressed,

564
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,318
so I went to shoot some hoops.

565
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:14,758
My gosh.

566
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:17,428
School?

567
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:24,498
So you're saying
you threw the ball and made a wish

568
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,068
and that wish came true?

569
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:27,298
Yes.

570
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,408
I said if it goes it, I'll go back.

571
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:32,338
Really?

572
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:39,818
It's really hard.

573
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,848
It makes sense to fulfill a wish
after getting it in.

574
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,148
The power went out suddenly,

575
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:46,818
so I don't know if it really went in.

576
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,388
Either way, after that moment,
people started calling me a student.

577
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,928
It all worked out then.
You always said you wanted to go back.

578
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,698
I was talking about going back home.

579
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:56,598
Having a younger body
is 5.005 trillion times better

580
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:58,098
than going back home.

581
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:01,468
If I were you,
I'd get naked and start dancing.

582
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:03,868
You've received a divine gift,
and if you don't unwrap it,

583
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:05,668
the divinity would feel awkward too.

584
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:07,478

585
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:09,978

an age full of dreams and hope.

00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,918
Yes, I look forward
to being in your class.

711
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,158
See you tomorrow!

712
00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:44,588
Bye now.

713
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,058
See you tomorrow!

714
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:51,468
- Bye now.
- Thank you!

715
00:48:53,668 --> 00:48:56,408
What a strange man.

716
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:10,048
I missed this smell.

717
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:21,858
Get ready and come out.

718
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:25,698
How is Si-ah late every morning?

719
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,638
You're so cold.

720
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:32,768
You know that today is
my final interview, right?

721
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:36,108
How do I look today?

722
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:38,648
- Your makeup is cakey.
- Really?

723
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:41,378
That's not good.

724
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:48,458
Sir,

725
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:52,328
she's pregnant. Could you give her
your seat please?

726
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:57,428
If you're pregnant, stay home.

727
00:49:57,498 --> 00:50:00,068
Why do you need to be a nuisance
to society by going out?

728
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:04,968
- He's insane.
- How could you say such a thing?

729
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:06,208
I'm fine.

730
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,108
How dare you treat
your elders like this?

731
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:11,978
Kids these days are so rude.

732
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:13,878
I can't just watch this.

733
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,818
Come on.

734
00:50:22,488 --> 00:50:25,288
What's wrong with a pregnant man
wanting to sit

735
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,198
on a seat reserved for pregnant women?

736
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:32,068
Look at his belly. It's nice and plump.

737
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:34,038
It's definitely going to be a daughter.

738
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:37,568
What?

739
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,378
How dare you make fun
of an elder like that?

740
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:41,708
It's fine.

741
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:43,578
Stay seated.

742
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:46,878
You seem like you're due soon,
judging from your big belly.

743
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:50,918
Thanks and congratulations on contributing
to highering the low birth rate.

744
00:50:50,988 --> 00:50:52,018
That's hilarious.

745
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:55,918
How is a kid so clever?

746
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:56,988
Driver!

747
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,228
I'm getting off.

748
00:50:59,728 --> 00:51:01,858
How annoying.

749
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:03,968
I hope your birthing goes well!

750
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,238
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

751
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,608
No, you are entitled to that seat.

752
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:12,968
The kid is full of surprises.

753
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:53,978
Everyone,

754
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:56,688
you know that the English assessment is
due today, right?

755
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:58,118
I'll be collecting them after this.

756
00:51:58,188 --> 00:51:59,958
- Come on.
- Really?

757
00:52:16,668 --> 00:52:19,108
He said,
"Congratulations on your pregnancy."

758
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,078
It was so satisfying to watch.

759
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,308
But his face looks even more satisfying.

760
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:27,078
His face is so refreshing to see!

761
00:52:28,118 --> 00:52:29,548
Quiet.

762
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:31,948
We have a new student today.

763
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:34,918
Come in.

764
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,688
It's Sprite.

765
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:08,718
Si-ah, wake up!

766
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:10,528
It's him!

767
00:53:11,228 --> 00:53:14,628
Even dogs don't bother another dog
when they're asleep.

768
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:15,698
Nice to meet you.

769
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:18,728
- Please introduce yourself.
- Yes.

770
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:26,108
Hello, I'm Hong Dae...

771
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,208
No,

772
00:53:29,908 --> 00:53:31,048
I'm Go Woo-young.

773
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,448
I'm 18...

774
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,548
I'm 18 years old.

775
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:41,118
Nice to meet you all!

776
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,288
No!

777
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:48,298
Hong Si-ah, you just wait there.

778
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,228
I'm going to come back
once I sort this through!

779
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,568
That punk!

780
00:53:57,208 --> 00:54:00,208
Hong Si-ah! Watch your language.

781
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:13,818
Woo-young was homeschooled,

782
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:17,028
so he's new to being at school.
Please be kind and help him out.

783
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,428
- Okay.
- Okay.

784
00:54:19,228 --> 00:54:20,628
Would you like to sit over there?

785
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:22,058
Sure.

786
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,168
Ji-ho, please take good care of him
as the class president.

787
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,168
Yes, ma'am.

788
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:27,338
Have a great day, everyone.

789
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:29,138
- Okay!
- Okay!

790
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,368
Why is that lunatic here?

791
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:33,538
Lunatic?

792
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:35,908
He's completely insane!

793
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,478
This is bad.

794
00:54:57,398 --> 00:54:58,728
You're Seo Ji-ho, right?

795
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:01,868
You grew so much in the time
I haven't seen you for!

796
00:55:02,868 --> 00:55:04,468
- You know me?
- Of course.

797
00:55:04,538 --> 00:55:06,108
You're my Si-ah's friend.

798
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:09,908
- "My Si-ah"?
- Yes.

799
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:12,778
Did you also go
to Pungin Elementary School?

800
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:16,748
Yes.

801
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,448
I guess we went to the same school.

802
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:20,818
Let me know if you need any help.

803
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:22,518
Thank you.

804
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:24,988
Nice to meet you.

805
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:26,898
Sure.

806
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:30,028
Look at you.

807
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:40,808
<i>JBC Anchor Blind Hiring</i>

808
00:55:42,978 --> 00:55:45,078
<i>JBC Anchor Blind Hiring</i>

809
00:55:53,888 --> 00:55:57,528
Silla had the bone-rank system
and the hwarang system,

810
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:00,498
and residents of Silla were

811
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:04,198
controlled by the bone-rank system.

812
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:06,568
What's the bone-rank system?

813
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:07,668
Oh, no.

814
00:56:09,638 --> 00:56:11,508
Hey!

815
00:56:13,268 --> 00:56:15,838
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm just going to the bathroom.

816
00:56:22,648 --> 00:56:25,118
Seems like we have
a real idiot in class.

817
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,318
The bone-rank system.

818
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:29,818
Yes?

819
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:31,458
You're finally picking up.

820
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:35,458
I've been busy. I'm on a work trip.

821
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:36,868
I'm in Busan right now.

822
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:39,828
You sound great for someone who's busy.

823
00:56:42,638 --> 00:56:45,768
It must be the air in Busan.

824
00:56:46,638 --> 00:56:47,908
You got my text, right?

825
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,578
I know you're busy, but you have to come
to the second settlement meeting.

826
00:56:50,648 --> 00:56:53,448
If you don't come, I'll take it
that you're giving up child custody.

827
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:54,848
Who says you can do that?

828
00:56:58,118 --> 00:56:59,248
You can't take the kids.

829
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:02,258
You never even cared about the kids,
so why now?

830
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,158
What are you talking about?

831
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:12,668
You may not know,

832
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:16,568
but I'm closer to the kids
than you can ever imagine.

833
00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:29,178
- Excuse me?
- What?

834
00:57:30,718 --> 00:57:31,888
Is someone in there?

835
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:33,758
Could you open the door for me?

836
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:38,358
I heard that bullying was getting bad,
but this is terrible.

837
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,408
Thank you.

838
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,248
Who did this to you?

839
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,088
Who did this to you?

840
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:08,918
I don't think we've met.

841
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:11,388
Do we know each other?

842
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:16,758
No. I'm sorry. My name is Go Woo-young.

843
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:18,898
You know your father's friend,
Go Deok-jin?

844
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:19,968
That's my dad.

845
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,768
I didn't know he had a son.

846
00:58:23,908 --> 00:58:25,768
But he never got married.

847
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:27,978
He did. He did get married,

848
00:58:28,378 --> 00:58:30,008
but my mom wanted to keep it a secret.

849
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:32,908
I never get adults.

850
00:58:33,818 --> 00:58:35,378
Anyway, thank you.

851
00:58:35,448 --> 00:58:37,088
Don't tell other students about this.

852
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:39,948
If they find out,
they'll target you too.

853
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:41,458
They'll target me?

854
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,658
Who on earth did this to you?

855
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,458
Bye.

856
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:51,898
You should be careful too.

857
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:55,568
"Be careful"?

858
00:59:35,078 --> 00:59:36,838
Why are they bullying you?

859
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,078
Mind your own business.

860
01:00:06,908 --> 01:00:07,908
Was it him?

861
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,508
Don't look at his eyes.

862
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:13,378
Don't look at him.

863
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:31,198
Si-woo has a friend now.

864
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:43,708
A loser has friends too, I guess.

865
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:52,488
Hey!

866
01:01:00,598 --> 01:01:01,598
You come here.

867
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:25,288
Give it back.

868
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:28,218
The ball?

869
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:32,358
Sure.

870
01:01:46,438 --> 01:01:47,438
You

871
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:49,808
need a stern talking-to.

<i>Fall of 2001</i>

873
01:02:16,638 --> 01:02:17,768
<i>No.</i>

874
01:02:18,108 --> 01:02:20,508
<i>No? Are you going
to have that baby then?</i>

875
01:02:20,578 --> 01:02:22,808
You're carrying twins.

876
01:02:22,878 --> 01:02:24,508
Don't be stubborn. Get an abortion.

877
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:26,648
I'm looking out for you.

878
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:28,448
But I don't want that!

879
01:02:29,148 --> 01:02:30,648
What about college?

880
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,048
Will you live just as a mom?

881
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:36,288
Yes. I will.

882
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:40,458
You... You must be out of your mind.

883
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:42,058
You must be crazy.

884
01:02:42,128 --> 01:02:43,728
What choice do I have?

885
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:46,698
How can I get rid of them
when they are alive?

886
01:02:57,178 --> 01:02:59,178
I read it in a book

887
01:03:00,618 --> 01:03:04,288
that babies can understand
everything the parents say.

888
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:07,688
Since I'm carrying two babies,
let's double up on compliments.

889
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,218
Okay?

890
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,558
It's hard, right?

891
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:22,698
Should we

892
01:03:24,238 --> 01:03:25,768
give up the babies?

893
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:27,538
What?

894
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:32,878
We're still young.

895
01:03:32,948 --> 01:03:33,948
No.

896
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:37,618
Da-jung, let's look at our reality.

897
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,188
Our reality?
Is giving up our babies your reality?

898
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:45,328
- That's not it.
- Is it hard?

899
01:03:46,158 --> 01:03:48,728
If it is, you go on
and live your own life.

900
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:53,268
Da-jung, if you regret this later--

901
01:03:53,328 --> 01:03:54,338
I

902
01:03:56,468 --> 01:03:57,938
can feel our babies.

903
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:22,598
Call that girl now.
Let's take her to the hospital.

904
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,128
Why do you care, Dad?

905
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,328
You punk!

906
01:04:26,068 --> 01:04:28,438
You ruined your life
because I didn't care enough!

907
01:04:29,038 --> 01:04:30,838
If you want to ruin anything,
just ruin your life.

908
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:32,868
Don't ruin that poor girl's life.

909
01:05:21,788 --> 01:05:23,418
They can't hear

910
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,288
the babies' heartbeat.

911
01:05:31,368 --> 01:05:33,428
I can't conclude anything right now.

912
01:05:33,698 --> 01:05:35,268
But if this is a missed abortion,

913
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:38,738
we may have to perform
dilation and curettage.

914
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,478
I'm sorry.

915
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:53,248
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

916
01:05:58,388 --> 01:05:59,528
Daddy is

917
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:02,128
so sorry.

918
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:06,968
Daddy is sorry.

919
01:06:07,198 --> 01:06:08,268
I'm

920
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:09,998
sorry.

921
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:35,698
The babies must have heard your voices.

922
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,838
<i>Life always weighs
on a more important side.</i>

923
01:06:42,568 --> 01:06:43,798
<i>And even if the weight</i>

924
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,308
<i>made us give up a lot more,</i>

925
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:51,948
<i>we thought nothing would be
as important as having these babies.</i>

926
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:55,848
<i>And that's how</i>

927
01:06:58,048 --> 01:06:59,588
<i>we became their parents.</i>

928
01:07:19,808 --> 01:07:20,988
<i>18 Again</i>

929
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,933
<i>- You. You look familiar.
- You.</i>

930
01:07:24,003 --> 01:07:25,903
<i>He's my son.</i>

931
01:07:25,973 --> 01:07:28,243
<i>He's your son?</i>

932
01:07:28,303 --> 01:07:29,803
<i>Did you know Si-ah had a part-time job?</i>

933
01:07:29,873 --> 01:07:31,673
<i>I just knew because we're friends.</i>

934
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:32,973
<i>Because you're friends?</i>

935
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:35,013
<i>How long have they been friends?</i>

936
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,713
<i>They are more than school friends.</i>

937
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:39,213
<i>Il-kwon, that's your first love.
It's Da-jung.</i>

938
01:07:39,283 --> 01:07:41,223
<i>What a disappointment.</i>

939
01:07:41,283 --> 01:07:43,453
<i>That's a rude thing
to say to an adult.</i>

940
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:45,223
<i>You deserved it.</i>

941
01:07:45,323 --> 01:07:48,093
<i>Actually, I am...</i>
