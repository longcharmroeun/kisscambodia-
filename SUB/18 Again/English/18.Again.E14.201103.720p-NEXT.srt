Hey, my hubby.

I'm sorry to call you.
You must be tired.

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,260
We were shooting on an island.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,300
I had such a hard time
because I got seasick on the boat.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
It sounds like my wifey had a tough day.

18

Yes, it was tough

19

Anything to say to me?

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,180
Oh, right. I'm going on a business trip.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,180
For a week to Gwangju.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,120
Can you pack me
some underwear and socks?

27
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,890

28

"And"?

29
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,920
Pack my toothbrush and razor too.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,960
- Hey, Dae-young!
- Gosh, you startled me.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,490
You'll make me go deaf. What's wrong?

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,100
Is packing your bag my job?

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,300
You're not a kid.
You can pack your underwear yourself.

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,130
Why are you getting mad over that?

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,470
Is that such a hard thing to do?

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,070
It's not that.

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,170
I told you that I missed you.

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,240
But why won't you say it back?

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,479
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,480
You've changed.

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,550
Back then,

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,420
you said you missed me
even when we were together.

43

We've been together for a decade.

44
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,460
If I miss you, that would be weird.

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,900
Fine. I'm the weird one.

46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,270
It must be so hard to live with
such a weird woman.

Da-jung, what's wrong?

50
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,240
Did I do something wrong?
I didn't do anything wrong.

- Da-jung.
- Stop playing around.

Where did you get this phone?

I know it's hard to believe,

but I'm Dae-young.

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,660
On the day I got fired from my job
before our divorce

99
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,230
and I came to your house,

100
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,860
I made a wish saying that I wanted to go
back in time, and I suddenly became young.

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,570
My body got younger,

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,370
and I pretended to be Go Woo-young

103
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,940
despite being Hong Dae-young.

104

I'm sorry, Da-jung.

What?

106
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,910
Your body got younger?

107

You're really taking this too far.

108

It's true.

109
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,360
When I went to the stairs at the roof,

110
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,290
I went because I knew that's where
you go when you're having a hard time.

111
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,260
And when I kissed you,

112
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,700
- we were talking about half-moons and—
- Enough already!

113
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,870
There's a limit to what I can let go of.

114

Please believe in me, Da-jung.

115
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,080
Are you really Hong Dae-young?

Yes, I am.

117
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,290
Then

118
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,890
why did you pretend to be Go Woo-young?

119
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,660
To be honest,

120
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,870
I wanted to live my life
after my body got young again.

121
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,670
I wanted to play basketball again,

122
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,070
and I wanted to achieve my dreams.

123
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,810
But

124
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,280
I learned a lot about our kids
while going to school with them.

125
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,620
They weren't the same Si-ah
and Si-woo that I knew.

126
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,090
That's why

127
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,060
I wanted to take care of them

128
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,030
not as their dad but as their friend.

129
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,670
Our kids?

130
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,370

You're speaking complete nonsense.

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,740
I'm warning you.

132
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,940
Don't come anywhere near me or my kids.

133
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,310

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,160
I went because I knew that's where you
go when you're having a hard time.

169
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,660
And when I kissed you,

170
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,930
we were talking about half-moons and...

171
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,540
<i>But how does he know all of that?</i>

172
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,540
<i>No way.</i>

173
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,280
<i>How to get younger</i>

174
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,380
<i>"How to get younger,
the ultimate product for anti-aging"</i>

175
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,420
<i>My goodness. What am I doing right now?</i>

176
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,960
Da-jung must be really
nervous right now.

177
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,830
Nobody is in their right mind
with the announcement coming up.

178
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,730
I can't focus on preparing for
my reports or anything either.

179
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,440
And the MC of the show got changed too,

180
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,010
so I'm sure she's more worried.

181
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,480

And Changing Their Host to Kim Bit-na"</i>

182
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,020
I wanted to help her,

183
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,530
but I guess
I only made things harder for her.

184
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,710
What's with the bankbook?

185
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,410
My parents made these when I was born

186
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and recorded my life in them until now.

187
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,750
That's so cool
that you have such a bankbook.

188
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,620
I think I had a misunderstanding
about my parents until now.

189
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
Especially

190
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,420
my dad.

191
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,090
I told you, your dad is a good man.

192
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,880
I really hate him.

193
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,610
Go Woo-young?

194
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,720
Why? I think he's okay.

195
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,450
Why do you think he's okay?

196
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,860
I think

197
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,820
he's a nice guy.

198
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,790
What about you? Why don't you like him?

199
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,330
He likes you.

200
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,470
You like him too.

201
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,480
Hey! I don't like him.

202
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,280
You don't?

203
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,350
No.

204
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,390
But why would that bother you?

205
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,060
Because I like you.

206
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,330
I like you.

207
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,070
Stop joking around. That's not funny.

208
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,580
I have to get going. Bye.

209
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,610
Hey!

210
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,840
Give them to me. I'll give you a hand.

211
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,250
I'm fine. I'm almost here.

212
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,150
No, you have bad wrists.

213
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Sorry?

214
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,020
I'll take care of these.

215
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,990
Sure.

216
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,500
We're here.

217
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,900
Thank you.

218
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,070
No problem.

219
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,110
Stay healthy.

220
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,040
All right. Thanks.

221
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,280
You must be hungry.

222
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,950
Did you not have lunch?

223
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,150
I did. I had lunch.

224
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,990
Come and eat with me inside
if you haven't eaten.

225
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,530
I'm really fine. I'm not...

226
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,500
You're not very good at lying, are you?

227
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,820
I don't know if you'll like this.

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,550
Our family loves braised ribs.

229
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,090
Everyone is coming home late,
so let's eat first.

230
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,230
What are you doing? Eat up.

232
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,640
Thank you.

233
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,310
First,

234
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll make sure to pay back the rent
that you paid for me.

235
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,210
It's fine.

236
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,450
Eat up. You must be hungry.

237
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,280
You said that you love braised ribs.

238
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,220
Thank you.

239
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,860
Do you like it?

240
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,130
Yes, it's delicious.

241
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,770
It tastes just like my mom's.

242
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,780
Tell me whenever you want some.

243
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,710
I'll cook for you.

244
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,050
Thank you.

245
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,350
It's nothing.

246
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,590
Think of me as your mom from now on.

247
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,230
I'll think of you as my son too.

248
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,310
What's wrong?

250
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Well...

251
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,119
It just reminded me of my mom.

252
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Is that right?

253
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
You two even eat alike.

254
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Sorry?

255
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,180
It's nothing.

256
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,650
You just

257
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,550
remind me of my son.

258
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,480
<i>Oh, My Teacher</i>

259
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,540
<i>I miss you.</i>

260
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,580
<i>I miss you.</i>

261
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,200
Are you sad because of Ms. Ok?

262
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,000
It's really all over now.

263
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,510
So,

264
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
are you going to give up?

265
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,510
I have to.

266
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,650
There's nothing else I can do.

267
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,820
What do you mean?

268
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,150
You're just going to
give up this easily?

269
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,220
You said it was love at first sight.

270
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,560
You can't miss that

271
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,960
and regret it like me.

272
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Deok-jin,

273
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,540
don't you ever give up because of me.

274
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,560
What's wrong?

275
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm sad that I can't
see Iron Man anymore.

276
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,170
I bawled my eyes out
while watching "Avengers: Endgame".

277
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,370
I know exactly how losing
your favorite character feels like.

278
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,670
Exactly.

279
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

280
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,670
Gosh, I'm starving.

281
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,900
- Hey!
- Hi!

282
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,940
Everyone!

283
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,740
Don't you think you're
a tad bit too late?

284
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,270
Are you trying to show off
that you're successful?

285
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,310
It's the weekend.

286
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,880
My French class ran a little late.

287
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,710
You learn French? Lucky you!

288
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,680
Do you want to come with me
if you're interested?

289
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,420
No, I'm already busy
looking after my kids.

290
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,490
Right.

291
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,420
Ae-rin, are you getting married
anytime soon?

292
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,760
No, I don't plan on getting married.

293
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,630
What? You want to stay single forever?

294
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,560
If you're just using that as an excuse
because it's too late and embarrassing,

295
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,300
don't be.

296
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,200
No need to be embarrassed
in front of your old friends!

297
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,770
It's fine.

298
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,300
Is Da-jung coming?

299
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,510
You think she would? She got divorced.

300
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Why?

301
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,310
Is there a rule that you can't come
to a reunion if you're divorced?

302
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,650
It's embarrassing!

303
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,680
- What?
- To be honest,

304
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,850
I was embarrassed for her
every time she came.

305
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,290
Everyone here knows that she got
knocked up as a teen.

306
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,900
Not only that, she never got to
go to college in time,

307
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,360
married an incapable husband,
and got divorced.

308
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,670
Da-jung is really the epitome
of all things unfortunate.

309
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,070
Hey!

310
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,810
Who are you to evaluate
other people's lives?

311
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,680
Did Da-jung say that she felt unhappy?

312
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,310
Did she say that herself?

313
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,780
Do we really need to hear her say that
to know?

314
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,880
Of course!

315
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,650
You said that you wouldn't have married
your husband had it not been

316
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,090
for his money, and that his face looks
like a dumpster.

317
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,330
Fact is what comes out
of the person themselves!

318
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,030
Chu Ae-rin! We can't even worry
for our old friend?

319
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,630
Oh, old friend?

320
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,640
<i>Divorce Lawyer Chu Ae-rin</i>
I got a new name card.

321

Give me a call when you need me.

322
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,250
I'll give you an old friend discount

323
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,520

- Hey.
- What...

326
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,690
What's wrong with her?

327
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,590
Why is she causing a scene?

328

I'm never coming to a reunion again!

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,590
Let's get a beer.

333
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,730
How refreshing.

334
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,600
It's nice to drink in broad daylight.
It's been a while.

335
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,100
One more, please!

336
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,140
Did something happen
at the school reunion?

337
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,880
What? No, nothing happened.

338
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,250
I left because it was no fun.

339
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,680
Hanging out with you
is the most fun for me.

340
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,350
Same here.

341
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,450
Then, why don't we go on a trip
next weekend?

342
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,890
We can go somewhere close

343
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,530
and have a cup of coffee.

344
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,360
And let's take a lot of photos too.

345
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,930
What a surprise.
You're the busiest woman I know.

346
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,900
I wasn't the busy one between us.

347
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,470
You always said no to my offer.

348
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Right.

349
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,610
I did say no.

350
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,980
I was just kidding.

351
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,110
If you feel bad about it,
I feel bad too.

352
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,680
It's nothing. I'm just envious.

353
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,250
Of what?

354
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,150
You're free and passionate.

355
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,320
You're enjoying your life.
I'm so envious of that.

356
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Really?

357
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,960
I'm going paragliding again this time.

358
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,130
Want to join me?

359
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,700
Really?

360
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,170
Whenever you went paragliding,

361
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,100
I always wanted to go with you.

362
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,270
Join me.

363
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,640
It's my kids.

364
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,580
I can't do anything
that's physically dangerous.

365
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,480
What if I get into an accident?
What about my kids?

366
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,180
They are still in high school.

367
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,950
Gosh. You are indeed a mother.

368
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,820
Forget it. Let's just drink today.

369
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Let's do that.

370
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,970
<i>Seo Ji-ho</i>

371
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,350
Whatever.

372
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,210
That's her. Hong Si-ah.

373
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,690
What? Gu Ja-sung asked someone
like her to go out with him?

374
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,820
Whatever.

375
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,650
But she dumped him
when she looks like that.

376
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,960
My gosh. She must be
very confident of herself.

377
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,630
She must think she's pretty.

378
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,790
Exactly. She's ridiculous.

379
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,500
- Let's just ignore them.
- Right. Did you know?

380
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,760
Jung Da-jung.

381
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,430
That's her mom.

382
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,770
I see. That woman who got splashed?

383
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,570
I knew it.
She's trashy just like her mother.

384
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,810
Hey, by the way, she must think

385
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,810
having kids at an early age is
something to brag about.

386
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,380
How can she be on TV?

387
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,080
How humiliating.

388
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,020
Hey, she might hear you.

389
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,550
Seriously.

390
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,320
- What are you doing?
- I can put up with criticisms about me,

391
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,220
but not when they are about my mom.

392
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,460
Let go of me.

393
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,730
- Apologize.
- You must be out of your mind.

394
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,800
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

395
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,700
I badmouthed your mother.
I'm sorry about that.

396
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,110
Hey, are you okay?

397
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,450
Who are you?

398
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,880
Hong Si-ah?

399
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,250
You must be out of your mind.

400
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,060
You can't go like this.
Where do you think you're going?

401
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,800
If you want to leave,
kneel and apologize.

402
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,930
Then, maybe,
I'll consider letting you go.

403
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
If you want to leave,
kneel and apologize.

404
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,970
Then, maybe,
I'll consider letting you go.

405
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,880
- Let go of me.
- No.

406
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,880
Are you crazy?

407
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,880
- Gosh.
- Hey.

408
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,390
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

409
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,560
Hey, get them. Get them now!

410
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,290
Hey!

411
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,830
Darn it.

412
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,460
Hey!

413
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,430
Stop right there!

414
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,070
Hey!

415
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,840
Hey!

416
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,510
You're really not going to the PC cafe?

417
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,140
- Let's go.
- I said no.

418
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,780
Let's just go.

419
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,820
Hey, stop them.

420
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,760
What's going on?

421
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,100
It's none of your business.
Get out of my way.

422
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,570
It is my business.

423
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
Don't bother Hong Si-ah.

424
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,580
If you do, I won't let that slide.

425
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,390
Oh, right.

426
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,420
Don't bother that guy either.

427
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,600
Darn it.

428
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
Let's go.

429
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,540
What?

430
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,560
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

431
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,560
I'm okay.

432
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,970
Do I make you

433
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,630
uncomfortable?

434
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,970
No.

435
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,140
You're an awful liar,

436
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,310
Si-ah.

437
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,420
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,950
Why are you sorry?

439
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,920
I'm the one who made
things uncomfortable

440
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,190
between us.

441
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,130
But you can forget about what I said.

442
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,230
I don't want to lose our friendship

443
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,570
because of what I said.

444
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,410
Let's go.

445
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,910
Hey, Ji-ho.

446
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,880
Wait up.

447
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,430
Don't just stand there.

448
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,460
Let's go.

449
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,230
Okay.

450
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,420
My gosh. I'm drunk today.

451
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,050
I called a taxi. Take it when it comes.

452
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,320
By the way,

453
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,460
were you able to make things clear
with Woo-young?

454
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,560
Don't even start.

455
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,930
I thought I made things very clear,

456
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,700
but he crossed the line.

457
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,100
How?

458
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,070
He told me that he's Hong Dae-young.

459
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,980
What?

460
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,050
So what do you think about that?

461
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
What do I think?

462
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,990
I just feel bad for Deok-jin.

463
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,700
Da-jung.

464
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,800
You told me that your heart fluttered
because he resembled Dae-young.

465
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,840
Putting aside his looks,

466
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,340
he has Dae-young's voice
and acts like Dae-young.

467
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,740
Even I found that a bit off.

468
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,240
That has never crossed your mind?

469
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,380
Not at all.

470
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,980
It's impossible for people to get young.

471
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,550
Why is that?

472
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,790
I mean, it turns out

473
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,250
there are deities and
aliens in our world.

474
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,260
Dae-young could have gotten younger.

475
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,160
You never know what can happen
in our world.

476
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,930
Right.

477
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,100
You are drunk.

478
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,140
The taxi is here. Let's go.

479
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,570
- Hey, I'm really not drunk.
- Hurry.

480
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,980
Hey, I'm not drunk at all.

481
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,940
This is a fact!

482
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,450
Hey.

483
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,590
Sorry for making you wait long.

484
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,920
My grandma is leaving tomorrow.
I was helping her pack.

485
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,760
- She's leaving tomorrow?
- Yes.

486
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,130
Hey, Mom.

487
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,470
Where are you going at this hour?

488
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,440
To the park.
I'm going to practice with Woo-young.

489
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,940
Don't you know what time it is?

490
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,080
Did you call him out?

491
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,680
- No, the thing is...
- From now on,

492
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,050
don't call Si-woo out at a late hour.

493
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,320
It's late, so practice tomorrow.

494
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,890
Let's go, Si-woo.

495
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,060
I'm sorry, Woo-young.

496
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,300
I'll call you later.

497
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,080
Why are you being
like that to Woo-young?

498
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,320
If you act cold to him, I'll feel bad.

499
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,220
Si-woo. I'll be honest with you.

500
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,090
I want you to keep
your distance from Woo-young.

501
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,530
What?

502
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,100
Why must I do that?

503
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,260
It's because...

504
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,770
Maybe it's because he lived abroad
for a long time,

505
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,540
but I feel like he's too open-minded.

506
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,610
What are you talking about?

507
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,550
Did you have that kind of prejudice?

508
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,410
Regardless, it's because I'm worried.

509
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,320
You only hang out
with Woo-young these days,

510
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,520
and you don't meet your other friends.

511
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,720
I don't have any friends
to hang out with.

512
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,100
What do you mean?

513
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,800
To be honest,

514
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,970
I was bullied at school.

515
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,580
What?

516
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,710
Why are you telling me that now?

517
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,220
How can I tell you that?

518
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,090
But I'm okay now, so don't worry.

519
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,300
I didn't have friends before,

520
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,500
and I didn't have the courage
to play basketball.

521
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,540
But after I met Woo-young,

522
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,310
a lot has changed for me.

523
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,610
Woo-young

524
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,179
is a really good friend to me.

525
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,389
Are things

526
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,190
okay now?

527
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,889
Yes, they are.

528
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,830
It's all thanks to Woo-young.

529
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,460
- Goodness.
- This must be so heavy.

530
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,600
What? Woo-young.

531
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,260
Didn't you go to school?

532
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,530
I had something to do,
so I left school early.

533
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,510
Is that so? What brings you here?

534
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,440
I heard you were leaving today.

535
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,880
I have to go to the bus terminal too.

536
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,180
The bus terminal?

537
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,310
Yes.

538
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,550
Why do you need to go there?

539
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,520
To see my mom.

540
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,300
<i>Ticket Office</i>

541
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,370
Here. One ticket to Gangneung, please.

542
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,740
Thank you.

Come in.

547
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,810
I have the final score
for the probationary employees.

548
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
What?

549
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,830
What is this?

550
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,430
Is this correct?

551
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,530
Yes.

552
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,540
Does this make sense?

553
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,330
Newbies.

554
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,300
Gather around.

555
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,270
The results

556
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,750
for the permanent
employees just came out.

557
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Excuse me.

558
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,770
What? You didn't leave yet?

559
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,370
Not yet.

560
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,380
Please eat this as you go.

561
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,780
Your luggage is heavy,

562
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,520
so be sure to take a taxi home.

563
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,020
Right. Thank you.

564
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Then

565
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,190
get home safely.

566
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,900
Okay.

567
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,270
<i>What do you think?</i>

568
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,370
Is it good?

569
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,180
Of course it is.

570
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,380
How did you know to buy it for me
every time?

571
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,750
I know it's your favorite.

572

Here.

573
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,360
When you get to the terminal,
be sure to take a taxi.

574
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,730
Goodness, it's okay. I can take the bus.

575
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,430
Please take a taxi this time.

576
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,070
Also, don't tell Da-jung that I gave you
spending money. Okay?

577
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,040
Goodness gracious.

578
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,840
Thank you.

579
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,910
No problem.

580
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,980
The results for the permanent
employees just came out.

581
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,290
Thank you for all your work,

582
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,730
Ms. Jung.

583
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,780
It's okay.

584
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,050
Let's finish up

585
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,320
the rest of the week well.

586
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
Of course.

587
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,300
Gosh.

588
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,110
Where are you going? Sir!

589
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,320
Director Choi!

590
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,290
Director Moon! What brings you here?

591
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,290
You told the variety show department's
producers to give Ms. Jung a zero!

592
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,660
Ms. Jung didn't make the cut
because of you!

593
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,030
Is that right?

594
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
That's great.

595
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,670
What?

596
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,040
You even took her off the show
that you first cast her!

597
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,440
This is going too far.

598
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,510
Exactly!

599
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,680
This shows how lowly your department
thinks of us, the news anchors!

600
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,280
What's with the fuss?

601
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,650
The divorced news anchor with two kids
was a headache to you too.

602
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,520
You should thank me for cutting her out
without causing a scene.

603
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,820
Why are you getting angry at me?

604
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,120
How is she a headache to us?

605
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,820
She's so talented
that she even convinced me!

606
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,660
I'm banning all the news anchors

607
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,030
from being on any of your variety shows!

608
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,900
<i>Director Choi Hyun-seung</i>
Darn it!

609
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,500
Come on, Director Moon.

610
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,570
Let go!

611
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,940
Darn you!

612
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,710
Director Moon, you sounded incredible.

613
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,290
Incredible? Nonsense.

614
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,960
I was the one who wanted Ms. Jung out
because she gave me a headache.

615
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,030
Ms. Jung...

616
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,400
All this time that she was working hard
to prove herself,

617
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,300
I never got to tell her
that she did well.

618
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,070
I only got to tell her

619
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,270
after she got cut.

620
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,950
- Mr. Heo,
- Yes?

621
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,050
you said that you remember
what I said, right?

622
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,080
Yes.

623
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,220
In this world,

624
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,290
one should be evaluated

625
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,560
purely based on their quality of work,
not by anything else.

626
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:53,990
But

627
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,830
I keep forgetting that.

628
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,000
I didn't want to repeat my mistake.

629
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,640
I wanted to get it right this time.

630
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,480
Why are there so many condescending
jerks like me in this industry?

631

It's nothing.

Why are you here?

639
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,630
Because I miss you.

640
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,730
You're certainly not Hong Dae-young.

641
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,740
Hong Dae-young would never say that.

642
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,480
You didn't

643
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,980
tell the kids that
you're Hong Dae-young,

644
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,820
did you?

645
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,390
I didn't.

646
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,530
All right.

647
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,360
I'm grateful to you

648
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,930
for taking care of my kids and me.

649

But

650
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,010
if you keep coming to me like this,

651
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,040
I think I'll be more worried for my kids

652
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,850
than grateful.

653
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,020
So please,

654
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,650
let's pretend that
none of that happened.

655
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,420
What happened at the party

656
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,060
and the things you said after.

657
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,660
I'm going to forget it all.

658
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,460
So please, do the same

659
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,730
for me and my kids.

660
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,340
Okay.

661
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,480
It seems like the rain isn't stopping
anytime soon. Take this umbrella.

- I'm fine.
- Take it.

663
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:42,990
And

664
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,160
whatever it is,

665
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,030
you must've had a long day,

666
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,260
so just go home and rest.

667
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,900
Sorry?

668
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,040
It's fine.

669
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,540
You've been doing well all along.

670
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,790
It's fine.

671
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,060
You've been doing well all along.

672
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,550
Yes?

673
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,250
I'll head right over.

674
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,030
Are you sure Hong Dae-young is
the guy in the footage?

675
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,040
Yes, I've gotten in touch
with the car owners that parked

676
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,640
near where the accident happened,

677
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,870
looked through their dash cams,
and looked for the man in the footage.

678
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,710
I double-checked with his workplace

679
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,080
about the accident that day too,
so I'm confident.

680
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,820
Could I take a look at the footage?

681
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,050
Sure.

682
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,320
Here.

683
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,370
This man is

684
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,640
Da-jung's husband?

685
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,860
Hello?

686
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,690
Is this Hong Dae-young?

687
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,160
Yes, it is. Who is this?

688
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,270
I'd like to meet you in person.

689
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,900
What is this about?

690
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,040
Do you

691
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,580
remember the car accident

692
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,120
that occurred on Christmas Day?

693
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,890
Why did you do that?

694
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,490
I'm sorry.

695
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,985
Hey, Mom. I'm sorry.

696
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:54,355
Things got hectic for me.
I couldn't call you.

697
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,185
It's raining. Did you get home safely?

698
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:59,885
I'm all right. It's not raining here.

699
00:51:00,395 --> 00:51:03,925
And I got to the bus terminal
comfortably because Woo-young helped me.

700
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,125
Woo-young did?

701
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:07,295
<i>Yes.</i>

702
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:12,935
But earlier, it felt strange.

703
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:16,975
Woo-young bought me the red bean buns
from the bus terminal.

704
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:19,545
I was reminded of Dae-young.

705
00:51:21,815 --> 00:51:23,615
Ms. Jung.

706
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,755
Mom. I'll call you later.

707
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:32,285
Please sign here.

708
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,925
I'm a fan. Can you give me an autograph?

709
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,265
Okay. Sure.

710
00:51:39,325 --> 00:51:40,865
Thank you.

711
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:52,145
Actually, I became your fan
because of the guy who bought the shoes.

712
00:51:53,345 --> 00:51:55,075
The guy who bought the shoes?

713
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,145
Yes. It looked like
he was a big fan of yours.

714
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,415
He bragged so much about you,
so I remember him.

715
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:08,655
You're sending them to a TV station.

716
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:11,625
"Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung"?

717
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:14,395
What kind of show is she on?

718
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,805
Don't you know who she is?

719
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:19,265
Gosh, no.

720
00:52:20,935 --> 00:52:23,205
I'm a huge fan of hers.

721
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:27,515
She prepared to become an anchor
at a late age.

722
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,445
So whenever she had job interviews,
it must have been hard,

723
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:33,585
but she didn't give up and kept trying.

724
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,485
So she got the job
with her 24th interview.

725
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:37,555
I see.

726
00:52:38,085 --> 00:52:40,025
When she worked
as a reporter on a contract,

727
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,795
she went through so much.

728
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:48,995
How do you know everything about her?

729
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:53,575
Oh, that. I read that in her interview.

730
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:57,045
I see. I will look her up too.

731
00:52:57,105 --> 00:52:58,875
Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

732
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:02,175
Yes. You should definitely look her up.

733
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:04,715
She's a really cool woman.

734
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:09,515
Afterward,
I've been following your career.

735
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:11,825
And I started to root for you too.

736
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,455
You must be so happy
to have such a reliable fan like him.

737
00:53:16,355 --> 00:53:19,125
The man who called himself my fan...

738
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:21,495
Was he a man in his late 30s?

739
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,735
No. He looked like a student.

740
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:25,965
A student?

741
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:32,745
Yes.

742
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:40,045
Please wait here. I'll bring your shoes.

743
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:06,275
What? I'm fine.

744
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:08,575
I'm not fine with that.

<i>I'm not okay with it.</i>

746
00:54:12,285 --> 00:54:15,215
How can they just let you
leave like this? This is upsetting.

747
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:19,885
Be strong.
Don't worry about Si-ah and Si-woo,

748
00:54:20,055 --> 00:54:21,125
and focus on your work.

749
00:54:21,395 --> 00:54:23,665

<i>I should've been nicer to you.</i>

753
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,505
"I'm sorry for not taking
better care of you."

754
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:38,145

Why are you staring at me?

763
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:18,845
Because you're pretty.

764

Did you have fun

deceiving me?

779
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,385
If you lied about who you are,

780
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,625
you should have lived your own life.

781

Why are you hovering around me
and nice to me?

782

If you hid it from me,

783
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:18,135
you should've hidden it to the end.

784

Why are you telling me this now?

785
00:57:22,775 --> 00:57:23,905
You said you regretted it.

786
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:28,815
You regretted meeting me
and ruining your life.

787
