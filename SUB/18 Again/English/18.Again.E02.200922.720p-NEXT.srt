180
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,957
inspected companies that
provide school meal services.

181
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:25,827
However, it has been reported that
they found fruit flies, mold,

182
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:28,167
and feathers in some of the companies.

183
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,597
She knows about this.

184
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,197
- I know.
- They put students...

185
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,067
She's better in practice than theory.

186
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:36,267
This act is more heinous than
any form of violence.

187
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,677
- I'm sorry.
- It is necessary for

188
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,347
the government to act promptly
regarding this situation.

189
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,677
I apologize for

190
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,517
the sudden static during our broadcast.

191
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:51,187
Please be understanding.

192
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:53,187
Gosh, she's very good

193
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,357
She's quite good.

194
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:57,827
Ms. Jung Da-jung?

195
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,357
How did you come up
with the last comment?

196
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,567
I thought of this as an actual broadcast
and said what came to mind.

197
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,597
She's quite skillful.

198
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:08,837
I shouldn't ask her age, right?

199
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:11,377
Of course not. It's a blind test.

200
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,477
What class were you in?

201
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:18,577
Oh, right.

202
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,817
I'm in the class of '11.

203
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:25,687
Then she's around 28.

207
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,297
Don't tell the others.

208
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,167
If they find out you helped me,
they'll try to get revenge.

209
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:43,807
What? Revenge?

210
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:46,007
You should be careful too.

211
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,577
Be careful?

212
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:28,347
Is this

213
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,547
how you act in school?

214
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,487
Do you understand how serious
the situation is?

215
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:36,257
I don't play dirty and attack people
through social media or play politics.

216
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:39,927
I can chew you up and spit you out
without much effort.

217
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,227
What? Chew me up?

218
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:48,367
Be honest.

219
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,377
You put down some bait
before you transferred, right?

220
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,637
Did you think that I'd be scared
if you bought liquor

221
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,107
at a convenience store and threw a fit?

222
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:58,847
Your younger brother Si-woo...

223
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,647
Did you look into my background too?

224
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,157
Did you know that Si-woo
was getting bullied?

225
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,257
What?

226
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,657
Hong Si-woo got bullied again?

227
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:10,187
Did you know that already?

228
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,757
If you knew that,
you should've told your dad!

229
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:14,427
Do you tell your dad things like that?

230
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:16,797
If you don't tell your dad,
who would you tell?

231
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,637
How dare you keep talking about my dad?

232
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:20,537
I'm warning you.

233
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:23,167
You better not show your face
around me anymore.

234
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,817
<i>Are you really my daughter, Si-ah?</i>

235
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,147
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

236
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:39,157
Dad, be strong!

237
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,387
I love you.

238
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:44,427
Okay. I will be strong.
I love you, Si-ah.

239
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,767
<i>You used to be so kind.</i>

240
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,017
<i>That can't be her.</i>

241
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,447
<i>My daughter must be somewhere else.</i>

242
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:21,567
How was I? Did I do a good job?

243
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,597
Yes. You seemed like a real bully.

244
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,197
I wouldn't have been able to do it
without you guys.

245
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,867
I was scared at the convenience store.

246
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,607
But Go Woo-young seems nice.

247
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,207
Did he really do that?

248
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,447
You think that anyone who's handsome
is nice, don't you?

249
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:40,877
Hold on.

250
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,217
Gu Ja-sung picked on Hong Si-woo again?

251
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,087
Darn it.

252
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,897
Why are you getting bullied?

253
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:58,897
Mind your own business.

254
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,997
If you were trapped,
you should've screamed for help.

255
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,307
Why did you stay quiet?

256
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:04,607
Why would I scream?

257
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:05,937
That's embarrassing.

258
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,737
Embarrassing?

259
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,247
What's embarrassing?

260
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,417
People like your older sister are the ones
who should be embarrassed by themselves.

261
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:13,877
What?

262
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,747
Don't talk about it if you know nothing.

263
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:39,837
Is it him?

264
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,177
Don't look him in the eye.

265
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,847
I told you. Don't look at him.

266
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,597
Si-woo, is this your new friend?

267
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,737
What a surprise.

268
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:19,217
Hey!

269
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,087
Come here.

270
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,777
Give me the ball.

271
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,917
The ball?

272
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:55,617
Sure.

273
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:09,066
You

274
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,527
need a good lesson.

275
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:16,707
How are you going to teach me?

276
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,707
First,

277
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,477
I'm going to call your father.

278
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,027
That's very old-fashioned of you.

279
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,197
I'm also going to report you
to the Bullying and Harassment Committee

280
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:42,297
and tell them that you're bullying
your classmate.

281
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,867
Not only that, you're being cowardly
and using your friends to do it.

282
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:46,567
What do you know?

283
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,537
I know everything.

284
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,977
Kids who hit their growth spurts
earlier than everyone else

285
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,377
and bully others
just because you're taller and bigger.

286
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:58,917
I've seen a lot of those.
Tall and big but immature.

287
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,357
You think life is going good for you

288
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,987
because your peers are scared of you,
right?

289
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,127
What you don't know is

290
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:12,257
that you just look like a fool
begging for people's attention.

291
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,757
Sorry,

292
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,067
are you still a kid down there too?

293
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,487
Dare to say one more thing.

294
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:37,347
Apologize.

295
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,757
- What?
- Apologize.

296
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,827
- How dare you...
- Stop!

297
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,357
Eat up. Your food is getting cold.

298
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,087
All right.

299
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:27,767
This is infuriating.

300
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,467
How dare they bounce a basketball
on someone's precious child?

301
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,007
I wish I could beat him up
as my old self.

302
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,357
I haven't been there

303
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,487
in forever.

304
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,967
What was that?

305
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,307
Choi Il-kwon, you think you can become
a basketball player like this?

306
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:13,817
Come here, Go Deok-jin.

307
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,517
Should I?

308
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,717
Thank you.

309
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,127
You all don't want to play
in the next game, do you?

310
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,697
What? You're going to snitch on us
to the coach?

311
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:30,097
Why would I do that when I can
sort it out here?

312
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,437
You annoying punk.

313
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,707
Get it together!

314
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:40,907
That was me back in the days,

315
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,607
but I'm the one going
there to smoke now.

316
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,317
How funny.

317
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,567
Hey!

318
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:09,667
My goodness.

319
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,637
I thought you were a teacher.

320
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:13,707
What?

321
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,947
- Hong Si-ah, you!
- Stop right there.

322
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:19,817
I told you to not make yourself seen
in my eyes.

323
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,687
- You smoke now?
- Hey.

324
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,347
You shouldn't be the one to talk.

325
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:25,957
You're here to smoke too.

326
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,157
What is with the attitude?

327
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:29,257
What's wrong with you?

328
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:32,927
What?

329
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:35,467
I'm talking to you!

330
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:37,627
How rude!

331
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,267
- What?
- What?

332
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,437
You look familiar.

333
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:48,577
Choi Il-kwon?

334
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,577
What? Choi...

335
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,047
How dare you call your teacher
by his name?

336
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:55,647
You're a teacher now?

337
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:56,917
"You're a teacher now"?

338
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,087
What do you think
you're doing, you punk?

339
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,257
Well...

340
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,957
I'm a new student here.

341
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:06,657
A new student?

342
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:09,897
You're a new student,
and you're smoking on your first day?

343
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,627
A student shouldn't be smoking!

344
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,537
Come with me to the Teacher's Office.

345
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,177
Why would I go? I didn't even smoke.

346
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,737
What's in your hand, then?

347
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:23,847
I didn't smoke, I'm telling you.

348
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,747
See? It's unopened.

349
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,117
Look at these punks.

350
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:34,287
Who smoked these?

351
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,087
There must be others
who smoked with you.

352
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:42,997
If you tell me who smoked,

353
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,767
I'll let you off the hook.

354
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:49,437
- Okay?
- What?

355
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,167
Goodness.

356
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:56,407
What do you mean, you didn't smoke?

357
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,877
You punks did not only smoke,

358
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,577
but are lying too?

359
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,547
How can students smoke at school?

360
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:07,487
<i>She's not going to listen to me
when I look like I'm her age anyway.</i>

361
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:10,227
<i>Si-ah, this is the only way for you
to learn your lesson!</i>

362
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:11,557
I know it may look cool,

363
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:13,797
but it'll all come back
at you in the end.

364
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:14,827
You're right.

365
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:17,797
Please keep scolding us
so that we learn our lesson.

366
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,837
Sir, we have some equipment delivered
to the school,

367
00:23:20,897 --> 00:23:23,007
- so I'm going to go downstairs.
- Sure.

368
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:27,307
Go Woo-young, why are you getting up?

369
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:30,847
I've already made a deal with Mr. Choi.

370
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:31,907
Right?

371
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,017
Right.

372
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:36,047
Please teach Woo-young and Si-ah

373
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:37,987
a good lesson.

374
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,017
All right.

375
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:40,517
You punk.

376
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:41,787
What?

377
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:44,287
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

378
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:48,767
Have a seat!

379
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,167
Yes, sir.

380
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:57,337
Why are you giving a side-eye?
You're in trouble too.

381
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,677
You're a woman!

382
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:02,007
How dare you smoke
and from such an early age too?

383
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:05,007
What will you do when you grow up?

384
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:09,447
Sir, please do not hit her.

385
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:12,657
Although smoking
was inappropriate of her,

386
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,427
you can certainly scold her
just with words.

387
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,357
You don't need to beat her.

388
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,727
And "You're a woman"?

389
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:22,397
That's highly inappropriate
for this day and age, don't you think?

390
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,597
Sorry, I was wrong.

391
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,667
It's fine.

392
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,767
All right.

393
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,237
- Ms. Ok,
- Yes?

394
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,177
you're Woo-young and Si-ah's
homeroom teacher, right?

395
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:37,507
- Yes.
- Call their parents right now!

396
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:40,347
What? I'm sorry!

397
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,387
- Sir...
- What are you doing? Call them!

398
00:24:44,987 --> 00:24:45,987
All right.

399
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,617
You punks.

400
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,127
How dare you try to teach me a lesson?

401
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:55,597
The new Gogo Play's theme

402
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,097
and Ye Ji-hoon's image go well together.

403
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,597
We could certainly attract

404
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,007
- the public's eyes.
- I miss her.

405
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:05,607
So cute!

406
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:08,807
I didn't know he was your type.

407
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,477
<i>Baseball Player Ye Ji-hoon</i>

408
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:16,387
Look at that guy.
He's the second-cutest guy after me.

409
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,657
All right. Then, I'll take it
that you agree with our decision.

410
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:28,197
I'll offer Ye Ji-hoon to be our
game model for our new commercial.

411
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:29,397
Ye Ji-hoon?

412
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:31,667
You just said he was cute.

413
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:35,137
If every cute guy models for
commercials, I'll be the model.

414
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:36,437
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

415
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:38,977
Our game targets female players.

416
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,477
How can we hire a player
to be our model?

417
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:44,277
Gosh, you guys don't know anything
about what women want.

418
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,677
He's the most sought-after model
by female players.

419
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,947
And he's the most sought-after guy
to go to the amusement park with.

420
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:54,587
He's also the most sought-after guy
to introduce as a husband on holidays.

421
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:57,357
Is that so?

422
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,757
<i>Oh, My Teacher</i>

423
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:07,837
This is the legend that scored 10 million
downloads within the shortest time period.

424
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,707
This is the CEO of Go Go Play,
Go Deok-jin.

425
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,537
Yes, Ms. Ok.

426
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:18,107
I see. Okay.

427
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,617
I got it.

428
00:26:21,717 --> 00:26:24,847
Then, let's contact Ye Ji-hoon
for the commercial.

429
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,817
I have an important meeting.
I'm heading out.

430
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,317
Go home when you're done.

431
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:34,657
- Lawyer Chu.
<i>- Doors are closing.</i>

432
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,197
Chu Ae-rin.

433
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,427
Don't talk to me in that outfit.

434
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,867
Our offices are in the same building.
Don't be a stranger.

435
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:41,967
I especially want to be

436
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:44,407
a stranger to you
when we're in this building.

437
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:45,507
Gosh.

438
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,037
I'm nervous.

439
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,977
Of course. An outfit like that
will make anyone nervous.

440
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:54,147
No. I'm on my way to see
my kid's homeroom teacher.

441
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,817
Have you gone mad?

442
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,257
You don't have a kid.

443
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,787
I do. I have an annoying
18-year-old son.

444
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:04,657
Are you serious?

445
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:07,457
Are you telling me there's a boy
who has the same DNA as you?

446
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,167
If he takes after you, it's a disaster.

447
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:13,497
It's a disaster for him
and for this world.

448
00:27:15,037 --> 00:27:16,467
My gosh. You and your jokes.

449
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:20,077
Thanks to you, I don't feel nervous.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

450
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,777
Yes. That's more like him.

451
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:28,147
Wait. He has an 18-year-old son?

452
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,257
Ms. Jung.

453
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,197
Hello, Ms. Ok.

454
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,319
Ms. Jung.

455
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,119
Hello, Ms. Ok.

456
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,159
Did Si-ah

457
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,359
cause trouble at school?

458
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,329
Si-ah was caught smoking, ma'am.

459
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:12,169
Smoking?

460
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,369
She had this electronic cigarette.

461
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,269
Where did you get this?

462
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:23,409
It's my mom's.

463
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,449
It is mine.

464
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,789
Wait, that doesn't mean I'm a smoker.

465
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,949
What a colossal mess!

466
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,759
Woo-young, watch your language.
Sit down.

467
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,689
Listen to them. The mom and the daughter
share the electronic cigarette.

468
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,459
Why must I just sit here
and listen to this?

469
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:39,859
You smoked too.

470
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,629
You and I are different!

471
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:43,229
How are we any different?

472
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:44,369
Guys.

473
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:27,679
You look just like him.

474
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,319
Ms. Jung?

475
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:35,419
Ms. Jung, you can't do that
to another student.

476
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:37,049
Nowadays, this can be a huge problem.

477
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,759
She's right, Mom. Don't touch him.

478
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,489
Who does he look like?

479
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,989
Look at him.
He looks just like your father.

480
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:45,699
What? Who?

481
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,969
- Dad?
- Yes.

482
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:51,529
Your dad, Hong Dae-young.

483
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,139
Take a good look at him.

484
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,539
- Come on.
- Ms. Jung.

485
00:29:58,609 --> 00:29:59,939
- Ms. Jung.
- Mom!

486
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,309
Hold up!

487
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,549
Mr. Go?

488
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,689
We meet again.

489
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:21,399
I had my son without getting married.
I'm a single dad, Go Deok-jin.

490
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:22,599
Deok-jin?

491
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:24,429
Hey, Da-jung.

492
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:25,499
But

493
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,039
you had a son?

494
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,009
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

495
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:33,209
Right. He's my son.

496
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,949
He's your son?

497
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,149
You guys should go back to class.

498
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:43,919
Okay.

499
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:46,759
- Bye.
- Bye, son.

500
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:49,859
Why don't we go to
the counselor's office?

501
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:50,959
Okay.

502
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:53,359
<i>Counselor's Office</i>

503
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,699
Thank you for coming today.

504
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,869
You did all the work, Ms. Ok.

505
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,839
Ms. Ok, I'm sorry.

506
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,539
I'd like to treat you to a meal
as a way to apologize for my son.

507
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,939
I'm on a diet.

508
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,449
Then, how about coffee?

509
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,049
I'm allergic to it.

510

It's you, isn't it? Jung Da-jung.

It's you, isn't it? Jung Da-jung.

513
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,059
And you're Go Deok-jin.

514
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:27,659
Hi, Il-kwon. What are you doing here?

515
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:31,569
I'm the physical education teacher here.

516
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:34,299
It's so nice to run into you here.

517
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:37,069
You too, Deok-jin.

518
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,209
What's wrong with him?

519
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:47,079
I guess he still hates me.

520
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:48,149
Pardon?

521
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,849
What I did to him back then was wrong.

522
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,389
Anyway, it's been so long.

523
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,859
Right. You didn't come
to any of the school reunions.

524
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:00,559
Right.

525
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,929
Had I known that you'd be there,

526
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:04,999
I would've attended one.

527
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,549
Si-ah, everyone is coming.
Are you sure you're not coming?

528
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:20,279
No, I'm sorry. I have to work
after I stop by home.

529
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:21,919
Are you working again?

530
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:24,319
What is it now?

531
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,919
Why do you have a part-time job?

532
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,759
Why do you care?

533
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:32,859
You're a student. If you need money,
ask your parents for money.

534
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:35,059
Why are you trying to
make money already?

535
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:40,299
There's something I want to do.
Are you happy with my answer?

536
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:47,709
- See you tomorrow.
- Hey, Ji-ho.

537
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,309
Did you know Si-ah had a part-time job?

538
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,749
- Yes.
- How?

539
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:56,989
I just knew because we're friends.

540
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,159
Because you're friends?

541
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,959
Then, you must also know
why she's working.

542
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:05,459
Yes.

543
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,299
But that's not my story to tell.

544
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:12,199
Ji-ho, what are you doing? Hurry up.

545
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:13,269
Okay.

546
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,369
- Bye.
- Hey.

547
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,839
My gosh. Goodness. Come on.

548
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:32,459
Those punks.

549
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,279
Si-woo, are you really
not going to play basketball?

550
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:30,879
You were good when you were younger.

551
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:33,118
I'm not interested.

552
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,819
He said he wasn't interested.

553
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,229
<i>My son</i>

554
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:01,079
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Si-woo. Where are you?

555
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:02,279
I'm at home.

556
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:03,649
Home?

557
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:04,909
<i>Yes, I'm at home.</i>

558
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,549
<i>- Why?</i>
- Why do you think?

559
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,949
I just called to see how you were.

560
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,559
Are you really
uninterested in basketball?

561
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,189
Be honest.

562
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,029
<i>If you want to play, I'll support you.</i>

563
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:18,959
I'm not interested.

564
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:21,859
Really?

565
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:24,199
Hey, Si-woo.

566
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:27,439
<i>How's school?</i>

567
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,009
Is everything okay?

568
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,209
Does anyone pick on you?

569
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,779
<i>No, no one does.</i>

570
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,579
Why are you asking me that today?

571
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:42,149
No reason. I was just curious.

572
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,019
Hey, Si-woo.

573
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:45,689
<i>Yes?</i>

574
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:49,889
If you have anything to tell me,

575
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:51,929
you can tell me anytime.

576
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:55,799
I'm always on your side.

577
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,399
Okay.

578
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:26,699
Hey, Hong Si-woo.

579
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:28,799
Go Woo-young?

580
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,299
You're pretty good.

581
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:35,139
But I'm pretty good at basketball too.

582
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:37,609
Stop bluffing.

583
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:40,239
What's with that tone?
Don't you believe me?

584
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,619
Okay. Pass me the ball.

585
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:01,699
Did you tell Mr. Go or my dad about me?

586
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:05,669
No.

587
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,769
Why would I tell them that?

588
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:10,139
Then do me a favor and don't tell them.

589
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:14,079
Okay. I'll do that.

590
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,579
How long have you
been playing basketball?

591
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,579
Since a while back. Just for fun.

592
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,689
That means you're interested in it.

593
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,559
Who said I wasn't interested?

594
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,339
Hong Si-ah.

595
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:45,469
Come sit here.

596
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:03,129
Why did you take this?

597
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:06,429
I thought you were throwing it
because you didn't smoke it.

598
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,099
If I don't smoke it,

599
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:10,999
does that mean you can?

600
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:14,539
Why can you do it, but I can't?

601
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:16,909
You're a minor.

602
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,409
I'll be an adult in two years.

603
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,339
What would be so different then?

604
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:21,739
I'm all grown up.

605
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,609
Si-ah. An adult...

606
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,349
There isn't much difference between
being 18 and being 20.

607
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,819
Why are you stopping me?

608
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,619
My goodness. If you smoke and
do everything you want at 18,

609
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:33,759
what will you do as an adult?

610
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:34,759
Don't worry.

611
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:37,129
Regardless of what happens,
I won't live like you.

612
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,029
Hey. Why do you think I live like this?

613
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,399
Are you saying it's because of me?

614
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,069
Did I ask you to give birth to me?

615
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,199
What?

616
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,259
I've lost my mind.

617
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,619
Why did I even buy that?

618
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:12,729
<i>Electronic cigarettes</i>

619
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:14,129
<i>Electronic Cigarette, 110,000 won</i>

620
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:19,539
What are you looking at?

621
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,339
I'm thinking about buying
an electronic cigarette.

622
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,309
I told you to quit smoking.

623
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,239
What kind of pleasure would I have
in life if I quit smoking too?

624
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,849
Quit smoking. I'm warning you.

625
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:32,949
Fine.

626
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,899
It looks like you've had a lot to drink.
You should stop.

627
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:50,969
Let go!

628
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,299
You're the worst!

629
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,679
I should've thrown it out
with Hong Dae-young.

630
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,419
Why do you keep following me?

631
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:45,219
Hey, can you help me practice?

632
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:47,019
- Help you practice?
- Yes.

633
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:48,659
I want to join the basketball team
at school,

634
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,489
and I need someone to practice with.

635
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:52,999
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

636
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,029
If your hobby is playing basketball,
why not play with me too?

637
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,129
I don't want to.

638
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:00,469
Mom.

639
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,939
Hey, Si-woo.

640
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,639
You're Deok-jin's son, right?

641
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:12,149
I'm sorry about what happened today
in the Teachers' Office.

642
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,079
What is she sorry about?

643
00:41:14,149 --> 00:41:15,779
Right. The thing is...

644
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:19,559
I'm really disappointed.

645
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,159
How can you smoke
after what happened today?

646
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:28,459
What? Woo-young, this is...

647
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,469
I have no idea what you're thinking.

648
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:32,729
Hold on.

649
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,439
Is that any way to speak to an adult?

650
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,009
And why do you keep speaking down to me?

651
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:40,679
I have my reasons to do so.

652
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:42,309
What?

653
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,649
To be honest, I...

654
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:47,349
I...

655
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,989
I'm your husband, Hong Dae-young!

656
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,619
I almost said that to her.

657
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:54,159
Because I was so angry.

658
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:56,459
To be more exact,
you're her ex-husband, Hong Dae-young.

659
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:59,289
Hey. I'm not divorced yet.

660
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,429
So? What did you say?

661
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:06,539
I...

662
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:10,009
I lived abroad for a long time,

663
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:11,969
so I'm not good at using honorifics.

664
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,109
Then you must be good at English.

665
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:17,349
I can't, because I lived in Koreatown.

666
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:26,619
You should've just told her
you were Hong Dae-young.

667
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:28,959
It's because of our kids.

668
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:31,429
Your kids? Why?

669
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:55,879
After seeing them today,

670
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,319
I realized I didn't know a lot about

671
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:01,819
Si-ah or Si-woo when I was their dad.

672
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:06,529
But...

673
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,599
What about your future?
Is there anything you want to do?

674
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:11,429
No.

675
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:15,369
You're a student. If you need money,
ask your parents for money.

676
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,269
Why are you trying to
make money already?

677
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:19,269
It's because
there's something I want to do.

678
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:24,549
Si-woo, are you really
not going to play basketball?

679
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:26,109
I'm not interested.

680
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,079
How long have you
been playing basketball?

681
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:31,049
Since a while back. Just for fun.

682
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,559
That means you're interested in it.

683
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,059
Who said I wasn't interested?

684
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,409
They told Go Woo-young,
someone they met today,

685
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,909
things that they never told
Hong Dae-young,

686
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,449
who raised them for nearly 20 years.

687
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:02,719
The person my kids need right now

688
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,059
is not Hong Dae-young the father,

689
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,029
but their friend from school,

690
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,689
Go Woo-young.

691
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:20,299
Yes, I need Go Woo-young

692
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:23,069
more than Hong Dae-young right now too.

693
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:26,409
Will you shut it?

694
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:39,189
Jung Da-jung!

695
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,829
What brings you here?
You never come out.

696
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:49,199
I just need a drink.

697
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:51,629
- Excuse me.
- Yes!

698
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:55,339
I'll take your order.

699
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:57,739
Choi Il-kwon?

700
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:59,509
Jung Da-jung!

701
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,049
Choi Il-kwon?
The Choi Il-kwon from high school?

702
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:05,579
Chu Ae-rin!

703
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:07,149
It's so nice to see you.

704
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:08,249
Hello.

705
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,849
What are you doing here?

706
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:12,049
My older brother runs the bar,

707
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,259
and the part-timer skipped,
so he needed an extra hand today.

708
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,559
You're looking good.

709
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:18,359
You're being too kind.

710
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:20,099
Choi Il-kwon!

711
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,329
I can't believe that you ran into him
at school of all places.

712
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:25,229
I have to go there
if I want to meet Ms. Ok more often.

713
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:27,239
Dae-young, what do I do?

714
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,839
He probably grew up
now that he's a teacher.

715
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,209
You should let the past be past too.

716
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:32,709
You think Choi Il-known grew up?

717
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:34,679
You think people change that easily?

718
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:37,209
All right.

719
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:52,629
Hey,

720
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:54,499
feel better.

721
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,729
So your kid smoked. That's no big deal.

722
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:59,839
Smoking is an issue,

723
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:02,439
but I've just been so busy
with the divorce

724
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:04,509
and interviews.

725
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:09,709
I feel like this happened because
I didn't take care of them enough.

726
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,819
I've raised them for 18 years,

727
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:17,549
but it's still hard.

728
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:20,789
I'm fired.

729
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,099
Did you say divorce?

730
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:35,369
Da-jung, did you get a divorce
with Dae-young?

731
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,109
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

732
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:42,409
It's fine.

733
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:45,709
Divorce isn't a big deal
in this day and age.

734
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:48,849
It's getting late. I should go.

735
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:52,249
Hey, I was just finishing my shift too.

736
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,319
Let's go together. I'll drop you off.

737
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:57,059
No, we don't live far from here.

738
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:58,559
That's great, then.

739
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:00,759
Wait for me outside. I'll get my car.

740
00:47:05,399 --> 00:47:09,699
Da-jung, Il-kwon
still seems like he's into you.

741
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,269
What are you talking about?

742
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,679
His first love!

743
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:16,779
It's you!

744
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:18,879
That's all in the past.

745
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:22,849
I hope you end up falling
for a divorced woman with kids!

746
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:31,329
I know exactly what that is.

747
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:33,299
The guy cheated on her.

748
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,259
What's wrong with a divorced woman
with kids?

749
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:37,569
Let's go.

750
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:00,789
Everyone seems like they're happy.

751
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:04,529
You still feel sad after drinking?

752
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,299
Even after all the drinks,

753
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,199
my life is still the same.

754
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:12,729
Your issue is
that your life is still the same?

755
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,739
I know a secret to life.

756
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:17,969
A secret to life?

757
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:19,569
You want to know?

758
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:24,279
First, open your shoulders wide.

759
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:27,679
Close your eyes,

760
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:29,919
and take one step at a time,

761
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:34,389
while imagining that you're the coolest
and fiercest woman in the world.

762
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:38,829
Could to ten,
and when you open your eyes...

763
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:41,499
When you open your eyes?

764
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,829
Date the first man you see in sight.

765
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:49,399
How do you expect me to do that?

766
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:51,539
Can you stop taking the fun
out of everything?

767
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,069
Just give it a try!

768
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,909
You can do that all you want.

769
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,879
Sure.

770
00:48:57,209 --> 00:49:00,079
Keep laughing at how others live
their lives,

771
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:03,589
and keep living your life
full of regrets.

772
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,519
You're right.

773
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:12,459
My life is pathetic.

774
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:14,229
I have no right to judge others.

775
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:21,299
Let's try your way of living.

776
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:25,569
Da-jung! Are you finally coming out
of your shell?

777
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:27,939
Shoulders open.

778
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:30,879
Here I go.

779
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,419
<i>One,</i>

780
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:40,359
<i>two,</i>

781
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:44,289
<i>three...</i>

782
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:49,429
It's going well.

783
00:49:52,669 --> 00:49:54,269
Honey!

784
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:56,369
Really?

785
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:00,409
<i>Five.</i>

786
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:13,319
<i>I've been living my life</i>

787
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:16,789
<i>all wrong.</i>

788
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,159
Your job is so easy for you, isn't it?

789
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:22,759
You think I'll be a little kinder to you
just because you have kids?

790
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:25,999
<i>At work.</i>

791
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:27,669
<i>Six.</i>

792
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:30,139
<i>Yes, I regret it!</i>

793
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,239
You do too.

794
00:50:33,439 --> 00:50:34,579
Don't you?

795
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:38,349
<i>In my marriage too.</i>

796
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:41,879
<i>Seven.</i>

797
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:44,189
Are you saying it's because of me?

798
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:46,419
Did I ask you to give birth to me?

799
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,259
<i>As a mother to my children.</i>

800
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:53,029
<i>Eight.</i>

801
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:56,769
<i>I've been living my life</i>

802
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:00,569
<i>all wrong up to this point.</i>

803
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:02,299
<i>Nine.</i>

804
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:06,039
<i>Ten.</i>

805
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:03,529
Are you okay?

806
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:05,369
What?

807
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:08,839
Yes.

808
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:11,609
You have to be careful.

809
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:14,439
Yes.

810
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:34,499
You reek of alcohol.

811
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:37,929
Sorry.

812
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:40,139
Goodness.

813
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:58,019
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

814
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:02,119
Then please get out of my way.

815
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:10,469
Goodness.

816
00:53:17,709 --> 00:53:18,769
What happened?

817
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:20,709
Did he save you?

818
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:26,309
Da-jung, hop in.

819
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:31,719
Go Woo-young, what are you doing here?

820
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:33,719
Mr. Choi? What are you doing here?

821
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:36,929
Why do you ask? I met my old friends.

822
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,029
Get home.

823
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:39,489
Okay.

824
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,799
How old are you?

825
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:43,929
I'm underage.

826
00:53:44,629 --> 00:53:46,529
I see.

827
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:48,739
Da-jung, get in the front.

828
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:52,209
Wait!

829
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:56,209
Give me a ride too. It's getting late.

830
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:59,479
Sure. It gets dangerous at night.

831
00:53:59,549 --> 00:54:00,919
You're fine with that, right, Il-kwon?

832
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,519
Well,

833
00:54:07,389 --> 00:54:08,389
okay, I guess.

834
00:54:23,669 --> 00:54:25,509
How long have you been friends?

835
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:27,779
Oh, us? We went to the same school.

836
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:29,009
We both went to Serim High.

837
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:31,409
They are more than school friends.

838
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:34,019
Il-kwon, your first love was Da-jung.

839
00:54:34,379 --> 00:54:35,919
Ae-rin, come on.

840
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,229
<i>Go Deok-jin</i>

841
00:54:46,729 --> 00:54:47,829
<i>Slide to answer</i>

842
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:51,569
- Yes, Dad.
- Where are you?

843
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:54,069
I'm sorry to make you wait.
I'm on my way home.

844
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:56,399
You went to smoke a cigarette.
Why are you going home? Hey, you!

845
00:54:56,469 --> 00:54:57,969
Yes. I love you too.

846
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:00,009
Hey!

847
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,379
Hey!

848
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:09,849
You show your affection to him.

849
00:55:09,919 --> 00:55:11,749
Deok-jin must be a loving dad.

850
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:13,919
What?

851
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:17,089
Deok-jin is your dad?

852
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:18,929
Wait, that Go Deok-jin?

853
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:22,529
It would be more believable
if he were Hong Dae-young's son.

854
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:23,929
He looks just like Dae-young.

855
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:25,569
Right? When I first saw him,

856
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,839
I was so shocked because
he's the spitting image of Dae-young.

857
00:55:31,669 --> 00:55:32,739
Hong Dae-young?

858
00:55:45,749 --> 00:55:47,759
Gosh, what are you talking about?

859
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,789
He's way more handsome than Dae-young.

860
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:53,159
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back for a second.

861
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:54,729
Right?

862
00:55:55,729 --> 00:55:57,329
You guys are ridiculous.

863
00:55:57,469 --> 00:55:59,199
Woo-young, look at this guy.

864
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,399
This is the guy they're talking about.

865
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:04,209
He can't even hold a candle to you.

866
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:05,269
I see.

867
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,879
Look at him.
You look nothing like him. Right?

868
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:11,149
You look totally different.

869
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:15,319
Don't think about how he looks now.

870
00:56:15,379 --> 00:56:16,989
Try to remember when he was young.

871
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:18,149
Doesn't he look like Dae-young?

872
00:56:18,219 --> 00:56:19,919
He resembles
the younger version of Dae-young.

873
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:22,659
And he was an awesome basketball player.

874
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:24,789
Hey, that's all in the past.

875
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:26,889
I don't know
how kids get so tall these days.

876
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:30,599
If Dae-young and I were to join
the basketball team now,

877
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:32,299
we might end up warming the bench.

878
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:34,069
Gosh.

879
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:35,969
Only those players who got lucky

880
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:38,239
to become the first-stringer
wouldn't be able to make it.

881
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:40,909
A key player like Dae-young
who was always a first-stringer

882
00:56:40,979 --> 00:56:42,079
is a different story.

883
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:43,179
Gosh.

884
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:44,509
How do you know that?

885
00:56:45,049 --> 00:56:47,179
That he always made the first string.

886
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:49,879
Well, I learned

887
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:53,249
basketball from Dae-young.

888
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:58,559
Dae-young taught you
how to play basketball? Why?

889
00:56:58,759 --> 00:57:00,189
Because

890
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:03,299
my dream is becoming
a basketball player.

891
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,569
I see. That's your dream?

892
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:07,639
He has the same dream as Dae-young.

893
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,649
Why are you getting off?

894
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:25,889
Because I want to.

895
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:27,159
Hey, Woo-young.

896
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:28,659
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

897
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:32,429
I'll take a cab.

898
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:33,559
Really?

899
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:37,429
Okay, then. Go straight home.

900
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:39,929
Bye, Da-jung.

901
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:41,739
Thank you for the ride.

902
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:43,239
Bye.

903
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:55,619
Wait. Let me get you a cab.

904
00:57:56,149 --> 00:57:58,319
I can go home by myself.
You should go inside.

905
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:00,759
No. It's dangerous.

906
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:04,429
It's more dangerous for you
than it is for me.

907
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:07,259
- Bye.
- No.

908
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:12,299
I know

909
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:14,599
you drank.

910
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:16,539
What?

911
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,739
I didn't say anything
because Il-kwon is your teacher.

912
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,379
I smelled alcohol from you.

913
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,519
I won't tell you not to drink
because it will

914
00:58:27,749 --> 00:58:29,219
worry your dad.

915
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:30,619
At that age,

916
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:33,049
nothing that your parents tell you

917
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:35,619
sounds important.

918
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:38,289
But Woo-young,

919
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:41,529
you said you wanted
to be a basketball player.

920
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,929
Then, you shouldn't drink or smoke.

921
00:58:47,169 --> 00:58:48,469
Earlier in the car,

922
00:58:48,899 --> 00:58:51,739
you said that Dae-young always
made the first string.

923
00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:53,879
Do you know how he did that?

924
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,079
Practicing every moment he had
was a given.

925
00:58:57,749 --> 00:58:59,979
He neither drank nor smoked.

926
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:02,579
I know it well
because I've seen it myself.

927
00:59:03,379 --> 00:59:08,019
I know how hard he worked
to achieve his dream.

928
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:15,599
If you're serious about your dream,

929
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:17,569
no matter how hard it gets,

930
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:20,999
I hope you'll take
good care of yourself.

931
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:27,479
Sorry. That was a long lecture.

932
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:28,739
I bet you didn't like that.

933
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:30,579
No, I like it.

934
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:32,909
It sounds like you care about me.

935
00:59:35,749 --> 00:59:37,049
It's been a while since I heard that.

936
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:38,849
Really?

937
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:41,389
Then, it feels rewarding for me.

938
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,029
Wait. There.

939
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:51,799
Taxi.

940
00:59:56,499 --> 00:59:58,409
Here. Please drive him home safely.

941
00:59:59,169 --> 01:00:00,309
Get in, Woo-young.

942
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,979
<i>Available</i>

943
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:07,549
Woo-young.

944
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:10,179
I'm sorry for nagging you again.

945
01:00:10,419 --> 01:00:13,289
Cigarettes are really bad for athletes.

946
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:14,789
So quit smoking.

947
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:16,989
I'll quit too.

948
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:20,729
Okay. You should go home now.

949
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,809
As if.

950
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:38,449
Da-jung said
the electronic cigarette was yours.

951
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:41,079
What are you talking about?
I don't have an electronic cigarette.

952
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:43,149
She bought it for you as a present.

953
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:46,319
But she had no idea
Si-ah would take it and smoke it.

954
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:48,459
She bought it for me?

955
01:00:57,269 --> 01:00:58,299
<i>I will be</i>

956
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:00,599
<i>the only one who'll have to quit.</i>

957
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,599
Hey, it's been a while.

958
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:30,969
- Hey.
- Hey, Il-kwon.

959
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:32,329
What took you so long?

960
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:33,629
I'm sorry.

961
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:36,099
I was going to come right after work,
but I happened to

962
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:38,309
run into my first love.

963
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:40,239
I see. Your first love?

964
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:41,779
Is she pretty?

965
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:43,979
Well, you know,

966
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:46,809
she's still beautiful.

967
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,869
<i>If you're serious about your dream,</i>

968
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:11,369
<i>no matter how hard it gets,</i>

969
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,769
<i>I hope
you'll take good care of yourself.</i>

970
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:25,509
<i>I see. That's your dream?</i>

971
01:03:25,709 --> 01:03:27,109
He has the same dream as Dae-young.

972
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,049
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back for a second.

973
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:14,329
Where did you go this morning?

974
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:15,799
I exercised.

975
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:17,259
I must be in tiptop condition

976
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:19,299
if I'm going to play basketball
and take care of my kids.

977
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:21,869
Nice. Hey, do you have a cigarette?

978
01:04:22,399 --> 01:04:23,539
I threw all of them out.

979
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:25,739
From now on, I won't drink or smoke.

980
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,019
Let's see how long that lasts.

981
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:09,579
Score! I got a package!

982
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:14,149
Da-jung.

983
01:05:15,859 --> 01:05:17,489
What brings you here this morning?

984
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:28,299
You.

985
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:32,309
Hong Dae-young.

986
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:50,019
<i>5 months ago</i>

987
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:53,189
<i>Epilogue</i>

988
01:05:53,259 --> 01:05:54,499
Bye.

989
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,669
- Si-ah.
- Dad.

990
01:05:59,729 --> 01:06:02,199
You didn't answer your phone.
Where have you been all night?

991
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:04,669
Where do you think?
I was in the study hall.

992
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:11,709
You're drinking again?

993
01:06:12,509 --> 01:06:14,249
Well, I just wanted to have a drink.

994
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:17,419
Aren't you cold?
Look what you're wearing.

995
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:21,159
It's dangerous to walk around
all alone late at night.

996
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:24,789
Why are you trying to
make money already?

997
01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:27,999
You're a student. If you need money,
ask your parents for money.

998
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,091
<i>18 Again</i>

999
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,791
<i>I got the job.</i>

1000
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:23,761
<i>I got the job at JBC!</i>

1001
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,701
<i>It's been a while
since I saw you smile.</i>

1002
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:27,201
<i>You still have a beautiful smile.</i>

1003
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:30,301
<i>A mom was ranked first
in the open recruitment at JBC?</i>

1004
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:32,841
<i>Make her quit on her own
during the probation period.</i>

1005
01:07:32,901 --> 01:07:33,971
<i>You got off work like that?</i>

1006
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,411
<i>I'm a mess, aren't I?</i>

1007
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:38,281
<i>How can they just let you leave
like this? This is upsetting.</i>

1008
01:07:38,341 --> 01:07:40,481
<i>I just saw Gu Ja-sung
bullying you again.</i>

1009
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,581
<i>Then, what do you expect me to do?</i>

1010
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:44,481
<i>Should I go and fight him?</i>

1011
01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:45,821
<i>Hey, Gu Ja-sung!</i>

1012
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:47,321
<i>Let's duke it out.</i>
