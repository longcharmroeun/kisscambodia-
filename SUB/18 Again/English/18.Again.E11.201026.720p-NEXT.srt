<i>It's fine as long as they aren't dating.</i>

328
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Did you

329
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,740
follow us?

330
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,880
No, it was obviously a coincidence.

331
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
What?

332
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,950
Mom?

333
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,390
Mom?

334
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Mom!

335
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
What?

336
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,800
Si-ah!

337
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,880
You, sir, are an anime fan.

338
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,920
I don't like anime fans.

339
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,760
<i>I don't like anime fans.</i>

340
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,640
I forgot the most
important thing at work.

341
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
Ae-rin.

342
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,240
Hey!

343
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,410
Stop, Ae-rin!

344
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,110
It's me.

345
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,950
Go Deok-jin?

346
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,050
You anime-crazy lunatic!
What do you think you're doing?

347
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Anime-crazy lunatic?

348
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,960
What's wrong with anime?

349
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,630
What's so bad about watching anime?

350
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,230
Take a look at yourself,
for goodness' sake!

351
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,360
You don't know fashion!

352
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,890
Everyone, over there!

353
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,440
- Could I take a photo with you?
- Of course.

354
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,110
I can feel sadness behind your smile.

355
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,350
That's right.

356
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,350
- It's because of love.
- Feel better.

357
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,620
That love must be real.

358
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Thank you.

359
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,390
My friend said

360
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,030
that ugly people's love is genuine love.

361
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Ugly?

362
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,210
Would you like to take a photo with me?

363
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,080
Seems like we're the only ones
from Wonderland.

364
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,290
This voice sounds familiar.

365
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,330
Are you Woo-young's father?

366
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,730
Is that you, Ms. Ok?

367
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,070
You didn't see me today, okay?

368
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,310
Ms. Ok, why are you here?

369
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,240
<i>You, sir, are an anime fan.</i>

370
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,840
I don't like anime fans.

371
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,750
Hold on, Ms. Ok!

372
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,930
Ms. Ok,

373
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,490
don't be ashamed of yourself.

374
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,800
You look

375
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,430
more beautiful than ever right now.

376
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,300
Have confidence in yourself.

377
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,270
You certainly

378
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,510
deserve it!

379
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,620
Thank you!

380
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,190
At today's game between Daehan and Seum,

381
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,330
after an intense battle for victory,
Seum won by 7 to 3.

It's nothing.

391
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,390
Do you want a photo with me as well?

392
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,430
- No!
- No!

393
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,770
Da-jung, nobody is
waiting for you today, right?

394
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,170
No, nobody's waiting.

395
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,940
Why don't we all have dinner together?
My treat.

396
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,480
I'd feel too bad.

397
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,010
I don't want to go yet.

398
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,880
I don't treat my fans often,

399

but once I start,

400
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,090
I make sure that I do a good job at it.

401
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,330
But even so...

402
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,600
Do you two want to join us too?

- No!
- No!

406
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,240
You're my fan too.

407

410
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,300
Right here. You should sit here.

411
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,040
Hey. That's Ji-hoon's seat.

412
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,480
Are you in elementary school?
There are no assigned seats.

413
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,920
What? Elementary school?

414
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,890
I'll move to another seat.
Are you happy now?

415
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,990
Goodness.

416
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,590
What are you doing here?

417
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,900
Why did you tag along?

418
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,670
Because I was hungry.

419
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,180
I think there are more fans of Si-ah
than mine.

420
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,110
What?

421
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,350
It's nothing.

Oh, right. Ms. Jung. Will you be
interviewing me again starting today?

423
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,460
No. Ms. Kwon was asked for another show.

424
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,290
I'm just filling in for her today.

425
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,260
I see.

426
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,100
What is she filming?

427
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,100
I don't exactly know.

428
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,300
I just heard that
the show gets a lot of attention.

429
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,240
Upon receiving the news
that a typhoon will arrive in Korea,

430
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,370
people are worried
about its possible damage.

431
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,010
I was curious about how strong
an actual typhoon would be.

432
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,980
So I decided to experience it firsthand.

433
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,150
<i>Interactive Hall
for Storm and Flood Damage</i>

434
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,691
<i>Velocity per second: 10m per second</i>

435
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,790
The velocity of the wind
I'm experiencing now

436
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,690
is 10m per second.

437
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,560
I can somewhat walk in the rain
with an umbrella against the wind.

438
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,097
The velocity...

439
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,830
...of the wind is 30m per second.

440
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,310
<i>Velocity per second: 30m per second</i>

441
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,210
When will your new show air?

442
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,910
Next Monday.

443
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,550
It's a pilot program,
so there is only one episode.

444
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,080
With you on it,
it will be a regular program soon.

445
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,690
I'll make sure to watch it.

446
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,020
It's not something
you'd be interested in, Mr. Ye.

447
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,960
You're on it.

448
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,960
Then, I'll be more than interested
in the show.

449
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,930
Do a good job just
like you've been doing.

450
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,970
Thank you.

451
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

452
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,820
Let me. I can do it.

453
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,560
Gosh, no. I'll do it.

454
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,410
Thank you.

455
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,150
You're making it obvious.

456
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,120
What do you mean?

457
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,360
I mean,

458
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,260
it looks like you gave a lot of food
especially to Si-ah.

459
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,800
It's nothing like that.

460
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,240
I get where you're coming from,
but that's not cool.

461
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,010
Give some food to Ms. Jung.

462
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,180
It's all right.
I'm not a big fan of clams.

463
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,080
It's all right, Woo-young.

464
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,750
Okay.

465
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,190
- Eat a lot, Ji-ho.
- I'm fine.

466
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,230
Why not? Oh, I see.
Do you want me to take out the clams?

467
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,630
I'm fine. I'll scoop up my own food.

468
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,970
You punk. Fine.

469
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,470
Gosh.

470
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,040
- Then, I guess this is for me.
- Okay.

471
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,940
That looks delicious.

472
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,010
I'll scoop up some for you, Mr. Ye.

473
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,320
Thanks.

474
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,219
- Thank you.
- Here.

475
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,130
Ji-hoon,

476
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,070
can I ask if you have
a crush on someone?

477
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,730
What?

478
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,870
Why do you ask?

479
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,810
I mean, I saw your interview
about your ideal type of woman.

480
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,980
The description was very detailed.

481
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,010
It sounded like

482
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,320
you were describing someone
you had in mind.

483
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
I see.

484
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,090
Si-ah.

485
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,930
It's all right.

486
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,940
Actually...

487
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,440
Actually,

488
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,210
there's a woman I like.

489
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,750
But it's only a crush.

490
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,050
I haven't told her yet.

491
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,330
Okay. I got it.

492
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,970
Why are you out here?

493
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,810
I had to call someone.

494
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,870
Is that so?
I'll see you inside after your call.

495
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,010
Wait.

496
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,250
I hope you don't treat
all women like that.

497
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,880
"Like that"?

498
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,450
You ask her about the smallest things,
take an interest in her life,

499
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,150
root for her, and so on.

500
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,960
I don't think you're
talking about Si-ah.

501
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,290
Are you talking about Ms. Jung?

502
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,160
Just answer my question.

503
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,700
Why does it look like you're mad at me?

504
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,870
I'm not mad.

505
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,640
Who knows?

506
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,540
Depending on your answer,
I might be mad.

507
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,950
Why are you laughing?

508
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,420
I mean,

509
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,120
I can understand why you've been
so hostile against me all this time.

510
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,390
I can understand it.

511
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,530
When you're young,
you do have fantasies about women.

512
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,130
because you lack a sense of reality.

513
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,670
- Gosh.
- But it's only a fantasy

514
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,170
because it won't come true.

515
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,340
Well, men grow up as they get hurt.

516
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,150
What is he talking about?
That annoying brat.

517
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,360
Wait, Ms. Jung.

518
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,990
This was my treat.

519
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,360
My daughter and her friends had most
of the food. I ought to pay for this.

520
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,530
Gosh. Let me pay for this today.
Can you buy a meal next time?

521
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,900
I will let you pay for our next meal.
Let me pay for this one.

522
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,470
Your bill has already been paid for.

523
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,570
Pardon? Who did?

524
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,310
That young man did.

525
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,650
Woo-young. Did you pay for the meal?

526
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,710
Why?

527
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,980
My father didn't have dinner yet.

528
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,950
I paid for the meal
when I was buying the dumplings.

529
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,850
You're only a student.
Wasn't that expensive?

530
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,990
Yes. I agree. Wait.
Let me give you some cash.

531
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,190
It's fine.

532
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,230
I paid with his card.
Let's say he bought this meal.

533
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,030
I feel bad for Deok-jin.

534
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Goodness.

535
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,380
Ms. Ok, when did you first
get into this world?

536
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,820
I started this

537
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,890
because I was a huge fan of Iron Man.

538
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,630
It was fun. It was a good way
to relieve my stress.

539
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,130
You cannot tell anyone
that you saw me here today.

540
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,740
Must you go that far to hide this?

541
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,370
Of course, I must.

542
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Everyone will think that I'm an oddball
for doing this when I'm a teacher.

543
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,880
Why are teachers who do costume play
considered odd?

544
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,280
You must own it.

545
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,150
If a schoolteacher

546
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,490
goes around in this costume,

547
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,120
no parents would trust me
and send their children to my school.

548
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,190
It's impossible.

549
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,000
Well,

550
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,230
I think of three impossible things
a day on purpose.

551
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
First,

552
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,710
Iron Man will become the model
for a game made by my company.

553
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,810
Second,

554
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:11,310
a 37-year-old man can turn into
an 18-year-old teenager.

555
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,750
And lastly,

556
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,280
Ms. Ok will eventually realize
how I feel about her.

557
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,600
No matter what you say to me,

558
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,300
the fact that I'm abnormal won't change.

559
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,170
It seems that way.

560
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:38,770
Pardon?

561
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,480
This is a secret,

562
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,980
but all cool people are abnormal.

563
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,440
What do you think?
Does it fit your palate?

564
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,210
I remembered that you like dumplings
which is why I bought them.

565
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,640
Do you remember that?

566
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,410
Yes. It's delicious.

567
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Thank you.

568
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,820
I'll buy some for you more often.

569
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,190
How's school?

570
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,490
Does anyone bully you?

571
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,060
Gosh, Father.
Why would you worry about that?

572
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,200
You're right.

573
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,840
You may look like a child,
but you're a full-grown adult.

574
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,340
I'm making a fuss for no reason.

575
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,410
I understand.

576
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,740
No matter how old a child is, they're
still a kid in their parents' eyes.

577
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,110
When you were young,

578
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,650
I scolded you quite a lot.

579
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,490
You were quite bossy.

580
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,920
What? Weren't you like that too?

581
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,790
Of course I was.

582
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,100
I thought I wouldn't be like that,

583
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,700
but as I was raising my kids,

584
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,670
I realized I became
bossier than you were.

585
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,500
Really?

586
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,940
Yes.

587
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,370
I scolded my kids a lot,

588
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,810
and I would always be stubborn
and lecture them.

589
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,380
I thought

590
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,010
it was for my kids,

591
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,120
but it was all for myself.

592
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Now that I became friends with my kids,

593
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,290
I understand how they feel now.

594
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,230
I was lacking in many ways too.

595
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,700
Father, please eat these before
they get cold.

596
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Okay.

597
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040

of the woman who wants a divorce

Hello, sir.

- Is he serious?

652
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,820
I listened to them because
I wanted to be on good terms.

653
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,720
Do you think I listened to them
because I wanted to?

654
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,560
I can relate to the wife's side.

655
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,160

I can't. Listen.

659
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,270
All of his sisters are unmarried,

667

That's worth getting a divorce over.

Dr. Park Jae-in.
What do you think about this?

673
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,710
Yes. From a psychological perspective,

674
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,380
I'm against this divorce.

675
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,620
I believe that the problem lies entirely
with the wife.

676
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,190
- What is he saying?
- Is he serious?

- How is she the problem?
- What is he saying?

678
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,990
What is the problem?

679
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,530
If she knew he had three sisters,

680
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,230
she never should've gotten married.

681
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,130
- Is he serious right now?
- How can he say that?

682
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,600
Is that so?
Then I really should get a divorce.

683
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,870
Not at all.
You got married despite knowing,

684
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,570
so you should take
responsibility for it.

685
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,810
I don't want to.
I'm going to get a divorce!

686
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,780
I said you can't!

687
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,110
I have three older sisters too,

688

690

You're right.
Who said I wanted to go on a TV show?

694
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,630
You're right. It's all my fault.

695
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,440
This show and our marriage

so you can't be negligent towards them.

730
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,220
However,
a daughter-in-law is not a guest

731
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,190
but a part of the family.

And under the name of family,
they demand service.

Since this kind of

this is why

Yes, two of the main reasons are

00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,660
one party having to do most of the work
raising their children and doing chores.

All you do is lie down when you're home.

769
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,760
When I come home, I feed our kid

770
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,160
and do all the chores!

771
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,660
You're not the only one with a job.

772

- She had surgery!
- What?

779
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,710

six months ago.

781
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,250
I asked the doctor
what caused the myoma,

782
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,020
and she said that
it's because of stress.

783
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,920
- Come on!
- That's terrible.

Why do you say so?

814
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,620
Listening to the two talk,

815
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,330
I noticed

816
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,530
that they're not honest to each other.

817
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,730
This is

818
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,600
a common mistake in couples.

819
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,440
At first,

820
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,410
people don't tell their partners

821
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,280
what they're going through
because they don't want to worry them.

822
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,880
The coach gave his blessing.

823
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,080
Thank you for the offer,

824
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,450
but I don't have time for that.

825
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,550
Why not?

826
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,390
Si-woo is sick.
I need to make money for him.

827
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,360
You're drinking again.

828
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,560
Is something wrong?

829
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,600
It's nothing.

830
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,440
When they hide
what they're going through,

831
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,340
and when the partner makes
a hurtful comment on top of that,

832
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,840
they get disappointed.

833
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,920
They want their partner to know,

834
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,080
and they want to be understood.

835
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,550
But ironically,

836
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,590
they aren't honest

837
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,990
to their partners.

838
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,840
Sir, you need to pay me
the travel expenses.

839
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,580
That product was discontinued long ago,

840
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,850
so we just don't have the parts.

841
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,120
Why would I pay you
when you've fixed nothing?

842
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,320
Get out!

843
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,220

<i>Sir!</i>

845

You didn't get the travel expenses?

846
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,800
You need to cover it
out of your pocket, then.

Aren't you embarrassed to face our kids?

Are you embarrassed of me?

and the anger and the disappointment
only build up.

856
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,470
Just like that,

857
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,600
we often misunderstand one another,

858
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,910
and forget

859
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,170
about the other's heartfelt intentions.

If you get divorced for this reason,

you might regret it later on.

that they'll regret it
if they get divorced.

864

But Ms. Jung, you got divorced yourself.

as much as I did all this time,

886
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,750
I would've thanked him

You did well.

973
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,000
It's okay.

974
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,940
You did well.

975
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,440
Are you all right?

976
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,280
How much did she drink?

977
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,720
Let me see your face.

978
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:03,430
Dae-young.

979
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,210
What took you so long?

980
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,350
I've been waiting for you.

<i>Jung Da-jung. Get a grip.</i>

984
01:06:04,946 --> 01:06:06,446
Why are you flustered?

985
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:10,556
My goodness.
Ye Ji-hoon looks so hot in person.

Stop smiling at random guys and all.

989
01:06:18,596 --> 01:06:19,826
They get the wrong idea.

990
01:06:19,896 --> 01:06:22,366
If you're coming at me
because you're undergoing puberty,

991
01:06:22,596 --> 01:06:23,836
I hope you stop it here.
