if you didn't take taxis.

183
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,562
That's 5 days a week, and there are 4
weeks in a month, so that's 20 days.

184
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,650
Let's say the cab fare is 8,000
won from your home to school.

185
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,750
<i>20 times 8,000 won is 160,000 won.</i>

186
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,952
That's 160,000 won!

187
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,220
You spend 160,000 won a
month, but that's not enough?

188
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,830
You!

189
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,460
Have you ever thought about
how your father feels?

190
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,830
Have you ever thought of your
father as you paid for the cab?

191
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,340
Woo-young, it's a misunderstanding.

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
You!

193
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,970
Your makeup is more natural now.

194
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,940
That's great.

195
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,280
Woo-young, you're misunderstanding.

196
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,310
And you!

197
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,750
Stop calling me SG Boy.

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,050
I don't like it.

199
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,820
SG Boy is a compliment.

200
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,916
Superior Gene Boy.

201
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,620
<i>SG Boy: Superior Gene Boy</i>

202
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,890
Does it bother you?

203
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,100
That's what that means?

204
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,100
My dad is a cab driver.

205
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
That's why he drives me
to school every day.

206
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
I see.

207
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,110
Your father is a cab driver?

208
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm just saying all of
this for your own good.

209
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,350
You know what I mean, right?

210
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,450
Nonsense.

211
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,850
"Nonsense"?

212
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,250
Hong Si-ah, can you speak a little nicer?

213
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,860
It's fine to be like that to me,
but if you do that to everyone else,

214
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,560
people aren't going to like you.

215
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,590
Stop it. That's enough.

216
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,370
I can't stand a single minute
with him.

217
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,440
Let's go.

218
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,500
What? What did I do wrong?

219
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,010
Si-ah hates people
who are like her dad.

220
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,140
You know,
the really old-fashioned people.

221
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,710
"Really old-fashioned"?

222
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,910
Si-ah's father is only 37,

223
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,380
so what do you mean, "old-fashioned"?

224
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,420
Age isn't what makes
someone old-fashioned.

225
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,720
Si-ah's dad is notorious.

226
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,790
Don't worry, Woo-young.

227
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,490
You're not that bad yet.

228
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
We're going now.

229
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,660

232
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,470
But I think Woo-young has a point.

233
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,510
If you think about it, my
dad drives me to school

234
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,910
because I wake up late every morning.

235
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,040
Yet, I've been taking him for granted.

236
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,480
What are you saying?

237
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,450
I agree. When he asked,
"How would your father feel?",

238
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,280
it kind of touched my heart.

239
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,350
I agree.

240
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,290
Let's be good to our dads
from now on.

241
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes, I'm not going to ask
him for allowance anymore,

242
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,690
and I'll wake up early.

243
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,050
They really do look alike.

244
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,430
I feel bad. What if I just
hurt the kid for no reason?

245
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm going to head home after
taking the trash out.

246
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,970
Sure. I'll take care of the rest.

247

You scored a very high number

But why did you graduate so late?

332
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,130
I went to college late

If you have any cravings, let me
know. I'll buy you anything you want.

361
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,550
- Why would you do that?
- What?

362
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
We're friends.

363
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,230
Si-woo, why don't we play
basketball to help digest all this food?

364
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,030
No, I don't want to. I'm not good at it.

365
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,330
You were pretty good.

366

How come you don't have any
confidence about yourself?

367
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,700
Si-woo.

368
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,180

close with Woo-young.

- It's nothing.

It was

374
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,540
a misunderstanding. I can understand.

375

Thank you.

- I'll get going.
- Okay. Bye.

378
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,250
Si-woo, I have great news.

379
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,550

A mom, not with elementary school kids.

She's a mom with twins
who go to high school?

389

A mom was ranked first in
the open recruitment at JBC?

390

The higher-ups will give us an earful

just to hire a mom!

392

You were selected

period is three months long.

If you fall short in your performance

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Are those punks serious?

538
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,760
I saw Gu Ja-sung bully you again.

539
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,030
Aren't you going to do anything?

540
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,160
If I keep it in,

541
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,660
it will pass.

542
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,640
Si-woo. If you keep it in,

543
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,740
the strong will get stronger,
and the weak will become weaker.

544
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,440
Then what should I do?

545
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,640
Should I fight with him?
Should I go and get into a fight?

546
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,810
When you need to fight,

547
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
you should.

548
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,190
It's true. I'm not lying. It's true.

549
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,590
It's true.

550
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,390
- Stop lying.
- I'm telling the truth.

551
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,230
It's...

552
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,430
Hey, Gu Ja-sung!

553
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,250
Let's fight.

554
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,920
- There's a fight!
- There's a fight!

555
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,920
Guys, there's a fight outside!

556
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,420
- Let's go outside.
- Let's watch.

557
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,930
- There's a fight outside!
- There's a fight.

558
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,500
- Someone's fighting.
- There's a fight!

559
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,930
Who's fighting who?

560
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,030
- Hey, Hong Si-ah.
- Si-ah.

561
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,200
Gu Ja-sung and Hong Si-woo
got into a fight.

562
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
What?

563
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,730
- Keep your promise.
- Okay.

564
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,300
If you win, I won't bother
Hong Si-woo anymore.

565
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,730
But if I win,

566
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,140
let me punch you ten times.

567
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,140
Sure.

568
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,380
But that's not going to happen.

569
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,380
You realize that we're on
the basketball team, right?

570
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,820
You're an amateur. I'll
give you some advantage.

571
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,950
Come at me first.

572
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,790
Look at you, underestimating me.

573
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,690
We're playing for ten points.

574
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,010
Si-woo, it's okay. Just play
as you've been playing.

575
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,350
Got it?

576
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,240
Why do you keep following Si-woo?

577
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,040
Because you feel bad?

578
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,180
Do you play basketball with your mouth?

579
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,800
He's so cool!

580
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,010
Si-woo!

581
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,550
- You did it!
- This is awesome.

582
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,920
That's my son.

583
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,650
Si-woo!

584
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,290
That's incredible.

585
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,960
You did it!

586
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,460
No way!

587
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,700
Great job.

588
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Get out of my way.

589
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,180
You don't have to be
embarrassed about losing.

590
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,710
But you should be embarrassed that
you contradicted yourself

591
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,920
as a man.

592
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,020
I get it! Get out of my way.

593
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,410
When you said that you wanted to fight,

594
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,710
I thought you wanted
to fight with fists.

595
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,680
What kind of a person do you think I am?

596
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,190
Violence isn't the answer to everything.

597
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,590
Hey,

598
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,330
it's really a waste of talent.

599
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,530
If someone like you doesn't play
basketball, then who will?

600
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,900
You're the tallest one
and also the best.

601
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,730
You're being too nice.

602
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,740
There are lots of kids who
can play as good as I can.

603
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,270
Don't be discouraged.

604
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,670
At school and in life,

605
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,810
as long as you're good at one thing,

606
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,950
nobody can look down on you.

607
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,780
You're a great basketball player.

608
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,360
Let's get going now.

609
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,730
Hong Si-woo!

610
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,660
You're pretty good.

611
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,970
I heard that your dad was a
failed basketball player.

612
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,140
I guess you could still
learn from a failure like that.

613
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,240
How dare you?

614
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,640
- What was that?
- Don't bring parents into this.

615
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,110
You lunatic.

616
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,250
Lunatic?

617
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,420
Don't attack me like that!

618
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,290
I thought you said violence
isn't the answer to everything.

619
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,290
Si-woo, do you want to
watch baseball together?

620
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,930
- Baseball?
- Yes.

621
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,400
<i>Daehan versus Seum</i>

622
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,320
Go!

623
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,990
You can do it!

624
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,440
This is an emergency! He bailed!

625
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,070
I knew he'd cause trouble
one day. That crazy bastard.

626
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,640
All right. I'll find
someone and send them over.

627
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,210
Darn it.

628
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,410
Do you know anyone who's
not filming right now?

629
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,820
All right.

630
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,050
How can we not have enough
people when we just hired some?

631
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,790
Is nobody there?

632
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,230
I'm here, sir!

633
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,170
Are you the only one here, Ms. Jung?

634
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,970
Yes, I am.

635
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,140
I see. This is where it all ends for me.

636
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,350
- Sorry?
- Never mind.

637
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,050
It's getting late,
so you should go home.

638
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,450
All right. I'll get going now.

639
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,100
Whatever.

640
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,530
The point is to put the fire out,
not which firefighter puts it out.

641
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,170
Ms. Jung!

642
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,770
Ms. Jung!

643
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,840
- Yes, sir?
- Could you put the fire out?

644
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,850
- Ms. Jung?
- Yes.

645
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,760
There are only a few
minutes until the game is over.

646
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,990
You're going in right
away, so get ready to talk.

647
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,630
Do I get a script?

648
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,790
What do you mean, a script?
You need to write it yourself.

649
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,060
This is the record of the game tonight.
Write a script with this and come down.

650
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,330
Listen, Ms. Jung.

651
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,870
A live broadcast isn't
a walk in the park.

652
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,970
Just please don't cause
any trouble, all right?

653
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,380
Let's go, team!

654
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,110
Let's go!

655
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,510
Let's win!

<i>Daehan versus Seum</i>

657
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:46,450
Strike two!

00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,160
<i>Let's go!</i>

659
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,600
<i>The end!</i>

660
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,300
<i>The game is over!</i>

661
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,930
The final score is 6 to 0.

662
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,640
Player Ye Ji-hoon,
that was a perfect game.

663
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,870
Yes, Ye Ji-hoon
rescues Thursday night as usual!

664
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,680
He's going to be the
model for our company.

665
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:13,510
It'll definitely be a hit if he models.

666
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,080
Our Ji-hoon.

667
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,720
This is alcohol!

668
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,220
Sorry, I forgot that you quit drinking.

669
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,990
Come on.

670
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,930
<i>Seum is taking two wins in a row.</i>

671
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,900
<i>They strongly remain in first place.</i>

672
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,600
<i>I will now finish
broadcasting the game.</i>

673
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,830
<i>- Next up is Ye Ji-hoon's interview.</i>
- It's not what it looks like.

674
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,780
I've never seen you before.

675
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,210
Yes, nice to meet you.

676
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,150
Don't be nervous.

677
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,550
I'm not.

678
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,790
Don't you ever get nervous,
no matter what happens.

679
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,130
Okay, no matter what happens.

680
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,200
Standby!

681
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,540
All right. Cue!

00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,280
<i>We now have Player
Ye Ji-hoon with us here.</i>

683
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,480
Mom?

684
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,120
Congratulations on winning tonight.

685
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,980
Thank you.

686
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,860
That lunatic.

687
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,830
Thank you.

688
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:53,710
That lunatic.

689
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,120
Where's the template for an apology?

690
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,560
Gosh.

691
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,430
It was pretty hot today.

692
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,060
Getting splashed like
that chased away the heat.

693
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,830
I guess you can only
have celebratory gestures

694
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,940
like this one because
you guys won today, right?

695
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,670
<i>Yes. I did get splashed all over me.</i>

696
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,110
<i>But it does feel good.</i>

697
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,580
Nice, Da-jung. Gosh. She's pretty good.

698
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,280
<i>Ji-hoon, you allowed
5 batters hit over 9 innings.</i>

699
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,350
<i>You struck out five batters
without allowing any points.</i>

700
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,096
<i>This is your first shutout
game this season.</i>

702
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,420
What?

703
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,660
<i>Are you satisfied with
your performance today?</i>

704
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,760
<i>That's not my focus.</i>

705
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,700
<i>I wanted to do
my best for every pitch.</i>

706
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,200
<i>You're indeed humble.</i>

707
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,700
<i>Here's a fun fact about your stats.</i>

708
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,040
Among 16 wins from last season,

709
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,240
your team won 10 games on Thursday.

710
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,810
Did you expect your team
to win again today?

711
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,580
No, I didn't.

712
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,050
<i>Could you tell us the driving force
behind your wins?</i>

713
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,750

Recently, you turned
down an offer from the MLB,

01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

892
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,840
What should we eat for dinner?

893
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,340
I want fried rice.

894
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,410
Should we eat fried rice?

895
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,210
How about tteokbokki? Let's get going.

896
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,210
I want cheese tteokbokki.

897
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,210
Well,

898
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,520
you drew them with a permanent
marker, so they aren't going away.

899
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,990
My gosh, I'm sorry.

900
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,700
<i>On rainy days, people can
measure how big their love is.</i>

901
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,360
<i>Even when they share umbrellas, </i>

902
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,130
<i>as everyone holds
them at different angles, </i>

903
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,000
<i>it's clearly visible how
big their love is.</i>

904
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,740
<i>So love and rain come hand in hand.</i>

905
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,010
It's raining a lot.

906
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,520
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

907
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,750
I drew you the wrong whiskers.

908
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,420
Why? I had fun.

909
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:00,020
Right. The kids laughed too.

910
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,460
Is that so?

911
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:05,060
Come closer.

912
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,530
You'll catch a cold
if you get rained on.

913
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

914
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,670
Should we eat a delicious meal at home?

915
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

916
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,140
- Let's go.
- Okay.

917
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:46,179
<i>18 Again</i>

918
01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:48,579
<i>I want Ms. Jung Da-jung
to do my interview.</i>

919
01:05:48,649 --> 01:05:50,489
<i>Do you really want me
to interview you?</i>

920
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:53,019
<i>I find someone like you fascinating.</i>

921
01:05:53,089 --> 01:05:54,789
<i>I'll take care of myself.</i>

922
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:56,789
<i>Don't do that next time.</i>

923
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:58,429
<i>Why are you here so late?</i>

924
01:05:58,489 --> 01:05:59,929
<i>I have to meet someone.</i>

925
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,829
<i>So did you meet that person?</i>

926
01:06:01,899 --> 01:06:03,869
<i>Si-ah, are you okay? Wake up. Hong Si-ah!</i>

927
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:05,599
<i>Dae-young changed too.</i>

928
01:06:05,669 --> 01:06:07,899
<i>Everything about his situation
and his emotions</i>

929
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:09,669
<i>was all a lie.</i>

930
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:12,069
<i>Is Mr. Hong Dae-young
not here today again?</i>

931
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,369
<i>He's here.</i>
