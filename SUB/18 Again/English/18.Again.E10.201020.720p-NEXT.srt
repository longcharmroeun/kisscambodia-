She's always late to school.

They are so curious
about my anchorwoman daughter.

They wanted to know
what your next TV show is.

When will that be?

398
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,029
I did get an offer
to be on a show recently.

399
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:41,199
Really? Gosh. That's great.

400
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,569
But

401
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:44,929
the show is

402
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,569
about divorce.

403
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,579
I thought about it,

404
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,479
and I'm going to go on

405
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,549

406
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,519
Of course you should.
Were you planning not to?

407

Are you okay with it?

408
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,529
What's wrong with
a program about divorce?

409

I'm okay with it too.

It's been a while since you appeared
in a new program,

You did a great job.

433

You must be that difficult girl.

Kids at this age usually disappear
at the blink of an eye.

481

My kids were like that too.

You were like that too?

485
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,769
Seo-yeon. Don't go anywhere this time,

486
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,969
and wait in the greenroom okay?

487

I want to go.

499
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:33,779
Okay.

500
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,479
Yahoo!

501
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,919
A lot of kids asked each other out
last year.

502
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,119
Will it happen again this year?

503
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:43,519
I wonder how many couples there will be
this time.

504
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:47,119
Why are you so interested in
other people's dating lives?

505
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:50,289
Oh, my. Hong Si-ah.
It's so obvious you never dated.

506
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:53,429
What? I never dated by choice.

507
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,059
I haven't met anyone I like yet.

508
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,599
Really? What kind of guy do you like?

509
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:01,169
Let's see.

510
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,269
Someone who's forward.

511
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,869
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

512
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,789
Why are you sitting here?
There are plenty of other seats.

513
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,089
I like this seat.

514
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:23,289
What are you saying?

515
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:33,969
Let's get ready for class.

516
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,309
I have an announcement first.

517
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,539
The duet performance assessment
I assigned at the beginning

518
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:41,239
of the semester will be next week.

519
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,609
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

520
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,279
- What?
- Did you start?

521
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,619
Woo-young, you don't have a partner
because you transferred.

522
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,719
Who is your closest friend?

523
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:52,819
Si-ah.

524
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,929
Who is Si-ah's partner?

525
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:01,929
It's me, Bo-bae.

526
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:05,469
Then Si-ah, Bo-bae, and Woo-young

527
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:07,269
can prepare a trio together.

528
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,269
Okay.

529
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:14,279
Hey, Go Woo-young.

530
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:16,779
Do you know how to play any instruments?

531
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:25,619
I played a bit of guitar
back in the day.

532
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,219
Really?

533
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,059
Then try playing it.

534
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:41,999
It's been a while,

535
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,809
so I don't know if I'll do well.

536
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:35,259
Gosh, Woo-young is really good
at playing the piano, right, Si-ah?

537
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:37,929
You're right.

538
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,899
- Woo-young.
- Yes?

539
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:41,059
Can you play another song?

540
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:42,499
Another song?

541
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,039
Okay.

542
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:22,499
♫ Even if life drives us apart ♫

543
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:26,069
♫ Let's only love enough to turn away ♫

544
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:31,709
♫ Without being so heartbroken ♫

545
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,649
♫ Let's only leave ♫

546
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,919
♫ Memories that we can forget ♫

547
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:42,189
♫ In each other's hearts ♫

548
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:45,429
♫ Promise me so ♫

549
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:48,529
♫ I now know ♫

550
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,669
♫ That love too deep ♫

551
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:55,169
♫ Only brings ♫

552
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:58,309
♫ The most tragic ending ♫

553
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:01,479
♫ I wish ♫

554
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:04,779
♫ For your next love ♫

555
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:07,879
♫ Won't be like ours ♫

556
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:11,349
♫ Won't be as painful as ours ♫

557
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:22,829
♫ You have to be happier ♫

558
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:28,169
♫ Than me ♫

559
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:48,859
This question is from your fan.

560
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:53,499
Mr. Ye Ji-hoon.
What's your plan for the future?

561
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:57,669
I'd like to keep my game
up until the end of the season

562
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:01,469
and show only my best self to my fans.

563
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,379
Keep in mind that popularity is a factor
when we consider you for full contracts.

564
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,209
Bring your games up, everyone.

565
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,989
You got quite a lot of attention
for adopting your niece.

566
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:22,359
You're young and quite handsome,

567
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:24,789
so a lot of fans must be
disheartened by the news.

568
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:25,929
Excuse me?

569
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:28,399
We promised not to bring his niece up.
What should I do?

570
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,069
Goodness.

571
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:32,469
You have a child now,

572
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:34,939
but you must still want to get married
one day.

573
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:39,139
What do you look for in a woman?

574
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,009
What do I look for?

575
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:48,649
I wasn't expecting this question.

576
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,499
"'Mirror, mirror,'"

577
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,169
"'who's the prettiest
girl in the world?'"

578
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:08,399
"'It's Snow White in the woods,
of course!'"

579
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:10,639
"Then, the witch said,"

580
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:13,779
"'What did you just say?
Snow White is prettier than me?'"

581
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,349
"'Who's that? Unacceptable!'"

582
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:19,849
"'Buy an apple that'll
grant you a wish!'"

583
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:22,419
"'Snow White, please
hold out your hand.'"

584
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:26,149
"'Eat this apple,
and you'll become beautiful.'"

585
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:28,219
There we go.

586
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:30,059
Read it to me again!

587
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:31,389
Again?

588
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:34,099
Read it to me again!

589
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:37,599
Mr. Ye, did the interview go well?

590
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:38,669
Yes.

591
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:40,799
Did you have fun today?

592
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,169
Yes. Look at my hair!

593
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,269
Seo-yeon, you look beautiful!

594
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,439
I want some more ice cream.

595
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,179
You do? What do you want?

596
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:51,379
I'll get it for you.

597
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:54,249
I'll get it.

598
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:57,149
All right.

599
00:43:57,849 --> 00:43:59,549
You know how to pay, right?

600
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:00,659
Yes.

601
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:12,499
I'll take one chocolate
ice cream, please.

602
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:13,569
Okay.

603
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,409
She's even prettier
with her hair braided.

604
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,139
Too bad I can't do that for her.

605
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:23,209
Braiding is hard for men.

606
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:24,479
Thank you.

607
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:26,249
By the way,

608
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:27,979
congratulations.

609
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:29,679
Sorry?

610
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:31,589
I heard that you got into a program.

611
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:35,419
You're going to kill it this time again.

612
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:40,059
I wasn't going to take it,

613
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:42,629
but they love watching me work.

614
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,399
- Who?
- My kids,

615
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:47,099
although I heard it from someone else.

616
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:48,999
See?

617
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,569
I told you that your family would
support you.

618
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:54,209
So, Ms. Jung,

619
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:56,979
just be yourself.

620
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:01,549
Thank you.

621
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:12,229
Yes, sir? I'm here. Where are you?

622
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:14,759
Okay.

623
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,969
- I guess there's a public proposal.
- No way!

624
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:21,369
<i>Will you date me?</i>

625
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:24,539
<i>Will you date me?</i>

626
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:29,639
Ms. Ok.

627
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:34,819
I thought you wanted to grab a coffee.
Why are we here?

628
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,049
Let's first go there.

629
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:39,219
There?

630
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:43,019
You didn't do that, did you?

631
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:44,959
Of course not.

632
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:47,559
What kind of a crazy man does that
at a park?

633
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:50,569
Why don't you sit on
the bench over there?

634
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,999
- I'll bring the coffee over.
- Sure.

635
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:58,969
Take it all down.

636
00:45:59,169 --> 00:46:00,179
Take it all down!

637
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:09,549
Thank you.

638
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:13,919
Ms. Ok, thanks for agreeing
to go on a date with me.

639
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,159
What do you mean, a date?

640
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:21,399
Remember how I asked you out for coffee
at the gym?

641
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,229
I just agreed

642
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:26,469
because you went through that day.

643
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:30,109
But you said that
you thought I was cool.

644
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:32,169
I meant as a father,

645
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:33,779
not as a love interest.

646
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:40,219
Please kindly refrain
from such inappropriate behavior

647
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:41,879
and presents.

648
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,419
Why do you not like me?

649
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:47,759
If it's

650
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:50,259
because I'm a parent,

651
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:52,759
- I'm actually...
- You, sir,

652
00:46:57,729 --> 00:46:59,329
are an anime fan.

653
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:01,669
I don't like anime fans.

654
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:04,209
I'm sorry.

655
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:24,659
Ae-rin. Chu Ae-rin.

656
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:25,829
Chu Ae-rin!

657
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:27,829
What? What, what?

658
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:30,669
You can have this.

659
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:34,199
What's with the bouquet?

660
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,439
I don't need it anymore.

661
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:38,869
I got rejected.

662
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:41,579

<i>I see.</i>

823
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:33,632
She must be good-natured, professional,

824
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:34,972
and beautiful.

825
01:01:36,102 --> 01:01:39,572
She's the whole package.
There are no women like her.

No, there is. She's right here.

You're here. Let's go.

836
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:57,722
Have you ever dated a girl before?

837
01:02:58,922 --> 01:02:59,992
Yes.

838
01:03:00,752 --> 01:03:02,192
What was she like?

839
01:03:02,522 --> 01:03:05,392
Wait. Don't tell me
you're dating a girl.

840

No.

841
01:03:07,962 --> 01:03:09,932
I was just curious.

842
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:12,072
What was she like?

843
01:03:16,472 --> 01:03:18,272
Let me tell you about her.

844
01:03:23,942 --> 01:03:26,282
<i>She had a beautiful smile.</i>

845
01:03:28,122 --> 01:03:30,152
I think I can do a good job.

846
01:03:30,622 --> 01:03:32,652
<i>She was brave and cheerful,</i>

847
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:34,762
<i>so just watching her gave me strength.</i>

848
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:37,992

no matter how hard it gets,

I hope you'll take
