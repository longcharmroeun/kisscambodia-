00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,140
Yes.

177
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,350
After your probationary period, only three
of you will become full-time employees.

178
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,050
I see.

179
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,190
Thank you for telling me.

180
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,290
I should give you some information since
I'm in the anchor department.

181
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,020
But Yu-mi.

182
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,990
You're in fourth place right now.

183
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm in fourth place?

184
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,270
Yes.

185
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,970
I saw the producers' score sheet.

186
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,170
At this point, it won't be the
baby mother that'll get fired.

187
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,470
It'll be you.

188
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,170
You know your probationary
period is almost over, right?

189
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,880
Yes, I do.

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,850
Mr. Heo.

192
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,020
I would like to take half
the day off tomorrow.

193
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,020
Why do you need half the day off?

194
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,790
Are you going on
a picnic with your kids?

195
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
No.

196
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,870
I'm getting

197
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,500
a divorce tomorrow.

198
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,270
What?

199
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,770
A divorce?

Gosh, Mr. Choi. I'm so sleepy.

205
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,910
I'll wake up if you tell
us about your first love.

206
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,080
First love, my foot. Go wash your face.

207
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,410
Gosh. Tell us about your first love.

208
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,420
First love.

209
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,420
- First love.
- First love.

210
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,950
- First love.
- First love.

211
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,120
- Be quiet. Okay. Enough.
- First love.

212
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,060
Goodness.

213
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,530
Okay then.

214
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,800
My first love

215
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,170
went to high school with me.

216
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,700
I saw a movie with my first love,

217
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,740
and I still can't forget that day.

218
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,950
We will all pray now.

219
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,190
- Amen.
- Let's begin.

220
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,900
Da-jung!

221
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,570
Everyone is watching a movie together.

222
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,540
Would you like to join us?

223
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
A movie?

224
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,570
What movie?

225
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,840
"Bungee Jumping of Their Own".

226
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Sure.

227
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,980
Everyone canceled last-minute.

228
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,820
- Really?
- Let's just watch anyway.

229
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Sure.

<i>and drop one seed from the sky.</i>

233
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,700
<i>The chance of that seed floating
down, landing right on the needle.</i>

234
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,840
We were so naive.

235
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,110
I could barely even hold her hand.

236
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,820
I wonder what would've
happened had I held her hand that day.

237
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,220
That's so sad.

238
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,190
Poor you.

239
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,990
But actually,

240
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,560

- Come on.

<i>Maybe that's why I'm getting divorced.</i>

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,270
Why? Your parents were
also each other's first love.

254
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,070
No, Mom said that
Dad isn't her first love.

255

What?

256
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,940
He's not her first love?

258
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Sorry.

259
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,180
I heard that they
were each other's first love.

260
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,690
Mr. Go surely talks a lot.

261

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,200

Her first love

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,180
was someone else.

265
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,220
Who is her first love, then?

266
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,920
Well...

who's your first love?

269
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,930
Dad.

270
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,930
What? You said that he wasn't.

271
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,500
Not your dad. My dad.

272
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,140
That's lame.

273
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,910
Why? Your first love is Dad, isn't it?

274
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,410
I'd take anyone who's not like Dad.

275
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,610
That's amazing.

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120

So, they're each other's first love.

278

They say that first
love never works out,

279
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,490
but those two did.

280
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,069
I guess first love never works out.

294
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,430
This is so annoying.

295
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,760

All right, then.

322
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,190
It's only going to get
harder from your divorce.

323
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,560
Just give me a call when you need a man.

324
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,960
Is he out of his mind?

325
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,830

I'm just saying, call me if you need
anyone to carry heavy things for you.

328

I won't be needing a man.

329

330
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,250
Did he cheat on you?

331
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,020
Or do you just not love him anymore,

332
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,220
because he's uneducated and
has a low-paying job?

333
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,360
Stop it.

334
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,860
Dae-young was

335
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,660
He doesn't deserve your trash talk.

337
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,000

she's still beautiful.

350

Your first love.

352
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,340
No, drop it.

353
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,940
She's a mom.

354
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,740
And she's getting a divorce too.

355
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,480
Then, isn't that easier?

356
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,980
Hey. You know what? I'm going to bet

357
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,480

You're right. It's
already been three weeks.

doubled on the bet, right?

easily? Gosh, thank you for that.

Your days are over, Il-kwon.

You can't even seduce a divorced mom.

Hey, it wasn't that I couldn't
I chose not to seduce her.

You know what?
You should go double next time.

- Are you working late too?
- Get lost.

392
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,780
How could your friend, Dae-young,
be so busy lately?

393
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,050
Why can't we reach him when
his own daughter is sick?

394
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,020
Then, what about your
awesome friend, Da-jung?

395
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,820
Why is she divorcing him for not
being there when he was busy working?

396
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,120
Don't you remember the school reunion?

397
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,160
It's crystal clear that
he was at fault there.

398
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,130
Why would you bring
up the school reunion here?

399
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,900
- It's a lovers quarrel.
- What's wrong with them?

- Do you really have no clue?
- I don't.

- Weren't you at the school reunion?
- No.

I didn't go either.

404
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,980
Gosh. But after hearing what
happened from Da-jung,

405
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,050

00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,910
I just sit there and watch him drink.

713
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,180
I just find it so pathetic
when he drinks alone.

714
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,680
I'm his only friend.

715
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,980
Yes, I have no friends.

716
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,120
What?

717
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,090
Just go with it.

718
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,060
- Sir?
- Yes?

719
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,760
We need to talk.

720
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,480
I just need to ask you something.

721
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,510
Go ahead.

722
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,850
What kind of a day is it today that
Woo-young can't come to school,

723
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,920
and has to drink?

724
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,350
The day of divorce.

725
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,920
- The day of divorce?
- Yes.

726
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,990
Yes, Woo-young...

727
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,190
No, I mean,

728
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,400
not me, either.

729
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,900
You know what? I wonder as well.

730
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,340
Why didn't he go to school today?

731
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,370
Mr. Go,

732
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,540
are you unaware of what's
going on in Woo-young's life,

733
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,580
or are you not saying
anything because you don't trust me?

734
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,280
Neither.

735
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,410
What?

736
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,880
If I had to choose, though,

737
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,150
I'll go with the former.

738
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,220
I'm very disappointed in you, then.

739
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,220
Sorry?

740
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,190
No matter how busy you
are, I plead that as his dad,

741
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,030
you at least look after his drinking
issue and him attending school.

742
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,360
I'll keep an eye out for
him as well. Bye now.

743
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,800
Ms. Ok?

744
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,640
I should've chosen the latter.

745
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,250
Did it all work out?

746
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,550
Whatever.

747
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,790
What's wrong with him?

748
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,360
Why did you skip school?
You're in school!

749
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,630
What's he saying?

750
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,840
Hello! It's been so long.

751
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,170
Oh, my. You're right!

752
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,740
I haven't seen your
roommate in so long, either.

753
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,340
What? I live alone.

754
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,550
I'll head in now.

755
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,720
That's not true.

756
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:11,890
I saw another woman
come out of that house.

757
00:52:40,646 --> 00:52:42,316
Yes. What?

758
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:43,886
Should we go for a round today?

759
00:52:44,556 --> 00:52:45,686
Wait there.

760
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:46,756
Okay.

761
00:52:56,066 --> 00:52:57,896
She does have a roommate.

762
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:01,466
What took you so long?

763
00:53:01,536 --> 00:53:04,106
Are you the last one to
arrive because you're the oldest?

764
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:05,136
Yes.

765
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:07,046
Hurry and be my sniper. Gosh.

766
00:53:07,106 --> 00:53:08,776
All right. Let me set it up first.

767
00:53:08,846 --> 00:53:09,776
Okay.

receiving as presents?</i>

a present, go for a limited edition.</i>

Woo-young.

Hey, Bo-bae.

786
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,536
Why weren't you at school
yesterday? I was worried.

787
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:09,836
You know, Hong Si-ah
in Class 2-7. I so pity her.

788
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:11,676
The whole school knows
her parents split up.

789
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:13,706
- Exactly.
- Those brats. Hey!

790
00:54:14,606 --> 00:54:16,416
Why are you so interested in her life?

791
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:18,076
What's her deal? She's making it worse.

792
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:20,286
- Unbelievable. Hey!
- Bo-bae.

793
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:23,486
How do they know
that her parents split up?

794
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:26,256
What do you think? They
read it in the news articles.

795
00:54:27,356 --> 00:54:28,356
News articles?

796
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:36,836

Hey, Si-ah.

800
00:54:51,516 --> 00:54:52,516
What?

801
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:54,646
The bag popped.

802
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:55,746
What?

803
00:54:59,056 --> 00:55:00,186
Darn it.

804
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:02,686
I should bring a new bag.

805
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:04,656
I heard your parents split up.

806
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:09,936
Why are you picking up a fight?

807
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:12,266
It's not that.

808
00:55:13,336 --> 00:55:14,466
Hang in there.

809
00:55:16,506 --> 00:55:18,176
It's just that we don't talk about it.

810
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:20,076
But a lot of families
split up these days.

811
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:26,116
It's the same with my parents.

812
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:30,256
Every family has troubles.

00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,616
Don't let that get to you.

814
00:55:36,026 --> 00:55:37,126

816
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:45,796
As if.

817
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:07,356
Is that empty?

818
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:09,586
No. Someone is in there.

819
00:56:09,656 --> 00:56:10,656
Let's go somewhere else.

820
00:56:29,206 --> 00:56:30,316

825
00:56:42,856 --> 00:56:45,196
Gosh. Clean it up now.

01:01:01,846 --> 01:01:03,086
If you leave now,

892
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:05,386
I will disown you!

893
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:14,126
Grandpa.

894
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:17,466
Hey, how have you been?

895
01:01:19,136 --> 01:01:20,236
Grandpa!

896
01:01:21,436 --> 01:01:22,436
Come here.

897
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:24,076
You've grown.

898
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,406
Did you have a good day?

899
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,476
Yes.

900
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,146
You studied hard, right?

901
01:01:32,216 --> 01:01:34,046
- I tried my best.
- You did?

902
01:01:35,746 --> 01:01:36,786
Good job.

903
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:48,226
By the way, who is he?

904
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:50,936
He's my friend.

905
01:01:51,136 --> 01:01:52,666
- Your friend?
- Yes.

906
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:06,246
You...

907
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:15,956
You don't look like you
listen to your parents.

908
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:23,796
Let's practice tomorrow.
I have to get going.

909
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,936
- Okay.
- Let's go.

910
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:28,766
- What do you want to eat? Really?
- I want to eat snack bar food.

911
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:30,976
That sounds good. Let's go.

912
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,116
- Dig in.
- Thank you.

913
01:02:38,816 --> 01:02:40,786
I heard from your mother.

914
01:02:41,446 --> 01:02:42,716
This must be tough on you guys.

915
01:02:42,786 --> 01:02:44,016
It's okay.

916
01:02:44,816 --> 01:02:46,216
Don't worry about us.

917
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:47,886
Eat up.

918
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:54,896
- Get home safely.
- We'll visit you next time.

919
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:56,796
- Okay. Get home safely.
- Okay.

920
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,696
- Bye.
- Bye.

921
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:05,736
<i>Snack Bar</i>

922
01:03:46,376 --> 01:03:48,846
<i>Priority Seat</i>

923
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,286
- Bye.
- All right.

924
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:58,626
You should do that later, okay?

925
01:03:58,696 --> 01:04:01,366
- Okay.
- Okay. Drive safe.

926
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:46,336
Hello?

927
01:04:46,406 --> 01:04:48,246
Hey, come to my office now.

928
01:04:48,476 --> 01:04:49,706
Why? What is it?

929
01:04:50,216 --> 01:04:51,516
You'll know once you come.

930
01:04:51,576 --> 01:04:54,016
If you don't, you'll regret
it. You'd better come.

931
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:00,656
Gosh. What is this about now?

932
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:11,896
I signed everything.

933
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:13,296
We're done, right?

934
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:15,306
Yes, we are.

935
01:05:15,366 --> 01:05:17,236
But can you stay a bit longer?

936
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:19,536
My son is a huge fan of yours.

937
01:05:19,606 --> 01:05:22,406
I called him to come here without
telling him why. But he's not here yet.

938
01:05:23,946 --> 01:05:25,146
When will he be there?

939
01:05:25,216 --> 01:05:26,346
In 10 minutes.

940
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:29,316
Wait. 20 minutes? 30 minutes?

941
01:05:30,686 --> 01:05:31,786
I'm sorry.

942
01:05:31,856 --> 01:05:33,786
We should take a rain
check for your surprise.

943
01:05:33,856 --> 01:05:35,986
Then, can you give me your autograph?

944
01:05:37,196 --> 01:05:38,256
Sure.

945
01:05:39,296 --> 01:05:41,366
- What's his name?
- Hong Dae-young.

946
01:05:41,996 --> 01:05:42,996
Wait, no.

947
01:05:43,466 --> 01:05:44,466
Go Woo-young?

948
01:05:44,836 --> 01:05:46,766
Should I get one under Hong Dae-young?

949
01:05:47,706 --> 01:05:48,706
Pardon?

950
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,736
Make it to Go Woo-young, please.

951
01:05:53,506 --> 01:05:54,606
Go Woo-young.

952
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:08,926
Ms. Jung?

953
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:13,256
- Mr. Ye.
- What brings you here?

954
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:18,236
I'm going home after seeing my friend.

955
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:20,166
Gosh, what a small world.

956
01:06:20,236 --> 01:06:21,936
Funny running into you here.

957
01:06:32,116 --> 01:06:33,786
There are a lot of
news articles about you.

958
01:06:36,716 --> 01:06:37,686
Did you read them?

959
01:06:37,756 --> 01:06:39,016
How could I not?

960
01:06:39,356 --> 01:06:41,586
Whenever people saw me,
that's all they talked about.

961
01:06:42,026 --> 01:06:44,826
People talked about that with you?

962
01:06:45,226 --> 01:06:46,896
It's my problem. Why?

963
01:06:47,896 --> 01:06:50,936
Well, you were in the video too.

964
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:52,836
But I was the highlight of the video.

965
01:06:54,736 --> 01:06:57,776
I see. You mean the
articles about the interview?

966
01:06:58,076 --> 01:06:59,106
I'm sorry.

967
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,346
I mixed it up with another article.

968
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:02,806
Another article?

969
01:07:03,946 --> 01:07:05,476
Oh, yes. I read it.

970
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:11,016
Congratulations

971
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:12,956
on your divorce.

972
01:07:14,286 --> 01:07:15,356
Pardon?

973
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:20,926
All of the players
who started fresh after

974
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:23,866
making a debut or switching to
another team with my blessing did well.

975
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:27,466
I'm sure things will
work out for you too.

976
01:07:29,106 --> 01:07:30,306
That

977
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:32,876
applies to divorces too, right?

978
01:07:33,176 --> 01:07:34,206
Yes.

979
01:07:34,706 --> 01:07:35,806
A divorce

980
01:07:36,646 --> 01:07:37,976
is a new start too.

981
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:42,386
Lately, I've only been
criticized for my divorce.

982
01:07:43,986 --> 01:07:45,186
This is new.

983
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:53,526
Ms. Jung!

984
01:07:57,736 --> 01:07:58,836
Woo-young.

985
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:04,436
What brings you here?

986
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,206
To see my dad.

987
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,616
Who is he?

988
01:08:11,316 --> 01:08:12,846
He's my son's friend.

989
01:08:19,885 --> 01:08:21,055
Excuse me.

990
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,595
If you're busy, you can go.

991
01:08:27,996 --> 01:08:29,595
I'll say bye to Ms. Jung for you.

992
01:08:30,066 --> 01:08:32,736
I should say that to you.
If you're busy, you can go.

993
01:08:32,936 --> 01:08:34,406
I'll say bye to her for you.

994
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:35,836
Yes.

995
01:08:37,376 --> 01:08:38,906
It doesn't matter.

996
01:08:39,175 --> 01:08:41,006
I'm going to leave with her.

997
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:45,076
But

998
01:08:46,746 --> 01:08:48,616
why do you keep
dropping honorifics to me?

999
01:08:49,385 --> 01:08:50,456
What?

1000
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:54,986
Let's not be so casual when
we met for the first time today.

1001
01:09:42,936 --> 01:09:45,506
<i>Observation report 12</i>
<i>At 10:05 p.m.,</i>

1003
01:09:51,076 --> 01:09:54,346
<i>At 7:48 a.m., he went to school.</i>

1004
01:09:54,646 --> 01:09:56,646

about his school life.</i>

1006
01:10:00,926 --> 01:10:03,726

<i>No way.</i>

1009

<i>You already have a fan?</i>

1010
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,341
<i>I thought I knew a lot about women.</i>

1011
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:49,871
<i>But I can't figure out
how this lady feels.</i>

1012
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,781
<i>Ms. Jung, I have
something to tell you.</i>

1013
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:54,281
<i>Do you think this is good?</i>

1014
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:56,311
<i>I can't tell Da-jung that I'm me.</i>

1015
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:57,981
<i>All I can do is hover around her.</i>

1016
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:00,321
<i>Thank you for always
taking care of me.</i>

1017
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,751
<i>I don't think I ever properly
thanked you for it.</i>

1018
01:11:03,821 --> 01:11:05,191
<i>What? Breaking news?</i>

1019
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,121
<i>You should just do it, Ms. Jung.</i>

1020
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:08,191
<i>Pardon?</i>
