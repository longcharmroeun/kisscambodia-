<i>I'm sure it's not me.
Let's not overreact.</i>

185
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,800
It's probably because that woman

186
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,470
hasn't opened up to you yet.

187
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,370
What should I do?

188
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,510
Caring for her is the most important.

189
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,510
Women know when they're being cared for.

190
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,950
They can tell when you worry about them,

191
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,480
think about them,

192
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,150
and like them.

193
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,390
Then they will naturally open up to you.

194
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,110

198
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,500

199

- No, I signed for an essay-writing class.
- I see.

Didn't you have work today?

207

I didn't attend one.

252
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,200
How did you get ready for the exam?

253
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
I did it alone at home.

254
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,870
At home?

255
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,270
What, did you read newspapers
and highlight them?

256
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,570
Did you make it
because it was a blind recruit?

257
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,610
You must be very lucky.

258
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,950

259
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,220
- It's nothing.
- You seem

You're on your probation, and yet,
you've been receiving so much attention.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I've seen so many anchors

264
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,900
that focus on getting popular
than becoming a good anchor.

265
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,210

266
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,440
not making it to the end
because they lack skills.

267

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,010

358
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,550
It was incredible. Great job.

359
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,990
I told her to win with her skills,

360
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,030
and she really did.

361
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,130
Come on.

362
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,300
<i>Just now, around 4:05 a.m.,</i>

363
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,300
<i>there was an explosion, bringing fire,</i>

364
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,740
<i>and 25 people in the complex are
currently being evacuated.</i>

365
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,610
<i>The fire is being put out at the moment.</i>

366
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,440
This is a view from Mount Nam
hindered by the micro dust.

367
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,410
Seoul's micro dust level is still high.

368
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,320
There had been many reports of deaths
due to the high level of micro dust.

369
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,050
What are you doing with the TV on mute?

370
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm practicing my report
in case of breaking news.

371
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,160
How do you practice it?

372
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,530
For breaking news,

373
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,260
they make captions based on
the information reporters give out.

374
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,770
You can prove that you're a good reporter
by making as many captions you can.

375
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,030
Okay. I see.

376
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,070
There had been many reports of deaths...

377
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,640
<i>Early this morning,
an apartment in Seoul...</i>

378
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,150
<i>It's accompanied by a strong wind.</i>

379
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,050
<i>You can expect heavy rains
and strong wind starting tonight.</i>

380
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,990
<i>Please prepare yourselves for the storm.</i>

381
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,790
<i>Let's take a look at how
the government is preparing for this.</i>

382
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,430
<i>I'm Jung Da-jung of JBC News,
reporting from the scene.</i>

383
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,260
Well done,

384
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,830
Jung Da-jung.

385
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,370
- Your breaking news coverage was cool.
- Thank you.

386
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,220
Today, Ms. Jung Da-jung
performed very well

387
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,990
- during today's breaking news coverage.
- Yes.

388
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,790
She came up with 12 captions
which is our record.

389
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,590
I watched it on my way here.

390
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,430
Gosh, she's good.

391
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,230
Did Choi Ji-na give her all the tips?

392
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,870
No.

393
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,670
I heard from the field team.

394
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,070
<i>- All the reporters and anchors were</i>
- How is it?

395
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,740
<i>busy putting on makeup.</i>

396
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,580
<i>She was the only one
who went around the field</i>

397
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,710
<i>and collected information.</i>

398
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,180
That's why we could
get the most captions.

399
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,520
My gosh.

400
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,920
But

401
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,660
did you all read the comments?

402
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,730
- Comments?
- Read them.

403
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,930
<i>She's new, but she just got a divorce.</i>

404
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,270
It's quite a mess.

405
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,270
They only talked about her divorce
when this was a breaking news coverage.

406
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,370
Did you read that?

407
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,470
Did you?

408
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,910
She single-handedly embarrassed
every anchor at JBC.

409
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,180
Getting a divorce these days
isn't considered an embarrassment.

410
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,880
Then, should she be proud?

411
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,220
Images and reputations are
the most important for anchors.

412
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,960
When people hear her name, Jung Da-jung,

413
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,630
they'll only think about her divorce.

414
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,440
Whenever she's on TV, people only
talk about how she got a divorce.

415
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,540
Make her

416
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,770
keep a low profile.

417
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,510
Okay.

418
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,930
Ms. Kwon will be handling
your baseball interviews, Ms. Jung.

419
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,000
Pardon?

420
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,600
Me?

421
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,000
You'll start tomorrow.
Give her the materials.

422
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Sir, why am I being switched out
all of a sudden?

423
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,370
Did you think everything would go
smoothly after your divorce?

424
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,080
A public figure ought
to be more careful.

425
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,940
Is a divorce

426
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,950
something I should be careful with?

427
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,020
Pardon?

428
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,850
Of course, it is.

429
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,430
You're an anchor. How can your personal
life stand out more than your reporting?

430
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,130
I don't want to hear your complaints.

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,110
Thank you for the meal.

535
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,380
How is it? Is it edible?

536
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,750
It's delicious.

537
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,060
Isn't it hard?

538
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,870
No, it's not.

539
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,070
I feel like I'm making you suffer.

540
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,040
I'm sorry.

541
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,980
It's all my fault.

542
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,490
No, it's not, Father.

543
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,260
I should get going.

544
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,390
Oh, right.
Use this for your living expenses.

545
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,060
It's okay, Father.

546
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Take it.

547
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,770
Don't tell Dae-young.

548
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,800
If he finds out I came,

549
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,240
he would definitely hate it. Bye, then.

550
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,910
Wait.

551
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,010
Don't come out.

552
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,350
<i>Hong Dae-young</i>

553
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,130
Hello?

554
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,430
I'm sorry I couldn't
go to the courthouse.

555
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,930
Is that why you called?

556
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,140
I heard

557
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,170
you kept in contact with my father.

558
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,450
Why did you take care of him?

559
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,150
Because he's your parent.

560
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,890
My father said

561
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,330
mean things to you in the past.

562
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,230
But you're okay with it?

563
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,000
He apologized to me,

564
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,200
and you don't know this,

565
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,500
but he helped us a lot
when we were struggling.

566
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,870
- Da-jung...
- But

567
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,410
I can't take care of him anymore,

568
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,540
so you should do it from now on.

569
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,710
Goodbye.

570
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,060
Are you going home after meeting
with Si-woo?

571
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,290
Yes.

572
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,100
Did you forget your umbrella?

573
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
Yes.

574
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,870
Then use this.

575
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,870
It's okay.

576
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,340
My house is close by.
You should take this.

577
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,740
Then let's go together.

578
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,710
I'll walk you home.

579
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,170
Thank you. Get home safely, Woo-young.

580
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,010
Thank you

581
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,950
for always caring.

582
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,520
Goodness. You don't have to thank me.

583
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,490
I don't think

584
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,030
I ever thanked you properly.

585
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,710
Why are these here?

586
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,680
These are really expensive.

587
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,520
They are?

588
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,690
Yes. They just came out.

589
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,860
Gosh. I'm late.

590
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I'm going to school.

591
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,900
Okay.

592
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,090
<i>Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung</i>

593
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,510
Goodness.
What brings you to call this morning?

594
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,140
The sneakers you gave me last time.

595
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,580
I think they're too expensive for me
to accept out of goodwill.

596
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,420
Gosh. I told you I don't need them.

597
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,680
Then I'll pay you for them.

598
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,790
No...

599
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,260
Okay. Bring them to
the baseball stadium later.

600
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,860
Okay. I'll see you later.

601
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,870
- Hey.
- Yes?

602
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,400
What time is your interview today?

603
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,070
It's at 3 p.m.

604
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,640
- 3 p.m.?
- Yes.

605
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,010
Okay.

606
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,610
Good work everyone.

607
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,180
- Great work.
- Thanks for your good work.

608
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,580
- Good work.
- Good work.

609
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,960
I thought Anchorwoman Jung
was coming today.

610
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,930
I'm doing the interviews from now on.

611
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,090
Why is that?

612
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,830
Since Da-jung's news on divorce,

613
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,830
she got on everyone's bad side at JBC.

614
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:53,140
Why did she have to get divorced
and lower her reputation like that?

615
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,710
Is that something that would
lower a person's reputation?

616
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,110
She probably had an issue
if she got divorced, don't you think?

617
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,610
News anchors are public figures too.

618
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,490
I'm a public figure,
so I know this quite well.

619
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,720
Reputations crumble

620
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,630
more easily by saying the wrong thing
than getting divorced.

621
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,790
Sorry?

622
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,300
To some people, getting divorced may be
big news,

623
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,070
but to others, it's a big life decision.

624
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,470
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>

625
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,540
I'm just worried that when people
hear you say that,

626
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,440
it might hurt your reputation, you know.

627
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,850
Why is he defending her?

628
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,130
<i>May I know where the Teacher's Office
for grade 11 is?</i>

629
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,760
<i>The Teacher's Office for grade 11
is located on the 2nd floor.</i>

630
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,840
You can speak in sign language too?

631
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,980
Just a little.

632
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,480
You can really do everything.

633
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,580
It's nothing.

634
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,950
- Woo-young,
- Yes?

635
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,050
I have to study for the skills assessment,
so I don't think I can practice tonight.

636
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,350
Skills assessment?

637
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,290
Yes, the math skills assessment is due
tomorrow.

638
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,920
Did you not do it yet?

639
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,130
I should work on that.

640
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,230
You didn't do it?

641
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,270
Do you want to work on it together
at my house, then?

642
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,670
Sure, that sounds great!

643
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,100
Let's go.

644
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,940
You really didn't
need to bring anything.

645
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,310
How can I?

646
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,780
Nobody in our family eats this.

647
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,890
Gosh, you don't know.

648
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,270
What are you doing?

649
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,800
Si-woo, you can study.

650
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,240
I'll do the dishes.

651
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,770
What?

652
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,710
It's fine. Study.

653
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,520
I'm home.

654
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,330
You're drinking again?

655
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,700
It's my day-off. Let me drink.

656
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,340
Why can't you clean up after yourself?

657
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,880
You think we have
a cleaner or something?

658
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,610
Just leave it. I'll clean up after.

659
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,650
- When?
- After this.

660
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,080
Come on!

661
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,590
How much housework do you think you do?

662
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:55,750
I'd say

663
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,720
at least 50 percent.

664
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,160
No, more like 30 percent.

665
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,890
What? That's too little.

666
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,360
Seriously.

667
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,100
That's why you're losing!

668
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,110
How pathetic.
You didn't even do 30 percent.

669
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,380
Woo-young, aren't you going to work
on your assessment?

670
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,150
I'm fine. You can keep studying.

671
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,890
You're home.

672
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,860
What do you think you're doing here?

673
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,170
Woo-young is such a husband material.

674
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,100
Husband material? As if.

675
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,570
You think it's normal to do dishes
at someone else's house?

676
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,170
Did you eat?

677
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,410
Why do you care?
You think you're my dad or something?

678
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,510
What?

679
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,150
Bo-bae, let's watch some TV
before we start on the assessment.

680
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,190
Sure!

681
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,290
It's Ji-hoon!

682
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,490
Ye Ji-hoon?

683
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,130
Amazing!

684
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,940
- That's our Ji-hoon.
- Yes, our Ji-hoon.

685
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,070
"Our" Ji-hoon?

686
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,440
He's an old man!
And certainly not yours.

687
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,580
Who are you to have a say
on what I call him?

688
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,540
I'm...

00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,450
<i>I'm your father!</i>

692
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,580
Whatever. Men who look like that

693
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,220
are the men you need to be careful of,
all right?

694
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,350
What did you just say?

695
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,330
<i>Mother-in-law</i>

696
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,870
Who is he to say that about our Ji-hoon?

697
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,570
Yes, Mother?

698
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,450
How could you get a divorce
without coming to me first?

699
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,680
You think you two can just
decide on that among yourselves?

700
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,550
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever. Where are you?

701
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,560
Well,

702
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,490
- I'm in Busan.
- Still?

703
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,090
I'm sorry.

704
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,330
Isn't it basic manner to apologize
in person?

705
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,770
I'm sorry.
I'll go and meet you soon, Mother.

706
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,970
Whatever. Bye.

707
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,880
Soon?

708
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,720
How am I going to apologize
with this face?

709
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,890
I can't do that.

710
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,030
Grandmother, you must be tired
from your long trip.

711
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,730
Why didn't you give
a call before coming?

712
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,970
I just wanted to surprise
my grandchildren.

713
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,540
Goodness!

714
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,780
I'm sorry!

715
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,260
Woo-young, this is my grandmother.

716
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,830
Grandmother, he's my friend.

717
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,260
Is...

718
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,330
Is that right?

719
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,270
Hello, ma'am.

720
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,210
Si-woo, I'll get going first. Goodbye.

721
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,710
Si-a,

722
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,720
you have to be careful of men
who look like that.

723
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:47,890
What?

724
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,270
You're here.

725
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,040
Everyone else went home.
You're working so hard.

726
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,210
I got bored while waiting for you.

727
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,250
I'm sorry for coming so late.

728
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,980
Are you okay?

729
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,420
Of course.

730
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,420
I'm all healed now.

731
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,330
Can you try those on?

732
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,160
- Sorry?
- Help me practice while you're here.

733
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,900
- Right now?
- You said that you owe me.

734
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,040
Put those on and come out.

735
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,540
Come on.

736
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,350
Da-jung, keep your eyes open,

737
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,550
and watch the ball all the way.

738
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,840
Does this really help
with you practicing?

739
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,440
Of course. One more time!

740
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,750
Focus a little more.

741
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,250
Keep your feet grounded,

742
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,620
and relax your shoulders.

743
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:03,790
Relax.

744
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,390
Good.

745
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,180
You just got on the base.

746
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,280
Doesn't it feel great?

747
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,890
I know that you gave me
an easy one on purpose.

748
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,590
You still hit it anyway.

749
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,960
Even if it's hard and frustrating,

750
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,860
when you keep at it,
you get to hit it once.

751
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,800
Yes.

752
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,870
Don't be scared
just because you got a strike.

753
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,500
You never know if you'll hit the ball,
get a ground ball,

754
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,910
or hit a home-run

755
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,370
before you swing your bat.

756
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,480
So you should keep swinging to the end.

757
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:36,380
Did Ms. Kwon talk to you about me?

758
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,350
Sort of.

759
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,290
I thought

760
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,320
everything would be perfect
once I became an anchor.

761
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,100
But working at a company
isn't that easy.

762
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,360
After my divorce became a public record,

763
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,630
I lost all of my positions.

764
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,870
I'm trying to hang in there,

765
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,610
but I feel so bad for my kids.

766
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,380
Lately, I'm not sure
if I'm trying to achieve my dream

767
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,610
or if I'm being too ambitious.

768
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,020
I can't tell now.

769
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,020
What's so bad about being ambitious?

770
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,790
Ever since I decided
to become a ball player,

771
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,990
I've always been ambitious.

772
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,230
Really? You?

773
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,630
When other players got ahead of me

774
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,060
although I thought I was better,

775
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,500
I couldn't go to sleep that night
out of anger.

776
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,630
I would practice too much, get injured,

777
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,400
and inconvenience other people.

778
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,840
But

779
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,010
there were people who believed
in me to the end.

780
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,950
So you should aim high.

781
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,820
Your family will root for you.

782
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,590
Thank you.

783
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,260
Don't mention it.
I'm your number one fan.

784
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,060
What?

785
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,900
<i>I became your fan after seeing
how confident and brave you are.</i>

786
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,100
<i>I hope there are only sunshine
and rainbows in your future.</i>

787
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,670
<i>From your number one fan.</i>

788
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,540
Ms. Jung.
There's something I want to tell you.

789
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,180
Excuse me.

790
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,620
Hello?

791
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,860
What?

792
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,930
She might come home.
You should stay at home.

793
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,060
I'll look for her.

794
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,430
I'm sorry. I have to get going now.

795
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,970
What happened?

796
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,230
My daughter went missing.

797
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,340
Your daughter?

798
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,400
See you later.

799
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,690
- Hello?
<i>- This is the police.</i>

800
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,720
<i>Is this the guardian of Ye Seo-yeon?</i>

801
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,890
The police?

802
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,370
- Mr. Kim.
- Hello, sir.

803
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,870
Go home. You won't get anything tonight.

804
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,640
Okay.

805
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,410
Let me use the restroom.

806
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,350
Seo-yeon!

807
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,220
Are you okay?

808
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,090
Are you hurt?

809
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,530
Why did you leave without telling us?

810
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,860
Isn't that Ye Ji-hoon?

811
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,600
- I think he is.
- Right?

812
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,330
We found her in front of Mirae Hospital.

813
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,070
She was crying there with this photo.

814
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,570
Do you know who she is?

815
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,740
It's her mother.

816
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,810
But what's your relationship
to this child?

817
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,950
I am her father.

818
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,520
What?

819
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,080
Her father?

820
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,990
Are you okay? Don't cry.

821
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,320
It's all right.

01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,210

Of course, not.

I'm sorry,
but I'll officially turn it down.

Why is that?
Why are you turning it down?

881
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,380
If you give me a reasonable answer,

- No. You look like you do.
- That's right.

01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,260
Bye.

890
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:38,960
Gosh. I should've said the opposite.

891
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,400
- Ms. Ok.
- Hey, Deok-jin.

892
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:47,040
Come on. You should at least
say hello to your friend.

893
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,540
From afar, it looked like

894
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,280
you were talking to my Hye-in.

895
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,080
"My Hye-in"?

896
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,520
Gosh. I slipped.

897
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,820
It's a secret.

898
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:06,620
I'm only telling you this
because you're my friend.

899
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,530
I'm dating her.

900
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:11,630
What?

901
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:15,330
She doesn't want people to find out that
we're dating since we're colleagues.

902
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,870
Don't tell anyone.
It's strictly for your ears only.

903
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,540
Okay.

904
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,060
Why did you want to see me?

905
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,890
What? I...

906
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,930
Well,

907
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,400
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

908
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,900
Okay. What is it?

909
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,340
I know this woman in her 30s.

910
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,340
You know,

911
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,710
she keeps telling me that she gets
butterflies for a high school student.

912
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,580
She can't stop thinking about him.

913
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,350
And her heart pounds like crazy.

914
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,480
What a nutcase.

915
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,020
What?

916
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,520
But she's unmarried.

917
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,160
That's not important right now.

918
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,330
She likes a minor.

919
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:16,330
Gosh, that's so disgusting.

920
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:20,870
Did you say, "disgusting"?

921
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:21,970
Yes, it is.

922
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,170
Imagine she liked my son.

923
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,910
<i>Ye Ji-hoon</i>

924
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:35,210
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

925
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,320
Gosh. Come on.

926
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,000
Hi, Mr. Ye.

927
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,460
I read your message.

928
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,700
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

929
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,170
Are you okay?

930
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,870
Can we meet now?

931
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,640
Now?

932
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,090
Hey.

933
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:27,470
Dae-young.

934
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:29,899
Ms. Ok's boyfriend

935
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,370
is Choi Il-kwon.

936
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,040
What? Choi Il-kwon?

937
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:38,210
What am I going to do?

938
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,850
Hey, it's all right.

939
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,920
You never had a chance with her anyway.

940
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,180
What? Hong Dae-young.

941
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,450
How can my own friend say that to me?

942
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:54,660
Hong Dae-young?

943
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,729
I should have been the one
who got younger, not you.

944
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,200
Why do you only get lucky like that?

945
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,430
Darn you.

946
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,100
Do you think this is good for me?

947
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,970
I can't even tell Da-jung who I am.

948
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,180
All I can do is hover around her.

949
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,450
Hong Dae-young.

950
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,050
Can you drink with me tonight?

951
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,590
Woo-young,

952
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:24,890
you're Hong Dae-young?

953
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:36,170
Have I truly gone mad now?

954
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,600
Ae-rin, that's not it.

955
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:39,270
"Ae-rin"?

956
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:44,279
Well, that's not it, Ms. Chu.

957
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,109
Goodness.

958
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,850
I didn't know you two were here.

959
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,990
I'm sorry, Ae-rin. I have to get going.
I have somewhere to be.

960
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,030
What? Hold on.

961
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,700
It sounds like it's urgent.
You should go, Da-jung.

962
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,100
Yes. You should hurry.

963
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,630
I mean, bye.

964
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,970
Okay. See you later.

965
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,510
Wait, Da-jung.

966
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,310
Yes?

967
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,480
I have

968
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,720
something to tell you.

969
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,740
<i>Epilogue</i>

970
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,340
Are you here to buy a present?

971
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:53,380
Yes. Do you also deliver?

972
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:54,710
Of course.

973
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,780
I want this pair in 240mm.

974
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,180
Sure.

975
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,560
<i>I became your fan after seeing
how confident and brave you are.</i>

976
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,260
<i>I hope there are only sunshine
and rainbows in your future.</i>

977
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,890
<i>From your number one fan.</i>

978
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,460
Your number one fan.
I wonder who sent them to you.

979
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,030
I'm so jealous.

980
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,030
<i>There are things you want to give</i>

981
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,340
<i>even if it's impossible.</i>

982
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,510
<i>In hindsight,</i>

983
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,180
<i>they weren't that grand.</i>

984
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,050
Who changed the light?

985
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,970
Who washed the dishes?

986
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,350
Who bought them?

987
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:12,360
<i>They were so small and insignificant.</i>

988
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,430
<i>You considered them to be unimportant.</i>

989
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,300
<i>But these small things make you smile.</i>

990
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,770
<i>I finally realized that.</i>

991
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,820
- You're home.
- Mom.

992
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,350
My gosh, Da-jung.
It was a tough day, wasn't it?

993
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,560
It was you.

994
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,430
Thank you, Mom.

995
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:54,370
<i>It's impossible to share
my sincere feelings as it is too late.</i>

996
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:57,700
<i>But</i>

997
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,040
<i>I'll be okay</i>

998
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,580
<i>as long as it makes you smile.</i>

999
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,940
<i>18 Again</i>

1000
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,270
<i>I think you're
such a fantastic dad to Seo-yeon.</i>

1001
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,010
<i>I'll be your fan starting today.</i>

1002
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:46,880
<i>This was supposed to be for Si-woo,
but you ruined everything.</i>

1003
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,308
<i>And if you don't send me that money,</i>

1004
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:50,350
<i>know that you ruined
his basketball career.</i>

1005
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,780
<i>It's funny</i>

1006
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,790
<i>how you're always with me
whenever I need help.</i>

1007
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:57,290
<i>Go Woo-young is Hong Dae-young.</i>

1008
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,860
<i>Hong Dae-young is Go Woo-young!</i>

1009
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,522
<i>Do you want to hear
an interesting story?</i>

1010
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:03,690
<i>It's about Hong Dae-young.</i>

1011
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,930
<i>Hey, Hong Dae-young.</i>
