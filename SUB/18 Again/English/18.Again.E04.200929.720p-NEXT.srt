00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,580
That's the problem!

183
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,120
What good does it bring to JBC

184
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,350
to have a video like this go viral?

185
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,420
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

186
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,490
At least you know.

187
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Let me say this again.

188
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,170
Make sure that old woman

189
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,110
can't last her probation period
and walks out of here herself.

190
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,510
Yes, sir.

191
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,690
Don't you think the comments
on Da-jung are too malicious?

192
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,790
It's too bad.

193
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,130
She probably thought she'd
become a star from getting soaked,

194
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,530
but she's just getting hate comments.

195
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,700
This is why women must
succeed before they get old.

196
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,730
Once you get old,

197
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,700
people will leave hate
comments on whatever you do.

198
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,970
Ms. Kwon.

199
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,540
Still,

200
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,910
hate comments are
better than no comments.

201
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,880
Da-jung! We were so worried for you.

202
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,380
We feel really bad about
those hate comments.

203
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,120
You must be disheartened.

204
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,220
Disheartened? They all have a point.

205
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,190
Are you really okay?

206
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,760
What did the higher-ups say?

207
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,760
To restock the break room.

208
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,020
<i>JBC is also a victim.</i>

209
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,460
<i>How could they know she was a mother?</i>

210
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,290
<i>She should just stay
home and raise her kids.</i>

211
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,190
<i>Who does she think she
is? I don't like her at all.</i>

212
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,030
<i>Isn't she the best mother ever
if she can do well at her job, </i>

213
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,400
<i>and raise her kids well?</i>

214
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,830
Si-ah?

215
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,370
<i>I feel bad for the kids.</i>

216
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,310
<i>I would hate to have a mom like her.</i>

217
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,640
<i>Who are you to act like a saint?</i>

218
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,110
<i>Just worry about your own life.</i>

219
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,740
<i>It's so shameless of you to come
on TV as if nothing happened.</i>

220
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,280
<i>She took responsibility for it.</i>

221
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,980
<i>I thought that was rather inspiring.</i>

222
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Could this be Si-ah?

223
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,360
<i>Si-ah and Si-woo, are you two okay?</i>

224
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,160
<i>Is everything okay at school?</i>

225
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,981
<i>Mom</i>

226
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,200
Did you see his mom's video?

227
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,300
I'd be so embarrassed if it were my mom.

228
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,740
Did you see the clip?

229
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,810
- It's his mom.
- Someone so lowly doesn't belong here.

230
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,240
If it were me, I'd be too
embarrassed to come to school.

231
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,710
Exactly. Unbelievable.

232
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,620
<i>Si-woo: It's all good.</i>

233
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,519
He's lying.

234
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,060
<i>Si-ah: Everything is fine.</i>

235
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,230
She's lying too.

236
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,810
Hey, Gu Ja-sung.

237
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,750
I heard about it all.

238
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,580
So what?

239
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,050
I'm going to ignore it because it
doesn't even deserve to be heard.

240
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
But

241
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,790
I can't ignore you insulting my mom.

242
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,740
Why you little...

243
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,670
Run that mouth of yours
again if you dare.

244
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
Hey!

245
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,880
And one more thing,

246
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,450
if you lay a finger on Si-woo again,

247
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,060
you and I will get
into some real trouble.

248
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,390
<i>Kid, look at you all grown.
You can even cause trouble.</i>

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,760
Ice yourself with this.

250
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm fine.

251
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,157
Your mother will worry
about you if you go home

252
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,839
with a swollen face like that.

253
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,510
I'll do it.

254
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
<i>Are you okay?</i>

255
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,780
<i>Yes.</i>

256
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,340
<i>Come to the convenience store after.</i>

257
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
<i>All right.</i>

258
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,982
We're having a staff dinner tonight,

259
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,430
so wrap up whatever you're doing now.

260
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,300
Yes, sir.

261
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,040
Mr. Heo, what's the dinner for?

262
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,140
You can skip it if you have a problem.

263
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
Of course not.

264
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,510
If you have something else,
you're allowed to miss it.

265
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,280
But Ms. Jung, you're required to attend,

266
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,520
so don't miss it.

267
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,520
- Sorry?
- What?

268
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,450
Yes, I will attend.

269
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Okay.

270
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,690
Why are you the only one
who's required to attend?

271
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,530
Maybe it's a staff
dinner to console her.

272
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,030
I doubt it.

273
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,100
Sorry.

274
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,170
Throw the water!

275
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,680
Throw the water!

276
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,180
Throw the water!

277
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,020
Throw the water!

278
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,680
I guess this is what
they called her for.

279
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,020
I knew it. They wouldn't console her.

280
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,390
I thought this was an important dinner,

281
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,860
so I skipped my Chinese lesson for this.

282
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,800
Come on. She had a long day today.

283
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,270
Why don't we show her some
support as her colleagues?

284
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,040
Throw the water!

285
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,510
Throw the water!

286
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,850
I will never throw water at
another news anchor ever again!

287
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,590
Goodness.

288
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,020
I can't do it.

289
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,290
Come on.

290
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,830
Ms. Jung!

291
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,560
Can you imagine how bad
he feels right now?

292
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
Just accept the apology
by throwing some water

293
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,100
and be done with it.

294
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,070
Throw the water!

295
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,670
Throw the water!

296
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,710
Could we get it over with already?
I'm so embarrassed.

297
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,010
Throw the water!

298
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,580
- Throw the water!
- All right.

299
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,410
I'll do it now.

300
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,320
One,

301
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,220
two,

302
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,520
three!

303
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,190
Here you go.

304
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,260
Cheers to Seum!

305
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,050
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

306
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,850
Here you go.

307
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,220
Thank you for taking
my difficult request, sir.

308
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,220
It's nothing.

309
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,460
Because of that video,

310
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,960
we get so many complaint calls

311
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,060
at the team's office.

312
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,130
Ms. Jung, thank you for
agreeing to film the video.

313
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,400
- Here.
- It's no problem.

314
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,840
People are scrutinizing her for
being old and being a mother,

315
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,680
so this is a good chance for her
to make a good impression, too.

316
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,120
She's probably thankful that
you came up with this idea.

317
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Aren't you?

318
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,720
Yes, of course.

319
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,190
I'm so happy that I
came hereto apologize,

320
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,020
but I also got a thank you!

321
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,460
If you're so thankful,

322
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,430
get us an exclusive
interview with Ye Ji-hoon.

323
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,200
Of course we will!

324
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,930
Do you think you can do it?

325
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,170
Sure. That sounds good.

326
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,640
Great.

327
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,470
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

328
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,150
Hey, Ms. Kwon?

329
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,720
- Yes, Director?
- Why are you sitting there?

330
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,350
Come and sit here.

331
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,750
Ms. Jung,

332
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,160
if you're done drinking, you can go.

333
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,660
Okay.

334
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Here.

335
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,840
Meet Ms. Kwon Yu-mi,
who got hired at JBC

336
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,210
as the top candidate this season.

337
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,380
Introduce yourself.

338
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,480
Hello, I'm Kwon Yu-mi, and
I'm a new news anchor at JBC.

339
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,810
Gosh, congratulations.

340
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,450
You're quite young.

341
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,550
Can I ask her how old she is?

342
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,750
I'm 24.

343
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,120
I see. No wonder.

344
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,890
She has great skin.

345
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,560
This time, Ms. Kwon here will do

346
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,430
the exclusive interview with Mr. Ye.

347
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,430
I plan to assign her for
his interviews from now on.

348
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,400
I thought it'd be nice to
get to know each other.

349
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,840
I see. That sounds nice.

350
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,070
You guys look nice together too.

351
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,940
Well,

352
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,950
I want Ms. Jung Da-jung
to do my interview.

353
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,490
Ms. Jung doesn't have
a good reputation now.

354
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,130
You won't benefit in any way
from getting mixed up with her.

355
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,830
That doesn't matter.

356
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,030
Instead of being interviewed by a mom,

357
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,670
you would look much better
being interviewed by a young lady.

358
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,840
Gosh, I'm getting old,

359
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,570
so I'm more comfortable around moms.

360
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,180
Please, sir.

361
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,480
My goodness. You're so funny.

362
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,320
Then, let's settle that Ms. Jung
will do his next interview.

363
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,290
- Okay.
- Sure.

364
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,910
I guess it's bothering you a lot.

365
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,550
Kids are bound to stop.

366
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,150
Don't let them get to you.

367
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,020
How is that possible?

368
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,080
They were talking about my mom.

369
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,050
Are you worried about your mom?

370
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,020
If you are,

371
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,520
you should call her.

372
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,230
It'll make me cringe.
What will I say to her?

373
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,430
You know,

374
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,730
tell her you were worried
and ask her if she's okay.

375
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Gosh.

376
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,600
Look at you.

377
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,540
For parents, hearing such words gives
comfort to parents when things are tough.

378
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,310
Gosh. Whatever.

379
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,010
I'm leaving if you don't
want to play basketball.

381
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,500
<i>Mom</i>

382
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,180
Hey, Si-woo.

383
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,110
What's wrong?

384
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,880
Nothing.

385
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,220
Nothing what?
Tell me if you need anything.

386
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,020
That's not what I called.

387
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,120
I was wondering if you were okay.

388
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,290
What?

389
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,100
Did you call because you
were worried about me?

390
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,400
Gosh, it's nothing like that.

391
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,770
Come on. I know that's why you called.

392
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,700
If you know that,

393
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,040
don't make me worry.

394
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,010
Okay.

395
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,080
But a phone call from you
definitely got my spirits up.

396
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,580
When are you coming home?

397
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,250
I'm sorry. I'll be home
late today. Go to bed early.

398
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,390
<i>Okay.</i>

399
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,060
Come home safely.

400
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,790
Okay. Thank you.

401
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,700
Your son has a big heart.

402
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,730
My gosh. Did you hear that?

403
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,600
I'm sorry.

404
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,040
You know, I have good hearing.

405
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,310
You don't have to apologize.
You're embarrassing me.

406
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,940
You started it.

407
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,150
By the way, do you really
want me to interview you?

408
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,250
Then do you think I lied that I
was getting old for no reason?

409
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,920
Obviously, I'm still young.

410
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,750
Thank you.

411
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,620
You called yourself old to
help a middle-aged woman.

412
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,190
If you're thanking me, I'll take that.

413
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,630
But

414
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,160
is that all?

415
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,230
But that will be the end.

416
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,570
I am grateful, but I
can take care of myself.

417
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,610
I can take care of myself.

418
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,910
So don't do that next time.

419
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
Come here.

420
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,200
Hey, are you crying again?

421
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,840
I went to the zoo yesterday
with my dad and saw elephants.

422
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,880
But you didn't see them.

423
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,140
You don't have a dad
who will take you to the zoo.

424
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,010
♫ You don't have a dad ♫

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,090
Si-ah, who are you to stop us?

428
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
Are you his mom?

429
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,530
Or are you his girlfriend?

430
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,070
I told you I wouldn't let it
slide if you picked on him again.

431
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,470
Let's go.

432
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,910
He doesn't have a dad,
so that's what I said.

433
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,710
Why did you hit me, you brat?

434
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,680
Are you serious? You're dead meat.

435
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,420
You little...

436
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,250
Let go of me. Stop it!

437
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,930
Are you happy?

438
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,230
You got punched in the face.

439
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,430
Gosh.

440
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,940
I suddenly remembered
when we were little.

441
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,340
You used to beat kids up
because you wanted to help me.

442
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,310
I didn't beat up anyone.

443
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,010
Do you not really remember anything?

444
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,080
You were so scary.

445
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780

Isn't it hard?

453
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,980
Not at all.

Get in.

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,980
What is this?

519
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,250
- You said you wanted to drink more.
- I would love to,

520
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,590
but your wife keeps
calling. Should I pick up?

521
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,290
No, don't.

522
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,760
That's too bad.

523
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,330
Then drink this and
sober up as you go home.

524
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,659
Oh, my.

525
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,730
You're so sensible.

I love you!

00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,389
You were drinking
quite a lot. Are you okay?

531
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,360
Why wouldn't I be?

532
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,830
I don't think you are.

533
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,530

when you wore it out on purpose?

537
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,910

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,910
Pardon? I'm cute?

539
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,350
Not you,

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,880
the character behind you.

I like that character too.

543
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,890
I guess everyone likes it.

544
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,830
Yes.

545
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,860
It's

546
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,770
my favorite character.

547
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,880
Can you give me your number?

548
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Pardon?

549
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,610
I always get the questions
before an interview.

550
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,950

Aren't you Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung?

567
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,490
Oh, right.

568
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,830
You must've had a drink.

569
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,230
We're going for a second round too.
You should join us.

570
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,860
It'll be our treat.

571
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,730

572
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,270
Why are you acting so stuck-up?

573
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,900
We said we'd treat you.

574
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,870
What are you doing?

575
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,510
Did you hit me?

576
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,010
You seem very drunk. You should go home.

577
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,520
What? Are you looking down on me?

578
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,820
I said are you looking down on me?

579
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,760
If you keep doing this,

580
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,290
I won't stand still.

581
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,660
You seem to have

582
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,671
a bit of a temper.

583
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,000
I warned you.

584
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,970
Warn? Okay.

585
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,670
Do what you want.

586
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,240
You should stop.

587
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,680
Who are you?

588
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,780
You should stop.

589
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,220
Who are you?

590
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,950
What a rude punk.

591
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,620
How dare you butt in?

592
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,520
Don't cause a scene and go your way.

593
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,530
You're a funny kid. You little...

594
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,300
Woo-young. Stop.

595
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,870
Hey. Did you see him hit me?

596
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,470
Call the police.

597
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Okay.

598
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,940
Go ahead.

599
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,250
I'll sue you for sexual harassment too.

600
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,650
Do you see that security camera?

601
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,090
I hear security cameras
these days even record sound.

602
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,824
Can a public figure be like this?

603
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,260
It'll be even better.

604
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,230
Since I'm a public
figure, it'll be on the news.

605
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,700
Then your faces will appear on the news.

606
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,600
Will you be able to face your family?

607
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,470
Go ahead.

608
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,210
Let's just go.

609
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,010
Gosh.

610
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:42,810
I'm going easy on you.

611
00:39:42,895 --> 00:39:44,210
What are you talking about?

612
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,390
Are you okay?

613
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,390
Yes, I'm fine.

614
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,900
I told you I could go alone.

615
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,140
Those guys could show up again.

616
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,650
What are you doing here at this hour?

617
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,250
I came to meet someone.

618
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,380
So did you meet them?

619
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,420
Yes, I did.

620
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Is that so?

621
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,660
But still, don't stay out too late.

622
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,830
What? Didn't you see earlier?

623
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,800
There are a lot of
strange people out at night.

624
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,030
Gosh. Didn't you see me

625
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,200
chase those strange men away earlier?

626
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,470
We're here.

627
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,310
Woo-young. Wait a
minute. I'll get you a taxi.

628
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,980
It's fine. I'm not a kid.

629
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,950
If you're not a kid,

630
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,580
then I'm not a middle-aged woman.

631
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,820
That's not it.

632
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,720
I can call a taxi on my own.

633
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,990
You should go in.

634
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,590
Okay. Get home safely.

635
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,930
Be strong.

636
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
What?

637
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,010
It was hard to achieve your dream.

638
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,810
So you shouldn't get
hindered by things like this.

639
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,510
Don't worry about Si-ah and Si-woo,

640
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,280
and focus on your work.

641
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,550
I'll take care of the kids at school.

642
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,090
You sound like an old man.

643
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,460
Thanks, Woo-young.

644
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Don't mind

645
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,570
the hate comments.

646
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,400
People who are saying that you messed up
because you got pregnant in school

647
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,340
are just saying that because
it's not their business.

648
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,180
I think you're amazing

649
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,380
for being responsible.

650
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,650
It's

651
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,490
really nothing amazing.

652
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,660
It's what I have to do.

653
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,200
It's sad that people think
that my kids are my mistakes.

654
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,470
I think they're my blessings.

655
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,070
I must be drunk.

656
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,340
I can't believe I'm
saying this to a kid.

657
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,970
Go home now, Woo-young.

658
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,510
I actually...

659
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,080
What?

660
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,990
I...

661
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,620

00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,660
I...

663
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,130
You feel bad now because you
brought up the hate comments, right?

664
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,870
I appreciate that
you're concerned for me.

665
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,280
You don't have to feel bad, okay?

666
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,180

694
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,260
You're once again

695
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,270
setting a record number
of wins this season.

696
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:44,200
What's the secret to
your consistent success?

697
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,370
I don't think there are any secrets...

I don't let things hurt,

700
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,390
or shake me up.

701
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,160
I think that's the secret
to continue doing well.

703

I'll move onto the next question.

704
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,070
Hi. Oh, right, Ji-ho?

705
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,240
- Yes?
- Who's on weekly class duties?

706
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,010
It's Si-ah and Bo-bae.

707
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,770
Si-ah and Bo-bae? I see.

708
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,880
Tell them to draw the
dodge ball court lines nicely.

709
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,240
Yes, sir.

710
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,060
Are you zoning out?

711
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,070
Goodness.

712
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,050
All right, huddle up. Let's start class.

713
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,120
Let's go.

714
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,160

- Si-ah!

716
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,740

718
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,210
- Hong Si-ah!
- What's wrong?

719
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,770
- Where's my phone?
- Si-ah! Wake up.

720
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,980
I'm going to call 911.

721
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,210
What do you think you're doing?

722
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,720
It's faster to run to the
hospital right by the school!

723
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,550
You guys go ahead and play dodge ball.

724

Ji-ho, stay here.

725
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,600
Thank you so much for making
time for the interview today.

726
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,670
That concludes today's
"Baseball Hot Star Hot Interview".

727
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,740
Cut!

728
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,510
- Good work.
- Good job.

729
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:02,880
That was amazing!

730
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,080
Watch this.

731
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,380
Did you see?

732
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,450
- That's amazing.
- Oh my gosh.

733
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,050
- He just caught it like that.
- He's so cool.

734
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,650
- It's incredible.
- How did he do that?

735
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,820
Are you leaving now?

736
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,990
Yes.

737
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,490
Are you really okay?

738
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,060
I'm fine.

739
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,060
This is nothing.

740
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,500
That's good to hear. I thought...

741
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,700
Excuse me.

742
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,340
Il-Kwon, what's up?

743
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,510
What? Si-ah is at the hospital?

744
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,880
Okay. I'll head there now.

745
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,810
Is something wrong?

746
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,420
My daughter is ill.

747
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,180
- I have to get going.
- Wait...

748
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,890
She usually never gets nervous,

749
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,560
but she seems nervous now. I'm worried.

750
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,860
It's a stomach spasm caused by stress.

751
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,800
You don't have to be worried.

752
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,100
It'll be fine as long as she de-stresses
and gets some good rest.

753
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,510
She can leave after the IV drip is done.

754
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,170
Okay. Thank you.

755
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,310
Thank you.

756
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,550
Woo-young, I'm just
going to go and make a call.

757
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:17,720
Okay. Go ahead.

758
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,270
It hurts!

759
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,440
It hurts!

760
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,280
Goodness.

761
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,250

763
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,600
Si-ah, Daddy is sorry.

764
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,500
It'll be over soon.

765
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,940
Just hold on, Si-ah.

766
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,940
Si-ah!

767
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,880
I'm sorry.

768
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,950
I'm so sorry. Just hold on a little bit.

769
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,360
I'm sorry.

770
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,420
I'm sorry, Si-ah.

771
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,270
Kid, you grew so much.

772
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,700
You're too young to be so stressed.

773
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,650
- What are you doing?
- You're awake!

774
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,750
I asked what you were doing.

775
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,220
Why are you here, caressing my hair?

776
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,560
Because I carried you all
the way hereon my back.

777
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,600
Don't you remember?

778
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,940
Then you should've
left after dropping me off.

779
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,370
How dare you touch me?
Do you have a death wish?

780
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,450
You better be like this
to every other guy.

781
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,620
Understood?

782
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,820
Whatever.

783
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,790
Gosh.

784
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,230
- Deok-jin.
- Yes?

785
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,730
What's the age limit
for your daughter-in-law?

786
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,040
My daughter-in-law?
She just can't be my age.

787
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,080
Hey, son.

788
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,350
Is that so? Until when must
Si-ah stay at the hospital?

789
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,990
Si-ah is at the hospital? Why?

790
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,230
She had a stomach spasm.

791
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,960
Okay. Then you take good care of...

792

793
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,900
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Wait.

794
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,170
Is that Ms. Ok?

795
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,600
Do you want to rest a bit more?

796
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,540
Yes. She's here.

797
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,510
Wait there. I'm on my way.

798
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,650
Is this the flower shop?

799
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,080
Woo-young is at the hospital?

800

Deok-jin, wait up!

801
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,620
You don't look too good.

802
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,260
Does it still hurt?

803
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,430
No. I'm all right now.

to a nice meal next time.</i>

807

Hello.

808
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,880
- Why are you here?
- I can ask you the same thing.

809
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,090
Are you looking for Si-ah?

810
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,990
Are you insane?

811
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,330

814
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,030
Si-ah, how did this happen?

815
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,930
You poor thing.
It must have hurt so much.

816
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:08,270
By the way, where's Ms. Ok?
She should witness my warmhearted-ness.

817
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,010
That explains your behavior.

818
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,510
Gosh.

819
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,980
Goodness.

820
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,750
You're an adult. Act like one.

821
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,020
Si-ah, did it hurt a lot?

822
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,720
Are you all right now?

823
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,730
Yes, I'm okay.

824
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,090
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

825
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,660
I heard you were very helpful,
Woo-young.

826

I heard everything.

You practically flew
with heron your back.

828
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,500
You might not have guessed it, but
she has thick bones. Is your back okay?

829
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,100
Yes.

830
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,140
You should drink this.

831
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,410
It must have been hard bringing her
here. You need to regain your energy.

832
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,110
By the way, you did
come here to see me, right?

833
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,750
Of course.

834
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,420
- You should drink one too.
- No!

835
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,790
She has a stomach spasm,
so she can't have juice yet.

836
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,620
Gosh. Then, I'll drink it.

837
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,230
Why did you bring flowers?

838
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,130
Nice. They look beautiful.

839
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,470
Don't touch them.

840
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,600
They are for Ms. Ok.
I don't need your bad luck.

841
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,010
Aren't they for Si-ah?

842
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:17,980
Si-ah.

843
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,280
Don't covet these flowers.

845
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,320
- Be good.
- Si-ah. Are you okay?

846
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,620
Gosh, I'm okay.

847
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,460
Did you leave work because of me?

848
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,460
I finished my interview.

849
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,370
You must have been in pain earlier.
Why didn't you tell me?

850
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,340
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

851
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:44,570
And you're working too.

852
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,940
Is that important?

853
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,010
If you were sick,
you should have told me.

854
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,210
You're upsetting me.

855
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,480
I'm really okay.

856
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,110
I can get discharged
once the drip is done.

857
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,410
But still. You'd better not keep
things from me again for my sake.

858
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,320
Gosh. Okay.

859
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:01,990
By the way,

860
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,560
how did you all get here?

861
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Well,

862
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,160
I had to come and check on
her when I heard she was sick.

863
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,030
Are you okay? All right.

864
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,058
Woo-young, you can
leave now. My mom is here.

865
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,870
He can't leave.

866
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,940
You know what I mean?

867
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,680
He carried her on his back
all the way to the ER here

868
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,950
and stayed with her.

869
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,250
You can't tell him to leave like this.

870
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,450
Really?

871
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,620

"I see. A stomach spasm"?

903
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:14,950
Aren't you worried?

904
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,920
No, a lot of my colleagues
had stomach spasms.

905
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,250
I know a thing or two about it.

906
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,790
Once she stops getting stressed

907
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,250
and is well-rested, it
will go away. Don't worry.

908
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,720
Hey, Dae-young. Your daughter is sick.

909
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,030
Instead of asking me where she
is and telling me you'd be here,

910
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,330
<i>you're telling me she'll be
okay with rest and not to worry?</i>

911
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:31,900
How can you call yourself her dad?

912
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,570
Da-jung, you don't know everything.

913
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,040
No, that's not true. I know too well.

914
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,470
<i>Whenever we had problems,
you said you were busy and tired.</i>

915
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,110
<i>Giving me excuses and
avoiding them were your specialty.</i>

916
00:59:42,181 --> 00:59:43,140
You were

917
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,280
never here for us when we needed you.

918
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,580
Is that what you think of me?

919
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,020
Don't worry. From now on,

920
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,620
we won't need you.

921
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,310
I wasn't there when they needed me?

922
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,280
Let's see if you can

923
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,910
still say that after
finding out who I am.

924
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,890
When did you get here?

925
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,930
If you're upset, just cry.

926
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,560
If you bottle it up, it will snowball.

927
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,300
I'm all right.

928
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,900
I mean it. I'm fine.

929
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,000
Gosh.

930
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,240
Goodness. You always act tough.

931
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,880
Thank you for covering for me.

932
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,690
What made you so stressed out

933
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:03,420
that it made you pass out?

934
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,490
It's nothing.

935
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,190
I'm not stressed.

936
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,500
Si-ah.

937
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,100
Whenever you had problems,

938
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,500
you always handled them by yourself.

939
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,710
Did that upset you?

940
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,340
Yes.

941
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,250
I can't solve your problems.

942
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,620
But I can listen to them.

943
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,820
So tell me if you have any problems.

944
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:47,470
You're right.
That's the right thing to do.

945
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
What?

946
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:50,770
I'm talking about my mom.

947
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,300
She keeps pretending to be okay.

948
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,670
I thought she finally caught a break

949
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,440
and living a happy life
with her dream job.

950
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,810
But the fact that she's married

951
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,580
and that she has kids is
holding her back again.

952
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,990
I know that she must
be having a hard time,

953
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:12,320
but she doesn't show it.

954
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:18,600
This is my point.

955
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,200
She made a fatal mistake
of marrying my dad.

956
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,770
But why do you only hate your dad?

957
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,940
Isn't it obvious?

958
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,780
He's not even here on a day like this.

959
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,480
My dad

960
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,920
was never there when we needed him.

961
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,370
But are you sure you're okay?

962
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,700
No.

963
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,610
You should have told me
sooner. Let's go back down.

964
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,440
- Let's get the test again.
- It's not about my health.

965
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:10,680
It's about my parents' divorce.

966
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,220
Whenever my parents fought,

967
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,660
I kind of blamed myself for being born.

968
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,730
When I see them getting
a divorce in the end,

969
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,860
it really feels like this is my fault

970
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,770
and I feel bad.

971
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,570
It's tough on me,

972
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,300
but to be honest,

973
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,310
I don't want them to
get divorced for my sake.

974
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,920
Si-ah is sick.

975
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,560
But hearing how he didn't
sound concerned made me mad.

976
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,760
On top of that, he lied to me.

977
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:00,160
He lied?

978
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,770
Dae-young quit his job.

979
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,910
But this fool

980
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,810
doesn't even know this came to the
house. He keeps saying he's in Busan.

981
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,450
He said he was on a business trip.

982
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
Dae-young lied to you?

983
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:21,120
But he never lied to you.

984
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,560
He didn't. But he changed too.

985
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,490
Divorce. Resignation.

986
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,030
He's been lying to me about everything

987
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,670
like his situation and his feelings.

988
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,230
I

989
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,010
really can't trust him anymore.

990
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:50,410
<i>You were never here for
us when we needed you.</i>

991
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,020
<i>My dad was never there
when we needed him.</i>

992
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,290
<i>You know when the final day is, right?</i>

993
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:05,930
<i>Even if you don't show up,
the divorce will go through.</i>

994
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,270
<i>Let's end this on a good note.</i>

995
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,210

No.

999

Then, I will proceed with my ruling.

<i>Epilogue</i>
How dare you punks get into a fight?

1004
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,910
Why did you fight?

1005
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,840
This jerk hit me

1006
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,880
- out of nowhere.
- Out of nowhere?

1007
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,650
Why did you hit him?

1008
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,680
He told me not to put up with it.

1009
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:43,420
What? Not to put up with it?

1010
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,420
Who said that?

1011
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,460
Who?

1012
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,060
I told you not to bully Ji-ho.

1013
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,430
- Stop it! Let go!
- I told you not to pick on him,

1014
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,430
so don't do it!

1015
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,700
You punks.

1016
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,820
Gosh. There's a baby elephant.

1017
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,690
That's so cute.

1018
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,560
It's so cute.

1019
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,200
If there's a place you want to go to,

1020
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,800
you can tell me. Okay?

1021
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,270
Ji-ho.

1022
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,370
Come quickly. The elephants are so big!

1023
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,910
Are you still sad?

1024
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:39,380
Those little rats.

1025
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,550
I won't let them do that again.

1026
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:44,350
I heard violence is a bad thing.

1027
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,380
What? Gosh.

1028
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,790
My dad told me that I
shouldn't put up with it.

1029
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:50,689
Right?

1030
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,490
Of course. Ji-ho.

1031
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,859
Violence isn't the right way.

1032
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:58,100
But there are times you
shouldn't put up with bullying.

1033
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,660
When are those times?

1034

When you need to protect
something dear to your heart.
