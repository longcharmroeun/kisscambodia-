You said you regretted it.

7
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:19,243
You regretted meeting me
and ruining your life.

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,813
I let you go, so you
can live a good life.

9
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:26,113
I didn't ask you to stay.

10
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:29,552
But...

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,083
But

12
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,223
why are you here again?

13
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,893
Whenever you stayed by my side,

14
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,403
do you know what went through my head?

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,873
"I miss you."

16
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,443
"I miss you, Hong Dae-young."

17
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:09,493
I missed you too.

18

You look just like when you were young.

19

How did I miss it?

20
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,203
Come to think of it,

21
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:34,143
so many things didn't make sense.

22
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:38,113
I must be a fool.

23
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:40,583
No.

24
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,113
I was wrong.

25
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,553
I should've told you the truth.

26
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:51,923

<i>Episode 14, Confession</i>

28
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:16,053
What?

29
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,453
You thought I was having an affair?

30
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,093
It's because

31
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:24,623
I didn't know why you wanted a divorce.

32
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:30,063
Is that why you were so mean to me
in the beginning?

33
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:32,963
Yes.

34
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:34,603
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:37,573
It's okay.

36
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:39,873
It was just a misunderstanding.

37
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:41,673
Now I know

38
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:44,283
that even if you're a married couple,

39
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,343
you can't know
what the other is thinking

40
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,413
if they don't say anything.

41

Thank you for understanding.

42
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:54,353
Oh, right.

43
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:56,993
There's one more thing.

44
00:03:57,563 --> 00:04:00,163
I'm telling you so that
there won't be any misunderstandings.

45
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:03,563
There's nothing going on
between me and Mr. Ye Ji-hoon.

46
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,763
At that time, I—

00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,703
You must've had a really hard time.

48
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,773
You had to lie because of me.

49
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:12,273
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,073
It's okay.

51
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,113

Oh, the bus is here.

00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,763
- I'll get going now.
- Right.

55
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:34,433
Get home safe.

56
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,193
What?

57
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,423
Why did you get on?

58

Let's not

59

go home today.

00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,163
What?

61
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,453
-1, 2.
- I said it was dangerous.

62
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:37,793
My goodness.

63
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:12,923
Oh, Mom.

What? Yes.

66
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:20,033
I had plans, and I came home a bit late.

67
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:21,973
You weren't a bit late.

68
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,933
Right.

69
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,843
It's okay.

70
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,513
You need to release your stress too.

What?

72
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,313
Wait a bit. I'll make you breakfast.

73
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:38,383
No, it's okay. You must be tired.
Get some rest.

74
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:40,982
It's fine. Just wait a bit.

75
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,573
Back in the days, I would be fine
after playing all night long.

76
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,803
But it's not easy now that I'm older.

77
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,543
Hey. What is it?

78
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:09,253
Nothing. I just wanted
to hear your voice.

79
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:10,353
What?

80
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,123
We just said goodbye.

81
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,863
Who is she on the phone
with at this hour?

82
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,903
Hong Si-ah.

83
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,243
- Are you going to class?
- Yes.

84

Let's go together.

85

What if someone sees us?

86
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,883
I told you to keep it
a secret in school.

87
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:42,613
I don't care if we get caught.

88
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:44,823
Do you care?

89
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,893
No. It's not like that.

90
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,333
What is it?

91
00:07:58,163 --> 00:07:59,233
What's wrong?

92
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,503
Si-ah. You came to school early today.

93
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:06,673
What is it?
Why are you picking a fight with me?

94
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:08,913
I'm complimenting you.

95
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:12,613
You're not late for school these days,
and you're very diligent.

100

101
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:34,473
My goodness.

102
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,313
What am I thinking right now?

103
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,123
Please take a look
at these lucky bracelets.

104
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:02,563
Take a look at them.

105
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,733
This is pretty.

106
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:10,873
Can I pay with a card?

107
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,403
We only accept cash here.

108
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,413
Is that so?

109
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:18,613
- I'll come back another time.
- Okay.

110
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,583
Oh, aren't you the baseball player,
Ye Ji-hoon?

111
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:29,393
I'm a fan. Can you give me
your autograph?

112
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:31,293
Sure.

113
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:35,433
In return, can you do me a favor?

114
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,863
Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

115
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,273
What? Hello.

116
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,843
I'm a fan. Here.

117

118
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,553
It's a present. Goodbye.

119

Hey.

120
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,223
I was going to give it to Si-ah.

121
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,463
I guess I should wear it.

122
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:24,983
Do you remember the car accident

123
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,383
that occurred on Christmas Day?

124
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,423
Why did you do that?

125
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,093
I'm sorry.

I just finished practice,
and I'm on my way home.

137
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,533
You had practice today? Were you
okay after staying up all night?

00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:26,303
Of course. I'm fine.

Yes.

Why did the two of you call us here?

Right. You said
you had something urgent to tell us.

That's why I tried to hold it in.

But

158
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,443
I can't hold it in any longer.

159
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:33,103
Hold what in?

160
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,383
I'm sure now.

- What?
- What?

165
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,393
Woo-young is turning legal soon.

166

00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:04,773
Well,

170
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:08,113
I can't really say anything.

171
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:13,113
I can't hold it in anymore.

172
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:16,013
Da-jung, he's actually Hong Dae-young.

173
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,853
You really can't do this!

174
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:19,683
What are you saying?

175
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,593
Deok-jin, I'll take it that you're
approving of this.

176
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:26,293
Woo-young and I are
official from now on,

177
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:28,293
so Ae-rin, keep that in mind.

178
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,233
We'll get going first.

179
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,633
Hey!

180
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,533
How come all of Mr. Go's friends

181
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,543
are so weird?

182
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,473
Maybe I should quit.

183
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,613
Da-jung! No.

184
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:45,743
What...

185
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:54,993
<i>I'm not entirely happy
that you all lied to me,</i>

186
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,853
<i>but still, thanks for helping Dae-young
all along.</i>

187
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,023
What is she saying?

188
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:00,663
What?

189
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:04,733
Did they fool us just now?

190
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,173
My gosh.

191
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,843
We have some really great friends.

192
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:20,143
Yes, we do.

193
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:25,053
That's...

194
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:28,893
Yes, it's the necklace that you gave me.

195
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:34,693
It's beautiful.

196
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,163
Where are we going now?

197
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,663
Hold on.

198
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:41,633
Here.

199
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,303
What's with the car?

200
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:48,043
I borrowed it from Deok-jin.

201
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,173
I wanted to go somewhere nice.
It's our first date in a long while.

202
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:53,113
No! You're still a minor.

203
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,313
Come on.

204
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:57,783
You know that I'm a great driver.

205
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,453
Still, no.

206
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,353
If we get into an accident,
you'll get caught without a license.

207
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:04,963
Is that right?

208
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,663
What should we do then?

209
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,593
I've already planned the date out.

210
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,733
Then leave the driving to me today.

211
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,333
I've driven without getting
into an accident for ten years.

212
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,313
Don't you think you're going
a little too fast?

213
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:32,383
What's wrong?
I'm still under the speed limit.

214
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:34,723
Do you

215
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:36,653
not trust me?

216
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,323
Of course I do.

217
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,363
I've just never seen you drive.

218
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:42,993
I drove quite a bit when I was
stationed in other cities for the news.

219
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,333
Is that right?

220
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:48,103
Why?

221
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:53,173
Nothing. It's just really cool
to see you drive.

222
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:54,743
It feels new.

223
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:56,573
Says you.

224
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:01,613
This is fun. I haven't
driven in a while.

225
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,053
I can't believe that I'm driving
a sports car.

226
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:09,823
Da-jung, I think you should slow down.

227
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:11,353
Da-jung!

228
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:13,363
Da-jung!

229
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,903
This place is beautiful.

230
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,333
How did you find out about this place?

231
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:23,633
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

232
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,543
It's beautiful,

233
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:28,443
and the air is fresh.

234
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,143
I love it.

235
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:33,713
That's good. I searched online
all night to find the place.

236
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,413
- Really?
- Yes.

237
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,863
- What?
- Get excited.

238
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:48,163
We have a full-on date today.

239
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,403
Stand over there.

240
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:07,043
One, two, three.

241
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:12,983
You look beautiful.

242
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:14,922
Look at that!

243
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:16,652
It's so pretty.

244
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:19,922
Would I look good here?

245
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:22,633
Here I go.

246
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,432
One, two, three.

247
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,133
Da-jung, stand over there.

248
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,973
Give it to me. I'll take one of you now.

249
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:35,273
I'm fine.

250
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,513
Come on. We've come so far.

251
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,643
We need a photo of you.

252
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:42,713
Let's take one together then.

253
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:44,513
Together?

254
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,323
Here we go.

255
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,523
One, two, three.

256
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:11,043
It's been a while since we did this.
It's so much fun.

257
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,343
We took photos on our first date too.

258
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:17,013
We had a great time
at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, remember?

259
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,083
You remember that?

260
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:20,383
Absolutely.

261
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,293
It was my first date with my first love.

262
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,493
How can I forget that?

263
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:29,263
I heard that I'm not
your first love though.

264
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:33,903
What? Who said that?

265
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,133
I heard Si-ah say that at school.

266
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:40,943
I see.

267
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:46,813
How did I think that I was
your first love all along?

268
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,213
Who on earth is it?

269
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,223
Come on. It's all in the past now.

270
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:57,293
First love doesn't mean anything.

271
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:58,793
It means everything to me!

272
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,623
Look at you.

273
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,533
Why can't you say anything?

274
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:04,563
Is it

275
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,633
someone I know?

276
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:08,403
What are you doing?

277
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:11,303
Are you being jealous right now?

278
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:12,743
Of course I am!

279
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,003
What?

280
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:17,673
All right.

281
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,843
My first love is...

282
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,023
Look! The sun is setting.

283
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,533
That's too bad,
I want some more time here.

284
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,263
Why aren't you saying anything?

285
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,333
Tell me!

286
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,933
Who is it?

287
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,633
<i>If you're watching with your engine off,
turn it on every half an hour.</i>

288
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:56,413
Here.

289
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:07,263
Why are you smiling?

290
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:09,633
Nothing.

291
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,663
Coming to a movie theater

292
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,433
just reminded me of the time
you got mad at me.

293
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:15,733
At you?

294
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:17,703
Why?

295
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,043
You got really mad at me

296
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:24,613
because I watched a movie
with Choi Il-kwon.

297
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,783
To make you stop being mad, I...

298
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:34,123
You what?

299
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,023
What?

300
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:37,823
What did you say?

301
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,463
Well...

302
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:42,993
I...

303
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:44,133
"I love you."

304
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,733
- What?
- That's what you said.

305
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:52,503
Right.

306
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,583
What?

307
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:01,683
Nothing.

308
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:12,663
<i>You're acting like
it's your first relationship.</i>

309
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:14,263
<i>I've had enough.</i>

310
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:19,403
<i>The more time goes by,
the more confused I get.</i>

311
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,603
<i>Now, I can tell what someone is like</i>

312
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:24,703
<i>just after exchanging a few words.</i>

313
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,343
<i>I understand why people say</i>

314
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,843
<i>that you should date and get married
while you're still naive.</i>

315
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,713
<i>You've never sincerely loved someone,
have you?</i>

316
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:35,713
<i>I just don't fantasize about love.</i>

317
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,783
<i>The old sayings are right.</i>

318
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,523
<i>The more men you date, the better.</i>

319
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,853
<i>All men are the same.</i>

320
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:10,453
This is Si-ah's favorite. Try some.

321
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:11,613
Is that right?

322
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,263
It's good.

323
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:20,863
Is it?

324
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:22,063
Yes.

325
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,003
How long has it been since we last had
a date like this?

326
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:36,013
I don't know.

327
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:39,783
It's been so long,
I don't even remember.

328
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:45,013
I guess we've been
so busy with our lives.

329
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,083
I guess so.

330
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:49,823
But it's not all bad.

331
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:53,063
Since we haven't done a lot of things,
it's easier to get excited for them.

332
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:58,903
Then, let's do all the things
we didn't get to do when we were young.

333
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:00,233
Sure.

334
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:14,913
Isn't that Jung Da-jung?

335
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,783
Yes, I think it is her.

336
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:20,483
- Who is that guy next to her?
- Right?

337
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:29,393
Aren't you

338
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,063
Ms. Jung Da-jung, the anchorwoman?

339
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,033
Yes.

340
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,673
I'm a fan.

341
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:42,003
I heard you had a son in high school.

342
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:46,143
My gosh. You and your son
must be very close.

343
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:50,313
- I see. It's her son.
- No wonder.

344
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:52,823
Yes.

345
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:54,723
Thank you.

346
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,653
Okay. Enjoy your sandwich.

347
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:24,083
You must be tired.

348
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:25,583
Not at all.

349
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,583
I had a lot of fun today.

350
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:40,233
What if someone sees us?

351
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,573
- I'm sorry.
- I'll go inside.

352
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,703
Okay.

353
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,043
I really hate him.

354
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,383
<i>He likes you. And</i>

355
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:08,323
you like him too.

356
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,163
What are you two doing?

357
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:16,863
Yes.

358
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,303
I'm dating Ji-ho.

359
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:21,363
What?

360
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:28,643
Can you keep this a secret
to other people?

361
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:29,813
Okay?

362
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:34,583
So you two are really dating?

363
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:35,883
Yes.

364
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:38,353
You're the only one who knows.

365
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:40,123
We're friends.

366
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:45,963
Okay. I'm your friend. Right.

367
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:47,993
You'll keep our secret, right?

368
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,633
Then, we'll get going.

369
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:13,753
Hello?

370
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:15,653
<i>I'm calling from Serim High School.</i>

371
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:18,923
<i>Is this Mr. Hong Dae-young,
Hong Si-ah's father?</i>

372
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,723
Yes. This is he.

373
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,463
What is this about?

374
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:25,733
Hello?

375
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,103
Go ahead.

376
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:32,103
What was that?

377
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:40,183
This is Woo-young's phone number.

378
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,013
Gosh.

379
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:19,183
I know

380
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:22,653
you explained this to me,
but this is hard to believe.

381
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,893
Even you found out, Ji-ho.

382
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:32,603
I'm sorry about this.

383
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,303
Don't say that.

384
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,003
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,773
I had no idea who you were
and was rude to you.

386
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,873
No. You were never rude to me.

387
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:47,513
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:50,453
No. Gosh. Sit down.

389
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:58,993
But Ji-ho,

390
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,393
how did you figure it out?

391
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,493
Well,

392
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:07,563
I have a video of the sports day
at my elementary school.

393
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,833
I remembered the video and watched it.

394
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,003
And your face...

395
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:13,273
I see.

396
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:17,413
I still wasn't sure then,

397
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,813
but I saw you two hugging each other.

398
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,353
I was able to stop Si-ah
from seeing that.

399
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,683
But she almost caught you.

400
00:29:32,193 --> 00:29:33,393
But Ji-ho,

401
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:37,833
that means you were on a date
with my daughter until now.

402
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:40,563
Well,

403
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:44,173
today was our first date.

404
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,673
Is that so?

405
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:50,773
Tell me if you need more allowance.

406
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:54,683
I'll give you some money
for keeping my secret.

407
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:57,713
Thank you.

408
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:04,453
Gosh.

409
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:06,893
Mr. Hong.

410
00:30:06,963 --> 00:30:08,363
Yes? What is it?

411
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:14,003
Coming back to your old self

412
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,173
will be hard, right?

413
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,553
- Wasn't that really delicious?
- You were eating a lot.

414
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:33,623
Si-ah.

415
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:35,823
Let's walk around your house
one more time.

416
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:39,023
- Why?
- I don't want to say goodbye yet.

417
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,093
Okay.

418
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:45,693
It was so good.

419
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,703
Dad, aren't you tired?
I'll give you a massage at home.

420
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:51,333
Thanks, my princess.

421
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,303
When I get home...

422
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,343
- What is it?
- Okay?

423
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,773
They seem happy together.

424
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:59,483
I was always mean to my dad.

425
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:06,283
When he called, I didn't answer it
because it was a hassle.

426
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:08,353
Whenever we were together, I was grumpy.

427
00:31:09,193 --> 00:31:11,093
When he bought me a meal the other day,

428
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:13,923
I invited my friends
because I didn't want him to nag me.

429
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:18,663
Had I known it would be this hard
to see my dad again,

430
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,303
I would have been nicer to him.

431

00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:13,353
Hey, what is it?

435
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:18,793
What? The police station?

436
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:23,793
Are you sure this is it?
Don't you have more?

437
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:25,133
No. That's it.

438
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,863
You should come clean now.

439
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:30,833
I told you I don't have it.

Ae-rin! I'm being wrongfully accused.

00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:48,083
Malicious comments?

446
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,253
I didn't write them for that purpose.

447
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:52,453
They feel guilty which is why
they're overreacting.

448
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,363
Please help me.

449
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,393
Can I see the complaint and evidence?

450
00:32:58,463 --> 00:32:59,463
Okay.

- She wrote this much?

454
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:12,313
They looked up her nickname

455
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,943

460
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,473
This?

461
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,273
You were always really mean to Da-jung
ever since we were young.

462
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,143
What's your problem with her?

463
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:47,883
Gosh. I've always hated Jung Da-jung.

464
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,913
Also, before Jung Da-jung appeared,

465
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:52,723
you and I were best friends.

466
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:55,993
If it wasn't for her, you and
I wouldn't have gotten so distant.

467
00:33:57,523 --> 00:33:59,993
When I saw she was having a hard time
in life,

468
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:03,393
I thought she was getting punished,
so I tried to forgive her.

469
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:05,863
But she became an anchorwoman
and appeared on TV

470
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,403
and acted like she was
so nice and smart.

471
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,502
I couldn't hold it in when I saw her
acting so fake.

472
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:12,103
I wanted everyone to find out
what a greedy

473
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:13,502
and selfish person she is.

474
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:19,583
I think the term selfish suits you more.

475
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:21,143
- What?
- You know,

476
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:23,113
I have a belief when I defend someone.

477
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:25,583
I try to embrace trashy people
with my heart.

478
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:29,453
But I can't embrace someone
who talks ill about my friend.

479

You can look for another lawyer,

480
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:34,863
or you can settle with them.

481
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,533
Hey! Why do you only care for her?

482

Don't go around and tell people
that we're friends.

499
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:22,173
I'll sue you

Okay. Quiet.

Congratulations

You guys should all get rest,

- and I'll see you tomorrow at practice.
- Yes, sir.

- Good job, you guys.
- Good job.

Go Woo-young and Hong Si-woo.
See me for a second.

The scout for Hankuk University
said he was very impressed

514
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,353
by the two of you.

515
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:19,093
If we win the finals, Hankuk University
said they want to scout you two.

516
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,333
So do your best.

517
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:21,403
Yes, sir.

00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:23,403
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.

519
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:25,203
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

520
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,013
Hey. Nice.

00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:31,073
Good job.

Isn't Hankuk University
the school you wanted to go to?

523
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:35,343
This is great, Si-woo.

524
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:37,713
Let's go to Hankuk University together.

525
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:40,883
Right.

526
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:47,193
Woo-young. You should go first.

527
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:48,593
I'm going to make a phone call.

528
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:49,863
Oh, okay.

Hey, Si-woo.

532
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:26,933
Hi, Dad. The finals are next Saturday.
Can you come?

533
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,733
I want to go, but...

534
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:32,903
<i>Oh, right.</i>

535
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:34,773
You're busy these days, right?

536
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:38,973
It's okay if you can't come.

537
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,083
I'll hang up now.

538
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:56,833
What? You didn't leave yet?

539
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:59,393
No. I wanted to go with you.

540
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:00,533
I see.

541
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:07,073
You look really upset.

542
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,413
To be honest,

543
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,513
I became interested in basketball
because of my dad.

544
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,723
Is that so?

545
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,493
Yes.

546
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:25,993
My dad

547
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:28,863
was Serim High School
basketball team's ace,

548
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:32,863
but after I was born, he quit playing.

549
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:36,973
That's why I wanted to achieve
my dad's dream for him.

550
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:40,503
But I was afraid he'd be disappointed
if I was bad,

551
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,143
so I pretended not
to care about basketball.

552
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:50,213
I didn't know you had those thoughts.

553
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:55,083
I wanted to tell him
when I was good enough.

554
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:00,293
That's why
when I got into the basketball team,

555
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,393
my dad was the first person I called.

556
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,633
I wanted him to see me
play in the finals,

557
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:08,863
so I practiced really hard.

558
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:15,373
But he said he can't come.

559
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,483
My dad can't come either
because he's busy.

560
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,893
Why do you guys look so sad when we won?

561
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:34,523
You should join us at the PC cafe
to release some stress.

562
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,463
- Me too?
- Yes, you too.

563
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,033
- Don't you want to go?
- No. I do.

564
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,333
Are you going to go too, Woo-young?

565
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:49,943
Oh, I have something to take care of,

566
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:51,873
so you should go have fun.

567
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:54,713
You always act like you're so busy.
Hey, let's go.

568
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:11,393
You did a good job today.

569
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,963
I called you last minute, but you came.
Thank you so much.

570
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,463
It was nothing.

571
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:18,073
You can call me whenever you need me.

572
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,643
I'm really free these days.

573
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:23,113
Okay. I'll call you if I need your help.

574
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,343
- Okay. Be sure to call me.
- Okay.

575
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,243
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

576

<i>Nam Tae-hee got his fourth homerun
of the season.</i>

577
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:44,563
<i>Didn't Ye Ji-hoon let a homerun happen
too easily?</i>

578
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:47,703
<i>Including this homerun, his ball control
has been unstable throughout this game.</i>

579
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:50,233
<i>He's been allowing the batters
to hit his balls too easily.</i>

580
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:51,403
<i>That's unfortunate.</i>

581
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:54,903
<i>I'm worried that something has happened
to Ye Ji-hoon.</i>

582
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:57,713
<i>Can't we suspect
that he's in a slump right now?</i>

583
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:02,113
<i>Ye Ji-hoon isn't the type of player
to be in a slump.</i>

584
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:04,453
<i>I'm wondering if he's been hurt.</i>

585
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:07,053
<i>- Hurt? His team hasn't said anything</i>
- Are you okay?

586
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,253
<i>- about him being hurt.</i>
- Oh, my.

587
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:11,053
- Yes.
- Then

588
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:13,663
do you want to get coffee with me?

589
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,663
It's nice to see you
in the baseball stadium.

590
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:24,173
Did you come for an interview?

591
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:28,273
No. I'm here to get some work.

592
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,713
I got fired.

593
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:33,743
You got fired?

594
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:35,183
Yes.

595
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:39,183
I guess I wasn't good enough
to become a permanent employee.

596
00:41:39,253 --> 00:41:40,883
What are you talking about?

597
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:44,123
So many programs became successful
because of you.

598
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,323
My goodness.

599
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,663
They need to fail without you
to come to their senses.

600
00:41:49,563 --> 00:41:51,933
Broadcasting people are really dumb!

601
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:53,203
Ji-hoon.

602
00:41:53,963 --> 00:41:55,263
What if someone hears you?

603
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,833
Let them hear me.

604
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,203
I'm going to curse them,
so they can fail. Just wait and see.

605
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:09,213
Are you okay?

606
00:42:10,283 --> 00:42:12,153
I heard you might be hurt.

607
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:14,423
Gosh.

608
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:17,253
I'm not hurt.

609
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:19,323
Then what is it?

610
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,333
I wanted to be a good dad to Seo-yeon.

611
00:42:27,163 --> 00:42:28,333
But I feel like

612
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:31,403
she's only getting hurt because of me.

613
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:34,373
- What is it?
- Do you want to go swimming?

614
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:36,103
- Yes.
- Do you like the idea?

615
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:36,973
Yes.

616
00:42:37,943 --> 00:42:39,013
Seo-yeon,

617
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,143
do you miss your mom?

618
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:48,353
We're not open yet.

619
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:58,993
Could you meet with Seo-yeon just once?

620
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:03,733
No. She doesn't know about me anyway.

621
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:04,973
She does.

622
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:07,443
She even went

623
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:11,043
to the hospital
you worked at to see you.

624
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,243
- What?
- She misses you a lot.

625
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:17,813
Can you please meet her once?

626
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:21,053
Are you happy that you're getting
to see Mom?

627
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:22,823
Yes, I am!

628
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:36,063
Mom?

629
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:38,533
That's right. I'm your mom.

630
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:42,903
But I've forgotten you long ago.

631
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:46,513
I never thought of myself as someone
with a daughter.

632
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:47,743
What?

633
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:49,743
What are you doing?

634
00:43:49,813 --> 00:43:51,053
Can't you tell?

635
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:56,593
Don't cry, Seo-yeon.

636
00:43:57,193 --> 00:43:59,423
Your mom is just like this.

637
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:02,163
So, don't you ever miss me
or come looking for me again.

638
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,463
I'm not going to see you even if you do.

639
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:05,893
Understood?

640
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:08,663
Mom...

641
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,203
Why did you do that to her?

642
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:15,943
So that she won't get attached.

643
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:17,713
Why can't she get attached?

644
00:44:17,773 --> 00:44:18,973
She's your daughter.

645
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:20,013
My daughter?

646
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,843
I had her by mistake when I was young.

647
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:23,913
I didn't know anything back then.

648
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:26,383
I'm not responsible for her.

649
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,703
I'm sorry, Seo-yeon.

650
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:50,813
I'm sorry.

651
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,373
I'm so sorry.

652
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,503
The more I try,

653
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:18,773
the worse it's getting, it seems.

654
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:21,743
You're not making anything worse.

655
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:24,443
But what do you think

656
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:26,713
about staying as an uncle

657
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:31,053
to Seo-yeon?

658
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:33,353
An uncle?

659
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:38,353
Just like how nobody else can be
your brother,

660
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,593
to Seo-yeon,

661
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:43,363
there will always be just one father.

662
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:45,493
I think it'd be good

663
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,203
to let her think that.

664
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:53,573
Seo-yeon!

665
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:55,403
Come to Dad.

666
00:46:01,913 --> 00:46:02,983
You're right.

667
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:04,953
All along, I was trying

668
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:07,553
to make Seo-yeon forget
someone who means the world to her.

669
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:13,123
You heard from Si-ah, right?

670
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:16,163
I found your husband.

671
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,993
Oh... Yes.

672
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:23,363
I know you haven't forgotten about him,

673
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:26,173
so I didn't want to bring him up
and give you a hard time.

674
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:29,373
That's why I haven't said anything,

675
00:46:30,773 --> 00:46:32,313
but I guess I should now.

676
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,113
Remember how I said that my brother died
in an accident?

677
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:39,353
Yes.

678
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,523
That day,

679
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:45,123
Seo-yeon was also in the car.

680
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:53,093
Seo-yeon,

681
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:56,303
it seems like we'll have to spend
Christmas without Uncle Ji-hoon this year.

682
00:46:56,363 --> 00:47:00,073
Really? I miss Uncle Ji-hoon.

683
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:02,943
Seo-yeon, do you want to call
Uncle Ji-hoon right now?

684
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:05,673
- Yes!
- All right. Hold on a second.

685
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:07,783
A drowsy driver

686
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,183
ran into my brother's car.

687
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:17,893
Your phone is off.

688
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:21,563
Ji-hoon, make sure
to eat well in the US,

689
00:47:21,623 --> 00:47:23,693
and don't practice beyond your limit.

690
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:26,593
Merry Christmas!

691
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:35,996
And don't practice beyond your limit.

692
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:39,106
Merry Christmas!

693
00:47:53,986 --> 00:47:55,486
What was that?

694
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:03,596
Are you okay?

695
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:09,296
<i>There's a child in the car.</i>

696
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:16,776
Seo-yeon...

697
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:28,456
Excuse me!

698
00:48:30,656 --> 00:48:33,626
Excuse me! Please help me here!

699
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:43,236
Seo-yeon and my brother were
both in danger.

700
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:47,806
Then...

701
00:48:58,486 --> 00:49:00,086
Thank you.

702
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:02,456
Just hold on.

703
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:06,756
Please help!

704
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:14,296
Seo-yeon...

705
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,626
- Are you okay, sir?
- Sir.

706
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,756
Hello?

707
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:25,006
So,

708
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:27,536
why did you get into an accident?

709
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:29,236
Sorry?

710
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:31,876
Well...

711
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:34,476
So,

712
00:50:34,716 --> 00:50:37,286
the man in the accident
was your brother?

713
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:39,816
Yes, it was.

714
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:45,886
That's why I really wanted
to meet Mr. Hong.

715
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:01,036
Sir,

716
00:51:01,776 --> 00:51:03,406
is the child okay?

717
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:05,376
Yes, she is.

718
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:08,516
That's good to hear.

719
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:12,386
Are you the man who saved the girl
from the car?

720
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:14,516
Well, yes.

721
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:15,816
I see.

722
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:18,886
Her family is coming on a flight
right now.

723
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:21,196
He'd like to meet you
and compensate you for it.

724
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:22,656
Could I have your number, please?

725
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:23,726
No.

726
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:26,526
I didn't do it to get paid.

727
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:29,136
I did it because she reminded me
of my daughter.

728
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,106
I see.

729
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:33,406
Goodbye.

730
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:47,456
<i>Our condolences.</i>

731
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:49,216
<i>From Woorim High School</i>

732
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:24,286
Seo-yeon.

733
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,806
He didn't want to disclose
his identity to the police.

734
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:41,906
He also turned down any reward
for saving my niece.

735
00:52:44,406 --> 00:52:46,106
But I still thought thanking him

736
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,116
and giving him a reward was
the right thing to do.

737
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,546
So I contacted him.

738
00:52:51,986 --> 00:52:53,086
I'm sorry.

739
00:52:54,516 --> 00:52:56,686
I should have saved
your older brother too.

740
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:58,986
It's not your fault.

741
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,096
You risked your life and saved Seo-yeon.

742
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:04,596
So

743
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:07,736
I would really like to show you
my appreciation.

744
00:53:08,466 --> 00:53:11,836
No. I didn't do it for the money.

745
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:13,436
I just did it

746
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:18,106
because I was reminded
of my own daughter.

747
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:23,346
<i>He told me he did it
because he thought about his daughter.</i>

748
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:25,986
When I called him recently,

749
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:28,386
he said the same thing.

750
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,286
Your husband

751
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,026
is a great man.

752
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:36,656
He is.

753
00:53:37,526 --> 00:53:39,026
He's a good person.

754
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,166
To be honest,

755
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:46,566
if you told me
you couldn't get over someone else,

756
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:49,206
I wouldn't have given up.

757
00:53:50,136 --> 00:53:51,476
But if it's him,

758
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:55,046
I can't be his match.

759
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:00,916
I wish

760
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:03,986
only happiness for you two.

761
00:54:12,026 --> 00:54:15,336
It would be difficult for us
to be good friends,

762
00:54:15,596 --> 00:54:16,866
right?

763
00:54:17,636 --> 00:54:20,706
I thought we were friends.

764
00:54:20,906 --> 00:54:24,306
I thought you were my good friend.

00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:54,874
the dream you couldn't before.

826
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,134
Da-jung.

827
00:59:58,804 --> 00:59:59,804
I will

828
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:04,344
do whatever it takes
to find a way to go back.

829
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:08,254
What about your dream?

830
01:00:09,254 --> 01:00:10,684
To me, you and our children

831
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:13,224
are more important than my dream.

832
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:15,294
So

833
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,294
will you give up your dream
just like before?

834
01:00:19,424 --> 01:00:20,734
I'm not giving it up.

835
01:00:20,794 --> 01:00:21,794
Then, what is it?

836
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:26,404
This is exactly why I was so anxious.

837
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:29,734
Da-jung.

838
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:33,904
I can't do this anymore. Let's

839
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:36,314
really end this now.

840
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,954
Don't say things you don't mean.

841
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:45,684
No.

842
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:49,354
I called you,

843
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:51,894
so I can say this to you.

844
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:58,234
Our kids are all grown up now.

845
01:00:59,234 --> 01:01:01,334
I can look after them by myself.

846
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:04,944
So you should live your own life.

847
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,374
You're a good person.

848
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,914
And you more than deserve it.

849
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:13,884
Da-jung.

850
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,524
You can stay

851
01:01:18,984 --> 01:01:20,224
in their lives

852
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,024
as their friend just like now.

853
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:26,824
And we should

854
01:01:30,864 --> 01:01:32,534
live our own lives.

855
01:01:35,934 --> 01:01:37,444
Da-jung.

856
01:01:43,144 --> 01:01:44,284
I...

857
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:48,914
I want to stay by your side.

858
01:01:49,954 --> 01:01:52,424
Look what happened to your life
when you did that.

859
01:01:56,124 --> 01:01:57,194
To be honest,

860
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:00,934
it was

861
01:02:02,294 --> 01:02:04,134
really hard seeing you

862
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:07,734
play basketball.

863
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:10,374
<i>You seemed so happy</i>

864
01:02:11,104 --> 01:02:12,904
<i>when you were playing basketball.</i>

865
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:16,674
<i>It made me wonder</i>

866
01:02:17,544 --> 01:02:18,914
<i>what would have happened</i>

867
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:22,114
<i>if I didn't tell you I was pregnant
18 years ago.</i>

868
01:02:26,824 --> 01:02:28,794
I kept thinking about that in my head

869
01:02:30,494 --> 01:02:31,664
and regretted it.

870
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,294
You did too,

871
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:38,364
didn't you?

872
01:02:48,114 --> 01:02:50,014
Regretting your life with me once

873
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:52,414
is enough.

874
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:55,914
We know it firsthand.

875
01:02:57,354 --> 01:02:58,654
I won't do that again.

876
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:06,564
Give me a chance.

877
01:03:09,094 --> 01:03:10,164
No.

878
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:16,974
You already have a chance now.

879
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:18,944
Don't

880
01:03:20,374 --> 01:03:21,574
miss that chance.

881
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:25,384
Woo-young.

882

<i>Passion, pride, and Serim</i>

889
01:04:48,794 --> 01:04:49,934
Please.

890
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:53,764
Please. Let's go back to my real life.

891
01:04:57,104 --> 01:04:58,304
<i>Passion, pride, and Serim</i>

892
01:05:14,754 --> 01:05:16,794
I want my life back!

<i>Passion, pride, and Serim</i>

894
01:05:23,894 --> 01:05:27,674
Why can't I go back? Why not?

895
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:33,204
Please!

896

<i>We are Korea!</i>

898
01:06:18,754 --> 01:06:19,854
Yes, Mom.

899
01:06:20,754 --> 01:06:23,994
What's wrong with your voice?
Did something happen?

900
01:06:26,224 --> 01:06:28,134
No. Nothing happened.

901
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:31,234
Da-jung.

902
01:06:32,064 --> 01:06:34,234
Move back home with your kids
if it's too hard.

903
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:41,274
No. Dae-young takes good care of us.

904
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:43,374
I'm all right.

905
01:06:44,074 --> 01:06:47,754
- <i>(Deoksan Hill)</i>
- Let's go, Korea!

906
01:06:53,554 --> 01:06:56,724
<i>Everyone was wildly cheering for Korea
in summer of 2002.</i>

907
01:06:57,624 --> 01:07:01,294
<i>You at the age of 20 cried
because you were heartbroken</i>

908
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:04,604
<i>by your own misery</i>

909
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:07,034
<i>and by heartless people.</i>

910
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,274
<i>They made you cry.</i>

911
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:12,104
<i>I wanted to comfort you</i>

912
01:07:12,704 --> 01:07:15,774
<i>by telling you not to try so hard
when you were crying.</i>

913
01:07:16,544 --> 01:07:17,644
Da-jung.

914
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:27,524
<i>But you tried
and put a smile on your face.</i>

915
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:31,694
Why did you wait for me out here?
You must be tired.

916
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:35,334
<i>And I didn't want to make you cry.</i>

917
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:45,844
Are you okay?

918
01:07:46,544 --> 01:07:48,944
Oh, this? I'm fine.

919
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:50,974
It's a small cut.

920
01:07:52,184 --> 01:07:54,884
<i>When the whole world
