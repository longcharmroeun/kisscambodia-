1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
I'll retake the Founding!


2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,470
Eren!


3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,420
What’s wrong?!


4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,030
He’s the one who did that?!


5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,530
Could he be... the Ackerman?!


6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,690
No way...!


7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,630
I'm a Titan!


8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,180
They are just humans
and they are trying to kill me?!


9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,620
So these are...


10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,130
the devils of Paradis island!


11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,350
They are behind us!


12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,020
Evade! Evade!


13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,990
Dammit! We can’t seem to get rid of them!


14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,970
Dammit!


15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,209
That thing, too?!


16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
The Cart Titan!


17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,780
Pieck!


18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,150
Thank God, I made it in time.


19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,430
As I thought, this heavy machine-gun armament
is perfect against vertical maneuver gear.


20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,310
It was worth the time to put these on.


21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,430
Eren!


22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,360
That bastard is here...


23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,229
The Beast Titan!


24
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,009
Mr. Zeke!


25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,960
I will kill him!


26
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,229
Eren Yeager!


27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't let them get away.


28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,850
Exterminate them.


29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Don't die.


30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
Stay alive!


31
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,100
♫ Let's start a new life from the darkness ♫


32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,190

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,900

[#66 Assault]


42
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,409
This is...?


43
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,250
Could that be...?


44
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,950
Mr. Kruger?


45
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,030
No...


46
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,720
It’s Eren Yeager!


47
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,270
How dare he lie to me…!


48
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,010
Deputy Chief Braun!


49
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,070
Deputy Chief!


50
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,659
Deputy Chief!


51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry! It's all my fault…


52
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,730
He's alive.


53
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,940
But...


54
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,190
He's unconscious.


55
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,970
His injuries should heal
automatically with his Titan power.


56
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,860
As long as he has
the will to live, that is...


57
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,890
But this...?


58
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,250
I can't stand myself anymore...


59
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,780
Please kill me...!


60
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,950
Deputy Chief.


61
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,840
I will call for help.


62
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Not everyone out there is an enemy.


63
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,050
Gabi and I...
We are all your allies.


64
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,550
Please wait for me.


65
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,180
Deputy Chief Braun!


66
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,280
It's coming!


67
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,140
That bastard!


68
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,540
Hey, wait!


69
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
I will blow you into pieces!


70
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,400
We must protect War Chief's back!


71
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,180
Yes!


72
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,110
Above us!


73
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,460
I can’t find the right angle to shoot…!


74
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,210
Galliard!


75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
You saved us!


76
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,200
Thank you, Porco!


77
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,100
That was close. Thank you!


78
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,750
Be careful!


79
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,820
I lost sight of the Ackerman!


80
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,400
He must be hiding somewhere!


81
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,530
What did you say?


82
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,290
Porco.


83
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,420
The War Hammer is in danger!


84
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,140
A crystal form just like Annie's.


85
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,410
My teeth are not as strong as I expected.


86
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,500
But you already used out  your power.


87
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,950
If you had gotten just a little bit strength left,


88
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,000
you would've pierced me
right through my nape already.


89
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,960
You have run out of ideas.


90
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,200
But I haven’t.


91
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,460
Dammit!


92
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,000
That bastard...


93
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,960
He still has some power left?


94
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,940
If only we could beat him...
If we can retake the Founding...


95
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,350
What are you scared of, Pock?


96
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,650
What?!


97
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,120
There's no need for us to rush.


98
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,300
We're the ones who rule this battlefield.


99
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,640
Our enemies are already at their limit.


100
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,330
They got here using their
vertical maneuver gear.


101
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,510
So they couldn't pack enough
fuel and weapons.


102
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,200
In other words, they're like rats cornered
in the middle of the enemy territory with no supply line.


103
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,820
The Marleyan Army must've surrounded
this internment zone by now.


104
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,679
They have no escape route.


105
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,400
To begin with, the Paradis forces doesn't have
the power to take on Marley in a proper war.


106
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,409
That's why I said that as long as
we can get the Founding Titan


107
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,490
they would lose their key,
the Rumbling.


108
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,530
And that key is right in front of us!


109
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,850
That's why we need
to be careful when we act!


110
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,000
Anyway, all we need to do is to
protect War Chief from the Ackerman.


111
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,840
Very good, Pieck!


112
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,830
You are absolutely right!


113
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,570
Eren Yeager is no match for me.


114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,980
I will start with you.


115
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,040
Come out, Levi.


116
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,580
You don't have much time, right?


117
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,630
Wow! War Chief Zeke!


118
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,080
He's really amazingly strong!


119
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,110
Grice!


120
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,850
Commander Magath!


121
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,090
Commander!


122
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,880
In the back of the plaza…


123
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,850
What are you doing?!


124
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,720
Are you okay? Are you hurt?


125
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm fine!


126
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,730
Then you should get out of here immediately!


127
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,720
Actually!


128
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,720
Deputy Chief Braun is in the back of the plaza!


129
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,920
He's buried in the rubble and unable to move!


130
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,080
What did you say?


131
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,790
It's my fault…


132
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,340
It’s because he was trying to protect me…


133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,270
Who got him?


134
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,970
It's Eren...


135
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,460
Yeager!


136
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,210
Hurry up and dock!


137
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,930
Get the troops to Liberio
as soon as possible!


138
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,900
They're suffering devastating loss there!


139
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,610
Hey, you in the fishing boat over there!
It's dangerous here!


140
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,500
Can't you see this whole fleet here?


141
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,650
Hey!


142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
The navy ships...


143
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,720
Don't just stand here!


144
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,250
You two must get out of here!


145
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,180
Commander Magath, that...


146
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,110
They got the navy.
The only one who can do that…


147
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,110
The Colossal Titan!


148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Bertolt's Titan... has been taken!


149
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,470
Dammit!


150
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,510
They didn't attack us without a plan!


151
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,470
Just try, you devils!


152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,360
Everything will be over
once you lose the Founding!


153
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,090
The one beside him is an Ackerman!


154
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,650
You're in my way!


155
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,750
War Chief!


156
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,380
The enemy has launched a general attack!


157
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,420
-Mr. Zeke!
-Get down, Gabi!


158
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,600
Zeke...


159
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,550
Ms. Pieck!


160
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,680
The enemies are coming!


161
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,340
What's wrong?


162
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,660
Hey, Carlo?


163
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,440
Answer us, hey!


164
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,070
Carlo!


165
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,680
How dare you kill my people!


166
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
Thank you for that time!


167
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,830
Now!


168
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,740
Fire!


169
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,270
Ms. Pieck!


170
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,220
Everyone!


171
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,510
Pieck!


172
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,160
So this is...


173
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,900
...the view that you saw...


174
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,680
Bertlot.


175
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,370
Stop this...


176
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,610
Hurry up! Finish it!


177
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,210
Don't shoot!


178
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,610
Please stop!


179
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,020
I missed?!


180
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,220
Is it the steam? Or...


181
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,760
Or did...


182
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,120
I miss him?


183
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,850
Ms. Pieck!


184
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,820
It's the Cart's main body!


185
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,730
Run...


186
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Ms. Pieck!


187
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,900
Hurry…


188
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,000
Protect Pieck!


189
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,300
Don't look down on us, you devils!


190
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,400
Braun! Go help Grice!


191
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,470
Yes, sir!


192
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,460
It’s no good! We can't get close!


193
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,000
This way! Go!


194
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,220
They got the War Chief, and now Pieck, too?!


195
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,530
Dammit, dammit, dammit!


196
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,950
Damn you all!


197
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,980
He's fast.


198
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,310
It's way different from Ymir's Jaw.


199
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,560
So this is the power of the Jaw...


200
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,730
I see...


201
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,870
How awful...


202
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,470
She's not healing fast enough...


203
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,570
She got the Titan power, so why?


204
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,810
The Cart Titan is not that durable.


205
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,900
It's nothing compared to the Armored Titan.


206
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,390
What about Reiner?


207
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,520
Where is he?


208
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,900
You said he got beaten by Eren Yeager
and couldn’t move, right?


209
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,080
He can't fight now?


210
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,060
I don't know.


211
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,500
He's under the building behind the stage.


212
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,080
But...


213
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,250
I...


214
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,470
I don’t think we should bother Mr. Reiner…


215
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,910
What... are you saying?


216
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,359
Udo and Zofia...


217
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,609
A lot of people got killed by Eren Yeager.


218
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,800
Hey, Gabi!


219
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,750
Don't get near the window!
The enemy will find us!


220
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,610
Commander!


221
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,500
Commander!


222
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,430
We spotted the path of lights!


223
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,860
Good.


224
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,740
Looks like everything goes
as planned for now.


225
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,350
Alright, I'm counting on you, Onyankopon.


226
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,580
Just leave it to me, Ms. Hange!


227
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,970
Infiltrate into the internment zone
at low speed and low altitude.


228
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,360
And we will fly along the path
of lights and collect our troops.


229
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,530
That will be the only chance,
and it'll be over if you gets left behind.


230
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,490
It’s the same if this flying ship
is shot down.


231
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,970
You sure came up with one
hell of a reckless plan.


232
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,840
Are you possessed by Erwin’s ghost or what?


233
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,220
I wish that was the case,


234
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,390
If it could give us strength.


235
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,700
But now that things have become like this...


236
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,270
If we can't retrieve Eren
and everyone else...


237
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,410
There won't be a future for us.


238
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,490
Jean, it's here.


239
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,230
Yeah, right on time.


240
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,520
’Are they trying to take that and escape?!


241
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,560
Like I would let you!


242
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,440
Oh no--


243
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,240
H-Hey...


244
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,090
You're kidding me...


245
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,460
Stop it.


246
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,950
Cut it out!


247
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,370
Cut it out!


248
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,980
Please stop it!!!


249
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,610
What... was that?


250
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,860
The War Hammer has been eaten.


251
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,500
And after that... it's the Jaw...!


252
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,000
No way...


253
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,020
Even Mr. Galliard?


254
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
No...


255
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,600
This is no good.


256
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,340
Reiner!


257
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,050
Save us!


258
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,880
Mr. Galliard will get eaten!


259
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,280
Save him!


260
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,700
Shut up.


261
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,280
Be quiet.


262
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,410
- Reiner!
- Reiner!


263
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,640
I beg you.


264
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,380
Let me...


265
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,080
-Save us!
-Reiner!


266
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,410
Hey, stop it!


267
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,650
Come on, you kids!


268
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,870
Stop it!


269
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,300
Why


270
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,980
can’t you guys...


271
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,000
let me...


272
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,790
die in peace!


273
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:17,950
♫ In an instant ♫


274
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:24,960
♫ In an abandoned world ♫


275
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:36,140
♫ If you can fly, please tell him ♫


276
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,560
♫ Many birds with burnt wings ♫


277
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,240
♫ Scattering ashes and smiling ♫


278
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,740
♫ I wish someone ♫


279
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,880
♫ Spreading the proof of my existence ♫


280
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:19,100
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫


281
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:34,700
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫


282
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,670
The Armored Titan falls down.


283
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,420
With the power of anger over
the destruction of her homeland,


284
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,930
Gabi grabs a gun


285
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,470
and storms out.


286
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,780
