00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,910
Where are you going at this hour?


4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,440
I forgot something. I'm on my way back
to headquarters to get it.


5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,280
Excuse me!


6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,010
Falco. I need you to do me a favor.


7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,460
What is it, Mr. Kruger?


8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,680
I want to send out letters.


9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,990
But they will look at the content
if I send it from this internment zone, right?


10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,210
Yeah.


11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,210
If they read the letter, they will know
that I'm faking my illness.


12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,490
So I want you to put this
in the mailbox outside the internment zone.


13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,650
Alright. Is it for your family?


14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,100
Yeah... I just wanted to tell them
I'm doing fine here.

Hey, what's with all the noises?


28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,810
The entire Tybur family has come for a visit!


29
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,220
What did you say?


30
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,950
They're not from the Marleyan army.


31
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,860
They're Tybur family's personal guards...


32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,900
Come in.


33
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,210
I'm sorry for dropping by unannounced.


34
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,470
I'm Willy, the head of Tybur family.


35
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,290
I'm Theo Magath, the Warrior Unit Commander.


36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,710
It's an honor to meet you, Lord Tybur.


37
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,080
Nice to meet you, Commander Magath.


38
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,840
Well then, allow me to introduce you
to the rest of the Tybur family.


39
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,220
You're the guy who’s been managing
the Warrior Unit since it was first formed.


40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,970
Can you tell which one of them has
the War Hammer Titan?


41
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,570
No, I don't have a clue.


42
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,290
Nor am I sure if that person is even here.


43
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,390
You're as tactful as people say.


44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,030
However, he is here.


45
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,020
The War Hammer Titan is right among us.


46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,040
I came here to see the statue of Helos.


47
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,050
Hundred years ago, in spite of being a mere
human, he defeated the Devil of All Earth.


48
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,110
The honorable Marleyan hero who saved the world.


49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,670
His gallant act


50
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,300
was an incredible feat.


51
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,880
Brave, graceful, and unwounded.


52
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,380
Truly, the personification of Marleyan soul.


53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,130
Yes, indeed.


54
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,900
That bronze statue is hollow, after all.


55
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,990
Quite scathing, Commander.


56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,610
Rumors say you might be working
to reinstate conscription systems for Marley.


57
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,780
War to Marleyans is something


58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,300
that only exists on their newspaper.


59
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,660
They only need to read them,
and the next thing they know,


60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,760
their borders expanded.


61
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,650
Even better for them if the ones
who get showered by bullets


62
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,190
are the descendants of devils
they tamed or enemy soldiers.


63
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,380
Even if you have some


64
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,990
Marleyans’ ears grazed by bullets,


65
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,740
this country won't stop its march towards war


66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,700
until the day it self-destructs.


67
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,520
If there's someone controlling Marley
behind the shadow,


68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
I want to say this to them,


69
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,670
"It's already too late."


70
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,950
You're indeed merciless, Commander.


71
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,390
I can't even talk back.


72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,240
As you have guessed,


73
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,130
this country is under the authority of Tybur.


74
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,350
But it was none other than Marley itself


75
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,570
that took this path to militarism.


76
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,590
We simply gave Marley the freedom and power


77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,660
they needed as an act of atonement…


78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,270
As a result, both Eldia and Marley


79
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,000
were tossed into darkness.


80
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,500
That responsibility lies with the Tybur family.


81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,690
I'm planning to reveal all the truth


82
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,150
to the world on the upcoming festival.


83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,530
I was not lying when I said I came
to see the hero statue.


84
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,710
Marley needs a hero once again.


85
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,780
Theo Magath.


86
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,490
Can you please shake this hand once again?


87
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,690
Good morning, Pock.


88
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,990
Pieck... what are you doing?


89
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,620
It's much easier for me to walk this way.


90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,360
Did I surprise you?


91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,810
Just walk normally with two legs, okay?


92
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,750
The Titans will come from the south.


93
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,530
Based on this fact,


94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,400
the further into north, the weaker their defense.


95
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,970
So we should attack from the north?


96
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,900
Yes, that's an option.


97
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,000
However, the pier to the south remains


98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,600
to be the only place we can dock large ships.


99
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,690
If we want to utilize our material advantages, then…


100
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,520
We have to attack from the south?


101
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,420
Again, we lost our scout ships on the south shore,


102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,630
meaning the enemies have their eyes focused there.


103
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,470
There's a possibility that the docks have been destroyed…


104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,780
Then what are you trying to say?!


105
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,820
I just want to provide the information I have as reference…


106
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,690
I got it. That's enough.


107
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,150
It was a mistake letting the Eldian speak to us.


108
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,450
The Paradis island operation is going well, huh?


109
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,980
We have awfully brilliant officials leading us.


110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,360
I can't wait to see what kind of strategy
they will force on us.


111
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,150
Like


112
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,490
entrusting the entire thing to four kids, maybe?


113
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,550
Huh? He passed her...


114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,720
Falco passed Gabi!


115
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,280
They're cheering over just one victory.


116
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,490
Sheesh,


117
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,450
if only they knew what we were going through.


118
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,840
It doesn't matter how much Falco tries
to improve his grades,


119
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,210
it's already too late for him to overtake Gabi.


120
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,200
The final sprint…


121
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,150
Oh, what's with


122
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,560
you kiddos today?


123
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,159
Falco just beat Gabi for the first time!


124
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,190
Really? In grades?


125
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,500
No, just in race.


126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,909
This is a historic achievement!


127
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,320
Just stop it already. You're embarrassing me.


128
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,880
Well, that's amazing!


129
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,280
Guess you will be the next Armored, huh, kid?


130
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,570
O-Ouch!


131
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,860
It's already way too late for you to even catch up to me!


132
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,490
I made achievement in war and
contributed to our homeland, after all!


133
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,030
You're right.


134
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,450
But the Army still hasn’t announced
who will inherit the Armored.


135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,780
I will just do what I can do


136
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,400
until that day comes.


137
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,860
Hey, look, he's acting cool and all.


138
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,419
Your brother will inherit the Beast anyway!


139
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,659
Your whole family gets to be
Honorary Marleyan regardless!


140
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,909
So why are you still working so hard?


141
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,919
I'm doing this for you!


142
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,810
Oh my... Hey, he finally said it!


143
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,560
You're saying you're getting in my way for my sake?!


144
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,720
You're making no sense!


145
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,110
Damn, she didn't get it…


146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,450
What's wrong with him? Sheesh!


147
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,600
Oh, welcome home, our little warriors!


148
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,350
Gabi!


149
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,270
I heard what you did, Gabi!


150
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,730
You're our savior! Gabi!


151
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,160
No, I'm Zofia, so...


152
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,770
What are you doing,


153
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,730
getting drunk during the day and hugging girls?


154
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,070
You old geezer!


155
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,040
Shut up you old hag!


156
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,720
What's wrong with praising a hero?!


157
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,650
No one will be happy getting praised by you!


158
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,010
There, go back home to your mom already!


159
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,500
And you kids, here, take this.


160
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,020
Eat well and become as big as Deputy Chief Braun!


161
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,100
Thank you very much!


162
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,040
So they will really declare war in this internment zone?


163
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,340
It's like a theater.


164
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,490
They say the whole world will be on
our side if we hold this "festival" thing


165
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,790
while gathering all leaders here from different countries.


166
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,300
If so!


167
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,440
All Marley's problems will be over


168
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,710
and it will be great!


169
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,790
You don't think it will work?


170
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,650
You think it will, Gabi?


171
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,330
The countries from Mid-East Allied Forces


172
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,130
we had war with just a month ago will also be there.


173
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,250
My family came here from the interment zone
of other country, so I know.


174
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,830
It was awful.


175
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,560
The hostility that the Eldian face here is nothing


176
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,800
compared to outside.


177
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,720
Then, even more so, we must do something.


178
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,960
They must've chosen this place


179
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,620
to have the world understand more about the Eldian!


180
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,510
To convince them that we're not devils.


181
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,000
But how?


182
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,340
Smile!


183
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,180
I get how you feel about them, very well.


184
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,390
Just acting servile won't do a thing.


185
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,280
Also, Zofia,


186
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,890
stop playing such a weird character.


187
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,270
No, that’s just who I am.


188
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,340
So what will you change about yourself?


189
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,060
I can simply act the way I normally do!


190
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,570
I'm cute and smart, after all!


191
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,860
I'm sure I will get all the higher-ups'
attention, boosting my valuation.


192
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,510
She is starting to sound like a real devil.


193
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm going to make you cry if you


194
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,820
take Falco's side again, okay?


195
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,690
You really are a devil!


196
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,640
It's Commander Magath.


197
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,490
Here it is.


198
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,740
Large scale demolition required, huh?


199
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,340
It has become severely aged.


200
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,390
Congratulations, General.


201
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,210
The Army now belongs to you.


202
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,530
No, the Army belongs to the country.


203
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,700
And this country's Commander-in-chief is you.


204
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,090
Not exactly.


205
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,970
I'm simply holding the steering wheel.


206
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,310
I now understand why none of my predecessors


207
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,420
even tried to hold it.


208
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,070
It's too heavy.


209
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,430
I'd like to let it go if I could,


210
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,150
but I have to grip onto this firmly more than ever.


211
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,430
It just happened to be me.


212
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,620
This moment just happened to come during my turn.


213
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,020
The house is on the verge of collapse,


214
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,260
but there are some posts still usable.


215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,270
According to them,


216
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,720
there is already a rat infestation.


217
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,190
You did great, Falco.


218
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,530
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Kruger.


219
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,080
To be honest, I don’t think


220
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,270
I’d be able to outperform Gabi at this point.


221
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,270
But at least, I now can go


222
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,820
forward without doubts.


223
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,660
Really? But I'm the one who should be thanking you.


224
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,660
You helped with all those letters.


225
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm saved thanks to you.


226
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,110
It's nothing.


227
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,540
Is that from your family?


228
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,330
They said life in hospital must be boring.


229
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,270
It was hard for me with this body, though.


230
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,300
I must move forward, too.


231
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,540
I will go back to my hometown once the festival is over.


232
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,610
I see...


233
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,670
The doctor is here.


234
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,750
I'll go now.


235
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,540
Hey, may I sit next to you?


236
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,410
Yeah. As you please.


237
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,310
Then excuse me.


238
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,180
I'm a physician in this district. My name is Yeager.


239
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,560
I come here to drink tea occasionally.


240
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,840
Nice to meet you. My name is Kruger.


241
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,680
Nice to meet you, Kruger.


242
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,520
Seems like you're on good terms with that boy just now.


243
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,560
I am.


244
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,730
Yeah? I'm sure I'd get along with him.


245
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,250
I'm also sitting on this bench looking for someone to talk to.


246
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,750
That boy's uncle was a leader of the Eldia restorationist.


247
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,780
The restorationist were sent to "paradise,"


248
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,630
including their family.


249
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,950
The boy, along with his brother, volunteered
to be a warrior to protect their family.


250
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,630
With his brother earning
the right to inherit the Beast,


251
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,030
the Grice family finally found peace.


252
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,370
Why... are you telling me that?


253
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,670
Stop asking that boy to do stuff for you.


254
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,560
The Grice family's effort will be


255
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,470
all for nothing if he gets suspected by people.


256
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,940
If your mind has recovered,


257
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,340
hurry up and return to your family.


258
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:04,720
It will be too late to regret it once you lose them for good.


259
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,470
Regret... huh...


260
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,280
Seems like you have regret
regarding your own family.


261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,650
There has never been a day
I haven’t regretted it.


262
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,360
That day my son went outside the wall with his sister.


263
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,890
It's all because I was too harsh on him,


264
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,970
forcing him to take after me as a doctor.


265
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,860
It's me...


266
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,610
it's all my fault!


267
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,620
Ah!!!


268
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,210
Mr. Yeager!


269
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,870
Don't leave on your own like that!


270
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,970
I'm sorry, I took my eyes
off him for a moment, so he...


271
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,920
Come on, Mr. Yeager.


272
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm sure you will get better.


273
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,850
[The available intelligence for now]
[The Tybur family]
[The aristocracy overthrown by the uprising of the Eldian 100 years ago during the war of Titan]
[The Tyburs joined hands with the Marleyan hero Helos during the war and reached a truce agreement behind the back of the Eldian.]
[“The War Hammer Titan” of every generation belongs to them. With such power,]
[though noble, they are also the vanguard of the military state Marley, and have great influence both at home and abroad.]
[The current head of the family is Willy Tybur.]


274
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,690
It's amazing.


275
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,350
It's all people I see on newspaper!


276
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,330
Don't make idle chitchat.


277
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,460
We're going to serve them as we trained.


278
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,710
Look, there are some empty glasses!


279
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,530
Move out!


280
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,600
Falco, another!


281
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,260
Here!


282
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,110
Oh, look. The filthy blood is carrying the plates.


283
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,390
No wonder the food here stinks!


284
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,540
I-I'm very sorry…


285
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,500
Shush. Don't make a scene.


286
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,560
B-But... Your beautiful garment...!


287
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,000
Madame, is there something wrong?


288
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,560
How embarrassing!


289
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,910
I spilled wine on my kimono by accident,


290
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,829
so I was asking for his help.


291
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,359
Thank you.


292
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,010
Oh my goodness!


293
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,760
Please, this way.


294
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,520
W-Why...?


295
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,180
Who knows what would've happened to you?


296
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,040
Are you okay?


297
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,900
Yeah... She saved me.


298
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,780
All while knowing that I'm an Eldian.


299
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,710
That person... She must be someone
from the Eastern nation of Hizuru.


300
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,320
It's Willy!


301
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,920
Willy! The descendant of the Savior!


302
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,000
It's been long, Ambassador Ogweno!


303
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,320
Nambia! I haven't met you since we were little!


304
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,670
I still remember all those times I made you cry.


305
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,750
Do you remember me, Willy?


306
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,180
Oh! That must be the scar from when you fell from that tree!


307
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,950
Ladies and gentlemen,


308
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,060
I give you all my sincere thanks for coming here today.


309
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,850
Just a few days ago, some of our people engaged


310
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,480
in an unsightly dispute over resources.


311
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,770
However, yesterday's enemies are today's enemies, too!


312
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh, excuse me.


313
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,390
Yesterday's enemies are today's friends!


314
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,770
Let’s flush all what happened in the past
along with the wine we have tonight,


315
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,260
and join me for a toast for tomorrow?


316
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,480
Well then, for many years of peace!


317
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,500
Thank you so much.


318
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,140
What a refined joke it was, Ambassador.


319
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,890
However, it seems our guests weren't able
to understand what you said in common language.


320
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,750
So please, let me handle the rest.


321
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,140
That's it, Willy!


322
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,100
The Descendant of the Savior!


323
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,000
Tomorrow, I invite you all to the
Liberio internment zone.


324
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,490
There live the descendants of those who
once massacred the people of many nations.


325
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,850
The race whose blood runs in my veins as well.


326
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,280
It is the home of the devils known as the Eldian.


327
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,160
Marley, they who were once oppressed the most by them,


328
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,300
are now using that very devil to oppress other nations.


329
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,270
Thus, repeating the tragedy.


330
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,520
I understand very well the feeling


331
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,710
of wanting the extermination of all Eldians.


332
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,210
Thus, I finally arrived at a single answer


333
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,390
to this endless question.


334
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,730
Tomorrow, I will reveal that answer


335
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,730
at my first ever stage production.


336
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,760
To the great dramatist and the witnesses of history!


337
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,890
To the great dramatist and the witnesses of history!


338
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,670
What?!


339
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,070
What is this?!


340
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,580
Gabi! You finally woke up!


341
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,180
What's this situation?


342
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,340
It's a festival!


343
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,360
A lot of people from outside came
to this internment zone


344
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,440
and opened all kinds of stores!


345
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,330
Eat!


346
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,680
So this is a festival?!


347
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,880
Let's go!


348
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,960
♫ In an instant ♫


349
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,120
It hurts....!


350
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,220
It's your fault for being such a glutton.


351
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,320
They should make everyday a festival.


352
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,580
♫ In an abandoned world ♫


353
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,260
Yeah.


354
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,220
Somehow, so many things have happened
to me for the first time recently.


355
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:21,530

Huh? Where's Falco?

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,680
He said he found someone he knew
and ran off somewhere just now.

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,240
Is that guy okay?

C'mon, don't be so uptight on a good day like this!

00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,140
Can you follow me just for a moment?
