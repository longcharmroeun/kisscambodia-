00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,840
Let me go with you!


3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,960
-Okay?
-I’ll be back soon.


4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,510
-I wanna go with you!
-You’ve got to listen to your sister
and be good, okay?


5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,960
-Where are you going, daddy?
-Will you bring us gifts?


6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,080
-I want to go, too!
-Me, too!


7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,680
-Please, dad!
-I also wanna go!


8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,620
I'm sorry. I can't bring you kids this time.


9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,700
Eh? Why?


10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,340
That's unfair!


11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,420
-Come on, guys. Don't be so wilful!
-I wanna go!


12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,390
Look, dad is troubled, okay?


13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,770
Fine.


14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,860
Get along with your siblings, okay?


15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,940
Dad, good luck with your job!


16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,240
Well then, I'll get going.


17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,420
-Be safe on the way.
-Good luck!


18
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,490
My dear...


19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,330
I'm sorry. I'll leave the children to you.


20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,260
Let's go.


21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,420
If they'll attack me, will it
take place during my speech?


22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,750
I can't say for sure, but that's highly possible.


23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,000
It will be the only time that the leaders
of the Marleyan army are gathered in public.


24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,750
Or when the officers are on the move...


25
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,710
Usually, the route wouldn’t be confirmed
until right before departure for safety reasons.


26
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,500
Many important figures will take carriages.


27
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,330
Then the military leaders should
be in the VIP seats in the corner.


28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,460
Group them as close together as possible.


29
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,110
Are you sure about this?


30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,400
We Tybur family won’t just
sit around and enjoy ourselves,


31
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,640
not like our predecessors at least.


32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,229
We've built friendly relationship with
the influential people around the world


33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,560
to improve the social standing of the Eldian,


34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,530
and we also kept an eye
on the movements on Paradis island.


35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,020
However, we failed in
protecting our own backyard.


36
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,250
By the time we noticed, our enemies
had crossed the sea


37
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,650
and set foot in our home.


38
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,430
And now, they could kill us at any time.


39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,080
What we must be wary of are those who secretly
work with the Paradis island forces.


40
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,810
But we still don't know who they are.


41
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,870
As you know, our country
Marley has too many enemies,


42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,390
which include the ones inside the army.


43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,860
If it's to smoke out the enemies,


44
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm prepared to light a fire on my ass.


45
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,700
I'll accept the enemy's plan of attack


46
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,760
and use it to our advantage.


47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,200
If you have any other idea, just say it.


48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,900
If you don't, we will go as planned.


49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,430
Even though it's to fish up our enemies,
the bait for it is too big.


50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,990
Just give them as many useless
officers as they want.


51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,630
If their objective is to deal a blow
at the Marleyan army,


52
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,690
there's no better opportunity.


53
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,460
Your plan of rebuilding the military will go smoothly.
The party is ready to approve whoever you choose.


54
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,880
However, a lot will die.


55
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,540
But most of them will be the Eldian,


56
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,350
the descendants of the devils!


57
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,600
Isn't it a bit too late for that,
Commander Magath?


58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,500
You have thrown countless Eldians
In front of the enemy's machine gun
and straight into the minefields.


59
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,800
With or without military uniform on,
they're all the same.


60
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,780
You just need to keep doing
what you've been doing.


61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,280
Let me make it clear.


62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,670
This is not a war.


63
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,860
We still don't know our enemies,
their goal or means of attack.


64
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,520
We will be surrounded by crowds.


65
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,600
Lord Tybur, I’m afraid I won't
be able to protect you.


66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,470
You will die at this rate.


67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,000
Using you as a bait is way too risky.


68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,970
I know. I’ve prepped myself for that.


69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,330
The world won't take it seriously
unless I stand in front of them.


70
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,440
It will be the only time that the military,
journalists, and diplomats are in one place.


71
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,170
Furthermore,


72
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,510
the Eldian in Liberio internment zone,
including myself,


73
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,720
must become the tragic victims


74
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,610
of a "surprise attack."


75
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,640
The world wouldn’t be on our side


76
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,560
if I were the only one who survived.


77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,590
It's certain that the Eldian are
the descendants of the devils.


78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,960
And we...


79
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,590
are devils indeed.

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,010

(#65 War Hammer Titan)


91
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,130
Wake up, Gabi, Udo!


92
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,640
Stand up! Hurry!


93
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,350
...Zofia?


94
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,340
- Zofia, are you okay?!
- No, Udo!


95
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,140
- Zofia!
- Udo! Over here…!


96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,690
We must hurry and get this off of her…


97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,800
Udo!


98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,370
Brother...


99
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,030
You have fulfilled your duty...


100
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,080
...as a Tybur.


101
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,040
Commander Magath!


102
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,130
The War Hammer Titan will lose!


103
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
Commander, we can't find the Warriors!


104
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,830
General Calvi and the rest of
the command have been wiped out!


105
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,190
We should evacuate the VIPs first!


106
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,920
-It's too dangerous for us to stay here!
-Please give us your order!


107
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,920
Commander!


108
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,090
Commander...?


109
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,440
It was just a small pop,


110
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,030
but the first shot of our counterattack
has been fired.


111
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,620
I’ve never thought they would
make such a grand entrance.


112
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,450
And judging from its look,


113
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,950
it could be Eren Yeager himself, the usurper
of the Founding Titan, the Attack Titan.


114
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,420
It saves us the trouble of
going to the island.


115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,350
All men, to your station!
Prepare for battle!


116
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes, sir!


117
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,290
Hey, hey, what's going on?


118
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,520
What are you doing?!
Hurry up and run…


119
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,940
You all had better keep it in mind


120
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,980
that it's me who made the first shot.


121
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,450
Dammit! Why?


122
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,170
Why a war all of a sudden?!


123
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,930
Colt, how's Udo doing?


124
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,140
Anyway, we must bring him
to the hospital immediately.


125
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,660
Udo... no way!


126
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,830
Dammit!


127
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,720
Falco! Where are you?!


128
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,540
Just what is happening outside?!


129
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,190
This rumbling...


130
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,660
It sounds like a fight between Titans.


131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,600
There's no way!


132
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,660
That explains why we're confined here.


133
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,700
We must get out of here fast.


134
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,010
But how…?


135
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,720
What the heck is this?


136
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,180
You're late!


137
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,990
Ms. Pieck,


138
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,080
are you okay?!


139
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,630
Hurry up and bring us some rope!


140
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,610
Yes, ma'am!


141
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,220
The Panzer unit?


142
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,490
How did they know we are here?


143
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,530
That beard guy was suspicious,
so I gave them a heads-up.


144
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,570
So that's why!


145
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,370
That soldier is suspicious. Tail us later.


146
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,140
A Titan attacked the plaza
during the speech!


147
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,900
What?!


148
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,880
The War Hammer Titan seems
to be fighting it right now.


149
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,490
What about the Cart's armor?


150
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,320
It's at the HQ. It can be equipped
in fifteen minutes!


151
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,310
Do it in ten!


152
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Roger!


153
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm going ahead.


154
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,580
Wait, Porco.


155
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,050
You should wait and see if the situation…


156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,870
What was that?!


157
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,590
No way... how could that...?


158
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,970
We did it!


159
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,650
It's working!


160
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,620
The Anti-Titan Artillery does pack
a powerful punch!


161
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,720
-Load it now!
-Commander Magath,


162
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,880
let's take down Eren Yeager right away!


163
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,600
If we can take him down here,
the enemy's force is done for!


164
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,430
No!


165
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,090
Killing the Founder won’t solve the problems
but will only make them worse.


166
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,230
We must have the War Hammer
eat him no matter what!


167
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,160
We must focus only on assisting it!


168
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,400
B-But, Commander!


169
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,310
The War Hammer doesn’t seem
to be interested in eating the Founding.


170
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,810
How powerful!


171
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,440
The attacking means nothing to it!


172
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,210
It's War Hammer's victory!


173
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,860
So that's him... Eren Yeager!


174
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,390
It's really planning to kill him.


175
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,540
Usurper... Eren Yeager.


176
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,700
Do you have any last word?


177
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,460
Now, Mikasa.


178
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,670
You are all here!


179
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,730
Eren, I beg you...


180
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,920
Come home.


181
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,330
Our chain of command has been broken.


182
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,120
It's time to show the true
strength of the Marleyan army!


183
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,080
Cancel the special vigilance training.
Bring the entire army down the mountain.


184
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,220
Same goes to the fleet off-shore.


185
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,640
Get our thirty thousand soldiers stationed in
the east and west and gather them here.


186
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,090
Seal off the internment zone!


187
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,750
Don't let a single one of those island
devils get away, including the Founding.


188
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,880
Run amok while you can.


189
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,000
This is the end for you guys.


190
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,600
In this massacre,


191
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,670
every major nation that lost government
officials here is now part of this war.


192
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,920
Just as Willy Tybur had planned.


193
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,700
The whole world now knows
the threat of the Eldian Empire.


194
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,700
The world won't let you live anymore.


195
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,550
But still, they should've known
about that already.


196
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,340
In which case...


197
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,340
You damned the devils!


198
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,180
Shoot them down!


199
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,970
Those guys...


200
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,620
Are you trying to burn this whole
internment zone down?!


201
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,060
Keep the civilian losses to minimum!


202
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,640
Do you understand, Floch?!


203
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,700
There are only enemies
and the buildings they live in.


204
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,070
Have you forgotten how many human beings
inside the wall have been killed
by these bastards outside?


205
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,820
They ate us alive!


206
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,090
This isn't even close to a payback!


207
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,990
You're still saying that?


208
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,770
Look.


209
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,570
Eren showed us.


210
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,000
He told us to fight.


211
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,800
We can't just wait inside
the wall for them to kill us.


212
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,470
We need that devil!


213
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,220
Eren... Do you understand what you've done?


214
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,110
You killed civilians.


215
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,850
You also killed children.


216
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,350
There's no undoing this...


217
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,690
Mikasa, it's not over yet.


218
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,700
It can't be! I completely blew away its nape!


219
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,210
I even made sure to crush its nape.


220
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,950
But it’s not dead yet.


221
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,200
I see...


222
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,550
The War Hammer Titan...


223
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,480
So it's able to make anything with
high dexterity with hardening?


224
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,360
I get it now.


225
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,210
No wonder it's still alive no matter
how many times I’ve crushed its nape.


226
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,690
Mikasa, grab her attention for me.


227
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,350
If it goes well, I can eat
the War Hammer Titan.


228
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,010
Can't do. There’s no bed available,


229
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,770
and that kid is already dead.


230
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,230
Come on, please take a close look!


231
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,990
You should take a close look at the situation!


232
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,480
You're a warrior candidate, aren't you?


233
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,950
Doctor, come here please!


234
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,589
Okay, I’ll be right there!


235
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,410
Gabi. You should stay with your family.


236
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,849
There's no telling where's safe right now.


237
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,450
Get away from the plaza as far as possible.


238
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,810
I'll go back and look for Falco.


239
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,930
I will go, too.


240
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,950
I still don't understand why
Udo and Zofia must get killed.


241
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,990
Wait, Gabi! Don't go!


242
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Stop!


243
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,670
It's war zone over here!


244
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,520
Gabi!


245
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,410
What are you doing over here?


246
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,620
Mister gate guard...


247
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,030
I'll join the fight, so let me through.


248
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,770
Don't be stupid, you brat!


249
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,400
You should go home and…


250
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,620
What?


251
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,530
Is it enemy's attack?


252
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,490
From where?!


253
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,690
Above us!


254
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,650
Dammit!


255
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,260
Gabi, run…


256
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,020
Hey, are you oka-


257
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,580
Mister...


258
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,110
We've blocked this street.


259
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,320
Let's go, Sasha.


260
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,250
Connie, have you forgotten
to light up the lamp?


261
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,820
Oh, that's right.


262
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,070
Jean, the enemy’s reinforcement
won't get here so soon.


263
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,750
How about the lights?


264
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,400
All in place.


265
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,250
Is the plan going well?


266
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,110
For now, it is.


267
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,320
As long as we can take that thing
down in time…


268
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,680
But there’s no guarantee.
Anything could happen at this moment.


269
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,490
Just what lies after this fight...


270
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,350
We must survive to discern that.


271
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,000
Now I know what's been bothering me.


272
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,560
The weird feeling I had the moment
the War Hammer Titan appeared.


273
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,430
Its body was materialized from its feet up.


274
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,090
Not from its nape...


275
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,440
It appeared from the centre of the stage.


276
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,740
The War Hammer's body...


277
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,610
Oh, no!


278
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,210
The War Hammer Titan will get eaten!


279
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,590
I've been waiting for this moment!


280
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,770
I'll retake the Founding!


281
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,210
Eren!


282
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,440
What?!


283
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,850
I can't bite him through!


284
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,300
He did that?!


285
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,620
Could he be... the Ackerman?!


286
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,520
Don’t stay here!


287
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,730
No way...!


288
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,270
I'm a Titan!


289
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,160
And these human beings are trying to kill me?


290
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,480
So these are...


291
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,820
the devils of Paradis island!

293
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:35,870

303

The Warriors fight the soldiers who freely jump around


304
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,050
the space.


305
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,230
Will Reiner be able to hear Gabi and Falco's call?
