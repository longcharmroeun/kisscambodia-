2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,800
I keep having the same dream,


3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,210
dreaming of the old man who
hanged himself in that settlement.


4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,030
I’ve been wondering why he told us that story


5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,140
before he hung himself.


6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,850
How are we supposed to know that?


7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,240
Maybe he wanted someone to forgive him.


8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,200
Yet he definitely wouldn’t hear it from us.


9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,520
We ran and left Marcel to die, after all.


10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,180
For whatever reason, I think


11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,630
that old man must have wanted…


12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,210
someone to judge him.


13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,220
Hey. It has been four years, hasn’t it? Reiner.


14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,550
Well… Ermm…


15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,940
I heard you two are old friends...


16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,640
Isn't that so, Mr. Kruger?


17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,860
Yeah. We got a lot of things to talk about.


18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm not sure from where we should start.


19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,410
It's impossible…

come all the way here to encourage me?

I hope we're not bothering you.


39
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,760
I just wanted to see you.

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,610

No. You are a brave person.

I wish you luck.


45
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,170
Much appreciated, Ms. Kiyomi.


46
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,490
Sit, Reiner.


47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,000
This is a good seat, don't you think?


48
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,100
You can clearly hear the noise 
of the stage from here.


49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,150
Above us is a regular apartment building.


50
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,350
It's right in the back of the stage,


51
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,520
but many residents can’t wait for
the curtain to be raised.


52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,670
It's right above us.


53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,490
Huh? Mr. Kruger…Did you hurt your hand?


54
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,220
Yeah, it's just a scratch.


55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,600
Reiner, c'mon, sit.


56
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,760
Well, I'll go back first.


57
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,060
No, Falco.


58
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,440
You should stay and listen to our conversation.


59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,900
Falco. Do as he said.


60
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,409
Yes.


61
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,090
Well then, we should go now.


62
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,590
Oh, long time no see. Mr. Leonhart.


63
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,670
Mrs. Braun.


64
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,670
Last we met was when your
son returned, wasn't it?


65
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,590
Come to think of it, Mr. Hoover has
already passed away, huh?


66
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,570
Yeah…He was always pound
of his son’s dedication to Marley.


67
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,340
I'm sure your daughter also...


68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,660
She's not dead.


69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,490
Annie is alive.


70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,760
She promised me she would return home.


71
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,430
Who would have thought we would make
declaration of war in this interment zone…


72
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,070
So amazing! Even General Calvi is here.


73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,610
To think that the core officers
of Marleyan army would all be in here.


74
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,000
There are also countless foreign
ambassadors and nobles.


75
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,620
And reporters from every major
newspaper in the world, I guess?


76
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,920
It feels like being at
the center of the world.


77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,090
The Tybur family's influence
sure is amazing,


78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,630
even though they're Eldian like us...


79
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,570
It's starting.


80
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,320
Are Falco and Mr. Braun not here yet?


81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,830
Warriors of Marley,


82
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,450
Commander Magath has summoned you.


83
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,330
Eren…


84
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,620
How did you get here?
What are you here for?


85
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,340
Same as you.


86
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,730
Can't you tell?


87
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,740
I'm just like you.


88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
It's out of our control.


89
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,930
Looks like it's starting.


90
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,409
Let's listen to it.


91
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,170
I have a story to tell you.


92
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,350
About a hundred years ago…


93
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,950
The Eldian Empire ruled the world
with their Titan power.


94
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,310
From the rise of the Founder Ymir
to this day,


95
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,640
it is said that the lives that were
taken by the titans


96
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,150
tripled the amount of humanity remained today.


97
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,760
Outrageous number of races,
along with their culture and history,


98
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,470
were destroyed by the Titans.


99
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,630
These slaughters are part of
the history of humanity…


100
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,970
It’s the path that the Eldian Empire took.


101
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,610
Then, the all-conquering Eldian Empire


102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,659
engaged in a war among themselves.


103
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,580
It was the start of the Great Titan War.


104
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,260
The families who held the Eight Titans
shed each other's blood.


105
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,010
However, there was a Marleyan
who saw a chance in this chaos.


106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,860
He was none other than the hero Helos.


107
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,670
He cleverly led the Eldian Empire


108
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,010
to its self-destruction with intelligence manipulation.


109
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,840
He then joined hands with the Tybur family,


110
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,750
and successfully made King Fritz, who is said
to be unbeatable, to retreat to the island.


111
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,560
However, the king who retreated to
Paradis island is still in hand of his power.


112
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,220
Tens of millions of Titans with the power
of crushing the world are waiting on that island.


113
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,450
It's only by pure chance that our world


114
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,200
continued to exist to this moment.


115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,470
That's the only explanation
our Titan scholar could provide.


116
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,120
Our motherland Marley has sent out


117
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,980
four Titans to eliminate that threat.


118
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,120
However, they were beaten back and the only
one to return was the Armored Titan.


119
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,510
That means the darkest bolt of human history,


120
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,360
the Eldian Empire, is still alive and well.


121
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,190
Did you hear that, Reiner?


122
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,310
That’s the reason you guys
breached the wall.


123
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,050
You guys were trying to save the world,


124
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,090
weren’t you?


125
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,350
Yeager, go to the front gate.


126
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,790
Okay.


127
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,690
You two, follow me.


128
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,930
I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.


129
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,770
What unit you belong to?


130
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,650
I'm from the base in the west, Lakua.


131
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,630
I was called here to help
with the security.


132
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,260
I have no interest in chit-chatting
with an Eldian.


133
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,860
Well, that's a shame. I found
your beard to be charming.


134
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,970
Ms. Pieck!


135
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,820
The Panzer unit!


136
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,630
Thank you for working
so hard even on a day like this!


137
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,730
Well... same to you, Ms. Pieck.


138
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,720
You look quite happy today...


139
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,570
What are you doing? Let's go.


140
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,220
What was that about?


141
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,510
Well, as the Cart Titan, their fate
and mine are one and the same.


142
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,260
So our bond is important.


143
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,230
Well, it looks like what you did might
cause more damage than help.


144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,310
Find anything suspicious?


145
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,740
No report as of now.


146
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,820
Look at the even smallest detail.


147
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,240
Have them report on anything they found.


148
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,670
Roger.


149
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,290
It's here. Get in.


150
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,640
Where's Commander Magath--


151
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,260
Porco!


152
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,970
What is going on?


153
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,270
Why Deputy Chief Braun looks so frightened?


154
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,530
Mr. Kruger is his old friend, right?


155
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,750
Old friend?


156
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,370
Wait, then, when did they first meet?


157
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,750
If it was over four years ago,


158
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,900
then they must've met on Paradis island...


159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,700
No… it can't be…


160
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,450
Because… that means…


161
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,560
It's impossible…


162
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,540
Could it be…?!


163
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,900
[The available intelligence for now]
[Paradis island  The war of retrieving the Founding Titan]
[Took place in 854, a military operation led by Commander Theo Magath]
[Marcel Galliard, Reiner Braun, Bertolt Hoover and Annie Leonhart were selected from the troop and formed a four-member Warrior team,]
[Who hid on Paradis island, aiming to retrieve the Founding Titan and bring him back to Marley.]
[Five years after the war began, of the four Warriors, two were captured by the enemy and one died.]
[Reiner Braun was the only one who survived. He even brought back a captive who inherited the Jaw Titan.]


164
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,170
Well then, the things I talked about so far
are facts that everyone knows.


165
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,130
However, the truth is slightly different.


166
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,660
What I will tell you now is the memory


167
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,780
that was passed down to us
through the War Hammer Titan.


168
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,410
Today, I will publicly reveal that truth
for the first time ever.


169
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,710
About a hundred years ago…


170
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,880
The one to end the Great Titan War was
neither Helos nor the Tybur family.


171
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,800
The one who put an end to that war
and saved the world was King Fritz himself.


172
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,700
He lamented the cruel history
of the Eldian Empire.


173
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,850
He grew tired of the war
between his people.


174
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,960
And most of all, his heart ached for
Marley that was under constant tyranny.


175
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,340
When he inherited the Founding Titan,


176
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,400
he made a plan with the Tybur family.


177
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,040
They then made a man to play
the figure of a Marleyan hero.


178
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,950
That man was Helos,


179
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,320
who moved as many Eldian citizens as he could
to the island and sheltered them inside the gate.


180
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,470
And then he left a message that whoever
dared to threaten his peace would be attacked
by thousands of Titans.


181
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,840
However, it was not the end of the story.


182
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,610
In order to pass down his own philosophy,


183
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,040
King Fritz made a vow of renouncing war.


184
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,040
With this, Karl Fritz's philosophy was
passed down to his successors,


185
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
thus, ensuring the Titans from the island
won't attack the rest of the world.


186
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,270
Therefore, the one who actually saved the world


187
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,040
was the King of the Wall whom we hate.


188
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,370
It was thanks to Karl Fritz
and his desire for peace.


189
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,540
His goal was to make peace.


190
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,460
"If one day Marley grows stronger


191
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,530
and takes the lives of the royal family
or its Founding Titan,


192
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,340
I will accept it."


193
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,660
"That is how grave the crimes of us Eldians,


194
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,870
and how they could not be atoned for."


195
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,440
"However, until the day
that retribution comes,


196
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,240
I want to enjoy this brief moment of paradise


197
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,520
without conflict within the walls."


198
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,780
"Please, I ask you to grant
this wish of mine".


199
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,970
Those were the king's final words.


200
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,790
What does that mean?


201
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,950
If what he said is true…


202
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,030
The story about Marley and Tybur family


203
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,920
saved the world was all made up by King Fritz?


204
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,750
If the King of the Wall really have
no desire to invade the world,


205
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,120
then why would people say
Paradis is a threat?


206
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,430
Yes,


207
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,750
we Tybur family, in order to
ensure the prosperity of our family,


208
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,670
joined hands with Karl Fritz


209
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,150
and sold Eldia to Marley.


210
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,180
We Tybur family were nothing but filthy
thieves who were living off falsehood.


211
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,840
However, I am not standing here just


212
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,510
to put an end to this falsehood.


213
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm here because it had come to my
knowledge that this world is in danger.


214
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,400
Commander!


215
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,280
The Warriors and the soldiers
we sent to bring them back are gone.


216
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,970
Mobilize the reserve and search for them!


217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,730
Roger!


218
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,670
So it has begun…


219
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,990
That hurts, dammit!


220
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,330
What the heck is this?


221
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,640
Must be a trap to lock us Warriors.


222
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
It's old-fashioned,


223
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,910
but we can't transform in a cramped place like this.


224
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,760
And there are two of us...


225
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,470
Yeah, we might get crushed to death.


226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,270
What was that tall soldier up to?


227
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,460
I don't know.


228
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,330
But I feel like I've seen that soldier somewhere…


229
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,100
Please, stand there and watch.


230
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,390
This is my way of taking responsibility.


231
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,430
Karl Fritz used the power of the Founding Titan


232
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,710
to give birth to three layers of walls.


233
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,490
These walls are made of about
tens of millions of Colossal Titans.


234
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,320
It serves as both his shields and spears,


235
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,210
all to maintain peace.


236
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,340
However, in recent years, a rebellion
has occurred within Paradis island.


237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,490
King Fritz's pacifist ideology
has been rooted out,


238
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,260
and the Founder Titan has
been stolen by someone.


239
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,240
The world is in danger once more.


240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,770
This someone has rebelled against peace…


241
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,750
is named…Eren Yeager!


242
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,210
You lied to me…


243
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
I… respected you…


244
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,260
Yet you’ve been lying to me this whole time…!


245
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm sorry, Falco.


246
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,060
You saved me a lot.


247
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,900
Those letters…


248
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,190
Those letters you asked me to send for you were...?


249
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,340
They weren’t for my family.


250
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,510
They were sent to my ally.


251
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,880
It can't be… no way…!


252
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,690
Your ally...?!


253
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,280
The threat of Paradis island


254
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,660
is an attack by this army of Colossal Titan,


255
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,080
the Rumbling.


256
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,260
As I explained earlier,


257
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,890
those of royal blood won't use
the power of the Founding Titan
because of the vow of renouncing war.


258
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,130
However, Eren Yeager currently
possesses the Founding Titan.


259
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,970
It is thus possible for him
to start the Rumbling.


260
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,780
Once the Rumbling begins, there's
nothing we can do about it.


261
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,710
Humanity could only


262
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,900
tremble and run in fear of the footsteps


263
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,390
of doom.


264
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,900
These Titans will crush our cities, societies,


265
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,060
and literally flatten the world.


266
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,170
He's right.


267
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm a bad guy, just like what Willy Tybur said.


268
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,050
I might destroy the world.


269
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,670
However, you guys looked like bad people to me, too!


270
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,990
That day, the wall was breached,


271
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,180
my homeland got trampled by the Titans,


272
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,880
and my mom was eaten in front of me.


273
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,310
I just couldn't understand.


274
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,270
Why is that, Reiner?


275
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,920
Why my mom had to be
eaten by a Titan that day?


276
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,720
It's… because… we breached
the wall that day.


277
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,130
Why did you breach the wall?


278
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,980
To use the chaos to sneak into the wall


279
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,860
and see how the King of the Wall would respond.


280
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,120
What was your goal?


281
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,100
To retrieve the Founder and save the world.


282
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,610
I see…


283
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,520
If it was to save the world…


284
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,280
I guess you didn't have a choice.


285
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,620
You used to say it, didn't you?


286
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,020
You said you would do whatever you can
to see us suffer the worst death.


287
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,360
You came here to do that, right?


288
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,080
Ah, did I really say that?


289
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,230
Please forget it.


290
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,930
It's true that I once saw everyone
on the other side of the sea as enemy.


291
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,170
Then I crossed the sea and arrived here.


292
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,310
I slept under my enemies' roof


293
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,260
and ate the same food as they did.


294
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm Just like you, Reiner.


295
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,580
Sure, there are some people who pissed me off.
But there are good people, too.


296
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,490
Be it on the other side of the sea


297
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,270
or inside the wall,


298
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,020
it's the same.


299
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,850
However, you all were taught that
the people inside the wall were devils.


300
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,230
A bunch of clueless, ignorant children were
taught that since birth.


301
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,900
But what could you've done?
Back then you were just kids.


302
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,380
Hey, Reiner…You've suffered a lot, haven’t you?


303
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,470
No! It's not true, Eren!


304
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,130
That day,


305
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:50,070
when Marcel was eaten…Annie and Bertolt wanted
to cancel the mission and go home…


306
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,960
But I convinced them to continue the mission…


307
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,520
I wanted to be a hero!


308
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,150
I wanted to be respected.


309
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,130
It's all my fault.


310
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,210
It is my fault that your mother got eaten by a Titan!


311
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,300
I hated my blood.


312
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,030
I wished for the extinction of all Eldians
more than anyone else.


313
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,980
I can't take this anymore…


314
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,320
Please kill me…!


315
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,840
However, I don't want to die.


316
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,560
Because I’ve already been born in this world.


317
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,000
We may belong to different
nations and races.


318
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,850
However, now it’s the time for us to
join forces and face this powerful enemy together.


319
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,270
I want you,


320
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,550
who do not wish to die, to lend me your strength.


321
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,370
I beg you, to ensure our future together!


322
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,530
If we work together,


323
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,480
we should be able to overcome anything!


324
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,130
As I thought, I'm the same as you.


325
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:15,100
I wish you to join me in our fight!
A fight to defeat the devils on Paradis island!


326
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,480
I think we were like this from
the moment we were born.


327
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,730
I, Willy Tybur,


328
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,570
as the ambassador of Marleyan government, hereby proclaim...


329
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,220
I will continue to move forward,


330
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,300
until I exterminate all my enemy.


331
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,860
To the enemy force on Paradis island,
this is a declaration of war!

344
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,870
The Attack Titan appeared from nowhere.


345
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,930
Along with the echo of his roar,
the innocents were trampled mercilessly.


346
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,110
It was then, the War Hammer was swung.
