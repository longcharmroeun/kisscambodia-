4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,022
Kim Yeong-nim went missing
while the campaign was still ongoing.

5
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:24,717
I don't think what happened

6
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,286
<i>seven years ago is over yet.</i>

7
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,106
If the reservoir gets exposed,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,614
<i>you can forget the third ICT redevelopment
and his presidency.</i>

9
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:32,919
What's the reservoir?

10
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,726
Is that where Kim's body is?

11
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:37,215
I saw "reservoir" in my dad's notebook.

12
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:39,619
<i>Who's Kim Yeong-nim?</i>

13
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,489
<i>Jeong-yeong made a request to the NFS.</i>

14
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:44,302
Ji Cheong-sin the serial murderer.

15
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:45,841
<i>Have them blow this up.</i>

16
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,982
<i>The more people get scared, the better.</i>

17
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,536
<i>He must be caught ASAP.</i>

18
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,528
Hey, who are you?

19
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:54,315
Three, seven...

20
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,503
<i>Mo-tak, I think I've figured out
where the reservoir is.</i>

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,220
<i>I think Jungjin Dam is over there.</i>

22
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,810
<i>Jungjin Dam? That means
this garbage water is flowing</i>

23
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:03,807
into the city's water supply.

24
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,602
<i>We got a call from someone who spotted Ji</i>

25
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,617
<i>at 9 Jinseon-ro,</i>
<i>over by Sangjin Electronics.</i>

26
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,501

27
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,217

28

Dad.

29
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,974
Wait just a bit longer.

30
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,476
I'll catch that bastard

31
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,188
and hold a better ceremony for you
next year.

32
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,067

EPISODE 9

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,632
The report on Jinseon-ro 9-gil was
a false alarm.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,676
WANTED: SUSPECT

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,428
The caller must've been confused.

38
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,183
Let's conduct a search before we go.

39
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,644
All right. I'll head over there.

40
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:15,728
Okay.

41
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:28,092
Mun, what's going on?

42
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,552
<i>Why are you so agitated?</i>

43
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,054
I saw Ji Cheong-sin around my house.

44
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:38,018
Are your teammates with you?

45
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,103
No.

46
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,064
We may never catch Ji Cheong-sin
if we lose him this time.

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,659
<i>Mun.</i>

48
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,579
Mun, you can't do this alone.

49
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:58,831
<i>Lure him to a desolate place,</i>

50
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,083
<i>and join your team.</i>

51
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,334
Mun!

52
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,086
<i>Mun!</i>

53
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,088
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

54
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:07,673
<i>Mun!</i>

55
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,735
Mun.

56
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,737
Mun!

57
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,750
<i>It's okay.</i>

58
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,835
<i>My territory is flowing here.</i>

59
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,670
Looking for me?

60
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,960
You're running away already?

61
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:31,632
Or is this another one of your tricks?

62
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,717
<i>Come into my territory.</i>

63
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,761
<i>I'll put an end to this.</i>

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,016
Your parents tasted delightful
when I chewed on them.

65
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:50,317
<i>Good, he's inside.</i>

66
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,169
<i>This asshole suddenly got more powerful.</i>

67
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,193
Mun.

68
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,205
What now?

69
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,333
Say it again.

70
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,878
What did you do to my parents?
You disgusting bastard!

71
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:56,759
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen!

72
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,847
Do something.

73
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:04,433
Contact the Counters

74
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,103
and tell them to go find Mun.

75
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,191
Mo-tak! Where are you right now?

76
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:13,651
Where are you?

EONNI'S NOODLES

78
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,422
This is it.

79
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,342
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

80
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,221
Hazy like smoke.

81
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,723
It feels like a cold fog.

82
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,091
Time to go meet your parents.

83
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,016
<i>It's coming.</i>

84
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,276
You rascal.

85
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:04,970
Stand back.

86
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,891
Mun.

87
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:51,975
-Mun.
-Mun!

88
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,353
Mun.

89
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,569
Mun.

90
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,781
Ha-na.

91
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:07,574
Yes, you'll be okay.

92
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:08,784
Hang in there, Mun.

93
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,743
I'll heal you.

94
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:16,125
Mun.

95
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,045
He has a severed artery,
and his bones are crushed.

96
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,297
I'll call for an ambulance.

97
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,508
No human being can fix him.

98
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,010
This territory isn't strong enough.

99
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,888
-Go find a stronger territory, Ha-na.
-Okay.

100
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:38,480
There's a huge territory at the park.

101
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,232
Mun.

102
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,402
Please hang in there, Mun.

103
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,377
What's wrong?

104
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,546
Are you in pain?

105
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:11,889
Can you do this?

106
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,268
It won't be easy to heal
something this bad.

107
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,187
I'll do it even if I have to risk my life.

108
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,271
Don't worry.

109
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:20,355
I'll heal him.

110
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:45,297
<i>Mommy's hands are healing hands</i>

111
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,343
<i>Mun's bones are tough and strong</i>

112
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,388
<i>Mommy's hands are healing hands</i>

113
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,934
<i>Mun, you'll be fine</i>

114
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,378
<i>Mommy's hands are healing hands</i>

115
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,589

00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,576
Ms. Chu.

122
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,037
Ms. Chu!

123
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:01,999
Ms. Chu.

124
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,834
Ms. Chu.

125
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:06,628
Are you okay?

00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,041
You must be surprised.

129
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:50,630
We must erase the memories

130
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,801
of anyone who finds out our identities.

131
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,597
But I won't do that to you.

132
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,642
You erase their memories?

133
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,395
Ji Cheong-sin

134
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,940
isn't someone the police can arrest.

135
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,194
You saw how he took your gun.

136
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,033
What…

137
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:20,160
happened back there?

138
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:23,121
Psychokinesis.

139
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:24,414
Psychokinesis?

140
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,340
Where am I supposed to start?

141
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,634
Your gun flew out of your hands.

142
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,761
That means he isn't ordinary.

143
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,555
And we aren't ordinary people either.

144
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,475
We were sent by beings up there

145
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,811
to catch evil spirits.

146
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:47,312
Do you know what those are?

147
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:48,814
Evil spirits?

148
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,941
Man, where do I begin?

149
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,902
Other people call us heroes.

150
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,238
But we aren't.
We just run this noodle place.

151
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,615
We need power to catch those evil spirits.

152
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,826
That's why Ms. Chu, Ha-na and I are here.

153
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,661
And Mun too. The four of us

154
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,122
are here to catch those spirits.

155
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,918
Do you see these dots?
One, two, three, four, five, six.

156
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:12,629
There's this place called Yung.

157
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,256
We're connected to that place.

158
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,799
Are you following?

159
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:19,010
That's enough.

160
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:20,512
Damn it.

161
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,473
You have to believe me.

162
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,934
What kind of nonsense was that?

163
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,880
Are you okay?

164
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,548
Yes.

165
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:01,136
You must've lost at least a year
of your life trying to heal him.

166
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,221
I'm fine.

167
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:06,683
It's more than worth it to give it up
for a young kid.

168
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:20,739
GRANDPA

169
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:21,990
It's well over 11 p.m.

170
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:23,909
He must be worried. What should we do?

171
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:28,830
GRANDPA

172
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,334

174
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,213
Girlfriend…

175
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,673
Yes, we've met before. My name is Ha-na.

176
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,926
Are you with him right now?

177
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:44,054
He went out to get <i>bungeoppang</i>
and hasn't come back,

178
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,764
and now it's 11 o'clock.

179
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,516
<i>Bungeoppang?</i>

180
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,227
Can you put him on the phone?

186
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,708
<i>to communicate with his supporters</i>
<i>and the citizens.</i>

187
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:17,212
<i>Following rumors of Shin</i>
<i>joining the presidential race,</i>

188
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:20,298
<i>Mayor Shin's supporters</i>
<i>are showing their support.</i>

189
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,344
<i>Though Shin hasn't formally announced</i>
<i>his candidacy,</i>

190
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:26,846
<i>the winds of change are blowing</i>
<i>in the political realm.</i>

191
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,183
<i>With innovation as his motto,</i>
<i>he brought many changes to Jungjin</i>

192
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:32,686
<i>as soon as he was elected,</i>

193
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,896
<i>and he was also successfully re-elected.</i>

194
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,815
<i>Thanks to his history,</i>

195
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:40,443
<i>many of his supporters are giving</i>
<i>their fervent support for his candidacy.</i>

196
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,070
SHIN APPOINTED AS JUNGJIN'S MAYOR

197
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,489
Assholes!

198
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,951
Does he have any idea
who helped him make it that far?

199
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,746
Hey.

200
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,457
We can't be at the inauguration.

201
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,001
I mean,

202
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,837
you and I do all the dirty work
while they just sit around

203
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,463
and enjoy all the benefits!

204
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:05,176
Tae-sin gets a construction project
worth trillions,

205
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,805
and I'm supposed to be contented
with that random restaurant?

206
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:10,390
This is so damn annoying.

207
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,021
Hey.

208
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:22,777
Should we play this
at Shin Myeong-hwi's inauguration

209
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:24,404
and screw everyone over?

210
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:26,865
What is this?

211
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,830
<i>Once Mayor Shin declares his candidacy,</i>

212
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,167
<i>the primary race within his party</i>
<i>is expected to be fierce.</i>

213
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,003
<i>Oh Yeong-deok of the Reformers' Party</i>

214
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,755
<i>has already announced his candidacy.</i>

215
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:45,050
I can't get chased by the police
and end up with a hole in my head.

216
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,593
<i>Oh's values are…</i>

217
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,053
<i>What's your plan?</i>

218
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,600
My powers are nowhere near enough.

219
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:55,935
<i>We had a police officer,</i>

220
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,437
<i>but nothing really changed.</i>

221
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,730
I need to kill more.

222
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,273
Many more.

223
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:25,965
Mun, have you woken up?

224
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:27,801
Yes.

225
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,719
I'm up.

226
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:13,430
Hey, Mun. You're up?

227
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,682
Yes.

228
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,727
Try to move your hand.

229
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,398
It'll feel different from before.

230
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:24,441
How is it?

231
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:29,404
It's a bit stiff, but I'm fine.

232
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,993
Goodness, what a relief.

233
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:45,837
Mun.

234
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,299
You should never fight them alone.

235
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,760
Not only can you not win
against them by yourself,

236
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,595
you also can't summon them.

237
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:55,972
Your mind will be in Yung

238
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,808
while the spirit is being summoned,
so it's dangerous.

239
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,812
I'm sorry.

240
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:11,654
You must be in a hurry.

241
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,573
I'm sure you are.

242
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,159
You're in a hurry

243
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,287
to find your parents
before they dissipate.

244
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:21,539
Of course, you are.

245
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,504
Goodness, stop looking at me
with those sad puppy eyes.

246
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:29,798
Ms. Chu.

247
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:35,970
Your hair turned all gray because of me.

248
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:38,973
Don't I look great?

249
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:48,775
Don't get hurt.

250
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,111
I'll die of a broken heart
before I die treating you.

251
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:13,842
<i>Who is it?</i>

252
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,386
Oh, hello.

253
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:26,813
Goodness.

254
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,732
Did you come by to drop off <i>bungeoppang?</i>

255
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,526
I thought you'd be worried.

256
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,112
They got into a fight.

257
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,154
A fight?

258
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,824
Mun went out to get <i>bungeoppang</i>,

259
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:39,284
then met with his girlfriend.

260
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,995
They got into a fight
while they were hanging out,

261
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,372
and that rascal ran off somewhere.

262
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:48,543
He'll be home soon.

263
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,044
Have you had dinner?

264
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:51,004
Pardon?

265
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,841
Here. Take these.

266
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,640
Eat up, Mun-yeong.

267
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,560
That's Mun's mom.

268
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:06,728
I see.

269
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,521
Okay.

270
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,125
The <i>jeon</i> is still warm.

271
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,585
I warmed it up again

272
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:32,170
for Mun to eat when he comes back.

273
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:34,797
I'm even happier
now that you've had a bite.

274
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,383
You should eat too.

275
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,384
All right.

276
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:45,391
You can eat this
after you finish your dinner.

277
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,226
Goodness, thank you.

278
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,187
You're so pretty.

279
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:53,441
You're prettier.

280
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:54,484
What?

281
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,988
I heard you and Mun have been together
for two months.

282
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:01,532
Goodness.

283
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:05,745
I guess… I'm sorry.

284
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,622
Drink some water.

285
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:08,790
Here.

286
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:16,589
It has been that long, I guess.

287
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:19,676
Yes, it's been that long already.

288
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:22,387
Goodness.

289
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:30,937
This is it.

290
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,815
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

291
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,234
Hazy like smoke.

292
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,236
It feels like a cold fog.

293
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,155
<i>That asshole</i>

294
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,951
<i>won't fall into Yung's territory</i>
<i>now that he knows.</i>

295
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:49,038
<i>I need to be able to bring it in myself.</i>

296
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,585
Hey. Our territory opened up.

297
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,048
<i>How did you just do that?</i>

298
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,216
Do what?

299
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,678
You touched and played with our territory.

300
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,471
Am I not supposed to do that?

301
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:07,932
It's not that we aren't allowed to,
we can't.

302
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,893
<i>Only I can touch the territory,</i>

303
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,229
<i>so I must do this.</i>

304
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:30,455
Mun…

305
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:34,584
That's more like it!

306
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,088
<i>I need to remember how it felt.</i>

307
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,591
<i>I can do this.</i>

308
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,972
-Ung-min!
-Don't fight.

309
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,934
I told you not to hurt my friends.

310
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:56,189
Is it that hard?

311
00:25:58,316 --> 00:25:59,192
<i>Sadness.</i>

312
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:00,651
<i>Fear.</i>

313
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,236
<i>Anger.</i>

314
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:17,752
How…

315
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:19,837
I felt like

316
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:22,757
I was going to explode with anger.

317
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,178
Why?

318
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:48,157
<i>Yes.</i>

319
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:52,036
Let's end this.

320
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,538
<i>Back then…</i>

321
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,093
<i>I wanted…</i>

322
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,348
I warned you that
you'd get it all back, twofold!

323
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,147
to kill that asshole.

324
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,744
What?

325
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:16,079
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

326
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,375
We have the results

327
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,335
of the unofficial poll held by our party.

328
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:23,294
Is that so?

329
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:24,712
PREFERRED CANDIDATE

330
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:27,423
"Has a reputation as an ethical
and innovative man

331
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:30,468
who knows the importance
of communicating with the people."

332
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:33,304
The four big polling organizations

333
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:36,224
would like to include you in the polls
starting this week.

334
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:37,350
What should I say?

335
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:38,393
Not yet.

336
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:43,273
If I do it after launching ICT Valley,

337
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:45,024
how will it affect the ratings?

338
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,610
It'll probably go up by two percent.

339
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:50,405
If you announce your candidacy
on the same day,

340
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:53,199
your lead over Oh will be
outside the margin of error,

341
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:56,703
and you'll climb up to first place.

342
00:28:58,746 --> 00:29:01,332
Draw up a draft
of the candidacy announcement.

343
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,417
Yes, sir.

345
00:29:16,514 --> 00:29:17,515
Good.

346
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,907
Yes, I got the results too.

347
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:36,576
When will you have Ji Cheong-sin?

348
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:38,369
We're doing our best.

349
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:40,371
I heard an officer died.

350
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,377
<i>Keep the reporters quiet</i>
<i>so the news doesn't get out.</i>

351
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:49,047
We can't have negative articles on Jungjin

352
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,133
until the day
of the ICT groundbreaking ceremony.

353
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:55,386
Will he announce his candidacy

354
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,430
on the day of the groundbreaking ceremony?

355
00:29:58,765 --> 00:29:59,932
Yes.

356
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:01,976

00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:22,205
I got something.

359
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:37,970
Stop the car!

360
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:42,350
Move aside unless you want to die!

361
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,395
Hey, stop the car.

362
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:48,022
-What's he doing?
-Die!

363
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,365
Turn off the engine

364
00:30:58,032 --> 00:30:58,991
and get out.

365
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:02,787
Damn it.

366
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,546
Go away. Step back!

367
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:13,631
Move aside!

368
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:20,346
Mo-tak, it smells like gasoline.

369
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,183
If you don't, I'll kill you.

370
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:32,900
I only see gasoline here too.

371
00:31:32,984 --> 00:31:34,902
I don't think it's a waste disposal truck.

372
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:37,780
Who are you?

373
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:41,200
Why are you here?

374
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:51,127
You came to set this place on fire?

375
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,128
Why?

376
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,796
Then someone will finally show up.

377
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:56,174
If the mountain is on fire,

378
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:58,342
police officers
or firefighters will come by.

379
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:01,220
Then the world will find out

380
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,389
that this is nothing
but a mountain of waste!

381
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:08,186
You assholes.

382
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,313
How can you work for people like them?

383
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,857
-Wait, I…
-The waste here is

384
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,484
killing a child.

385
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,237
And my brother died because of this waste!

386
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,992
These bastards
even killed a police officer!

387
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:24,911
What

388
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,455
do you mean, sir?

389
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:31,667
How do you know that?

390
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:40,718
I wish I had something better to offer.
You are Detective So's son after all.

391
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:41,928
Thank you.

392
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,307
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

393
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:50,728
So-eun was born sick,

394
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:53,481
so her dad was very interested
in environmental problems.

395
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:56,234
Then he found out
about the waste mountain,

396
00:32:56,818 --> 00:32:58,694
and he conducted
a thorough investigation on it.

397
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,906
He took this and reported it
to the city office, borough office,

398
00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:04,200
and the Ministry of Environment.

399
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,410
<i>No one investigated it</i>

400
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:07,954
<i>or even gave him a reply.</i>

401
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:08,955
I turned it in…

402
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:10,081
The only one

403
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:13,167
who took this case on
and looked into it was

404
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:17,463
Detective So Gwon.

405
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,133
If your father
had ignored Jin-seung's complaint

406
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:23,636
like everyone else did,

407
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:25,596
he wouldn't have died.

408
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:31,060
Jin-seung was convinced
that Detective So was killed.

409
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,855
He began to get blackmailed

410
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,481
and had tails on him too.

411
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:38,359
He almost got run over by a truck once.

412
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:39,318
BRING JUNGJIN BACK

413
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:41,445
THE CITY OF JUNGJIN IS
KILLING MY DAUGHTER!

414
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:42,530
But then

415
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,658
after Detective So died,

416
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,451
Jin-seung became afraid

417
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,746
that he'd get killed
and have to leave his baby behind.

418
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,914
It's scary.

419
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,208
So he turned a blind eye

420
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,751
and went on for many years.

421
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:57,920
But last year…

422
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:04,176
So-eun was diagnosed with lymphoma.

423
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,346
It drove him insane.

424
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,514
OUR FLIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER

425
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:18,316
Did all these people become sick

426
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,483
due to the waste?

427
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,152
If that wasn't the cause, how could

428
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,112
so many people in one area get sick?

429
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:26,574
People there drink groundwater
that comes down from the mountains.

430
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,242
So did So-eun.

431
00:34:28,326 --> 00:34:30,328
They're putting a tarp over the waste

432
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,204
to make a park.

433
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:33,581
An eco-friendly park.

434
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:34,832
Seriously…

435
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,418
Everything will be over
once it gets covered up.

436
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,921
It'll turn into a secret
and disappear from the world.

437
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:42,131
Can you imagine how frustrated I've been?

438
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:48,471
OUR FLIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER

439
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,399
Knock, knock.

440
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,443
May I come in?

441
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:09,825
Wow.

442
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,663
So-eun, you must like BTS.

443
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,831
I love them too.

444
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:19,126
Once you get better,
let's go to their concert.

445
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,253
Really?

446
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:22,797
Yes.

447
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,298
But

448
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:28,511
who are you?

449
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:31,472
Right.

450
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:34,308
Your dad

451
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,561
and my dad were friends.

452
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:39,063
Friends?

453
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:41,107
Yes.

454
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:43,359
Dad…

455
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:46,445
I miss him.

456
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:49,907
Me too.

457
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:54,996
So you need to stay strong
and get better soon, okay?

458
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,081
Promise me.

459
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:03,295
Good girl.

460
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:10,636
Mo-tak.

461
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,640
Can't Ms. Chu help So-eun?

462
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:17,184
She can't treat illnesses or disabilities.

463
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,853
But she fixed me.

464
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:23,065
You're a Counter, kid.

465
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:32,867
Hello?

466
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,244
<i>-Are you driving?</i>
-Yes.

467
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:39,081
The blood sample of the Kim Yeong-nim
murder suspect is gone.

468
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:42,168
What? How did that happen?

469
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,586
How is that possible?

470
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:44,879
It's the NFS!

471
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:46,922
Someone came by as soon as I turned it in,

472
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,549
canceled the request, and took it.

473
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:49,884
Who did?

474
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,260
<i>They said it was Mr. Pyo.</i>

475
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:53,345
I'm sure Chief Choi has it now.

476
00:36:54,263 --> 00:36:56,057
EONNI'S NOODLES

477
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:04,982
Damn it, those assholes!

478
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,610
Man, come on.

479
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:10,404
Don't destroy the place, Mo-tak.

480
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,032
I can't believe this.

481
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:16,494
People disappearing one after another,

482
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,162
and kids getting sick and dying.

483
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:20,915
Then they cover it up
by killing another person.

484
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,126
Shin Myeong-hwi and those jerks.

485
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,213
Yet people don't know that these things
are happening in Jungjin.

486
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:29,465
We'll expose it.

487
00:37:30,674 --> 00:37:31,675
How?

488
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,553
It can't be covered up.

489
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:38,766
The police are on their side.

490
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,734
Let's let everyone know, Mun.

491
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:50,194
Let's stir them up.

492
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:56,408
Let's pull down their underpants
in front of everyone.

493
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:59,120
What? Underpants?

494
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,622
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

495
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:49,128
All done.

496
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:55,551
SPECIAL TALK: SHIN MYEONG-HWI

497
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:01,432
SPECIAL TALK: SHIN MYEONG-HWI

498
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:04,435
My hair looks perfect for this role.

499
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:06,270
LEE JIN-OK

500
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:07,396
This photo is too old.

501
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:09,815
Who the heck is Jin-ok?

502
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:14,445
I've kept that photo with me
for seven long years.

503
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:16,780
Give me a new one, then.

504
00:39:16,864 --> 00:39:19,658
This isn't the time to be flirting.

505
00:39:19,742 --> 00:39:22,995
I knew something was up
between you and Ms. Chu, Chairman Choi.

506
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,122
You caught on.

507
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:28,459
Hey, Mun. So apparently, I asked you out.

508
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,798
Wait. How did you know?

509
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:37,384
So I did. Your grandfather told me.

510
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:40,554
Oh, because he kept asking me
all these questions about you,

511
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,932
I had to explain…
Oh, thanks for the <i>bungeoppang</i>.

512
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:44,058
Exactly. So why--

513
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:45,768
Wait, what's the <i>bungeoppang</i> about?

514
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,312
Why did I ask you out first in your story?

515
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:51,357
Then if I said I asked you out first,
is that all right?

516
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,483
What a load of nonsense.

517
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,486
Remember to use honorifics.

518
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:57,404
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:00,658
Ms. Jang.

520
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:03,786
I got Mayor Shin some coffee.

521
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,329
Take this.

522
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:06,372
Sure.

523
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,419
Anyway, will he announce his candidacy
on TV today?

524
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:14,380
Will he? Really?

525
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:15,881
Yes.

526
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:20,970
Number one, Noh Chang-gyu.

527
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:25,140
Man, it's… My gosh!

528
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:26,684
Who are you?

529
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,938
Ga Mo…

530
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,822
Hey, we might grow on each other
at this rate.

531
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:42,533
Aren't we close enough

532
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,660
to call each other besties?

533
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,208
I was going to do that for him.

534
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,501
My goodness.

535
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,671
-Hey.
-Aren't you from the noodle place?

536
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,427
-No, it's not her.
-She's the owner there.

537
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,512
-Why would she be here?
-It is her.

538
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:06,015
-Goodness!
-It is her!

539
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:07,933
-Why are you here?
-My goodness.

540
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,893
What brings all of you here?

541
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:11,478
For Shin Myeong-hwi?

542
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:14,148
You are handsome, Shin Myeong-hwi!

543
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:16,567
We love you, Shin Myeong-hwi!

544
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,610
-It's nice to see you here.
-It's so nice.

545
00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:20,696
DECLARATION OF CANDIDACY

546
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,239
TODAY, I'D LIKE TO DECLARE…

547
00:41:22,323 --> 00:41:23,991
Once you're done talking about ICT,

548
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:25,743
the anchor will change the topic

549
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:28,370
to your presidential candidacy.

550
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:31,165
We already wrote out the script.

551
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:41,717
MASTER CONTROL ROOM

552
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,760
Excuse me.

553
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:43,719
Come in.

554
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:53,145
MASTER CONTROL ROOM

555
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:57,358
Should I have said I work two jobs?

556
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:59,193
Sorry.

557
00:41:59,276 --> 00:42:01,820
When you come by next time,
I'll give you twice as much.

558
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:04,615
Honey, Shin Myeong-hwi isn't a good guy.

559
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:08,994
One, two, three.

560
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,290
Next, it's time for our special talk.

561
00:42:13,374 --> 00:42:16,168
I'm here today with the mayor of Jungjin,
Mr. Shin Myeong-hwi.

562
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,586
Mr. Mayor, hello.

563
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:18,837
Yes, I'm glad to be here.

564
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,005
You must be quite busy.

565
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:24,134
I've been planning
ICT's phase-3 development,

566
00:42:24,218 --> 00:42:26,136
so I've been a little busy lately.

567
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,679
How's your health?

568
00:42:27,763 --> 00:42:30,307
-I try to work out whenever I can.
-Mr. Chairman.

569
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:32,684
After ICT's first two phases,

570
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,144
-Why are you here?
-your name

571
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,063
-became known in the nation.
-I had

572
00:42:36,146 --> 00:42:37,439
an interview regarding Ji.

573
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:38,399
I didn't expect

574
00:42:38,482 --> 00:42:40,359
-so much support from everyone.
-I came by

575
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:42,069
-to say hello.
-I'm grateful

576
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:44,363
-for all the love and support you showed.
-Okay.

577
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:47,199
The groundbreaking ceremony

578
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:49,451
for the third ICT Valley
will be held soon.

579
00:42:49,535 --> 00:42:50,828
It turned into a big deal

580
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:53,038
even before the construction work began.

581
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:57,042
I tried to think of a mayor
who developed a city

582
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:59,128
as successfully as you did,

583
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:00,796
but you're the first one to do it.

584
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,173
Goodness, I'm flattered.

585
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,175
But I didn't do this all by myself.

586
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:06,552
And you're modest too.

587
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:10,514
Mayor Shin, I'd like to ask you a question

588
00:43:10,597 --> 00:43:13,350
that many people
are waiting to hear the answer to.

589
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:15,853
It's about the rumor
of you running for president.

590
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:17,729
Will you give us an answer today?

591
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:24,570
I'm ready.

592
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:27,656
Don't even dream of it.

593
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:33,287
We'll continue to discuss that topic
after the eco-friendly park,

594
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,123
the core of ICT's phase-3 development.

595
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:38,917
Let's watch a video
on the eco-friendly park.

596
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:48,844
THIS IS THE SITE
OF THE SO-CALLED ECO-FRIENDLY PARK

597
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,597
<i>While maintaining the natural ecology</i>
<i>of the area,</i>

598
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:55,601
<i>culture, recreation, health,</i>
<i>and sports facilities</i>

599
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:58,103
<i>will be constructed</i>
<i>at the eco-friendly park.</i>

600
00:43:58,187 --> 00:44:01,940
<i>You should come to Jungjin,</i>
<i>the city that's beloved</i>

601
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:04,902
<i>by its people. Get what I'm saying?</i>

602
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:09,990
<i>Go beyond Jungjin</i>
<i>and come to the Blue House.</i>

603
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:11,742
<i>Get what I'm saying?</i>

604
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:14,328
MURDERER 2

605
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:16,747
What's that?

606
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,332
MURDERER 3

607
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:20,250
<i>The man who is beloved by the people.</i>

608
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:22,294
<i>-Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>
<i>-Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>

609
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:25,255
<i>The man who will take responsibility</i>
<i>for your health and safety.</i>

610
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:27,508
<i>-Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>
<i>-Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>

611
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:29,551
-Turn it off.
<i>-The man beloved by...</i>

612
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:31,345
No, there must be a misunderstanding.

613
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:33,096
<i>Get what I'm saying?</i>

614
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:36,934
<i>-Get what I'm saying?</i>
<i>-Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>

615
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:38,143
Turn it off!

616
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,399
Look over there!

617
00:44:45,943 --> 00:44:47,861
Hello, I enjoy watching you on TV.

618
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,156
One, two. Microphone test. One, two.

619
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,576
Everyone, I present to you this murderer

620
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,288
who dumped waste illegally
at the grounds of the eco-friendly park!

621
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:04,419
Ha-na, now.

622
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:25,440
What's this smell?

623
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:31,113
-Cut it out!
-Don't come near me!

624
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,489
Don't come near me!

625
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:37,869
-Don't come any closer!
-Get him!

626
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,960
Mr. Mayor, this way. Come this way.

627
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,586
Hold on to my hand.

628
00:45:55,012 --> 00:45:56,305
Oh no, Mr. Mayor.

629
00:45:56,388 --> 00:45:58,098
Goodness, this is gross.

630
00:45:58,181 --> 00:45:59,391
-So gross.
-Who are you?

631
00:45:59,474 --> 00:46:03,812
You deserve to be behind bars,
you piece of human trash.

632
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:06,315
Mun, let's go.

633
00:46:11,528 --> 00:46:13,280
-Hurry up, you punk!
-But there's one more!

634
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:16,950
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

635
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:18,744
-Get them!
-Go get them.

636
00:46:19,328 --> 00:46:21,246
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

637
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,081
-Damn it.
-Whoa.

638
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:25,083
-What's he doing?
-No, stop.

639
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:38,180
No, stop.

640
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:40,265
-Go get him.
-Get him.

641
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:46,772
Mo-tak, we're leaving.

642
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:52,778
Damn it!

643
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,373
How dare they do this
on the day of my announcement!

644
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:06,166
EMERGENCY STAIRS

645
00:47:13,256 --> 00:47:15,092
-Wait, stop!
-No!

646
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:16,510
-Hey, kid!
-Open this!

647
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:17,677
-Damn it.
-Hey!

648
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:18,762
Oh, man.

649
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,531
Gentlemen, take your wastewater back.

650
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:39,866
Get a taste of your own wastewater!

651
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,869
Stop it, you bastards!

652
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:07,310
Did that taste good, you assholes?

653
00:48:20,115 --> 00:48:22,576
-Please!
-Open the door, please!

654
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,329
-Mr. Chairman!
-Open this!

655
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:27,664
We're done here.

656
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:37,799
Reporters!

657
00:48:37,883 --> 00:48:39,676
There's a huge scoop out there!

658
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:41,803
The murderers of Jungjin are out there!

659
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,015
-Run.
-Hurry up.

660
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:48,768
You're Chairman Cho Tae-sin, right?

661
00:48:48,852 --> 00:48:50,145
Do you admit everything?

662
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,438
-Do you?
-Whatever.

663
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:52,522
-Say something.
-Stop.

664
00:48:52,606 --> 00:48:54,483
-Cameras off.
-How do you feel?

665
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:55,484
Say something.

666
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:57,360
Turn off the damn cameras!

667
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:04,576
It's me.
Postpone the groundbreaking ceremony.

668
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:06,786
And keep the media from reporting on this.

669
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,123
Make sure you put together a statement
to refute what they said!

670
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:14,961
DECLARATION OF CANDIDACY

671
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:25,096
Are you hurt?

672
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,598
Stop talking to me, idiot.

673
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:29,142
What the…

674
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:33,104
Who are you?

675
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:34,773
You…

676
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,535
Mo-tak.

677
00:49:46,618 --> 00:49:47,911
Su-ryong.

678
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:50,288
Su-ryong.

679
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:54,918
I forgot everything else.

680
00:49:56,169 --> 00:49:58,129
But I still remember

681
00:50:00,215 --> 00:50:01,800
how much respect I had for you.

682
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:06,680
Did you do this?

683
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,975
Come and catch me if you can.

684
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:15,313
When you do, I'll blow this up
into an even bigger deal.

685
00:50:21,403 --> 00:50:23,113
After I've caught all those jerks,

686
00:50:24,698 --> 00:50:25,865
I'll come for you.

687
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:42,966
They put innocent people to sleep,

688
00:50:43,049 --> 00:50:44,467
erased their memories,

689
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:48,221
and used violence in an occasion

690
00:50:48,305 --> 00:50:50,056
unrelated to evil spirits.

691
00:50:57,564 --> 00:50:59,441
What's going on?

692
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:08,533
<i>During today's live broadcast,</i>

693
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:12,162
<i>Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi's face was</i>
<i>splashed with wastewater.</i>

694

<i>as a part of ICT's phase-3 development</i>

697
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:21,129
<i>was exposed as an illegal dumping ground</i>

698
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,964
<i>where construction waste was dumped</i>

699
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:24,049
<i>for decades,</i>

700
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:25,717
<i>and it caused a huge controversy.</i>

701
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,262
<i>You're right. To sum it up,</i>

702
00:51:29,804 --> 00:51:33,683
<i>this will likely cause a problem</i>
<i>for Mayor Shin's presidential candidacy.</i>

703
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:35,101
<i>That's definitely possible.</i>

704
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:38,188
It'll cause a problem
for his presidential candidacy.

705
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:39,981
An immense problem.

706
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,446
All right!

707
00:51:56,956 --> 00:51:58,792
-One!
-Two.

708
00:51:58,875 --> 00:51:59,918
Three.

709
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,294
Four!

710
00:52:11,846 --> 00:52:14,474
-Here are your noodles.
-What's going on?

711
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,726
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

712
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,994
Mo-tak.

713
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:37,372
I forgot everything else.

714
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:40,125
But I still remember

715
00:52:42,168 --> 00:52:43,670
how much respect I had for you.

716
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,047
Come and catch me if you can.

717
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:49,718
When you do, I'll blow this up
into an even bigger deal.

718
00:52:55,765 --> 00:52:59,060
You took the blood sample, didn't you?

719
00:52:59,686 --> 00:53:01,146
That belonged to a suspect.

720
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:02,772
If you destroyed that,

721
00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:04,566
it means you know

722
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:07,193
who killed Kim Yeong-nim.

723
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:09,571
You knew, didn't you?

724
00:53:12,031 --> 00:53:13,158
That Mo-tak came back.

725
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:16,202
That's why you were so bold.

726
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,038
Isn't that so?

727
00:53:19,122 --> 00:53:20,498
It was Shin Myeong-hwi.

728
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:37,432
I used to have only one <i>mugunghwa</i> mark
on my badge,

729
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,434
but now I have three more.

730
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,978
I'm just waiting to turn that
into a bigger badge.

731
00:53:43,813 --> 00:53:45,190
I'm about to go to Seoul!

732
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:49,027
Chief Choi.

733
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:50,862
I won't give up.

734
00:53:52,155 --> 00:53:54,407
And Mo-tak will see this to the end.

735
00:54:06,503 --> 00:54:07,754
Do whatever you can.

736
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,724
The city council is pressuring us

737
00:54:19,808 --> 00:54:22,852
to reconsider the construction
of the eco-friendly park.

738
00:54:23,645 --> 00:54:26,397
They decided to leave out
all parties related to Taesin

739
00:54:27,023 --> 00:54:28,650
from the environmental research

740
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:30,735
and select their own.

741
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:32,403
They'll get another company

742
00:54:33,279 --> 00:54:34,989
to dig up the reservoir?

743
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:36,991
They plan on investigating thoroughly.

744
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:39,118
They're set on it.

745
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:40,995
Damn it!

746
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:42,872
I put half of them on the council.

747
00:54:43,623 --> 00:54:45,625
Did they all go crazy?

748
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,627
Give me the list of council members.

749
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:57,345
Who has the biggest say?

750
00:54:59,472 --> 00:55:01,391
Councilman Ham In-pyo is the leader.

751
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:03,268
Ham In-pyo.

752
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:04,477
You may leave.

753
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:07,188
Yes, sir.

754
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:15,321
Go do more favors for them

755
00:55:15,405 --> 00:55:17,532
or attack their weakest points.

756
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:19,492
-Yes, sir.
-What if

757
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:21,661
they end up finding Kim Yeong-nim's body?

758
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:25,957
You don't have to worry about that.

759
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:31,045
These rats are the problem.

760
00:55:32,046 --> 00:55:35,383
On the day that Mr. Mayor
was declaring his candidacy?

761
00:55:36,092 --> 00:55:37,510
Why show up suddenly

762
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:39,929
after playing dead all this time?

763
00:55:40,013 --> 00:55:43,182
Was he waiting for the right time
to get revenge?

764
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:45,518
It doesn't look like he'll give up easily.

765
00:55:46,227 --> 00:55:47,312
Ga Mo-tak is determined

766
00:55:48,187 --> 00:55:50,940
to find Kim Yeong-nim's corpse
in the reservoir no matter what.

767
00:55:56,029 --> 00:55:57,238
Kill him.

768
00:56:04,756 --> 00:56:05,590
That looks so good.

769
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,334
-Cut it into big pieces.
-Stop that.

770
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:09,169
-Cut it into four pieces.
-Four it is.

771
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:14,049
-Wow, come on.
-Hey.

772
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:17,136
You can't do this without me.

773
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:18,720
Grab a seat.

774
00:56:18,804 --> 00:56:20,055
How did you know?

775
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:22,683
We kept it a secret on purpose.

776
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,562
I could smell the meat
all the way over there.

777
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:27,938
He has a good nose.

778
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:31,191
What happened to Mr. Kwon's daughter?

779
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:35,237
Well, she's doing well at the hospital.

780
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,739
Let's hope she stays strong.

781
00:56:38,574 --> 00:56:39,741
She'll live through this.

782
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,786
All right.

783
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:52,754
-It's hot.
-Eat up, everyone.

784
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:54,214
-Okay.
-Goodness.

785
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:56,967
Ms. Chu, have a lettuce wrap.

786
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,428
Goodness, thanks.

787
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:02,347
Okay, then.

788
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:03,307
I want some garlic.

789
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:06,101
Garlic. Okay.

790
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:11,231
-Mun, it's for you.
-Okay.

791
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:15,277
Feed yourself. You have hands.

792
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:16,820
Right.

793
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,822
My gosh.

794
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,243
Ha-na.

795
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,996
You're going to eat that in one bite?

796
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,331
Can you really do that?

797
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:30,167
-Whoa.
-Wow.

798
00:57:31,168 --> 00:57:33,337
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

799
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:38,342
I knew it.

800
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:39,968
You have a huge mouth.

801
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:45,182
<i>Mun.</i>

802
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:47,184
Yes?

803
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:49,895
I need all the Counters up here.

804
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,860
All of us?

805
00:57:58,654 --> 00:57:59,905
Okay.

806
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:03,492
Let's not get dragged around.

807
00:58:03,575 --> 00:58:05,661
Don't be scared, everyone.

808
00:58:07,913 --> 00:58:10,582
Come back before the meat burns.

809
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,167
Let's go, everyone.

810
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:13,418
-In a little bit.
-Let's go.

811
00:58:14,169 --> 00:58:16,004
Wait a second.

812
00:58:19,216 --> 00:58:21,426
Damn it. I barely had a chance to eat.

813
00:58:59,423 --> 00:59:01,216
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

814
00:59:15,105 --> 00:59:16,231
You can't come in here.

815
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:20,861
Hey, who are you?

816
00:59:29,077 --> 00:59:30,996
What's going on outside?

817
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:36,918
Anyone outside?

818
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:39,379
You can't let in all sorts of riffraff!

819
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,799
Who are you?

820
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:48,639
What the hell do you want?

821
00:59:55,812 --> 00:59:57,147
Ji Cheong-sin?

822
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,447
Whoa, this is no joke.

823
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:08,325
She must be the famous inspector.

824
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,795
<i>Grab him!</i>

825
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:29,012
<i>Goodness, this is gross.</i>

826
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:30,639
<i>-So gross.</i>
<i>-Who are you?</i>

827
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,436
You are not allowed to use your powers

828
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:39,439
for anything unrelated to evil spirits.

829
01:00:40,065 --> 01:00:42,651
Yung has already warned you prior to this

830
01:00:42,734 --> 01:00:44,569
for breaking the rules as a Counter,

831
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:47,823
but I received a report that says
your behavior wasn't corrected.

832
01:00:47,906 --> 01:00:49,032
Is this true?

833
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:51,118
It's true.

834
01:00:53,995 --> 01:00:56,248
I'm asking the Counters.

835
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:57,708
It's true.

836
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:00,544
You are aware

837
01:01:01,336 --> 01:01:04,423
that you get dismissed
after five warnings, aren't you?

838
01:01:05,048 --> 01:01:06,216
Yes.

839
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:09,302
Chu Mae-ok.

840
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:21,606
<i>Should I have said I work two jobs?</i>

841
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:23,734
<i>Sorry.</i>

842
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:24,943
<i>Mr. Ga Mo-tak.</i>

843
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:36,913
Chu Mae-ok, two warnings.

844
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:45,881
Ga Mo-tak.

845
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:09,571
<i>We must erase the memories</i>

846
01:02:09,654 --> 01:02:11,865
<i>of anyone who finds out our identities.</i>

847
01:02:11,948 --> 01:02:13,617
<i>But I won't do that to you.</i>

848
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:19,831
Ga Mo-tak, four warnings.

849
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:21,792
Four?

850
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:24,544
Objection.

851
01:02:25,462 --> 01:02:26,379
What? Why?

852
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:29,883
He disclosed their identities as Counters

853
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:33,261
in order to receive help
to summon a level-three evil spirit.

854
01:02:35,013 --> 01:02:36,598
Please take that into consideration.

855
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:41,520
Was that so? I mean, yes.

856
01:02:41,603 --> 01:02:42,979
That was it. That's why.

857
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:46,441
I'll discuss that
with the other inspectors.

858
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:50,028
I'm so relieved.

859
01:02:50,946 --> 01:02:51,947
Do Ha-na.

860
01:02:59,287 --> 01:03:00,622
<i>Damn you.</i>

861
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:16,179
<i>I have to tell my daughter something.</i>

862
01:03:16,847 --> 01:03:17,889
<i>Mom?</i>

863
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:21,393
Do Ha-na, four warnings.

864
01:03:22,352 --> 01:03:23,520
-Do you object?
-I did that--

865
01:03:23,603 --> 01:03:25,105
I don't.

866
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:34,322
-So Mun.
-Yes.

867
01:03:40,996 --> 01:03:42,372
<i>You asshole!</i>

868
01:03:51,256 --> 01:03:52,924
<i>Why?</i>

869
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,225
So Mun, three warnings.

870
01:04:03,518 --> 01:04:07,856
Do Ha-na, you must remember
that you'll be dismissed

871
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:10,317
if you break the rules as a Counter
one more time

872
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,735
as you carry on your duties.

873
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:14,613
You'll be stripped of your rights
as a Counter

874
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:17,866
and also lose your life.

875
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:23,038
We're aware.

876
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:27,459
-Now, we'll wrap up the hearing--
-Before we wrap up,

877
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,838
I'd like to say something.

878
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:43,058
Regardless of the number of warnings,

879
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:47,437
I believe that Counter 1543 So Mun

880
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:51,274
should be dismissed.

THE UNCANNY COUNTER

883
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,359
I must save my parents
with my own two hands.

884
01:05:34,442 --> 01:05:37,862
I cannot quit this job.

885
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:40,699
That's enough.

886
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:42,117
At this rate, I'll lose you

887
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,077
and even Ha-na before we catch them.

888
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,578
I, Shin Myeong-hwi,

889
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:48,748
have decided to run for president.

890
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,919
He must be gathering evil spirits.

891
01:05:53,003 --> 01:05:54,713
-Who are you?
-I'm your savior.

892
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:56,214
Wait, hold on.
