1
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:50,017
THE UNCANNY COUNTER

2
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,690
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

3
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:01,941
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:05,028
You'll be stripped of your rights
as a Counter

5
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:08,281
and also lose your life.

6
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:12,994
We're aware.

7
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,914
-Now, we'll wrap up the hearing--
-Before we wrap up…

8
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:21,794
I'd like to say something.

9
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:32,513
Regardless of the number of warnings,

10
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:36,976
I believe Counter 1543 So Mun…

11
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:40,730
should be dismissed.

12
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:02,877
Based on my observations,

13
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:07,381
I've concluded that he does not qualify
to work as a Counter.

14
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:09,801
-Wi-gen.
-What?

15
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,177
-He's not qualified?
-Why?

16
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,345
Why would you say that?

17
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:14,388
-What are you saying?
-Silence!

18
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:18,976
This isn't a place to argue.

19
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,895
Tell me why I should be dismissed.

20
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,525
He has difficulty
controlling his emotions,

21
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,445
so we had to reevaluate
his qualifications as a Counter.

22
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,824
I took time to reflect on what I did
and I deeply regret it.

23
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:37,870
You were able to keep your job
as a Counter thanks to Ms. Chu.

24
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:42,792
But you haven't changed at all.

25
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,628
Mun, you can't do this alone.

26
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,255
The others will be there soon.

27
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,381
Join them.

28
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,094
No. We may never catch Ji Cheong-sin
if we lose him this time.

29
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:59,100
Say it again.

30
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:02,061
What did you do to my parents?
You disgusting bastard!

31
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,276
He failed to control his emotions

32
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,445
and endangered his life

33
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,157
as well as Yung.

34
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:18,494
Mun!

35
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,746
Ha-na.

36
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,790
It's okay, Mun. You'll be okay.

37
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,251
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen!

38
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:28,588
Contact the Counters

39
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,258
and tell them to go find Mun.

40
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,971
Things like this never happened
before he joined us.

41
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,807
Respect for each other's lives

42
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:43,477
and a sense of partnership
were the basis of our relationship.

43
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:45,229
All right. Okay, Gi-ran.

44
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:48,399
We'll be more careful from now on.

45
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:50,067
I agree

46
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:53,654
that Mun should be stripped
of his rights as a Counter.

47
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,660
Had he waited for his teammates,

48
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:03,456
we wouldn't have lost Ji Cheong-sin.

49
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,541
Since we kept losing our targets,

50
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:11,756
evil spirits had chances
to learn enough about Counters.

51
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,133
This is it.

52
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:16,928
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

53
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:20,765
Hazy like smoke.

54
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,351
It feels like a cold fog.

55
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,275
That evil spirit…

56
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,780
now knows how to avoid Yung's territories.

57
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,115
That bastard killed his parents.

58
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:42,536
I'm older, but I would've had a hard time
staying calm and collected too.

59
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:46,207
Think of how he must've felt
at that moment.

60
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,501
Can you please try putting yourself
in his shoes?

61
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:52,338
He's really trying
to put his emotions in check.

62
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,673
You see, Mun is…

63
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,134
He's really trying his best.

64
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:00,429
His vengeful thoughts are the problem,
Ms. Chu.

65
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,656
I warned you that you'd get it all back,
twofold!

66
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:24,537
-Hey!
-Hands off! Let go!

67
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:31,961
Mun has occasionally exhibited
the urge to murder.

68
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:36,340
No.

69
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:39,510
I never… That is not true.

70
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:40,469
Mun.

71
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,888
The emotions that you feel,

72
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:44,724
I feel it all too.

73
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,560
You admit it, don't you?

74
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:57,153
I'm holding back my emotions.

75
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,697
You know that I didn't kill anyone!

76
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,782
My contract said nothing
about my emotions.

77
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,200
-Am I wrong?
-Mun.

78
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,038
I'll announce our decision.

79
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:10,541
The committee has decided

80
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:14,545
to dismiss Counter 1543 So Mun
from his position.

81
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,717
What do we do?

82
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,180
Wi-gen, go ahead and terminate
your contract with So Mun.

83
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:34,982
Come forward, Mun.

84
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,045
I…

85
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,714
cannot

86
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:01,050
accept this decision.

87
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:04,220
You're right.

88
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,557
Wi-gen, I didn't think I'd end up
putting you in danger. I'm sorry.

89
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,142
I'm really sorry,

90
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,479
but can you please give me
one more chance?

91
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,315
My mom and dad…

92
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,236
are locked inside Ji Cheong-sin's body.

93
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,280
My parents…

94
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:25,866
are locked inside that bastard.

95
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,077
They've been locked in there
for seven years.

96
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:32,665
I don't know
when their souls will dissipate.

97
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:35,501
I must save my parents
with my own two hands.

98
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,754
And until the day I save them,

99
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:40,131
I…

100
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,592
I cannot quit this job.

101
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:51,767
With the powers bestowed upon you
by the heavens,

102
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,812
if you feel the urge to kill,

103
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,025
you're no different from an evil spirit.

104
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:02,903
Wi-gen.

105
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:13,789
-Mun!
-Mun!

106
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,291
-Mun!
-Mun!

107
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,709
Hey, Mun!

108
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:18,627
-Hey, Mun.
-Mun!

109
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,962
-Mun!
-Mun!

110
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,088
Mun!

111
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:24,967
What's with him?

112
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:28,429
Mun…

113
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:29,597
-Mun.
-What's wrong?

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,848
Mun.

115
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:33,434
Mun. Don't tell me
he's relapsed into a coma.

116
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,186
He won't die, right?

117
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,146
Mun, wake up. Mun!

118
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,230
Mun.

119
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,250
Mun.

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,097
My goodness! What's wrong with him?

121
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,349
Hey, what's going on?

122
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:18,312
He is…

123
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,065
no longer a Counter.

124
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,775
What?

125
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:24,276
How did that happen?

126
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,320
What did you guys do up there?

127
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,039
<i>Ha-na, erase Mun's memories.</i>

128
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,123
What?

129
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,127
What's wrong? What are they saying now?

130
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,922
Why?

131
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,007
Why must we erase his memories?

132
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,762
It's not like he'll tell people about us!

133
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:54,056
<i>Then you'll all get a warning,</i>

134
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,434
<i>which means</i>
<i>Ha-na will automatically be dismissed.</i>

135
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,813
<i>Try to understand</i>
<i>the gravity of the situation.</i>

136
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:09,405
I'll do it.

137
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:22,710
I understand that you guys
don't want to erase Mun's memories.

138
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:26,130
The memories of working together
while risking your lives.

139
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,174
But…

140
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:32,303
must it be done?

141
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:37,683
I must track down the person
who killed my parents, you know.

142
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:41,562
And I have to remember
what my fellow Counters look like.

143
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,689
You must forget everything, Mun.

144
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,819
We have no choice.

145
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,536
Wait, just a second.

146
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,038
Please, wait…

147
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,679
All right.

148
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,682
Goodbye, Mun.

149
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, dear.

150
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:48,587
I found him passed out
in front of the house.

151
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,547
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

152
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,092
Hold on. The nearest hospital is…

153
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,885
No, he'll be fine.

154
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:57,304
He just needs some rest.

155
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:59,181
He'll feel better soon.

156
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:00,099
My gosh.

157
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,102
Is he ill?

158
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:05,396
Gosh.

159
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,907
Honey, Mun is walking.

160
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:21,203
My gosh, Mun.

161
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,751
Gosh, I'm so happy for you.

162
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,594
Both of you are incredibly kind
and warmhearted.

163
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,139
No wonder

164
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,684
Mun's grown into such a purehearted,
wonderful boy.

165
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:21,263
-He's here.
-Do you think I can do a good job?

166
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:26,768
Wake up, Ha-na!

167
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:29,396
For your information,
I'm not good at comforting people.

168
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,482
I've only been comforted.
I haven't done it myself.

169
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,735
Is it good?

170
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,908
We won't lose anyone in this photo.

171
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:42,534
I promise you that.

172
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:46,288
Let's try that again.

173
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,886
JI CHEONG-SIN, SO GWON, HA MUN-YEONG

174
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:07,184
That's enough.

175
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:12,689
At this rate, I'll lose you…

176
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,024
JI CHEONG-SIN

177
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,108
…and even Ha-na…

178
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:16,068
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

179
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:17,277
…before we catch them.

180
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:18,487
CHO TAE-SIN

181
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:20,989
Mun can…

182
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,076
still get through his life, but for us…

183
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,871
It'll be the end of us, Mo-tak.

184
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,219
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

185
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:44,429
These rats are the problem.

186
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,725
On the day that Mr. Mayor
declared his candidacy?

187
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:51,478
Why show up suddenly

188
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,480
after playing dead all this time?

189
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:56,733
Was he waiting for the right time
to get revenge?

190
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:58,944
It doesn't look like he'll give up easily.

191
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,863
Ga Mo-tak is determined

192
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,950
to find Kim Yeong-nim's corpse
in the reservoir no matter what.

193
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,789
Kill him.

194
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:13,834
Well…

195
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,919
Sir, the thing is…

196
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,214
There's something you should see.

197
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:30,183
Who are these freaks, really?

198
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:46,325
You can't come in here.

199
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:50,537
Hey, who are you?

200
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,422
What's going on outside?

201
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,345
Anyone outside?

202
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,056
You can't let in all sorts of riffraff!

203
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,309
Who are you?

204
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:18,774
What the hell do you want?

205
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,825
-Ji Cheong-sin?
-How dare you?

206
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,035
Stop.

207
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:33,664
You may leave.

208
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,169
We need to talk.

209
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,300
You can't catch those rats
without my help.

210
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:47,970
Get me off the wanted list,

211
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:49,972
and I'll take care of it.

212
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,104
You want to strike a deal?

213
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:00,399
Hand over the ledger first.

214
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:05,696
Mr. Bae's ledger,

215
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:07,739
hand that over first.

216
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:30,721
Rather than getting you off the list,

217
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,182
how about you just get caught?

218
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,728
If you get caught and cause a stir,

219
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,024
my approval rating
will probably bounce back.

220
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:56,872
Let's do that, okay?

221
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:00,375
"Cause a stir"? How big of a stir?

222
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:37,662
Mun! Are you up?

223
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:41,124
Yes. I'll be right out.

224
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:16,368
Oh, you're up! You little rascal.

225
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,995
Gosh, Grandma.
Did you have a good night's sleep?

226
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,414
Good morning.

227
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:24,042
Look what I have!

228
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:25,710
What? Grandma.

229
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:28,421
-That's mine.
-No, it's mine.

230
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:31,383
-Grandma, yours is in the bathroom.
-No, this is mine.

231
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,384
Give it back!

232
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,219
-It's mine!
-Mun.

233
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,720
Come and eat first.

234
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:37,180
I'll get you a new toothbrush.

235
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:41,184
-Gosh, Grandma.
-Hey.

236
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,520
An old man was here.

237
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:45,355
-An old man?
-Yes.

238
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:47,649
With a mustache like this and…

239
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,068
And with glasses.

240
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:52,445
-A mustache like this?
-Yes.

241
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,324
He said you're purehearted and wonderful.

242
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:57,242
What?

243
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:01,246
So this is mine, okay?

244
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:03,790
-No, give it back!
-No, it's mine.

245
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,125
-Grandma!
-No, it's mine!

246
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,002
-It's mine.
-Enough! Come and eat.

247
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,378
-Goodness.
-See?

248
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,130
-It's mine.
-Want it?

249
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:11,631
Snatch it if you can!

250
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:14,134
JUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

251
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:17,220
SHIN MYEONG-HWI
SHIN ON-AIR INCIDENT, CHO TAE-SIN

252
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:19,514
This is insane.

253
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,517
Mayor Shin is screwed.

254
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,187
You jerk. You're smirking?

255
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:27,689
How's Assemblyman Choi doing?

256
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:28,899
Great, Mayor Shin.

257
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:32,652
Hey, come here!

258
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:34,237
Come on, quick!

259
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,614
-What is it?
-Look, over there.

260
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:37,616
What's going on?

261
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:40,702
Look.

262
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:46,333
Why is that moron limping again?

263
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,250
Exactly.

264
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,305
What kind of show is this?

265
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:05,518
See? I told you.
This asshole's just doing this for show.

266
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:14,569
-Whoa.
-What's going on?

267
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:15,904
Hey, you were wrong.

268
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:20,367
I'm throwing this far away!

269
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:23,328
Hey, what the hell?

270
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:25,914
Act up all you want.

271
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,749
Go ahead and act up all you want.

272
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,924
Hey, Ung-min. Isn't this Mun's?

273
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,302
-Mun!
-Mun!

274
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:45,183
Jeez, calm down.

275
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,309
What happened to him?

276
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:48,645
Seriously? First thing in the morning?

277
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:49,604
Out of the way.

278
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,606
Move! Out of the way!

279
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,441
Why are you guys all here?

280
00:21:57,112 --> 00:21:58,947
Hey, how did you fall?

281
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,365
Be careful.

282
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,709
He tripped and fell.

283
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,461
You guys are supposed to lie low. Go.

284
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:15,922
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,552
I got scared for no reason.

286
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:22,429
-Let's whack him soon.
-Sounds good.

287
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,142
What are you all doing? Go back inside!

288
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:30,228
Go back to your classroom. Now!

289
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:32,731
Go.

290
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,277
Are you all right?

291
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:39,779
Hey, what happened?

292
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:40,989
With what?

293
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,783
Your leg! It had healed.

294
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:45,952
Really?

295
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:49,205
My leg? That's impossible.

296
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:50,206
This is nuts.

297
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:54,669
Hey.

298
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,546
He doesn't have a fever.

299
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:59,382
Hey, you told us your leg had been healed.

300
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,633
And right here, you…

301
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:03,136
You walked like this right here.

302
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:04,262
What?

303
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,347
Mun.

304
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:07,265
My gosh.

305
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,824
Su-ho.

306
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,876
Here for Mun?

307
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:37,337
Yes, that's right.

308
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:39,756
Is there anything we can do?

309
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,175
Shall I file a complaint?

310
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:44,511
Can we appeal the decision?

311
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:45,970
Is there no way to revert it?

312
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:48,723
Wi-gen has already started meeting
with other candidates.

313
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,434
We'll hire his replacement soon, okay?

314
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:55,188
Good luck with that. You'll never find
anyone who's as good as him.

315
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,981
You threw away a huge asset.

316
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,858
You guys will regret it big time.

317
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:02,529
Come on, Ms. Chu.

318
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:05,865
You guys should take this
as an opportunity to set things right.

319
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:07,659
That secret Mo-tak spilled,

320
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:09,577
erase it when the spirit's summoned.

321
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:15,500
I feel so bad for Mun.
My heart breaks for him.

322
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:21,965
Su-ho.

323
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:24,342
You know what it's like.

324
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:26,761
It's devastating

325
00:24:27,804 --> 00:24:30,056
for parents and their child
to be separated by death

326
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:33,143
when they aren't even ready.

327
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,439
We know how awful that is.

328
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:49,492
I miss you so much
even while looking at you like this.

329
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:52,412
That poor thing must be so sad.

330
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:00,128
Su-ho.

331
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:03,965
We must help Mun
so that he can meet his parents again.

332
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:06,634
Do something, please.

333
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:11,264
Gosh, Mom. Why are you crying?

334
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,601
Okay, I'll try to persuade the others.

335
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:15,768
All right.

336
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:20,690
And why do you have so much gray hair now?
It makes me sad.

337
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,572
Kang Se-hyeon also said no?

338
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,949
That's right. It's not easy, you know.

339
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,452
Everyone says no
upon finding out it's dangerous.

340
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:35,330
I have a huge respect for our partners
who said yes.

341
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:37,874
We should be grateful to our partners.

342
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:39,125
I already know that.

343
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:43,588
There's only one candidate left.

344
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:50,053
Su-ho, can you put together
another list of candidates?

345
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:54,182
Those who are physically fit for the job
were all on the list I gave you.

346
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:58,978
How about we give Mun his job back?

347
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:02,774
The level-three evil spirits
make me anxious every day.

348
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,694
Even if we find someone,
training a new partner will take a while.

349
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,154
No, not Mun.

350
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:13,660
OH HYE-MI

351
00:26:13,743 --> 00:26:15,161
LEE SEON-HO

352
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:17,205
"Lee Seon-ho."

353
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:21,751
He fell into a coma after saving
a neighbor's kid when a fire broke out.

354
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:25,505
Kind and righteous.
He's an excellent candidate.

355
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:28,508
Let's meet him.

356
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:32,470
Eat up.

357
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:35,556
Excuse me! Can we get more kimchi?

358
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,641
It's self-serve…

359
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:39,143
KIMCHI IS SELF-SERVE

360
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:42,772
Sure, just a moment.

361
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:20,226
Mr. Lee Seon-ho?

362
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:22,979
Yes?

363
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:24,897
You are Mr. Lee Seon-ho,

364
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:27,442
the 55-year-old male
who lives in Jeonghan-dong?

365
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,777
How can I help you?

366
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:32,488
We're glad you made it here safely.

367
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:33,948
What? I came here?

368
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:37,076
All I did was answer
when you called my name.

369
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:42,498
That answer brought you here, Mr. Lee.

370
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:47,295
I was just

371
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:49,505
relaxing on the bench,

372
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:51,632
looking at the park.

373
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:55,553
This weather and this air.

374
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,931
I don't know
if I've seen and felt this before,

375
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,310
but I feel as if I've finally come
to the place I missed.

376
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:08,107
I'll be fine even if this day never ends.

377
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:11,277
Mr. Lee Seon-ho.

378
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:13,571
We have a favor to ask of you.

379
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:15,323
If you decide to do it,

380
00:28:16,115 --> 00:28:18,117
we can wake you up right away.

381
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:23,664
<i>You've been in a coma for a month.</i>

382
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:25,875
<i>You can't move at all.</i>

383
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,294
<i>Your family is having a really hard time.</i>

384
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:29,754
If you decide to sign with us,

385
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:32,507
we can wake you up from your coma.

386
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:35,093
Coma?

387
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:45,186
Can't I just sit here and enjoy
the sounds of birds and the wind?

388
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,696
If you stay in your current state,
you'll die soon.

389
00:28:55,238 --> 00:28:56,698
While working as a firefighter,

390
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,617
I jumped in headfirst to help others

391
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:02,704
and made my wife suffer.

392
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:05,081
Mr. Lee.

393
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,793
I'm exhausted.

394
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:12,296
Now, I want to be…

395
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,509
reunited with my wife in heaven

396
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:19,470
and rest in peace with her.

397
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:32,900
Seon-ho.

398
00:29:36,946 --> 00:29:37,947
Seon-ho.

399
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:51,794
JUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

400
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:16,027
-Why hide?
-Gosh! Hey, you scared me.

401
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,405
You didn't do anything wrong.

402
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:20,615
When did you get here?

403
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:22,992
Jeez.

404
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:25,870
Why hide? You know he won't recognize us.

405
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,414
Oh, you're right.

406
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:30,374
He seems well.

407
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,126
Let's go.

408
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:36,172
Okay, let's go.

409
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,306
Come on out.

410
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:50,937
You'd better show yourself
before I lose it.

411
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:56,359
This prick…

412
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,113
Didn't you have an affair with my wife?

413
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:05,868
Now, you want to live
and don't even care about her?

414
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:10,832
Come out, you little shit!

415
00:31:16,295 --> 00:31:17,755
I'll kill you.

416
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:31,769
Please… Don't kill me, please.

417
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,021
Please don't kill me.

418
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:37,400
Hey, please. Please don't…

419
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:38,526
Die!

420
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:57,628
There's no way it was done by a human.
It's impossible. Could it be…

421
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:59,505
That's right. It was an evil spirit.

422
00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:02,967
This one is on Ji Cheong-sin's level.

423
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,468
Higher than level three.

424
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,598
Here's a suspect.

425
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:14,437
If he's on Ji Cheong-sin's level…

426
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,314
Does he also use psychokinesis?

427
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:17,815
That's possible.

428
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:20,026
Or pure physical strength.

429
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:23,070
We have to catch him soon,
or he'll cause big trouble.

430
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:26,240
Were they both killed by the same person?

431
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,533
Yes.

432
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:29,493
Are you sure?

433
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:32,038
The female victim is the suspect's wife.

434
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:35,041
She cheated on him with the male victim.

435
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:37,126
And they died at the same location.

436
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:39,170
Was the woman killed first?

437
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:42,381
Why do you ask? What is it?

438
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,258
The time gap between the two murders?

439
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:46,427
Five minutes?
I'd say, ten minutes at the most?

440
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,055
Based on the blood viscosity, that is.

441
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:55,186
Doesn't this look like it was done
by a level-one evil spirit?

442
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:57,021
-I'd say it's pretty ordinary.
-Yes.

443
00:32:57,104 --> 00:33:00,858
Is it possible to level up like this
in just five to ten minutes?

444
00:33:04,946 --> 00:33:07,698
This… wasn't done by the same spirit.

445
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:09,909
Two were involved.

446
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:19,710
Hey, Han-ul.

447
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:23,798
What?

448
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:33,099
<i>Suspected serial killer Ji Cheong-sin</i>
<i>was found dead in a burnt-out vehicle,</i>

449
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:36,769
<i>which he had stolen while on the run.</i>

450
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:38,854
<i>When the police arrived at the scene,</i>

451
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,982
<i>the vehicle was completely burnt out,</i>

452
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,526
<i>and a burnt body was found</i>
<i>in the driver's seat.</i>

453
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:46,237
-<i>The police have stated that</i>
-I'm home!

454
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,072
-<i>the body was severely damaged.</i>
-Hi.

455
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:50,491
<i>The National Forensic Service</i>

No.

463
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,386
Grandpa, this can't be happening.

464
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:13,431
What's wrong, Mun?

465
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:17,059
Mom…

466
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:20,688
<i>Footage from nearby surveillance cameras</i>
<i>and dashcams showed no evidence</i>

467

What? What's going to happen now?

469
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,989
Mun's parents.

470
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:32,950
This means their souls have dissipated.

471
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:36,203
No, that can't be.

472
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:39,248
These bastards are putting on a show.

473
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,876
<i>Police are trying to determine</i>
<i>if additional crimes were committed.</i>

474

480

-Are the results out?
-It's him?

483
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:10,529

-When will the autopsy be done?
-the cause of death?

488
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:20,331
-This is nuts.
-A comment, please.

489
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:22,124

Ji Cheong-sin didn't leave
any DNA evidence at the murder scenes,

521
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,102
so we can't make a comparison.

522
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,731
Height, 181 cm. Shoe size, 275 mm.

523
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,400
No, I told you this isn't him.

524
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:22,152
He felt cornered by the cops,
so he killed himself?

525
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:24,780
-No way.
-I also find it hard to believe,

526
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:28,200
but the prints we lifted
from the belongings and glass shards

527
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:30,578
matched Ji Cheong-sin's fingerprints.

528
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:31,787
We found

529
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,415
the broken glass piece he used to hurt Mun

530
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:36,458

How did this happen?

533
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:43,674
We have no evidence
to prove that he's not Ji Cheong-sin.

534
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:48,053
Jeong-yeong, can we check
for bone fractures?

00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:50,764
His bones?

537
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:56,770
I broke his wrist and rib.

00:37:58,772 --> 00:37:59,940
In the autopsy report…

539
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:01,942
Nothing about fractures.

540
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,278
Let's check the X-rays.

541
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:08,657
Jeez, those evil bastards.

542
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:12,077
They used someone else's corpse.

543
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:15,247
But this means
Ji Cheong-sin is still alive.

544
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:18,250
So I still have a chance
to find my parents, right?

545
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:23,297
But we're not sure if they did this

546
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,634
or if Ji Cheong-sin staged this
on his own.

547
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:27,635
It's obvious.

548
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:29,511
Those bastards staged this.

549
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:31,597
Mayor Shin has become a hero.

550
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,724
For taking down the serial killer.

551
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:36,393
And no one's talking
about the illegal dumping anymore.

552
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:37,936
Jeong-yeong.

553
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,981
You're investigating
the illegal dumping case, right?

554
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,609
We dug up the case
my dad was working on seven years ago.

555
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:45,694
It won't get buried again, right?

556
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:48,822
We're interviewing Noh Hang-gyu
as a witness

557
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,200
-at the moment, but…
-Just for formality's sake?

558
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:01,835
Hey, buddy.

559
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,003
Mun.

560
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,173
Mun.

561
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:12,221
Let's go have some noodles.

562
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:15,849
Ms. Chu misses you a lot.

563
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:17,768
When you…

564
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:21,605
and Ms. Chu came to my school,

565
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,190
I saw you guys.

566
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:35,994
You saw us?

567
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:41,667
What happened? How do you
still remember everything?

568
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,046
Chairman Choi left all the memories intact

569
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,550
so I could at least run away
if I were to run into Ji Cheong-sin.

570
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,636
Ji Cheong-sin…

571
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:54,972
We'll catch him.

572
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,350
-At all costs.
-Mo-tak.

573
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:01,812
Nothing has changed.

574
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:06,024
Those bastards aren't even hurt
after everything we did.

575
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:09,403
Ji Cheong-sin, who killed my parents,
is free now.

576
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:12,448
Cho Tae-sin owns one of
the top 50 companies, and the mayor…

577
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:15,659
he's running for president.

578
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,203
I feel like…

579
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:22,499
all of this is a big fat lie.

580
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:25,210
Why do you think nothing has changed?

581
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,296
You've changed.

582
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:29,089
And…

583
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,049
so have I.

584
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:35,721
Mo-tak.

585
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:38,140
Please don't tell Ha-na

586
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:40,100
that I remember everything.

587
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,643
If she gets another warning,

588
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,187
she'll be dismissed.

589
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,737
I'll also keep it from Ms. Chu.

590
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:54,281
Come by the restaurant.

591
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:57,993
I'll play dumb and give you extra food.

592
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:01,163
Bring your friends, okay?

593
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:13,175
As a cop,

594
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:16,136
you must be so embarrassed right now.

595
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:18,138
Right?

596
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:22,976
Let's go get the warrant.

597
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:24,561
Warrant?

598
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:29,483
We should at least put Noh Hang-gyu
behind bars.

599
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:40,536
"Ji Cheong-sin,"
"burnt corpse," "serial killer."

600
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,038
Keep pumping out articles
to make sure those keywords

601
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,331
keep trending.

602
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:47,417
As for the dumping site,
turn it into a real estate issue.

603
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,921
If ICT's phase-3 development
faces a problem, trillions of won

604
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:54,508
will be lost and companies will go bust.
The housing prices will also crash.

605
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,969
Interview angry homeowners
and run it as a headline.

606
00:41:57,052 --> 00:42:01,265
And get some real estate experts
on the show and have them hype it up.

607
00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:05,352
Jeez.

608
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:21,410
Hey, Chang-gyu.

609
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:23,036
Councilman Ham In-pyo.

610
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:25,998
How's it going?

611
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:31,628
All done.

612
00:42:31,712 --> 00:42:33,755
We got something naughty for you.

613
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,425
Good, okay.

614
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:42,306
Sorry for the trouble. You can leave now.

615
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,517
Thank you, Chief.

616
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,234
Did the interview go well?

617
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:59,197
The thing is though…

618
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:03,869
I'm sorry, but we need you to stay here
for a bit longer.

619
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:05,871
What the heck is this about?

620
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:06,955
Hey, Jeong-yeong!

621
00:43:09,124 --> 00:43:12,169
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu, you're under arrest
for abetting attempted murder.

622
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:13,086
ARREST WARRANT

623
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,880
Murder?

624
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:20,218
"Get Ga Mo-tak
and lock him in your warehouse.

625
00:43:23,055 --> 00:43:26,058
I must see him breathe his last breath
with my own two eyes."

626
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,019
There, you wanted me dead.

627
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:33,148
You whacked me and buried me.

628
00:43:33,774 --> 00:43:35,359
I warned you that you'd no longer

629
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:38,195
have it so easy.

630
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,281
This jerk is a councilman.

631
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:43,075
Maybe I should run for a seat too.

632
00:43:43,158 --> 00:43:44,660
You, on the city council? Please.

633
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:46,161
Hang-gyu should do it.

634
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:47,955
He should run for a seat

635
00:43:48,038 --> 00:43:49,289
in the National Assembly.

636
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:50,749
The city council's too small.

637
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:56,213
-Number one, Noh Chang-gyu.
-Number two, Lim Jae-cheol.

638
00:43:58,548 --> 00:43:59,383
What the hell?

639
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:01,510
Noh Chang-gyu, Lim Jae-cheol.

640
00:44:04,054 --> 00:44:07,265
You're under arrest for the attempted
murder of Ga Mo-tak and three others.

641
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:09,267
Cuff them.

642
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:12,604
-Hey, hold on.
-Look.

643
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:14,398
-Hey, that hurts!
-Wait, hold on.

644
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,066
-I don't know anything.
-Hold on.

645
00:44:16,149 --> 00:44:17,192
-Hey.
-Wait.

646
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:20,237
<i>Hey, are they gone?</i>

647
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,656
<i>Just said goodbye to all of them.</i>

648
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,203
Do you have evidence?

649
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:31,164
We've also arrested Noh Chang-gyu
and Lim Jae-cheol.

650
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,000
They're on their way here now.

651
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:35,919
Will you make your brother take the fall?

652
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:37,671
Also,

653
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:40,465
we found this tracker

654
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:42,426
under the damaged vehicle.

655
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:46,555
And we verified it through the app
on Noh Chang-gyu's phone.

656
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:55,981
Here, Noh Chang-gyu's phone.

657
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:01,945
This will tell us…

658
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,701
what kind of things
you and your brother talked about.

659
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:11,830
You guys had been

660
00:45:12,497 --> 00:45:15,208
way too confident.

661
00:45:38,273 --> 00:45:40,984
<i>The vehicle was completely burnt out,</i>

662
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:44,112
<i>and a burnt body was found</i>
<i>in the driver's seat.</i>

663
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:45,614
<i>The body was…</i>

664
00:45:52,454 --> 00:45:54,831
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:59,503
PASSPORT

<i>of going on the run</i>

667
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,432
<i>after committing three serial murders,</i>

668
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:15,602
<i>police are trying to determine</i>

669
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,116
Goodness.

670
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,785
You're spilling it everywhere.

671
00:46:31,868 --> 00:46:34,287
Do a better job if you want to get paid,
you moron.

672
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:37,123
-Okay.
-Jeez.

673
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:52,013
-Is it him?

00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:53,390
<i>It's that skinny one.</i>

675
00:46:55,058 --> 00:46:58,186
<i>Our friend inside him hasn't woken up yet.</i>

676
00:47:01,815 --> 00:47:02,732
Who are you?

677
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:06,570
Hey, who are you?

678
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:11,366
Are you a cop?

679
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:12,826
No.

680
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:14,411
I'm your savior.

681
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:16,788
"Savior"?

682
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,165
What a nutjob.

683
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:20,166
Just be on your way.

684
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,127
Mind your own business.

685
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,587
And you, come with us.

686
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,507
-How dare you barge in here?
-I said, mind your own business.

687
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:45,525
You see it now?

688
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:49,362
What… What is this?

689
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:51,615
What we live on.

690
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:53,617
What we live on?

691
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:05,795
So, what do you say?

692
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,841
Will you come with me or just die here?

693
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:20,529
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

694
00:48:20,612 --> 00:48:23,073
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

695
00:48:23,156 --> 00:48:25,993
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

696
00:48:26,076 --> 00:48:27,452
-Shin Myeong-hwi
-Thank you.

697
00:48:27,536 --> 00:48:29,788
-for president!
-Thank you! Yes, thank you.

698
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:30,956
My gosh.

699
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:32,791
-Our president!
-Thank you.

700
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,585
Shin Myeong-hwi!

00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:38,881
SHIN MYEONG-HWI RECEIVES
HIGHEST FAVORABILITY RATING

702
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,977
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

703
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,854
<i>He's in a meeting now.</i>

704
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:55,772
Tell him again

705
00:48:55,856 --> 00:48:58,400
to call me when the meeting is over.

706
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:02,029
I may not be able to pick up,

707
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:03,947
so he can call Chief Choi.

708
00:49:04,615 --> 00:49:06,491
Okay, I'll let him know.

709
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:18,211
Hey.

710
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:22,716
Send him some food.

711
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:23,634
Yes, sir.

712
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,808
What about the Ji Cheong-sin case?

713
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:36,271
Since the prime suspect is dead,
the case will automatically be closed.

714
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:40,067
So the murder case itself will be closed?

715
00:49:45,656 --> 00:49:46,490
Chairman Jeon too?

716
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:48,784
Yes, sir.

717
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:52,037
Nice and easy.

718
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,458
I have to say, I think Mayor Shin…

719
00:49:58,293 --> 00:49:59,753
is a genius.

720
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:11,848
MAYOR SHIN, WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

721
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:13,976
WE SUPPORT SHIN MYEONG-HWI
NO MATTER WHAT

722
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:19,189
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

723
00:50:19,272 --> 00:50:21,650
PLEASE PROTECT JUNGJIN

724
00:50:27,948 --> 00:50:29,533
I was never interested…

725
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:33,370
in running for president.

726
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:35,497
Making Jungjin

727
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:39,376
the happiest city on earth

728
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:41,586
was my only wish and goal.

729
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,754
However,

730
00:50:44,548 --> 00:50:47,551
dealing with all the nasty,
awful attempts to slander me…

731
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:50,595
<i>has made me realize that…</i>

732
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,391
<i>their target isn't me.</i>
<i>They're trying to attack…</i>

733
00:50:54,975 --> 00:50:56,768
<i>the innocent civilians who want peace.</i>

734
00:50:57,477 --> 00:50:59,396
<i>For the citizens of our democratic nation,</i>

735
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:01,189
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

736
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:04,568
<i>I, Shin Myeong-hwi, have decided…</i>

737
00:51:04,651 --> 00:51:06,236
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

738
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,654
<i>to run for president.</i>

739
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:10,782
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

740
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,576
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>

741
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:15,996
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

742
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,040
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

743
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:25,297
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

744
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,592
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

745
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:31,553
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

746
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:34,681
Jeez, you were all excited
about your dad getting screwed over.

747
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:37,642
Hey, this isn't about
my dad becoming president.

748
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:41,605
I may become the next president's son.
That's what I care about.

749
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:44,024
So we're friends
with the next president's son?

750
00:51:44,107 --> 00:51:46,401
Hey, the proper term is "<i>yeongsik</i>."

751
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:47,319
Yeong-sik?

752
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:48,862
In class four?

753
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:50,572
Oh, that guy? What?

754
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,785
No, it's the formal term
for a presidential son. You idiots.

755
00:51:54,868 --> 00:51:56,787
-Oh!
-I see.

756
00:51:58,497 --> 00:51:59,581
Hey, <i>Yeongsik</i>.

757
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:01,833
He's so childish.

758
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,169
He wants to brag about it like crazy.

759
00:52:04,252 --> 00:52:06,630
Everyone's trying to get on his good side
these days.

760
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:07,881
I can't stand it.

761
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:11,301
If my dad wins the election,

762
00:52:11,384 --> 00:52:14,054
I should tell him to pay more attention
to people with disabilities.

763
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:18,517
You know the thing they ride.
The electric-powered one.

764
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,561
-This one, right?
-We should have that at school.

765
00:52:21,645 --> 00:52:23,146
Hey, Shin Hyeok-u--

766
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,774
What, bitch?

767
00:52:28,276 --> 00:52:30,487
Don't swear at my friend.

768
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:35,075
Just get lost.

769
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,544
DONGHOE AUTO SERVICE

770
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:47,212
Come on.

771
00:52:47,963 --> 00:52:49,714
Oh, hi!

772
00:52:57,389 --> 00:52:59,015
Go easy on him.

773
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:04,855
With my upgraded social status,

774
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:07,816
I must set an example
when many are watching.

775
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:14,573
My school life has gone to shit
because of you, asshole.

776
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:16,825
Hey, keep acting up.

777
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:19,035
Keep messing with me, you little shit!

778
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,328
Damn you!

779
00:53:22,122 --> 00:53:25,041
-Damn it!
-Hey, Hyeok-u. Enough, stop it.

780
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,293
-Stop.
-Goddamn it!

781
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:29,796
-Hey, enough.
-Fine, okay. I heard you.

782
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:45,395
Do you feel better
after letting your anger out like that?

783
00:53:45,478 --> 00:53:46,855
What did you say?

784
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:49,149
You're still talking shit?

785
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:51,985
Your inability to control your emotions

786
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:53,987
will put you

787
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:57,073
and the people around you in danger.

788
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:00,202
Shut up, gimp.

789
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,584
This feels very familiar, doesn't it?

790
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:15,091
You're not the only one
who has to stay out of trouble.

791
00:54:16,343 --> 00:54:17,344
You see,

792
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,180
I can kill you all right here,

793
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:27,520
but then I'd be no different
from you jerks.

794
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:47,123
Shin Hyeok-u.

795
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:50,919
We're still young, you know.

796
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,755
You still have a chance.

797
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,678
<i>And the same goes for me.</i>

798
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:09,020
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

799
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:11,731
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

800
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:14,484
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

801
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:17,153
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Let's pull over for a moment.

802
00:55:17,237 --> 00:55:18,363
Shin Myeong-hwi!

803
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:21,116
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

804
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:23,827
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

805
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,454
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

806
00:55:26,538 --> 00:55:29,791
-My gosh!
-Mr. Mayor, we're rooting for you!

807
00:55:29,874 --> 00:55:32,210
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Thank you very much.

808
00:55:32,294 --> 00:55:34,087
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor! Over here!

809
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,797
-My gosh.
-Congratulations, sir.

810
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,923
Thank you.

811
00:55:37,674 --> 00:55:39,426
You have our support!

812
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:41,011
You can't become president.

813
00:55:41,678 --> 00:55:43,221
-Who are you?
-Oh, it's okay.

814
00:55:44,848 --> 00:55:46,391
JUNGJIN'S NEW HOPE

815
00:55:54,983 --> 00:55:58,987
I should work even harder
to earn your support.

816
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:02,615
I'll take you down at all costs.

817
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:04,242
-Hey!
-What's your problem?

818
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:06,286
-What are you doing?
-Get lost, you punk!

819
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:09,664
-What's your problem?
-Everyone, please. It's okay.

820
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:11,666
Sir, we should get going.

821
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:19,549
-Mr. Mayor!
-We're rooting for you!

822
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:20,925
-Mr. Mayor!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

823
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:23,345
-You've got us!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

824
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:25,847
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

825
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,349
-Stay strong!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

826
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:28,391
Our president!

827
00:56:28,475 --> 00:56:29,976
-Our president!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

828
00:56:41,863 --> 00:56:44,282
WE'LL START THE JOB TODAY

EONNI'S NOODLES

830
00:56:51,664 --> 00:56:54,125
I rarely spot evil spirits these days.

831
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:56,836
Don't you think it's odd?

832
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,089
Maybe your radar is broken.

833
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:01,633
No, it is really strange.

834
00:57:08,598 --> 00:57:11,226
The vacation villa murder
Detective Kim told us about.

835
00:57:11,309 --> 00:57:14,437
One was level one,
and the other one was level three.

836
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:16,689
Two evil spirits did it together.

837
00:57:16,773 --> 00:57:18,233
Can they recognize each other?

838
00:57:21,027 --> 00:57:23,738
Let's call the old man tomorrow
and ask him.

839
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:25,824
Okay.

840
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:33,164
Mun loves bulgogi.

841
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36,167
But Mun's not here.

842
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:39,629
My goodness.
Talk about unrequited love, Ms. Chu.

843
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:41,256
Oh, boy.

844
00:57:42,465 --> 00:57:45,135
<i>Hey! I told you not to go that way.</i>

845
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:48,930
What is it? Did you spot one?

846
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:50,765
Just the voice.

847
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:53,017
-Sounds like he's nearby.
-Where?

848
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:55,729
<i>What is there?</i>

849
00:57:55,812 --> 00:57:58,356
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

850
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:01,067
There are two.

851
00:58:01,818 --> 00:58:03,111
What level?

852
00:58:04,404 --> 00:58:06,030
You don't see anything?

853
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:07,490
Here, look.

854
00:58:07,574 --> 00:58:10,618
Hazy like smoke. It feels like fog.

855
00:58:11,745 --> 00:58:12,996
"Hazy like smoke"?

856
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,290
<i>Hazy like smoke.</i>

857
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,959
<i>It feels like a cold fog.</i>

858
00:58:22,046 --> 00:58:23,590
It's what Ji Cheong-sin said.

859
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:28,261
He must be gathering evil spirits.

860
00:58:28,344 --> 00:58:29,429
What?

861
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,229
<i>It's that bitch.</i>

862
00:58:41,357 --> 00:58:43,193
What did you just say?

863
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,321
I didn't say anything.

864
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:48,948
<i>The woman who's tied up inside.</i>

865
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:01,836
That bastard…

866
00:59:02,462 --> 00:59:04,005
Is he here to get me out?

867
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:15,350
EMERGENCY CONVOY

868
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,884
No!

869
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:54,848
Are you all right?

870
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:01,312
Are you So Mun?

871
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:02,355
Sorry?

874
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,421
Don't come here, Mo-tak.

875
01:01:08,504 --> 01:01:10,089
-Mun!
-Just wait a little longer!

876
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:13,134
Ms. Chu!

877
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:16,012
They're all dying because of me!

878
01:01:16,095 --> 01:01:17,138
Don't do it!

879
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:20,433
It's the return of the prodigal son.

880
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:21,768
I'm getting scared now.

881
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:24,437
I think I might really become president.

882
01:01:25,396 --> 01:01:27,857
My memories are back.

883
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:29,984
-Su-ho's soul could dissipate.
-What?

884
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:31,444
Shock!

885
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:33,404
Ms. Chu…

886
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:35,031
