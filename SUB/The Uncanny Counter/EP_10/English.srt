1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:06,969
THE UNCANNY COUNTER

2
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,623
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

3
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:18,874
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,961
You'll be stripped of your rights
as a Counter

5
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:25,214
and also lose your life.

6
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:29,927
We're aware.

7
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:33,847
-Now, we'll wrap up the hearing--
-Before we wrap up…

8
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,727
I'd like to say something.

9
00:00:47,236 --> 00:00:49,446
Regardless of the number of warnings,

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,909
I believe Counter 1543 So Mun…

11
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:57,663
should be dismissed.

12
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,810
Based on my observations,

13
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:24,314
I've concluded that he does not qualify
to work as a Counter.

14
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,734
-Wi-gen.
-What?

15
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:28,110
-He's not qualified?
-Why?

16
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,278
Why would you say that?

17
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,321
-What are you saying?
-Silence!

18
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:35,909
This isn't a place to argue.

19
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:37,828
Tell me why I should be dismissed.

20
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,458
He has difficulty
controlling his emotions,

21
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:46,378
so we had to reevaluate
his qualifications as a Counter.

22
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:49,757
I took time to reflect on what I did
and I deeply regret it.

23
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:54,803
You were able to keep your job
as a Counter thanks to Ms. Chu.

24
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:59,725
But you haven't changed at all.

25
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,561
Mun, you can't do this alone.

26
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,188
The others will be there soon.

27
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,314
Join them.

28
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:10,027
No. We may never catch Ji Cheong-sin
if we lose him this time.

29
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,033
Say it again.

30
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,994
What did you do to my parents?
You disgusting bastard!

31
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,209
He failed to control his emotions

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,378
and endangered his life

33
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,090
as well as Yung.

34
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:35,427
Mun!

35
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:37,679
Ha-na.

36
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:39,723
It's okay, Mun. You'll be okay.

37
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:42,184
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen!

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,521
Contact the Counters

39
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:49,191
and tell them to go find Mun.

40
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,904
Things like this never happened
before he joined us.

41
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,740
Respect for each other's lives

42
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:00,410
and a sense of partnership
were the basis of our relationship.

43
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,162
All right. Okay, Gi-ran.

44
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:05,332
We'll be more careful from now on.

45
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:07,000
I agree

46
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:10,587
that Mun should be stripped
of his rights as a Counter.

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,593
Had he waited for his teammates,

48
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:20,389
we wouldn't have lost Ji Cheong-sin.

49
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,474
Since we kept losing our targets,

50
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,689
evil spirits had chances
to learn enough about Counters.

51
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:31,066
This is it.

52
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,861
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

53
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,698
Hazy like smoke.

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,284
It feels like a cold fog.

55
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,208
That evil spirit…

56
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,713
now knows how to avoid Yung's territories.

57
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,048
That bastard killed his parents.

58
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,469
I'm older, but I would've had a hard time
staying calm and collected too.

59
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:03,140
Think of how he must've felt
at that moment.

60
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,434
Can you please try putting yourself
in his shoes?

61
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:09,271
He's really trying
to put his emotions in check.

62
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:10,606
You see, Mun is…

63
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:14,067
He's really trying his best.

64
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,362
His vengeful thoughts are the problem,
Ms. Chu.

65
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,589
I warned you that you'd get it all back,
twofold!

66
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:41,470
-Hey!
-Hands off! Let go!

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,894
Mun has occasionally exhibited
the urge to murder.

68
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,273
No.

69
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:56,443
I never… That is not true.

70
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:57,402
Mun.

71
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,821
The emotions that you feel,

72
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,657
I feel it all too.

73
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,493
You admit it, don't you?

74
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,086
I'm holding back my emotions.

75
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,630
You know that I didn't kill anyone!

76
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,715
My contract said nothing
about my emotions.

77
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,133
-Am I wrong?
-Mun.

78
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:23,971
I'll announce our decision.

79
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,474
The committee has decided

80
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:31,478
to dismiss Counter 1543 So Mun
from his position.

81
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:36,650
What do we do?

82
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:41,113
Wi-gen, go ahead and terminate
your contract with So Mun.

83
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:51,915
Come forward, Mun.

84
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,978
I…

85
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,647
cannot

86
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,983
accept this decision.

87
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:21,153
You're right.

88
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:25,490
Wi-gen, I didn't think I'd end up
putting you in danger. I'm sorry.

89
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:27,075
I'm really sorry,

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,412
but can you please give me
one more chance?

91
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,248
My mom and dad…

92
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,169
are locked inside Ji Cheong-sin's body.

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,213
My parents…

94
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:42,799
are locked inside that bastard.

95
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:45,010
They've been locked in there
for seven years.

96
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:49,598
I don't know
when their souls will dissipate.

97
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,434
I must save my parents
with my own two hands.

98
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,687
And until the day I save them,

99
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,064
I…

100
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:00,525
I cannot quit this job.

101
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,700
With the powers bestowed upon you
by the heavens,

102
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,745
if you feel the urge to kill,

103
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,958
you're no different from an evil spirit.

104
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,836
Wi-gen.

105
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,722
-Mun!
-Mun!

106
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:32,224
-Mun!
-Mun!

107
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:33,642
Hey, Mun!

108
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,560
-Hey, Mun.
-Mun!

109
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:36,895
-Mun!
-Mun!

110
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,021
Mun!

111
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:41,900
What's with him?

112
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,362
Mun…

113
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,530
-Mun.
-What's wrong?

114
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:47,781
Mun.

115
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:50,367
Mun. Don't tell me
he's relapsed into a coma.

116
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,119
He won't die, right?

117
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:54,079
Mun, wake up. Mun!

118
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:55,163
Mun.

119
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:15,183
Mun.

120
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,030
My goodness! What's wrong with him?

121
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:30,282
Hey, what's going on?

122
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:35,245
He is…

123
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:37,998
no longer a Counter.

124
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,708
What?

125
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,209
How did that happen?

126
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:43,253
What did you guys do up there?

127
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:53,972
<i>Ha-na, erase Mun's memories.</i>

128
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,056
What?

129
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:59,060
What's wrong? What are they saying now?

130
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:01,855
Why?

131
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:03,940
Why must we erase his memories?

132
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:08,695
It's not like he'll tell people about us!

133
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,989
<i>Then you'll all get a warning,</i>

134
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,367
<i>which means</i>
<i>Ha-na will automatically be dismissed.</i>

135
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,746
<i>Try to understand</i>
<i>the gravity of the situation.</i>

136
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:26,338
I'll do it.

137
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,643
I understand that you guys
don't want to erase Mun's memories.

138
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:43,063
The memories of working together
while risking your lives.

139
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,107
But…

140
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,236
must it be done?

141
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,616
I must track down the person
who killed my parents, you know.

142
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,495
And I have to remember
what my fellow Counters look like.

143
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,622
You must forget everything, Mun.

144
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,752
We have no choice.

145
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,469
Wait, just a second.

146
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:15,971
Please, wait…

147
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:32,612
All right.

148
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:35,615
Goodbye, Mun.

149
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:01,933
Oh, dear.

150
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:05,520
I found him passed out
in front of the house.

151
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:07,480
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

152
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:10,025
Hold on. The nearest hospital is…

153
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,818
No, he'll be fine.

154
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:14,237
He just needs some rest.

155
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:16,114
He'll feel better soon.

156
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,032
My gosh.

157
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:20,035
Is he ill?

158
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:22,329
Gosh.

159
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,840
Honey, Mun is walking.

160
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,136
My gosh, Mun.

161
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:44,684
Gosh, I'm so happy for you.

162
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,527
Both of you are incredibly kind
and warmhearted.

163
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,072
No wonder

164
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,617
Mun's grown into such a purehearted,
wonderful boy.

165
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:38,196
-He's here.
-Do you think I can do a good job?

166
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,701
Wake up, Ha-na!

167
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:46,329
For your information,
I'm not good at comforting people.

168
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,415
I've only been comforted.
I haven't done it myself.

169
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,668
Is it good?

170
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,841
We won't lose anyone in this photo.

171
00:12:58,591 --> 00:12:59,467
I promise you that.

172
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:03,221
Let's try that again.

173
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:17,819
JI CHEONG-SIN, SO GWON, HA MUN-YEONG

174
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,117
That's enough.

175
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,622
At this rate, I'll lose you…

176
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:30,957
JI CHEONG-SIN

177
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,041
…and even Ha-na…

178
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,001
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

179
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:34,210
…before we catch them.

180
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:35,420
CHO TAE-SIN

181
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:37,922
Mun can…

182
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,009
still get through his life, but for us…

183
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,804
It'll be the end of us, Mo-tak.

184
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:59,152
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

185
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,362
These rats are the problem.

186
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,658
On the day that Mr. Mayor
declared his candidacy?

187
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:08,411
Why show up suddenly

188
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,413
after playing dead all this time?

189
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:13,666
Was he waiting for the right time
to get revenge?

190
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,877
It doesn't look like he'll give up easily.

191
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:17,796
Ga Mo-tak is determined

192
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:21,883
to find Kim Yeong-nim's corpse
in the reservoir no matter what.

193
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:27,722
Kill him.

194
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:30,767
Well…

195
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,852
Sir, the thing is…

196
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,147
There's something you should see.

197
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:47,116
Who are these freaks, really?

198
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:03,258
You can't come in here.

199
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,470
Hey, who are you?

200
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,355
What's going on outside?

201
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:23,278
Anyone outside?

202
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:25,989
You can't let in all sorts of riffraff!

203
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:29,242
Who are you?

204
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:35,707
What the hell do you want?

205
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,758
-Ji Cheong-sin?
-How dare you?

206
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:46,968
Stop.

207
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:50,597
You may leave.

208
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:56,102
We need to talk.

209
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:02,233
You can't catch those rats
without my help.

210
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,903
Get me off the wanted list,

211
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,905
and I'll take care of it.

212
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,037
You want to strike a deal?

213
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,332
Hand over the ledger first.

214
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,629
Mr. Bae's ledger,

215
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,672
hand that over first.

216
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,654
Rather than getting you off the list,

217
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,115
how about you just get caught?

218
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:54,661
If you get caught and cause a stir,

219
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,957
my approval rating
will probably bounce back.

220
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:13,805
Let's do that, okay?

221
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:17,308
"Cause a stir"? How big of a stir?

222
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:54,595
Mun! Are you up?

223
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,057
Yes. I'll be right out.

224
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:33,301
Oh, you're up! You little rascal.

225
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,928
Gosh, Grandma.
Did you have a good night's sleep?

226
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,347
Good morning.

227
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,975
Look what I have!

228
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:42,643
What? Grandma.

229
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,354
-That's mine.
-No, it's mine.

230
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:48,316
-Grandma, yours is in the bathroom.
-No, this is mine.

231
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,317
Give it back!

232
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,152
-It's mine!
-Mun.

233
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,653
Come and eat first.

234
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:54,113
I'll get you a new toothbrush.

235
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:58,117
-Gosh, Grandma.
-Hey.

236
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,453
An old man was here.

237
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:02,288
-An old man?
-Yes.

238
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,582
With a mustache like this and…

239
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,001
And with glasses.

240
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,378
-A mustache like this?
-Yes.

241
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,257
He said you're purehearted and wonderful.

242
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:14,175
What?

243
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:18,179
So this is mine, okay?

244
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:20,723
-No, give it back!
-No, it's mine.

245
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,058
-Grandma!
-No, it's mine!

246
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:23,935
-It's mine.
-Enough! Come and eat.

247
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,311
-Goodness.
-See?

248
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,063
-It's mine.
-Want it?

249
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:28,564
Snatch it if you can!

250
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:31,067
JUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

251
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,153
SHIN MYEONG-HWI
SHIN ON-AIR INCIDENT, CHO TAE-SIN

252
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,447
This is insane.

253
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,450
Mayor Shin is screwed.

254
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,120
You jerk. You're smirking?

255
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,622
How's Assemblyman Choi doing?

256
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:45,832
Great, Mayor Shin.

257
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:49,585
Hey, come here!

258
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:51,170
Come on, quick!

259
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:52,547
-What is it?
-Look, over there.

260
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:54,549
What's going on?

261
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,635
Look.

262
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,266
Why is that moron limping again?

263
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,183
Exactly.

264
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,238
What kind of show is this?

265
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:22,451
See? I told you.
This asshole's just doing this for show.

266
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,502
-Whoa.
-What's going on?

267
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:32,837
Hey, you were wrong.

268
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:37,300
I'm throwing this far away!

269
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,261
Hey, what the hell?

270
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:42,847
Act up all you want.

271
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,682
Go ahead and act up all you want.

272
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,857
Hey, Ung-min. Isn't this Mun's?

273
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,235
-Mun!
-Mun!

274
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:02,116
Jeez, calm down.

275
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,242
What happened to him?

276
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,578
Seriously? First thing in the morning?

277
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,537
Out of the way.

278
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:08,539
Move! Out of the way!

279
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:10,374
Why are you guys all here?

280
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,880
Hey, how did you fall?

281
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:17,298
Be careful.

282
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,642
He tripped and fell.

283
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:30,394
You guys are supposed to lie low. Go.

284
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,855
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,485
I got scared for no reason.

286
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,362
-Let's whack him soon.
-Sounds good.

287
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,075
What are you all doing? Go back inside!

288
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:47,161
Go back to your classroom. Now!

289
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:49,664
Go.

290
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:54,210
Are you all right?

291
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:56,712
Hey, what happened?

292
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:57,922
With what?

293
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,716
Your leg! It had healed.

294
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:02,885
Really?

295
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:06,138
My leg? That's impossible.

296
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:07,139
This is nuts.

297
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,602
Hey.

298
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,479
He doesn't have a fever.

299
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:16,315
Hey, you told us your leg had been healed.

300
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,566
And right here, you…

301
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:20,069
You walked like this right here.

302
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,195
What?

303
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:23,280
Mun.

304
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:24,198
My gosh.

305
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:41,757
Su-ho.

306
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:51,809
Here for Mun?

307
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:54,270
Yes, that's right.

308
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,689
Is there anything we can do?

309
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:59,108
Shall I file a complaint?

310
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,444
Can we appeal the decision?

311
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:02,903
Is there no way to revert it?

312
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:05,656
Wi-gen has already started meeting
with other candidates.

313
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,367
We'll hire his replacement soon, okay?

314
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:12,121
Good luck with that. You'll never find
anyone who's as good as him.

315
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,914
You threw away a huge asset.

316
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:15,791
You guys will regret it big time.

317
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:19,462
Come on, Ms. Chu.

318
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:22,798
You guys should take this
as an opportunity to set things right.

319
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,592
That secret Mo-tak spilled,

320
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,510
erase it when the spirit's summoned.

321
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,433
I feel so bad for Mun.
My heart breaks for him.

322
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:38,898
Su-ho.

323
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:41,275
You know what it's like.

324
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,694
It's devastating

325
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,989
for parents and their child
to be separated by death

326
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:50,076
when they aren't even ready.

327
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:55,372
We know how awful that is.

328
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,425
I miss you so much
even while looking at you like this.

329
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,345
That poor thing must be so sad.

330
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,061
Su-ho.

331
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:20,898
We must help Mun
so that he can meet his parents again.

332
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:23,567
Do something, please.

333
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:28,197
Gosh, Mom. Why are you crying?

334
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,534
Okay, I'll try to persuade the others.

335
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:32,701
All right.

336
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:37,623
And why do you have so much gray hair now?
It makes me sad.

337
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:44,505
Kang Se-hyeon also said no?

338
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:46,882
That's right. It's not easy, you know.

339
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:49,385
Everyone says no
upon finding out it's dangerous.

340
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:52,263
I have a huge respect for our partners
who said yes.

341
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:54,807
We should be grateful to our partners.

342
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,058
I already know that.

343
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:00,521
There's only one candidate left.

344
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,986
Su-ho, can you put together
another list of candidates?

345
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:11,115
Those who are physically fit for the job
were all on the list I gave you.

346
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,911
How about we give Mun his job back?

347
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:19,707
The level-three evil spirits
make me anxious every day.

348
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:23,627
Even if we find someone,
training a new partner will take a while.

349
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:25,087
No, not Mun.

350
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:30,593
OH HYE-MI

351
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,094
LEE SEON-HO

352
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:34,138
"Lee Seon-ho."

353
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:38,684
He fell into a coma after saving
a neighbor's kid when a fire broke out.

354
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,438
Kind and righteous.
He's an excellent candidate.

355
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:45,441
Let's meet him.

356
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:49,403
Eat up.

357
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:52,489
Excuse me! Can we get more kimchi?

358
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,574
It's self-serve…

359
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:56,076
KIMCHI IS SELF-SERVE

360
00:25:58,787 --> 00:25:59,705
Sure, just a moment.

361
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,159
Mr. Lee Seon-ho?

362
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:39,912
Yes?

363
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:41,830
You are Mr. Lee Seon-ho,

364
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:44,375
the 55-year-old male
who lives in Jeonghan-dong?

365
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,710
How can I help you?

366
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:49,421
We're glad you made it here safely.

367
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:50,881
What? I came here?

368
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,009
All I did was answer
when you called my name.

369
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:59,431
That answer brought you here, Mr. Lee.

370
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:04,228
I was just

371
00:27:04,311 --> 00:27:06,438
relaxing on the bench,

372
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,565
looking at the park.

373
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:12,486
This weather and this air.

374
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:15,864
I don't know
if I've seen and felt this before,

375
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:19,243
but I feel as if I've finally come
to the place I missed.

376
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:25,040
I'll be fine even if this day never ends.

377
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,210
Mr. Lee Seon-ho.

378
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,504
We have a favor to ask of you.

379
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,256
If you decide to do it,

380
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:35,050
we can wake you up right away.

381
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:40,597
<i>You've been in a coma for a month.</i>

382
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:42,808
<i>You can't move at all.</i>

383
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:45,227
<i>Your family is having a really hard time.</i>

384
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:46,687
If you decide to sign with us,

385
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:49,440
we can wake you up from your coma.

386
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,026
Coma?

387
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:02,119
Can't I just sit here and enjoy
the sounds of birds and the wind?

388
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,629
If you stay in your current state,
you'll die soon.

389
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,631
While working as a firefighter,

390
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:16,550
I jumped in headfirst to help others

391
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,637
and made my wife suffer.

392
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,014
Mr. Lee.

393
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,726
I'm exhausted.

394
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:29,229
Now, I want to be…

395
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:33,442
reunited with my wife in heaven

396
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,403
and rest in peace with her.

397
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:49,833
Seon-ho.

398
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:54,880
Seon-ho.

399
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:08,727
JUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

400
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,960
-Why hide?
-Gosh! Hey, you scared me.

401
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:36,338
You didn't do anything wrong.

402
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:37,548
When did you get here?

403
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:39,925
Jeez.

404
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,803
Why hide? You know he won't recognize us.

405
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,347
Oh, you're right.

406
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:47,307
He seems well.

407
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:49,059
Let's go.

408
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:53,105
Okay, let's go.

409
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,239
Come on out.

410
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,870
You'd better show yourself
before I lose it.

411
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,292
This prick…

412
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:18,046
Didn't you have an affair with my wife?

413
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:22,801
Now, you want to live
and don't even care about her?

414
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,765
Come out, you little shit!

415
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:34,688
I'll kill you.

416
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:48,702
Please… Don't kill me, please.

417
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,954
Please don't kill me.

418
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,333
Hey, please. Please don't…

419
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:55,459
Die!

420
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:14,561
There's no way it was done by a human.
It's impossible. Could it be…

421
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:16,438
That's right. It was an evil spirit.

422
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,900
This one is on Ji Cheong-sin's level.

423
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,401
Higher than level three.

424
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:25,531
Here's a suspect.

425
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,370
If he's on Ji Cheong-sin's level…

426
00:31:31,453 --> 00:31:33,247
Does he also use psychokinesis?

427
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,748
That's possible.

428
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:36,959
Or pure physical strength.

429
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:40,003
We have to catch him soon,
or he'll cause big trouble.

430
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:43,173
Were they both killed by the same person?

431
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:44,466
Yes.

432
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,426
Are you sure?

433
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,971
The female victim is the suspect's wife.

434
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,974
She cheated on him with the male victim.

435
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:54,059
And they died at the same location.

436
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,103
Was the woman killed first?

437
00:31:57,312 --> 00:31:59,314
Why do you ask? What is it?

438
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:01,191
The time gap between the two murders?

439
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,360
Five minutes?
I'd say, ten minutes at the most?

440
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,988
Based on the blood viscosity, that is.

441
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:12,119
Doesn't this look like it was done
by a level-one evil spirit?

442
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:13,954
-I'd say it's pretty ordinary.
-Yes.

443
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:17,791
Is it possible to level up like this
in just five to ten minutes?

444
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:24,631
This… wasn't done by the same spirit.

445
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:26,842
Two were involved.

446
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:36,643
Hey, Han-ul.

447
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:40,731
What?

448
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:50,032
<i>Suspected serial killer Ji Cheong-sin</i>
<i>was found dead in a burnt-out vehicle,</i>

449
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:53,702
<i>which he had stolen while on the run.</i>

450
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,787
<i>When the police arrived at the scene,</i>

451
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:57,915
<i>the vehicle was completely burnt out,</i>

452
00:32:57,998 --> 00:33:00,459
<i>and a burnt body was found</i>
<i>in the driver's seat.</i>

453
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:03,170
-<i>The police have stated that</i>
-I'm home!

454
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:05,005
-<i>the body was severely damaged.</i>
-Hi.

455
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:07,424
<i>The National Forensic Service</i>

462
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,189
No.

463
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:27,319
Grandpa, this can't be happening.

464
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,364
What's wrong, Mun?

465
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:33,992
Mom…

466
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:37,621
<i>Footage from nearby surveillance cameras</i>
<i>and dashcams showed no evidence</i>

467

00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:46,922
Mun's parents.

470
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:49,883
This means their souls have dissipated.

471
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,136
No, that can't be.

472
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:56,181
These bastards are putting on a show.

473
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:58,809
<i>Police are trying to determine</i>
<i>if additional crimes were committed.</i>

474

-It's him?

483

-When will the autopsy be done?
-the cause of death?

488
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:37,264
-This is nuts.
-A comment, please.

489
00:34:37,347 --> 00:34:39,057

Ji Cheong-sin didn't leave
any DNA evidence at the murder scenes,

521
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:30,035
so we can't make a comparison.

522
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,664
Height, 181 cm. Shoe size, 275 mm.

523
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,333
No, I told you this isn't him.

524
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,085
He felt cornered by the cops,
so he killed himself?

525
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:41,713
-No way.
-I also find it hard to believe,

526
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,133
but the prints we lifted
from the belongings and glass shards

527
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:47,511
matched Ji Cheong-sin's fingerprints.

528
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:48,720
We found

529
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:51,348
the broken glass piece he used to hurt Mun

530
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,391

How did this happen?

00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,607
We have no evidence
to prove that he's not Ji Cheong-sin.

534
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:04,986
Jeong-yeong, can we check
for bone fractures?

00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:07,697

537
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,703
I broke his wrist and rib.

00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:16,873
In the autopsy report…

539
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:18,875
Nothing about fractures.

540
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:21,211
Let's check the X-rays.

541
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:25,590
Jeez, those evil bastards.

542
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:29,010
They used someone else's corpse.

543
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:32,180
But this means
Ji Cheong-sin is still alive.

544
00:37:32,264 --> 00:37:35,183
So I still have a chance
to find my parents, right?

545
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:40,230
But we're not sure if they did this

546
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:43,567
or if Ji Cheong-sin staged this
on his own.

547
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,568
It's obvious.

548
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:46,444
Those bastards staged this.

549
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:48,530
Mayor Shin has become a hero.

550
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,657
For taking down the serial killer.

551
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,326
And no one's talking
about the illegal dumping anymore.

552
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:54,869
Jeong-yeong.

553
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:57,914
You're investigating
the illegal dumping case, right?

554
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:00,542
We dug up the case
my dad was working on seven years ago.

555
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,627
It won't get buried again, right?

556
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:05,755
We're interviewing Noh Hang-gyu
as a witness

557
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,133
-at the moment, but…
-Just for formality's sake?

558
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,768
Hey, buddy.

559
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:19,936
Mun.

560
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:23,106
Mun.

561
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,154
Let's go have some noodles.

562
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,782
Ms. Chu misses you a lot.

563
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:34,701
When you…

564
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:38,538
and Ms. Chu came to my school,

565
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:40,123
I saw you guys.

566
00:38:51,718 --> 00:38:52,927
You saw us?

567
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:58,600
What happened? How do you
still remember everything?

568
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,979
Chairman Choi left all the memories intact

569
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:06,483
so I could at least run away
if I were to run into Ji Cheong-sin.

570
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:09,569
Ji Cheong-sin…

571
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:11,905
We'll catch him.

572
00:39:13,323 --> 00:39:15,283
-At all costs.
-Mo-tak.

573
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:18,745
Nothing has changed.

574
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:22,957
Those bastards aren't even hurt
after everything we did.

575
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:26,336
Ji Cheong-sin, who killed my parents,
is free now.

576
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:29,381
Cho Tae-sin owns one of
the top 50 companies, and the mayor…

577
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:32,592
he's running for president.

578
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:35,136
I feel like…

579
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,432
all of this is a big fat lie.

580
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:42,143
Why do you think nothing has changed?

581
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:44,229
You've changed.

582
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:46,022
And…

583
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:47,982
so have I.

584
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:52,654
Mo-tak.

585
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,073
Please don't tell Ha-na

586
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:57,033
that I remember everything.

587
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:58,576
If she gets another warning,

588
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,120
she'll be dismissed.

589
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,670
I'll also keep it from Ms. Chu.

590
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:11,214
Come by the restaurant.

591
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:14,926
I'll play dumb and give you extra food.

592
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:18,096
Bring your friends, okay?

593
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,108
As a cop,

594
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:33,069
you must be so embarrassed right now.

595
00:40:33,862 --> 00:40:35,071
Right?

596
00:40:38,491 --> 00:40:39,909
Let's go get the warrant.

597
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:41,494
Warrant?

598
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:46,416
We should at least put Noh Hang-gyu
behind bars.

599
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:57,469
"Ji Cheong-sin,"
"burnt corpse," "serial killer."

600
00:40:57,552 --> 00:40:59,971
Keep pumping out articles
to make sure those keywords

601
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:01,264
keep trending.

602
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:04,350
As for the dumping site,
turn it into a real estate issue.

603
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:07,854
If ICT's phase-3 development
faces a problem, trillions of won

604
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:11,441
will be lost and companies will go bust.
The housing prices will also crash.

605
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:13,902
Interview angry homeowners
and run it as a headline.

606
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:18,198
And get some real estate experts
on the show and have them hype it up.

607
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:22,285
Jeez.

608
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,343
Hey, Chang-gyu.

609
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:39,969
Councilman Ham In-pyo.

610
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:42,931
How's it going?

611
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:48,561
All done.

612
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:50,688
We got something naughty for you.

613
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:53,358
Good, okay.

614
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:59,239
Sorry for the trouble. You can leave now.

615
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,450
Thank you, Chief.

616
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:11,167
Did the interview go well?

617
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:16,130
The thing is though…

618
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:20,802
I'm sorry, but we need you to stay here
for a bit longer.

619
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:22,804
What the heck is this about?

620
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:23,888
Hey, Jeong-yeong!

621
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:29,102
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu, you're under arrest
for abetting attempted murder.

622
00:42:29,185 --> 00:42:30,019
ARREST WARRANT

623
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:31,813
Murder?

624
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:37,151
"Get Ga Mo-tak
and lock him in your warehouse.

625
00:42:39,988 --> 00:42:42,991
I must see him breathe his last breath
with my own two eyes."

626
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:45,952
There, you wanted me dead.

627
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:50,081
You whacked me and buried me.

628
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:52,292
I warned you that you'd no longer

629
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:55,128
have it so easy.

630
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:58,214
This jerk is a councilman.

631
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:00,008
Maybe I should run for a seat too.

632
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:01,593
You, on the city council? Please.

633
00:43:01,676 --> 00:43:03,094
Hang-gyu should do it.

634
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:04,888
He should run for a seat

635
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,222
in the National Assembly.

636
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,682
The city council's too small.

637
00:43:10,184 --> 00:43:13,146
-Number one, Noh Chang-gyu.
-Number two, Lim Jae-cheol.

638
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:16,316
What the hell?

639
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:18,443
Noh Chang-gyu, Lim Jae-cheol.

640
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:24,198
You're under arrest for the attempted
murder of Ga Mo-tak and three others.

641
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:26,200
Cuff them.

642
00:43:28,202 --> 00:43:29,537
-Hey, hold on.
-Look.

643
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:31,331
-Hey, that hurts!
-Wait, hold on.

644
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:32,999
-I don't know anything.
-Hold on.

645
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:34,125
-Hey.
-Wait.

646
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:37,170
<i>Hey, are they gone?</i>

647
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:39,589
<i>Just said goodbye to all of them.</i>

648
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:45,136
Do you have evidence?

649
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:48,097
We've also arrested Noh Chang-gyu
and Lim Jae-cheol.

650
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:49,933
They're on their way here now.

651
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:52,852
Will you make your brother take the fall?

652
00:43:53,728 --> 00:43:54,604
Also,

653
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:57,398
we found this tracker

654
00:43:57,482 --> 00:43:59,359
under the damaged vehicle.

655
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:03,488
And we verified it through the app
on Noh Chang-gyu's phone.

656
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:12,914
Here, Noh Chang-gyu's phone.

657
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,878
This will tell us…

658
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:24,634
what kind of things
you and your brother talked about.

659
00:44:27,637 --> 00:44:28,763
You guys had been

660
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,141
way too confident.

661
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:57,917
<i>The vehicle was completely burnt out,</i>

662
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,045
<i>and a burnt body was found</i>
<i>in the driver's seat.</i>

663
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:02,547
<i>The body was…</i>

664
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,764
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
LEE JAE-HOON

665
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,436
PASSPORT
LEE JAE-HOON

666
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,280
<i>As Ji Cheong-sin was suspected</i>
<i>of going on the run</i>

667
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:29,365
<i>after committing three serial murders,</i>

668
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:32,535
<i>police are trying to determine</i>

669
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:47,049
Goodness.

670
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:48,718
You're spilling it everywhere.

671
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,220
Do a better job if you want to get paid,
you moron.

672
00:45:52,764 --> 00:45:54,056
-Okay.
-Jeez.

673
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:08,946
-Is it him?
-<i>No.</i>

674
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,323
<i>It's that skinny one.</i>

675
00:46:11,991 --> 00:46:15,119
<i>Our friend inside him hasn't woken up yet.</i>

676
00:46:18,748 --> 00:46:19,665
Who are you?

677
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,503
Hey, who are you?

678
00:46:26,672 --> 00:46:28,299
Are you a cop?

679
00:46:28,382 --> 00:46:29,759
No.

680
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:31,344
I'm your savior.

681
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,721
"Savior"?

682
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,098
What a nutjob.

683
00:46:36,182 --> 00:46:37,099
Just be on your way.

684
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:39,060
Mind your own business.

685
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:40,520
And you, come with us.

686
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:44,440
-How dare you barge in here?
-I said, mind your own business.

687
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:02,458
You see it now?

688
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:06,295
What… What is this?

689
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,548
What we live on.

690
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,550
What we live on?

691
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:22,728
So, what do you say?

692
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:26,774
Will you come with me or just die here?

693
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:37,629
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

694
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:40,173
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

695
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:43,093
Shin Myeong-hwi for president!

696
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:44,552
-Shin Myeong-hwi
-Thank you.

697
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:46,888
-for president!
-Thank you! Yes, thank you.

698
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:48,056
My gosh.

699
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,891
-Our president!
-Thank you.

700
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,685
Shin Myeong-hwi!

701
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:55,981
SHIN MYEONG-HWI RECEIVES
HIGHEST FAVORABILITY RATING

702
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:09,077
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

703
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,954
<i>He's in a meeting now.</i>

704
00:48:11,037 --> 00:48:12,872
Tell him again

705
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,500
to call me when the meeting is over.

706
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,129
I may not be able to pick up,

707
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:21,047
so he can call Chief Choi.

708
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:23,591
Okay, I'll let him know.

709
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:35,311
Hey.

710
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:39,816
Send him some food.

711
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:40,734
Yes, sir.

712
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,908
What about the Ji Cheong-sin case?

713
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:53,371
Since the prime suspect is dead,
the case will automatically be closed.

714
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:57,167
So the murder case itself will be closed?

715
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:03,590
Chairman Jeon too?

716
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:05,884
Yes, sir.

717
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:09,137
Nice and easy.

718
00:49:11,306 --> 00:49:13,558
I have to say, I think Mayor Shin…

719
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:16,853
is a genius.

720
00:49:26,696 --> 00:49:28,948
MAYOR SHIN, WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

721
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,076
WE SUPPORT SHIN MYEONG-HWI
NO MATTER WHAT

722
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:36,289
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

723
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:38,750
PLEASE PROTECT JUNGJIN

724
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,633
I was never interested…

725
00:49:48,927 --> 00:49:50,470
in running for president.

726
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,597
Making Jungjin

727
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:56,476
the happiest city on earth

728
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,686
was my only wish and goal.

729
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,854
However,

730
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:04,651
dealing with all the nasty,
awful attempts to slander me…

731
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,695
<i>has made me realize that…</i>

732
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,491
<i>their target isn't me.</i>
<i>They're trying to attack…</i>

733
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,868
<i>the innocent civilians who want peace.</i>

734
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:16,496
<i>For the citizens of our democratic nation,</i>

735
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:18,289
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

736
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:21,668
<i>I, Shin Myeong-hwi, have decided…</i>

737
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,336
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

738
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:24,754
<i>to run for president.</i>

739
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:27,882
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

740
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:29,676
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi!</i>

741
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,096
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

742
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:35,140
SHIN MYEONG-HWI ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

743
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:42,397
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

744
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,692
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

745
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:48,653
<i>Shin Myeong-hwi for president!</i>

746
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:51,781
Jeez, you were all excited
about your dad getting screwed over.

747
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,742
Hey, this isn't about
my dad becoming president.

748
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:58,705
I may become the next president's son.
That's what I care about.

749
00:50:58,788 --> 00:51:01,124
So we're friends
with the next president's son?

750
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:03,501
Hey, the proper term is "<i>yeongsik</i>."

751
00:51:03,585 --> 00:51:04,419
Yeong-sik?

752
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:05,962
In class four?

753
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:07,672
Oh, that guy? What?

754
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:11,885
No, it's the formal term
for a presidential son. You idiots.

755
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,887
-Oh!
-I see.

756
00:51:15,597 --> 00:51:16,681
Hey, <i>Yeongsik</i>.

757
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,933
He's so childish.

758
00:51:19,017 --> 00:51:21,269
He wants to brag about it like crazy.

759
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:23,730
Everyone's trying to get on his good side
these days.

760
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:24,981
I can't stand it.

761
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,401
If my dad wins the election,

762
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:31,154
I should tell him to pay more attention
to people with disabilities.

763
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:35,617
You know the thing they ride.
The electric-powered one.

764
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,661
-This one, right?
-We should have that at school.

765
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,246
Hey, Shin Hyeok-u--

766
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,874
What, bitch?

767
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:47,587
Don't swear at my friend.

768
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,175
Just get lost.

769
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:02,644
DONGHOE AUTO SERVICE

770
00:52:03,478 --> 00:52:04,312
Come on.

771
00:52:05,063 --> 00:52:06,814
Oh, hi!

772
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:16,115
Go easy on him.

773
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:21,955
With my upgraded social status,

774
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:24,916
I must set an example
when many are watching.

775
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:31,673
My school life has gone to shit
because of you, asshole.

776
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,925
Hey, keep acting up.

777
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:36,135
Keep messing with me, you little shit!

778
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,428
Damn you!

779
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:42,141
-Damn it!
-Hey, Hyeok-u. Enough, stop it.

780
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,393
-Stop.
-Goddamn it!

781
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:46,896
-Hey, enough.
-Fine, okay. I heard you.

782
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:02,495
Do you feel better
after letting your anger out like that?

783
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:03,955
What did you say?

784
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,249
You're still talking shit?

785
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:09,085
Your inability to control your emotions

786
00:53:10,044 --> 00:53:11,087
will put you

787
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:14,173
and the people around you in danger.

788
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:17,302
Shut up, gimp.

789
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,684
This feels very familiar, doesn't it?

790
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:32,191
You're not the only one
who has to stay out of trouble.

791
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,444
You see,

792
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,280
I can kill you all right here,

793
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,620
but then I'd be no different
from you jerks.

794
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:04,223
Shin Hyeok-u.

795
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:08,019
We're still young, you know.

796
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,855
You still have a chance.

797
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,778
<i>And the same goes for me.</i>

798
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:26,120
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

799
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:28,831
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

800
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:31,584
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

801
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:34,253
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Let's pull over for a moment.

802
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,463
Shin Myeong-hwi!

803
00:54:35,546 --> 00:54:38,216
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

804
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:40,927
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

805
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,554
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

806
00:54:43,638 --> 00:54:46,891
-My gosh!
-Mr. Mayor, we're rooting for you!

807
00:54:46,974 --> 00:54:49,310
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Thank you very much.

808
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:51,187
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor! Over here!

809
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:52,897
-My gosh.
-Congratulations, sir.

810
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,023
Thank you.

811
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:56,526
You have our support!

812
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:58,111
You can't become president.

813
00:54:58,778 --> 00:55:00,321
-Who are you?
-Oh, it's okay.

814
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,491
JUNGJIN'S NEW HOPE

815
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:16,087
I should work even harder
to earn your support.

816
00:55:17,797 --> 00:55:19,715
I'll take you down at all costs.

817
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:21,342
-Hey!
-What's your problem?

818
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:23,386
-What are you doing?
-Get lost, you punk!

819
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:26,764
-What's your problem?
-Everyone, please. It's okay.

820
00:55:26,848 --> 00:55:28,766
Sir, we should get going.

821
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:36,649
-Mr. Mayor!
-We're rooting for you!

822
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:38,025
-Mr. Mayor!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

823
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:40,445
-You've got us!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

824
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:42,947
Shin Myeong-hwi! Shin Myeong-hwi!

825
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,449
-Stay strong!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

826
00:55:44,532 --> 00:55:45,491
Our president!

827
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,076
-Our president!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

828
00:55:58,963 --> 00:56:01,382
WE'LL START THE JOB TODAY

829

EONNI'S NOODLES

830
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:11,225
I rarely spot evil spirits these days.

831
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,936
Don't you think it's odd?

832
00:56:14,562 --> 00:56:16,189
Maybe your radar is broken.

833
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,733
No, it is really strange.

834
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:28,326
The vacation villa murder
Detective Kim told us about.

835
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:31,537
One was level one,
and the other one was level three.

836
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,789
Two evil spirits did it together.

837
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:35,333
Can they recognize each other?

838
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:40,838
Let's call the old man tomorrow
and ask him.

839
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:42,924
Okay.

840
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:50,264
Mun loves bulgogi.

841
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:53,267
But Mun's not here.

842
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:56,729
My goodness.
Talk about unrequited love, Ms. Chu.

843
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,356
Oh, boy.

844
00:56:59,565 --> 00:57:02,235
<i>Hey! I told you not to go that way.</i>

845
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:06,030
What is it? Did you spot one?

846
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:07,865
Just the voice.

847
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,117
-Sounds like he's nearby.
-Where?

848
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:12,829
<i>What is there?</i>

849
00:57:12,912 --> 00:57:15,456
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

850
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:18,167
There are two.

851
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,211
What level?

852
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,130
You don't see anything?

853
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:24,590
Here, look.

854
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,718
Hazy like smoke. It feels like fog.

855
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,096
"Hazy like smoke"?

856
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,390
<i>Hazy like smoke.</i>

857
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:35,059
<i>It feels like a cold fog.</i>

858
00:57:39,146 --> 00:57:40,690
It's what Ji Cheong-sin said.

859
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,361
He must be gathering evil spirits.

860
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:46,529
What?

861
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,329
<i>It's that bitch.</i>

862
00:57:58,457 --> 00:58:00,293
What did you just say?

863
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:03,421
I didn't say anything.

864
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:06,048
<i>The woman who's tied up inside.</i>

865
00:58:17,518 --> 00:58:18,936
That bastard…

866
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,105
Is he here to get me out?

867
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:32,450
EMERGENCY CONVOY

868
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:06,984
No!

869
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,948
Are you all right?

870
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,412
Are you So Mun?

871
00:59:18,496 --> 00:59:19,455
Sorry?

874
01:00:23,561 --> 01:00:25,521
Don't come here, Mo-tak.

875
01:00:25,604 --> 01:00:27,189
-Mun!
-Just wait a little longer!

876
01:00:28,899 --> 01:00:30,234
Ms. Chu!

877
01:00:30,735 --> 01:00:33,112
They're all dying because of me!

878
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:34,238
Don't do it!

879
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,533
It's the return of the prodigal son.

880
01:00:37,616 --> 01:00:38,868
I'm getting scared now.

881
01:00:39,493 --> 01:00:41,537
I think I might really become president.

882
01:00:42,496 --> 01:00:44,957
My memories are back.

883
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,084
-Su-ho's soul could dissipate.
-What?

884
01:00:47,168 --> 01:00:48,544
Shock!

885
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,504
Ms. Chu…

886
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,131
