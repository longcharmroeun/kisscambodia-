1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,712
No!

4
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,759
Are you all right?

5
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,140
Are you So Mun?

6
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,183
Sorry?

7
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,660
Let me go!

8
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,453
Let go of me!

9
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,704
Hold him tight.

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,623
Let me go!

11
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,624
-Let me go!
-Hurry.

12
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,792
Let me go!

13
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,794
You little punk.

14
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:10,964
What's with him?

15
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,341
He's not strong.

16
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,260
Hurry. Tie him up.

17
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,011
Man, I got scared for nothing.

18
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,064
If what Ha-na said is true,

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,816
what are we supposed to do?

20
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,110
We can't even take on Ji Cheong-sin alone.

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,112
How are we going to deal

22
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,905
with a herd of evil spirits?

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,366
What's he going to do
with all those evil spirits?

24
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,743
Are they going to rob a bank?

25
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,328
Anything and everything.

26
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,247
Once they get together,

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,708
there will be bloodbaths everywhere.

28
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,002
Wait a second.

29
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,880
You don't see anything? Here, look.

30
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,216
Hazy like smoke. It feels like fog.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,343
The place where I spotted the spirits.

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,430
It was Mun's neighborhood.

33
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,184
If Ji Cheong-sin had been after us…

34
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,521
Mun. No, Mun.

35
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,481
-Shit.
-He got disqualified as a Counter

36
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,233
and doesn't have the power to fight!

37
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,904
Mun's calling.

38
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,905
SO MUN

39
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,244
-Goodness.
-Mun.

40
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,914
-Mun.
-Mun?

41
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,834
-Mun!
-Mun!

42
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,569
Ji Cheong-sin.

43
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,695
Where are you?

44
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,947
Where are you, asshole?

45
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,868
Mo-tak.

46
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,536
-No…
-Hey.

47
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,459
That's the crazy bitch
from the department store.

48
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,961
-Yes.
-Mun, where are you?

49
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,129
Tell us where you are! We'll be there!

50
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,048
No, don't come.

51
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,174
You can't come here.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,344
-Your camaraderie makes me cry.
-Damn it.

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,888
Anyway, what happened to this kid?

54
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,682
I read him, and he's an idiot now.

55
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,351
He has no power

56
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,019
nor any physical strength.

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,774
Mun!

58
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,778
Mo-tak, don't come here.

59
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,030
You'll all die if you do. Don't come!

60
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,990
Don't come.

61
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,954
Derelict factory in Jungjin, 9 p.m.

62
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,125
He'll lose a finger
for every minute you're late.

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,627
Those psychos.

64
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,422
EONNI'S NOODLES

65
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,173
Evil spirits can read memories?

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,801
Yes, I'm sure they read everything
about our team,

67
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,554
so they probably know
the type of power each of us has.

68
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,808
How many evil spirits did he gather?

69
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,687
We'll get them all no matter how many.
Mun's been taken hostage.

70
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,480
EONNI'S NOODLES

71
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,027
So your side calls us evil spirits.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,280
You wanted to kill me.

73
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,909
You said you're going crazy
because you want to kill me, you bastard!

74
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,705
Did you miss
your mommy and daddy that much?

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,043
Why are you dying to see your parents?

76
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,463
What do you know?

77
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,008
You're a scumbag
who killed his own parents.

78
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,599
I will…

79
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,102
run to the ends of the earth if I must

80
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,063
to make sure I catch you.

81
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,151
Do you know what I'm most excited about?

82
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,362
That your parents who are right here…

83
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,325
will get to see you die.

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,826
That's it.

85
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,747
You asshole!

86
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,208
They're here.

87
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,712
Oh, all right.

88
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,677
No.

89
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
No…

90
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,399
Ji Cheong-sin and Baek Hyang-hui
are both level-three spirits.

91
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,860
The spirits I just saw were level two.

92
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,987
Let's move as a group.

93
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,697
Don't fight them alone.

94
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,866
I'll be your shield,

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,159
so stick right behind me…

96
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,246
and use me to defend yourself.

97
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
Be careful.

98
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,213
It's like walking into a snake's mouth.

99
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,440
I think it's this way.

100
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,717
Ms. Chu!

101
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,219
-Ms. Chu!
-Ms. Chu!

102
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,557
There's an evil spirit here.

103
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,559
He's big.

104
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,727
He's quite big in size.

105
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,405
There are two of us.

106
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,116
Ms. Chu, give us a minute.

107
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,372
I'll let you witness
your colleagues' deaths.

108
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,292
-Mo-tak.
-You two, go find Mun.

109
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,711
Go find Mun!

110
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,046
Okay.

111
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,673
Ms. Chu, hang in there for a bit.

112
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,721
Do you see that old bitch?

113
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,681
She's the healer.

114
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,016
Kill her first.

115
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,533
Honey! Babe!

116
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,618
Over here!

117
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,044
There are four.

118
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,007
Ha-na. Mo-tak.

119
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,304
It's great to have everyone here together.

120
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,806
It's like a reunion.

121
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,974
Bullshit.

122
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,976
Did you go to school?

123
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,604
All my husbands graduated
from Seoul National University.

124
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,415
Mo-tak…

125
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,790
Mun, hang in there a little longer.

126
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,809
Don't you have any respect
for the elderly?

127
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,093
There aren't too many people
who are in comas--

128
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,640
-Su-ho.
-Su-ho.

129
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,100
Su-ho!

130
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,647
Mo-tak, is something going on? Mo-tak.

131
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,992
Long time no see.

132
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,509
No. No! Mo-tak!

133
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,191
Let him go, bitch.

134
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,196
This bitch reads minds. Be careful.

135
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,962
Blue smoke means life.

136
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,380
Black, evil spirits.

137
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,424
And green smoke

138
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,344
is the spirits that were taken captive
by the evil spirits.

139
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,153
Ha-na won't respond either.

140
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,030
What in the world is going on?

141
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,408
Mo-tak, answer me.

142
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,743
-Is everyone all right?
-Wi…

143
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,078
Wi-gen…

144
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,246
Wi-gen?

145
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,041
Mun?

146
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,042
Wi-gen!

147
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,295
Wi-gen, you can hear me, can't you?

148
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,592
A spirit just ascended.

149
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,604
Did you summon her here?

150
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,690
No, I'm not sure what's happening.

151
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,080
Wi-gen.

152
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,916
-Are you inside me right now?
-No.

153
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,126
Darn it.

154
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,010
Please.

155
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,969
Please.

156
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,932
Please.

157
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,361
No. Stop it.

158
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,362
Stop it!

159
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,993
Stop it. Please.

160
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,079
Stop. Stop it!

161
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,292
Stop it!

162
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,802
Ms. Chu!

163
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,512
Ms. Chu.

164
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,764
Stop it!

165
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,807
Stop! Stop it!

166
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,185
Stop it. Stop it, all of you.

167
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,271
Wi-gen…

168
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,278
It's all because of me. Please.

169
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,155
Mun.

170
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,699
Wi-gen.

171
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,621
Please come inside me. Just this once.

172
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,583
They're all going to die because of me.

173
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,797
They're all dying because of me.

174
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,843
Please…

175
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,680
Please help me out just this once.

176
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,850
Wi-gen.

177
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,314
What am I supposed to do?

178
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,297
Wi-gen! Please help us!

179
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,949
Hey! What are you doing?

180
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,617
That crazy bitch.

181
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,495
-Open the door!
-He just said

182
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,165
he doesn't need you two anymore.

183
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,332
Open up!

184
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,308
Mo-tak…

185
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,318
Ms. Chu.

186
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,486
Ms. Chu!

187
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,321
No, Ms. Chu!

188
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,034
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

189
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,873
Ms. Chu…

190
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,452
Whoa, shit.

191
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,335
I won't be seeing you off!

192
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,227
So it's them?

193
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,062
Idiots.

194
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,575
I love it when I hear people scream.

195
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,802
Ms. Chu, wake up!

196
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,762
Chairman Choi.

197
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,264
-Gosh, Mun. Are you okay?
-Thank you for coming.

198
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,142
We don't have time for that.
What's going on?

199
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,896
-Where's Mo-tak?
-Over there summoning evil spirits.

200
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,858
Goodness, Mo-tak,
you're doing your job in this chaos.

201
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,818
Those jerks at Yung.

202
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,487
Look at how hard they're working

203
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,031
as you hold them back
with an inspection or whatever.

204
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,786
Ha-na.

205
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,639
You nit-picked over petty things

206
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,308
and held our best attacker
down on the bench.

207
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,395
And then this happened.

208
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,232
Do you have to bring that up right now?

209
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,650
All of us were down too.

210
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,736
Both Su-ho and U-sik are about to vanish.

211
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,654
Yes.

212
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,906
It needs to be said.

213
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,617
How could you take away his power

214
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,495
while the evil spirits were after him?

215
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,958
Going back and forth out of need?
That's not a rule of ours.

216
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,794
Then is it okay
for a person's life to be at risk?

217
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,547
The problem is that
he became their target!

218
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,521
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

219
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,906
You're like the prodigal son.

220
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,618
Welcome back, Mun.

221
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,126
-Ha-na.
-Are you okay?

222
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,466
Chairman, didn't you erase his memory?

223
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,261
Would you have done it if you were me?

224
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,558
You aren't dead.

225
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,645
Thank you, Ha-na. Thank you for coming.

226
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,357
Damn it. I told you not to touch me.

227
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,913
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

228
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,005
I'M HERE TO TURN MYSELF IN

229
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,548
ON NOVEMBER 2ND, AT 11 A.M.,

230
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,592
I MURDERED MY WIFE AND HER OTHER MAN

231
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,261
Where am I?

232
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,060
Hey, who are you?

233
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,770
Who's this idiot?

234
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,438
I'M HERE TO TURN MYSELF IN

235
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,399
Why are we sitting here like this?

236
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,401
What?

237
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,988
Who are you?

238
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,617
KIM JEONG-YEONG

239
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,749
There's no way it was done by a human.
Could it be…

240
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,667
That's right.

241
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,460
It was an evil spirit.

242
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,630
They'll turn normal
once the evil spirit's power is gone.

243
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,299
The police can have him afterwards.

244
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,347
He's Choi Yeong-il,
the vacation villa murder suspect.

245
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,727
Should we arrest him?

246
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,731
-Take him away.
-Yes, ma'am.

247
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,756
You're here.

248
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,434
Mo-tak.

249
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,394
Are you in a lot of pain?

250
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,605
You should get examined again.

251
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,481
I'm fine.

252
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,027
I'm more worried about her.

253
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,863
Yes.

254
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,742
I heard her brain is awfully swollen.

255
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,161
And her eyes are bruised.

256
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,456
How dare they do this
to her gorgeous face.

257
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,755
But she is getting better, isn't she?

258
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,965
Right.

259
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,218
Let's give her time.

260
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,473
She's a woman
who can easily make it through this.

261
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,976
She'll come back.

262
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,569
You've forgotten how to walk properly?

263
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,072
I promised you I'd heal your leg.

264
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,450
Mommy's hands are healing hands

265
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,705
Mommy's hands are healing hands

266
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,502
Mun's bones are tough and strong

267
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,923
Ms. Chu, you have to hang in there.

268
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,015
The mayor hired the evil spirits?

269
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,976
Yes.

270
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,693
We need to talk.

271
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,487
You can't catch those rats
without my help.

272
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,865
Get me off the wanted list,
and I'll take care of it.

273
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,078
Looks like he also helped to plan

274
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,831
the fabrication of Ji Cheong-sin's death.

275
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,836
Man, it makes me speechless
to hear something that absurd.

276
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,715
What has the world come to?
How can jerks like him be in politics?

277
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,512
-Do Mo-tak and Mun know, too?
-Yes.

278
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,727
A guy who hires evil spirits is much worse
than the evil spirits themselves.

279
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,355
We can't let this go on.

280
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,444
Let's put an end to Mayor Shin
and Cho Tae-sin.

281
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,776
I…

282
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:01,012
I feel like all my heavy burdens
have been lifted off my chest.

283
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,097
Those rats.

284
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,766
How dare they try to ruin your career
right before the election.

285
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:09,479
There are way too many rascals
who think they're Robin Hood and his gang.

286
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,980
What about the council?

287
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,150
I went after their weaknesses
and did them some favors, too.

288
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,446
But you still need to go through
your primary election.

289
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,366
I thought it'd be easier
if we saved the council's face,

290
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,537
so I resolved everything
with very appropriate measures.

291
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,665
Appropriate?

292
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,669
A company picked by the council
will extract the leachate,

293
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,672
but we'll be in charge
of the purifying process.

294
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,550
When are we getting started?

295
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,262
The pipes are in. We got started ages ago.

296
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,349
Make sure dirty water
doesn't get in the water supply

297
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,976
and just reroute the waterway.

298
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,519
Of course we will.

299
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,564
I also rerouted the public sentiment
with all those news articles

300
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,275
by taking them down already.

301
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,698
And now,

302
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,993
we have one more to go.

303
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,377
That detective brat.

304
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,137
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

305
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,100
These are the assemblymen
who wish to join your camp.

306
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,810
POTENTIAL CAMP MEMBERS

307
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,521
Hyun Chung-nam
is a part of Oh Yeong-deok's camp.

308
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,857
Once Mr. Hyun makes the change,

309
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,569
11 other assemblymen of Jungjin
will join us along with him.

310
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,739
They're established in their districts,

311
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,616
so you'll most likely win.

312
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,959
Do you think I'll make it?

313
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,836
Sorry?

314
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,923
Do you think I deserve that position?

315
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,429
You're on your way to victory.

316
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,016
At this point,
no one can do much to stop you.

317
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,773
I'm starting to get scared.

318
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,194
I think I might really become
the president.

319
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,826
A NATION OF THE PEOPLE AND JUSTICE,
KOREA

320
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,920
LOCKERS

321
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,024
Hey, what were you doing in there?

322
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,110
Borrowing your clothes.

323
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,529
I can't walk around in my prison garb.

324
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,615
Where's Jang-su?

325
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,576
In the bathroom.

326
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,953
He's really gross.

327
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,872
I can't stand
being in the same room as him.

328
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,380
How much did you get?

329
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,598
Hey, what's this thing? Is it for me?

330
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,268
Hey.

331
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,521
Haven't you ever gotten a gift
for a girlfriend?

332
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,440
You've never had one.

333
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,322
What are you doing?

334
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,823
What did you do in my room?

335
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,034
What were you looking for?

336
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,161
Let me go. I said, let me go.

337
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,205
I wasn't looking for anything!

338
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,667
I just borrowed your clothes!
What the heck is wrong with you?

339
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,382
Get a passport photo today.

340
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,509
A passport photo? Why?

341
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,137
You want to go on a trip with me
or something?

342
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,513
We're going abroad.

343
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,890
Who are you to decide?

344
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,100
If you want to leave, leave alone.

345
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,107
You can either come with me

346
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,068
or you can die right now.

347
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,113
You're on the wanted list.
Cut your hair first.

348
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,455
How am I supposed to cut my hair
with this?

349
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,669
Then what are you going to do

350
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,128
when we come back to Korea?

351
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,089
That voice recording…

352
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,801
will be worth a fortune
once Shin Myeong-hwi…

353
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,054
becomes the president.

354
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,770
If you ever try that shit on me again,

355
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,815
I'll cut your thing off.

356
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,660
So I didn't summon Yung's territory…

357
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,205
with my desire to kill?

358
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,252
Mun.

359
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,795
Yes?

360
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,422
The inspectors want you here.

361
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,801
Should I be nervous?

362
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,803
Yes.

363
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,523
The committee of Yung
would like to make an announcement

364
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,234
regarding Counter 1543, So Mun.

365
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,906
You're reinstated.

366
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,996
Yes!

367
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,304
We owe you big time.

368
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,806
Wi-gen.

369
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,854
I don't think I'm working as a Counter
because of my mom and dad.

370
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,899
Then why are you doing it?

371
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,820
I'm going to find out.

372
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,953
I feel like
I haven't given you all my trust.

373
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,540
I can't fully trust myself either.

374
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,585
Thank you very much…

375
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,880
for giving me another chance.

376
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,025
Wi-gen.

377
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,445
It looks like Su-ho is going to vanish.

378
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,613
What?

379
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,240
What?

380
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,835
Ms. Chu.

381
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,218
Over here!

382
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,346
No, Ms. Chu…

383
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,600
Mun.

384
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,310
Mun.

385
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,148
Ms. Chu…

386
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,072
No…

387
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,866
Ms. Chu.

388
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,451
Ms. Chu!

389
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,355
SEVEN YEARS AGO

390
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,610
Ms. Chu Mae-ok.

391
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,612
Ms. Chu Mae-ok.

392
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,453
Ms. Chu Mae-ok.

393
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,290
Ms. Chu Mae-ok.

394
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,966
Are you the 45-year-old Ms. Chu Mae-ok?

395
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,012
Yes.

396
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,057
I've been looking for you.

397
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,687
It's been forever
since anyone's called me by my name.

398
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,482
I didn't know you were talking to me.

399
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,527
That's what happens to moms.

400
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
No one calls me by my name.

401
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,033
People just call me…

402
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,535
Su-ho's mom.

403
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,454
That's it.

404
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,048
Mom.

405
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,102
Su-ho.

406
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,736
Oh, Su-ho.

407
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,991
Su-ho, my son.

408
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,537
-Charge it to 200 joules.
-200 joules.

409
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,414
All clear. Shock.

410
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,345
Ms. Chu.

411
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,725
You've been in a coma for a month.

412
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,643
Goodness, yes.

413
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,438
I survived all alone.

414
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,607
Your hand slipped away in the water,

415
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,485
and I only saved myself.

416
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,923
Sorry for leaving you first, Mom.

417
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,717
No.

418
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,303
No, I'm sorry.

419
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,222
Mommy is sorry.

420
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,642
I'm so sorry.

421
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,810
Don't say that.

422
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,356
My son.

423
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,901
Su-ho…

424
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,195
-Increase it to the maximum.
-The maximum.

425
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,529
All clear. Shock.

426
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,202
Su-ho.

427
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,835
Hold me tight.

428
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:51,013
I won't let go of your hand.

429
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,185
We'll never let go of each other.

430
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,034
-Su-ho.
-U-sik.

431
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,460
Su-ho.

432
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,976
Ms. Chu…

433
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,159
Goodness, Ms. Chu.

434
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,994
You've done well.

435
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,037
Let me go.

436
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,371
Oh, okay.

437
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,082
Welcome back, Mun.

438
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,375
It's been a while.

439
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,543
Yes, Chairman Choi.

440
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,046
What's all this?

441
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,589
I made abalone porridge.

442
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,174
Did you wash everything properly?

443
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,967
Just take a seat, will you?

444
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,520
I'll heal all of you
once I feel a little better.

445
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,104
-No way.
-No.

446
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,147
You need to rest.

447
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,525
You just got better, Ms. Chu. No way.

448
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,111
Let's eat.

449
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,496
Stop looking at me with those eyes.

450
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,999
You always healed everyone else,

451
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,377
but who will heal you if you get hurt?

452
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,422
When you got hurt…

453
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,260
it was really frightening.

454
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,847
All of you…

455
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,767
are as good as family.

456
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,731
Yes?

457
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,942
I have…

458
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,237
something to tell my family here.

459
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,741
It's a very shocking confession.

460
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,201
A confession?

461
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,036
Don't you dare say you love us.

462
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,788
Goodness.

463
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,378
I got…

464
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,007
my memories back.

465
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,883
-What?
-What did you say?

466
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,927
-Seriously?
-Really?

467
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,888
-About half.
-What?

468
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,558
Half? What do you mean "half"?

469
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,268
One second. Look at me.

470
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,108
Good for you, Mo-tak!

471
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,958
Here are the texts between you two
that were on your burner phones.

472
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,876
LIFE WILL BE GOOD

473
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,797
On the 21st,

474
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,091
you ran over Mr. Ga Mo-tak
and three others…

475
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,097
with this truck.

476
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,728
Did you expect life to be good

477
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,730
after murdering people?

478
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,626
Hey.

479
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,254
About the call history
from Noh Hang-gyu's burner phone…

480
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,298
Yes. Did you find everyone he spoke to?

481
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,093
He called five numbers on this phone.

482
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,261
One of them is Noh Chang-gyu.

483
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,597
The other four were also burner phones,
so I found

484
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,265
the locations of the signals.

485
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,452
When did you get this far?

486
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,499
Great work.

487
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,797
But let's pretend
you never saw these pictures.

488
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,799
What's your plan?

489
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,594
You just gave me the fake names
registered with the burner phones.

490
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,138
That's all you did. Got it?

491
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,057
Answer me.

492
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,643
Yes, ma'am.

493
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,784
Did you enjoy your lunch?

494
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,696
The men who called you often
on your burner phone.

495
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:28,076
You've got such rich
and influential friends,

496
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,372
but they won't even find you an attorney.

497
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,088
The day the illegal dumping
got exposed. City hall.

498
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,343
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu, Mr. Cho Tae-sin,
and Mayor Shin got together,

499
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,095
and they were joined by this guy.

500
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,566
What kind of a connection…

501
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,404
did this serial killer, Ji Cheong-sin,
have with Mayor Shin and Mr. Cho?

502
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,494
We found 17 different bank accounts
you kept under different names

503
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,037
and five murder instigations.

504
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,333
Unless you want to take the blame and
celebrate your 80th birthday in prison,

505
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,378
stop pleading the Fifth.

506
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,505
It's time to cooperate.

507
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,932
First, I need to know what I can get
by cooperating

508
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,267
with you.

509
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,111
Damn it.

510
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,407
She froze all the bank accounts
that Hang-gyu was managing.

511
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,576
How am I going to fund the campaign?

512
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,495
Both Chang-gyu

513
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,747
and Hang-gyu were arrested urgently,

514
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,166
so they had no time
to clean up their phones.

515
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,670
What's your plan?

516
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,636
Chief Choi, this is your responsibility.
What's your plan now?

517
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,264
He told you
not to mess with his subordinates.

518
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,267
He said he won't let you off anymore

519
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,768
if we mess with any officers.

520
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,978
Chairman Cho!

521
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,901
Do you think you'll be fine, Su-ryong?

522
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,615
Hey, you.

523
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,950
I got you promoted
from a mere section chief

524
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,578
with a mugunghwa mark on your badge,
so behave, will you?

525
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,622
Did you think

526
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,207
you were on my level
because I was nice to you, asshole?

527
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,094
If you don't lose that bitch,

528
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,348
the least you'll have to do is resign.

529
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,689
Get out of my car, you bastard.

530
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,367
Get going.

531
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,094
Why are you making so much kimchi
if we're only doing takeout?

532
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,012
We still need to make kimchi for winter.

533
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:40,977
What's wrong?

534
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,480
My memories.

535
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,775
Goodness, don't rush it.

536
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,486
You've gotten started,
so you'll remember everything soon.

537
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,488
It's just frustrating.

538
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,782
I…

539
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,618
Damn it.

540
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,997
I definitely remember
that I was stabbed with a knife.

541
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,961
But that means
I must have found some kind of evidence.

542
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,589
And that is…

543
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,845
what I don't remember.

544
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,141
Because of that evidence…

545
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:21,977
Su-ryong…

546
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,646
Yes. What?

547
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,148
Su-ryong…

548
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,819
Damn it, this is so frustrating.

549
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,237
-Forget it, okay?
-Darn it.

550
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,909
Do you want help?

551
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,245
How?

552
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,584
First off, your memories
began to come back to you

553
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,127
when you fought Ji Cheong-sin.

554
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,545
Yes.

555
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:54,301
And you said those memories are in pieces.

556
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,178
I can help you…

557
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,681
bring those back…

558
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,563
into a whole piece.

559
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,026
That's how we pieced together
Mun's memories.

560
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,528
That's how we found Ji Cheong-sin…

561
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,158
from his subconscious memories.

562
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:25,791
I don't think he has a subconscious mind.

563
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,044
I doubt he has something that serious
in his head.

564
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:33,882
Ha-na.

565
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,426
Give it a try.

566
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,261
-Okay.
-Good.

567
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,147
Your head might hurt.

568
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,732
I'll do it even if it breaks.

569
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,900
Let's find them.

570
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,154
Hey, wait.

571
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,699
Don't look too carefully.

572
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,619
You know, my private…

573
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,746
What now? Your privacy?

574
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,998
Yes, I have that. A private life.

575
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,886
Hey, Ms. Chu. I got salted shrimp.

576
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,971
That's not the problem.

577
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,433
What are you doing?

578
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,481
This is election interference.

579
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,691
Yeong-nim's killer…

580
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,822
52C4882

581
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:51,167
SEVEN YEARS AGO

582
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,503
Please let me join you.

583
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,507
I forgot to make a reservation,
so there are no empty seats.

584
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,177
Gosh, look. Everything is getting burnt.

585
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,139
No?

586
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,017
Anyway, why are you eating alone?

587
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,685
Are you an outcast or something?

588
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,604
Gosh.

589
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,858
Wow, this is good.

590
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,069
-Excuse me. One more serving, please.
-Sure.

591
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,328
I'll buy.

592
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,329
Hey, man.

593
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,875
I'm not interested in men. Run along.

594
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,086
Me neither.

595
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,091
Then what are you trying to do right now?

596
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,725
You're in charge
of the Kim Yeong-nim case.

597
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,606
I saw something during my investigation
of Shin Myeong-hwi's election fraud.

598
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,108
There's a connection…

599
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,361
between Mayor Shin…

600
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,113
and Ms. Kim Yeong-nim?

601
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,078
Detective Ga.

602
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,289
My name is So Gwon.

603
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,711
I'm a detective too.

604
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,004
DETECTIVE SO GWON

605
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,550
Another bottle of soju, please.

606
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,266
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

607
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,397
May I help you?

608
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,023
Yes, I'm the police.

609
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,651
Car number 52C4882.

610
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,904
Who drove that car on September 16th?

611
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,531
You keep a car log, right?

612
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,824
We're too busy to do that.

613
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,367
Come on, please spare some time.

614
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,077
Come on.

615
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,370
-Sir, one second.
-Please.

616
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,579
Okay, fine.

617
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,873
Hey, one second.

618
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,752
You know me, don't you. Right?

619
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,879
-Let's go.
-Haven't you seen me?

620
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,299
You're Kim Yeong-nim's friend!

621
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,267
Hey, man.

622
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,893
Kim Yeong-nim's body is there.

623
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,729
This is election interference.

624
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,772
Why are you suddenly so scared, Su-ryong?

625
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,359
Hey, Su-ryong. Don't be a wuss.

626
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,196
They won't give you a warrant
for this anyway!

627
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,700
Hello? Go ahead.

628
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,870
I know who Yeong-nim's killer is.

629
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,955
-I have the evidence.
-I see.

630
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,998
Mo-tak.

631
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,420
Ha-na, this phone number.

632
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,338
Remember the number.

633
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,133
I'm reading it already.

634
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,267
010…

635
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,187
-Four…
-Wait, that number. Write it down.

636
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,731
497…

637
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,442
4536.

638
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,492
Mo-tak.

639
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,413
Can you guarantee my safety?

640
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,456
Of course.

641
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,085
You can rest assured
your identity will be kept secret.

642
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,336
Who is it?

643
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,464
Let's meet, then.

644
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,686
Are you okay?

645
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,648
I'm a little late.

646
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:47,987
I'm back.

647
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,783
Goodness. Great job.

648
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,076
What is it?

649
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,246
It's Mo-tak. He remembered everything
from seven years ago.

650
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,334
Wait, really?

651
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:04,838
Yes.

652
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,632
I remember…

653
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,301
your dad too.

654
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,223
He looks a lot like you.

655
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,475
No, I look a lot like him.

656
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,609
Sit down.

657
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,405
I told you it would hurt.

658
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,204
Yes, an informer?

659
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,498
Yes.

660
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,585
I went to see the informer

661
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,879
on the day I got attacked.

662
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,631
This is a number from seven years ago.

663
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,925
Could I find the owner?

664
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,760
Give it to me.

665
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,599
Wait.

666
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,145
Do you…

667
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,356
remember everything?

668
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,708
Marry me.

669
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,087
Yes.

670
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,673
You remember…

671
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,219
everything?

672
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,013
Yes.

673
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:42,977
Let's meet.

674
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,649
Detective Kim. No.

675
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,194
Jeong-yeong.

676
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,657
We have…

677
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,202
a lot to catch up on.

678
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,163
We do.

679
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,129
The one on the right

680
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,923
They look the same.

681
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,133
I told you
not to read into my private matters.

682
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,134
Let me see.

683
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,011
-I say the left one.
-Oh, really?

684
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,138
If I had known,

685
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,848
I would've given her some noodles.

686
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,100
Bring her over next time.

687
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,018
Yes, this one.

688
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,272
The one on the left is what women like.

689
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,857
This is their first date in seven years.

690
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,276
Noodles aren't good enough.

691
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,111
Use this as much as you want.

692
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,322
Gosh, you smell like an old man.

693
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,032
This isn't good.

694
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,371
-Mo-tak.
-Yes?

695
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,290
You don't have to come home tonight.

696
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,292
Why not? I'm coming home.

697
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,127
-Don't come home.
-Don't come back.

698
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,129
-You aren't coming home?
-I am!

699
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,714
-He's not!
-Why wouldn't I?

700
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,257
-I'm coming home.
-Don't come.

701
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,550
What do you know?

702
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,142
You see, when you're a Counter,

703
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,686
the gap between life and death

704
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,480
doesn't seem so huge,

705
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,023
and that's comforting.

706
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,275
Then what should we do
with these bastards?

707
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,401
Let's do things their way.

708
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,944
"Their way"?

709
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,279
This five billion won…

710
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:04,989
Let's steal it.

711
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,784
We'll rob them of their campaign funds?

712
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,745
We'll capture Ji Cheong-sin

713
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,747
and help Mun's parents ascend.

714
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,333
We can reopen after that.

715
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:20,254
