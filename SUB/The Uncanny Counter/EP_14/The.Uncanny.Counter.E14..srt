1
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,958
THE UNCANNY COUNTER

2
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

3
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,898
Watch and see

5
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,692
what happens to your parents.

6
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,700
No!

7
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,259
No.

8
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,233
Get up.

9
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,444
Get up.

10
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,238
Get up!

11
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,281
I said, get up!

12
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,752
Ji Cheong-sin is dead.

13
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,422
That means Mun's parents
and Cheol-jung are also…

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,634
No.

15
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,762
No, that can't be.

16
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,721
Ms. Chu.

17
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,932
Ms. Chu, help me. Ms. Chu!

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,021
Mun.

19
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,773
There's no pulse.

20
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,734
Mun.

21
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,153
Hey, get up.

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,989
Get up. I don't believe this.

23
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,907
This can't be happening. Hey!

24
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,534
Hey, get up!

25
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,538
Get up! Get the hell up!

26
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,874
Get up…

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,834
Hey…

28
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,353
No!

29
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,106
No!

30
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,366
Back off, all of you!
Do you want the kid to die?

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,410
-Let the kid go.
-Let him go!

32
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,829
Don't come near me. I'll kill you all.

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,333
Damn it!

34
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,100
GYEONGIN POLICE STATION

35
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,728
How dare they…

36
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,315
do this to me.

37
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,028
Right here. This is the climax.

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,198
Mr. Shin.

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:06,537
I believe
life is all about making choices.

40
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,963
I am dying to know

41
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,674
what you will choose to do.

42
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,766
Can we really keep on
interrogating Shin Myeong-hwi?

43
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,270
What will happen to us
if he ends up winning the election?

44
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,689
That's why we have to uncover the truth.

45
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,527
We cannot let a murderer
become the next president.

46
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,445
I know that, but…

47
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,530
Come on. Let's go.

48
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,658
INVESTIGATION ROOM

49
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,919
Hey, call an ambulance.

50
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,504
-Go. Call them now!
-Yes, sir.

51
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,926
-Jeez.
-This is insane.

52
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,273
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE

53
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,738
EPISODE 14

54
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,697
You said

55
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,950
they were immortal.

56
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,704
You said level-four evil spirits

57
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,791
never die.

58
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,753
Because he was inside the barrier,

59
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,213
the ability to be immortal

60
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,216
was probably deactivated.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,594
Mun, as you know,

62
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,263
when a host dies,

63
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,307
both the evil spirit

64
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,312
and all the other spirits
that were locked inside die with it.

65
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,274
No.

66
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,109
That can't be right.

67
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,361
No way.

68
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,656
There's no way my parents' souls

69
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,035
dissipated in vain like that.

70
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,579
You see,

71
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,000
I can still feel them.

72
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,170
I know they're still somewhere
in this realm!

73
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,257
I'm sorry

74
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,968
I couldn't keep my promise, Mun.

75
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,854
Mun.

76
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,107
Hey, Mun!

77
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,989
Hey, lazybones. You're still in bed?

78
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,748
Hey, Mun. Wake up.

79
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,509
Your grandma has been cooking up a storm
in the kitchen the whole morning.

80
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,053
Come on. Get up.

81
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,852
Are you that tired?

82
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,782
How is it?

83
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,036
Your grandma put her cooking skills to use
to make your favorite dishes.

84
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,956
Is it good?

85
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,168
Yes, Grandma.

86
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,796
It's good. It's very tasty.

87
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,595
I'd been so busy grieving
my daughter's death

88
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,974
that I hadn't been able
to cook a proper meal for my grandson.

89
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,102
I'm really sorry, Mun.

90
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,521
No. It's okay, Grandma.

91
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,814
You have no reason

92
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,066
to be sorry.

93
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,863
I'm sure your mom's waiting for me
in heaven,

94
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,910
so I should just take good care of you
until I can see her again.

95
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,662
Here, eat as much as you want.

96
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,421
This is delicious.

97
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,102
What a busy winter break for you.

98
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,813
The contest deadline is coming up.

99
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,982
I'll see you later.

100
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,693
All right, good luck.
Make sure you eat lunch.

101
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,779
And be nice to your friends.

102
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,738
Okay.

103
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,743
Don't force yourself to smile.

104
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,294
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,216
That's not what I meant.
We're really okay.

106
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,054
All right.

107
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,894
EONNI'S NOODLES

108
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,647
We all had those days.

109
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,191
EONNI'S NOODLES

110
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,820
How are the kids at the children's home?
All okay?

111
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,071
Yes, of course.

112
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,158
They'll be protected at the best facility
and will grow up just fine.

113
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,368
Okay.

114
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,246
But I wonder where Baek Hyang-hui went.

115
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,374
I'm sure that crazy girl
is going to cause trouble sooner or later.

116
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,045
-Mun.
-You see,

117
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,756
I won't give up like this.

118
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,468
You may think I'm crazy,
but I can really feel them.

119
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,056
I can still feel my parents' presence
in this realm.

120
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,186
I'll keep going. I have to,
for the sake of my grandparents.

121
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,479
Mun.

122
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,690
No, just give me some time.

123
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,236
I'll take a little break
from my job as a Counter.

124
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,700
I promise you I'll find
the evil spirit that has vanished.

125
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,328
-Mun.
-Don't try to change my mind.

126
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,163
-Ha-na, I--
-If you're right,

127
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,873
upon leaving Ji Cheong-sin's body,

128
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,292
it found a host
with the same vibrational frequency.

129
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,337
In other words, it must've gone
to someone who's that evil.

130
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,379
Ha-na.

131
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,839
Mun has a point.

132
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,467
That was a level-four evil spirit.

133
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,137
There's a possibility that the evil spirit

134
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,891
killed the host and found itself
a new host upon becoming complete.

135
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,062
If that is what happened,

136
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,940
we'll need to spot
the evil spirit in its new host,

137
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,568
so summon our territory
at a place where it may show up.

138
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,488
Then I'll try to spot it.

139
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,575
All right.

140
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,954
We'll do it even if there's only
a one-in-a-million chance.

141
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,001
Let's do everything we can.

142
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,675
-Right?
-Yes! Of course, we should.

143
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,594
That was my plan anyway.

144
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,179
You should've said so before.

145
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,222
Yes, it's too late.

146
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,515
Is it?

147
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,016
Do you really mean it?

148
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,267
Yes, I do.

149
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,769
Don't cry.

150
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,855
-You silly goose, why are you crying?
-Goodness.

151
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,150
If you cry, the rainbow--

152
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,151
Hey, enough.

153
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,529
Don't ever say you quit.

154
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,116
JUNGJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

155
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,359
Hello, I'm here to check in on Mr. Shin.

156
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,160
What happened?

157
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,579
I saved you.

158
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,998
You saved me?

159
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,958
Don't you remember?

160
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,211
You asked me to save you.

161
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,755
You desperately called out to me.

162
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,348
-Now, we must
-Now, we must

163
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,518
-protect each other.
-protect each other.

164
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,945
<i>Some suspect that Mayor Shin</i>
<i>might have tried</i>

165
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,989
<i>to take his own life because</i>
<i>he was unable to cope with the stress</i>

166
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,908
<i>of being interrogated as a suspect.</i>

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,208
INCOMING CALL
MAYOR SHIN MYEONG-HWI

169
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,254
My gosh!

170
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,340
I was sad about how we ended things.

171
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,094
I'm so glad I got to see you
one more time, Mr. Mayor.

172
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,890
You said you wanted the City of Jungjin.

173
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,566
You've always coveted my position.

174
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,032
I'll let you have it.

175
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,751
Have you lost your mind
now that you've come back from the dead?

176
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,378
Look, do you realize that--

177
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,861
How… How did you…

178
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,869
I'll let you have it
if you stay on your knees in front of me.

179
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,185
Let's take care of the urgent stuff first.

180
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,863
You're turning yourself in
for the murder of Kim Yeong-nim?

181
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,242
Yes, I killed her.

182
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,910
Kim Yeong-nim.

183
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,621
Mayor Shin is a useless card to us now.

184
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,707
So why should I do that?

185
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,045
I have no idea what happened to him,

186
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,423
but he has the powers
that Ji Cheong-sin had.

187
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,929
We have no choice now.

188
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,181
When the time is right,

189
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,559
I'll get you out on parole.

190
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,987
This is surely enough
to get you locked up.

191
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,076
I cannot let Mayor Shin
be wrongfully convicted.

192
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,913
<i>Noh Hang-gyu of Taesin</i>
<i>turned himself in for the murder</i>

193
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,623
<i>that took place seven years ago.</i>

194
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,792
<i>Noh stated that Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi</i>

195
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>had nothing to do with the murder</i>
<i>and has confessed that</i>

196
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,382
<i>he killed the victim</i>
<i>and abandoned the body all by himself.</i>

197
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,302
<i>Even though Mayor Shin</i>
<i>managed to clear his name,</i>

198
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,596
<i>he has expressed his intention to resign…</i>

199
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,724
Shin Myeong-hwi got away once again.

200
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,808
Shin Myeong-hwi…

201
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,187
I'll be sure to catch you this time,

202
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,064
for Mun's sake.

203
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,364
Oh my.

204
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,624
What's going on? Is it…

205
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,376
Level one, near the mall.

206
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,920
-Let's go.
-No.

207
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,005
You stay here.
It's just a level-one spirit.

208
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,675
All evil spirits make me shudder now,
regardless of their levels.

209
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,593
Let's go.

210
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,636
-No.
-Gosh, please.

211
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,846
You should take it easy today.

212
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,809
It's today.

213
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,310
Su-ho's death anniversary.

214
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,480
She'll be here soon, you know.

215
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,317
See you.

216
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,819
-Be safe.
-All right.

217
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
See you later.

218
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,414
My gosh.

219
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,303
Jeez, what is wrong with me?

220
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,389
I kept telling her not to come.

221
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,558
Why am I waiting for her? Goodness.

222
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm crazy, aren't I?

223
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
Mother.

224
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,022
Sorry I'm late.

225
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,775
Gosh, I told you not to come.

226
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,861
You're so stubborn.

227
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,195
You've been well, right?

228
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,989
Yes, of course. You must be cold.

229
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,246
You don't even have time to eat?

230
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,165
What's wrong with that company?

231
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,416
You should just quit.

232
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,877
The end of the year is always busy.

233
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,379
Try to eat well.

234
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,714
Don't skip meals.

235
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,550
Okay.

236
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,097
All right, you can tell me now.

237
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,559
Sorry?

238
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,104
You've been hesitating whether or not
you should tell me something.

239
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,480
I know you, Jeong-eun.

240
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,476
My gosh, congratulations.

241
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,189
I'm sorry, Mother.

242
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,900
Gosh, why are you sorry? Don't be.

243
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,526
Come on.

244
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,738
I'm happy to see you moving on finally.

245
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,118
Su-ho is in a good place now.
I'm sure he's totally forgotten about us.

246
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,580
It's about time you moved on
and lived your life.

247
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm sorry.

248
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,960
Yes, you should be.

249
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,587
I want to get married too.
Look at you ditching me.

250
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,593
He's good to you, right?
I'm sure he's a sweet guy.

251
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,972
I know you're a good judge of character.

252
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,558
I mean, that's why you chose Su-ho.
You have a good eye.

253
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,690
He's just an average guy.

254
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,444
I don't have to try to be someone else
when I'm with him.

255
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,490
He makes me feel at ease.

256
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,868
That's the best.
Great, I'm so happy for you.

257
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,289
Bring him here before your wedding.

258
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
Don't tell him anything else.

259
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,917
Noodles symbolize a long, happy life.

260
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,919
I'll make you some delicious noodles.

261
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,175
Gosh, why are you crying?

262
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,766
I know that you have

263
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,519
a happy, great life ahead of you,
Jeong-eun.

264
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,773
You deserve to be happy. You really do.

265
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,890
Are you sad?

266
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,573
I always felt bad,

267
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,203
so I'm happy for her.

268
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,089
Thank you, Mom.

269
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,654
Is Jang-mul good to you?

270
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,406
My gosh, what did you say?

271
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,950
What are you saying?

272
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,202
Come on. I saw everything.

273
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,162
What did you see? My goodness.

274
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,163
Gosh.

275
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,875
What on earth are you talking about?

276
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,877
-I saw everything.
-Goodness.

277
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,967
I have high standards, you see.

278
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,656
<i>He's not here.</i>

279
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,169
<i>He isn't here either.</i>

280
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,096
TAESIN GROUP

281
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,265
<i>Ji Cheong-sin.</i>

282
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,767
<i>Where on earth is he?</i>

283
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,184
You see, hope is…

284
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,646
It's such a cruel beast.

285
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,148
I know,

286
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,236
but it's what keeps us going.

287
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,670
My, look at this mansion.

288
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,463
What a nice house.

289
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,174
Will Hang-gyu be okay though?

290
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,802
Come on. I'm sure he has a plan.

291
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,595
You know the kind of person he is.

292
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,265
He told us not to worry,
so we have nothing to worry about.

293
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,395
But why did the chairman tell us
to come all the way to Mayor Shin's place?

294
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,065
My brother is taking the fall for him,

295
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,442
so I guess he wants
to give us something in return.

296
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,908
My brother must've already
cut a deal with him.

297
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,353
Why is it so dark in here?

298
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,777
Is he over there?

299
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,131
-Mr. Mayor, I heard you asked for us.
-Hello, sir.

300
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,593
Is he not at home?

301
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,845
-Jeez.
-My gosh.

302
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,067
<i>We cannot let anyone find out about us</i>

303
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,195
<i>until we've fully recovered.</i>

304
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,702
What do you want?

305
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,413
You… You're back.

306
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,215
<i>We should eat up that punk too.</i>

307
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,721
No, don't touch him.

308
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,849
<i>Why not? Because he's your son?</i>

309
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,814
<i>That little prick tried to kill you</i>
<i>at the hospital.</i>

310
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,023
<i>I bet you had no idea.</i>

311
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,069
Still, we can't kill him yet.

312
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,238
Now isn't the time.

313
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,573
No, not yet.

314
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,922
<i>Are you really gone?</i>

315
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>Are you, Mom?</i>

316
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,261
<i>Is it really true, Dad?</i>

317
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,146
Hey, you said your dad is at home.

318
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,148
Ask him for more pocket money.

319
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,401
-Hey.
-Say something!

320
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,194
What are you doing?

321
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,291
Get up.

322
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,736
-What?
-Your father, Shin Myeong-hwi…

323
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,697
Where is he now?

324
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,700
-What?
-Where is he?

325
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,613
<i>It's them.</i>

326
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,657
<i>No, not yet.</i>

327
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,450
<i>Right now, we mustn't get caught.</i>

328
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,679
Mun, stop.

329
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,763
Ha-na.

330
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,016
-In there--
-Can't you feel it?

331
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,767
Shin Myeong-hwi isn't there now.

332
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,978
He's already fled.

333
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,155
Shin Myeong-hwi.

334
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,616
That human trash.

335
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,827
I can't believe
the evil spirit went to him.

336
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,996
We're dealing with pure evil here.

337
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,207
But I wonder why he's been quiet
all this time.

338
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,419
No movement detected so far,
as if he's in hiding.

339
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,339
That's because he now knows
we can trap him using the barrier.

340
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,596
Mun, I'm sure we can find

341
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,389
Shin Myeong-hwi.

342
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,141
We'll track him down.

343
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,186
I'm not upset.

344
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:25,897
I'm happy.

345
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,775
This means we still have a chance.

346
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,361
I'm happy to know it's not over yet.

347
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,954
EONNI'S NOODLES

348
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,792
First, let's find out
where Shin Myeong-hwi could be hiding.

349
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,503
His son is that kid at your school, right?

350
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,712
Yes.

351
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,422
He must have a vacation home.

352
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,174
I'll find out.

353
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,303
-Look who's here.
-My gosh!

354
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,305
-Hi, So-eun.
-So-eun.

355
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,515
-Hello.
-Hello.

356
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,934
Hi, So-eun. What brings you here?

357
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,687
So-eun is doing a lot better now.
She missed you, Mun.

358
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,356
-My gosh.
-We came for some noodles,

359
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,608
-but I guess you're closed today?
-Oh.

360
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,735
His brother is Kwon Jin-seung
at Love Jungjin.

361
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,403
-Oh, I see.
-Hello, I'm Kwon Jin-ho.

362
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531
This is his brother's daughter.

363
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,408
Hello, I'm Kwon So-eun.

364
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,703
My gosh, you're So-eun.
It's so nice to meet you.

365
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,915
-Mo-tak, boil water for some noodles.
-Okay.

366
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,750
-It's cold. Come on in.
-Thank you.

367
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,918
-Come on in.
-All right.

368
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,879
Have some noodles. Here you go.

369
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,923
-Thank you.
-Here's yours, So-eun.

370
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,719
Here, I'll stir it for you.

371
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,389
My gosh, I'm very glad to see So-eun

372
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,598
looking so healthy.

373
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,143
I'm proud of her.

374
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,103
I'm relieved that she's doing better now,

375
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,105
but a lot of the kids
are still struggling.

376
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,901
That's no surprise. They drank
and bathed in that water for so long.

377
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,863
Are those jerks at Taesin
still playing dumb?

378
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,408
Yes. But thanks to your help,
we have many supporters now.

379
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,787
As soon as we have the results
from So-eun's heavy metals analysis,

380
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,414
we'll schedule a press conference.

381
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,750
Good. We're really almost there now.

382
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,211
You see, about the press conference…

383
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,796
Do it at my hotel.

384
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,340
Let's use the media to our advantage.

385
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,177
We should really take down
those scumbags once and for all.

386
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,929
He loves to spend a ton of money
for a good cause.

387
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,224
-What? I do?
-Yes, a hell of a lot of money.

388
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,852
Watch it. There's a kid here.

389
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,228
Oh, my bad.

390
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,855
-Forget what I said.
-Eat up.

391
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,872
If they insist that the kid's body
is evidence

392
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,667
and living proof in and of itself,

393
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,712
the ICT project will face
yet another roadblock.

394
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,840
I think environmental organizations
have their backs.

395
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,596
A kid who's bound to die should just die.

396
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,727
But Hang-gyu and Chang-gyu aren't around,

397
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,439
so I have no one to entrust
with such a task.

398
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,167
What do I do? The cops are looking for me.

399
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:20,214
Damn it! Why did that lunatic
have to shoot himself in the head?

400
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,096
Hey! Turn down the TV volume!

401
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,016
Do you think you own this inn?

402
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,811
Jeez, are your ears plugged?

403
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,063
You do this all the time.

404
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,482
Do I sound like a barking dog?

405
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,693
Open the door, you piece of shit!

406
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,368
Hey, gorgeous. This would've been

407
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,494
nice to know.

408
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,920
<i>What did I say I'd do</i>
<i>if you caused trouble again?</i>

409
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,714
-What? Who are you?
-I'm…

410
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,008
I'm Kim Deok-sik.

411
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,846
<i>I have a job for you.</i>

412
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,098
What?

413
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,808
You're alive?

414
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,061
I want to stay alive.

415
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,062
Damn it.

416
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:08,989
Is that blood?

417
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,042
What did you say?

418
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,961
Your family must have a vacation home.

419
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,170
Is Mayor Shin…

420
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,300
I mean, your father. Where is he now?

421
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,971
Well, why do you need to know?

422
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,056
Because I have to meet him now.

423
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,352
I'm baffled because you look so serious.

424
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,439
Hey.

425
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,774
You act up at school and think you're it?

426
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,318
Is my dad just some guy next door?

427
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,445
He has no time for you.

428
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,613
Just get lost.

429
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,658
Haven't you

430
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,369
noticed anything different about him?

431
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,000
You saw it too.

432
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,461
Those eyes.

433
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,217
You know

434
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,094
that your dad

435
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,263
is in danger now.

436
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,607
Hey, So-eun. Pork or beef?

437
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,524
<i>Pork.</i>

438
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,401
Beef is expensive.

439
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,527
Come on. It's fine.

440
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,488
We'll have beef today, okay?

441
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,699
Excuse me. What's good today?

442
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,242
I want Korean beef, not pork.

443
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,169
I see that you also hate studying.

444
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,882
OUR FLIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER

445
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,692
Check upstairs.

446
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,528
Will do.

447
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,491
He's not here.

448
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,292
No sign of him
visiting this place recently.

449
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,210
He's not here.

450
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,337
How many vacation homes does he have?

451
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,838
We don't have a lot of time.

452
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,759
You see, life is tough.

453
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,181
I thought you at least cared about kids.

454
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,225
<i>I guess you don't anymore.</i>

455
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,481
I spotted one.

456
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,857
Who? Shin Myeong-hwi?

457
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,277
No, Baek Hyang-hui.

458
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,320
But she's with So-eun.

459
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,030
So-eun? Why is she with So-eun?

460
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,784
If Shin found out, he wouldn't want
the press conference to happen.

461
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,202
And to do that…

462
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,663
So-eun! She's in danger.

463
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,458
Shit! Damn it.

464
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,502
I just drove by their fog.

465
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,300
Can't I just eat this kid now?

466
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,927
<i>I need that kid gone without a trace.</i>

467
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,931
<i>If you think you can completely</i>
<i>get rid of her, go ahead.</i>

468
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,685
Do you think I'm a zombie or what?

469
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,480
How could they do this to a kid?

470
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,107
And she's not well.

471
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,401
Think about all the things they've done.

472
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,028
They're not even human.

473
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,322
She was driving along Highway 26.

474
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,657
Can you keep our territory up on the way?

475
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,783
I'll try.

476
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,753
Who would have known Shin Myeong-hwi
would be his new host?

477
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,255
He couldn't have picked a better host.

478
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,300
Now, he even has full control over you,
Chairman Cho.

479
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,095
You're all done, right?

480
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,805
Get going, then.

481
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,184
Where's my pay?

482
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,853
I can't leave until I get paid.

483
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,540
Looks like I'll get to see some flames
today. Fun! It's been too long.

484
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,668
But you're getting me a new car, right?

485
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,426
Go ahead and pour it.

486
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,816
Shit.

487
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,485
-What is this?
-Back off!

488
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,180
Damn it. Guys, whack them.

489
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,986
Oh, boy. I told him to go easy on them.

490
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,366
That old man's not here.

491
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,493
I guess you can't use the staff
without him.

492
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,706
That little girl is ill.

493
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,251
How could you do this to a kid?

494
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,365
Damn it.

495
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:29,786
Shit.

496
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,418
So-eun. So-eun! Are you okay?

497
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,378
Mun…

498
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,465
Yes, So-eun. You're safe now.

499
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,572
Ga Mo-tak!

500
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,283
No, I mean… Detective Ga.

501
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,452
I didn't do anything.

502
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,329
Shin Myeong-hwi told me--

503
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,003
This is what worthless scumbags
like you deserve.

504
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,047
-Detective Ga.
-This is my motto.

505
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,883
"Beat them up to a pulp
but don't kill them."

506
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,220
I'm one of the top 50 business tycoons
in this country--

507
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,932
Even a criminal like you
is this clever and savvy.

508
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,143
It makes me think
that we really need to smarten up.

509
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,024
Hey, stay with me.

510
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,485
No, get up. Come on.

511
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,153
All right, 12 more punches to go.

512
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,823
I'll make you suffer, you bastard.

513
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,866
Hey, enough!

514
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,201
You'll break his nose.

515
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,955
It's so annoying to waste my power
on healing jerks like him.

516
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,040
Well, I just couldn't control my anger.

517
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,877
Hey, do you realize who
you're dealing with here? I'm Cho Tae-sin!

518
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,802
It'll be a lot of work anyway.
One punch won't make a difference.

519
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,012
All right!

520
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,727
We'll erase these jerks' memories
as well as So-eun's

521
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,229
and say that So-eun called the police.

522
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,024
Wait, where's Ha-na?

523
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,276
What?

524
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,041
You're one persistent bitch.
Is it because you survived that alone?

525
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,084
Shut your mouth.

526
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,003
Those guys probably have no idea

527
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,339
how you survived that day.

528
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,008
I said, shut your mouth!

529
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,557
Go ask your mommy
for some more breast milk.

530
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,185
Oh, she's dead, right?

531
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,400
Shit.

532
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,861
You persistent bitch.

533
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,451
Damn it!

534
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,331
JUNGJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

535
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,792
All done.

536
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,420
Does it mean those men will be punished?

537
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,880
Yes, of course.

538
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,007
Thanks to you,
who bravely told us everything.

539
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,717
Thank you.

540
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,594
Get some rest. I'll visit you again.

541
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,353
My gosh. You're amazing, So-eun.

542
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,021
Thanks, Mun.

543
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,231
For what?

544
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,651
I had a dream last night.

545
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:51,530
In my dream, you beat up those bad guys

546
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,116
and saved me. You were so cool.

547
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,252
It makes me anxious even now.

548
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,672
Had anything bad happened to her,
I would have…

549
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,299
I'd…

550
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,552
In the end,

551
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,054
So-eun helped us catch…

552
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,432
Cho Tae-sin.

553
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,272
-Get lost!
-Take responsibility!

554
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,815
-It's all on you!
-Be responsible!

555
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,942
-Take down Taesin!
-This is our basic right!

556
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,156
-He's coming out!
-A comment, please!

557
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,658
-Say a few words.
-Do you admit to the charges?

558
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,743
A comment, please!

559
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,660
-Sir!
-Over here!

560
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,704
Any comment as the chairman of Taesin?

561
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,872
Apologize to the kids!

562
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,083
This is a mere conspiracy
against me and Taesin Group.

563
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,627
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

564
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,962
-Sir!
-Is everything true?

565
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:49,921
A comment, please!

566
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,715
-Sir!
-Do you admit to the charges?

567
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,425
-Look over here!
-Hey!

568
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,011
-My gosh!
-What was that?

569
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:56,928
What happened?

570
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,555
-Let's get out of here.
-Everyone!

571
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,349
-What's going on?
-Huge articles on the front page, please!

572
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,729
That evil son of a bitch
doesn't even deserve to be called human.

573
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,982
We can put up with all kinds of jerks,

574
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,486
but not those who hurt our children!

575
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,447
-Get down.
-I'm counting on you reporters!

576
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,784
Our old man's trying hard.

577
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,498
-Goodness.
-What the…

578
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,250
Jeez! Enough!

579
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,336
-Calm down.
-You piece of…

580
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,921
-Out of the way!
-Move back!

581
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,676
A comment, please!

582
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,512
-How do you feel?
-A comment, please.

583
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:43,099
They'll finally reassess
the entire ICT project.

584
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,768
The kids…

585
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,854
can finally drink clean water.

586
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,648
-Sir!
-Do you admit to everything?

587
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,149
-Look here!
-Say a few words!

588
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,150
-Sir!
-Get lost!

589
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,152
-Get lost!
-You bastard!

590
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,321
-Let's go.
-Hold on!

591
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,323
-Convict him!
-Take responsibility!

592
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,618
That girl can't do anything alone,

593
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,537
but if those rats show up together

594
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,330
with their staffs, we'll be screwed.

595
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,208
If you don't have a plan,
we should just leave.

596
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,126
Come on!

597
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,587
Jeez. Cho Tae-sin's been arrested,

598
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,297
so we have no money. What now?

599
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,758
We're almost there. Let's hang in there.

600
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,678
When will we get there?

601
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,642
Soon.

602
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,108
Is Ha-na really okay?

603
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,776
Is she hiding somewhere

604
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,862
beating herself up
for losing Baek Hyang-hui?

605
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,323
Even so, it's strange
that she hasn't contacted us.

606
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,243
They say some people experience
teenage angst later on in life.

607
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,455
-Hey!
-You guys are here.

608
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,541
Hey, what happened? We were all worried.

609
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,959
Where have you been?

610
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,169
-I told you not to wander alone--
-I'm sorry.

611
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,296
How's So-eun?

612
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,464
Oh, she's back in the hospital,
safe and sound.

613
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,883
And those jerks got arrested.

614
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,800
Are you okay?

615
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,094
Are you all right, Ha-na?

616
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,181
I found Shin Myeong-hwi.

617
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,725
Seriously?

618
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:07,809
For real?

619
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,102
Where is he now?

620
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,735
Damn it!

621
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,043
I'm asking you where he is!

622
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,628
Sit down.

623
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,631
Yes, calm down.
Let's listen to what Ha-na has to tell us.

624
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,303
Baek Hyang-hui has become stronger.

625
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,682
Even if we were to activate the barrier,
it may not be enough for both of them.

626
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,018
They know what cards we're holding,

627
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,604
but we have no way of gauging
what they can really do.

628
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,189
Is there a way

629
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,942
we can summon Shin when she's not around?

630
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,444
That'd be nice,
but how do we separate her from him?

631
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,989
One good thing is that
it seems like the barrier

632
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,282
hurt Shin Myeong-hwi.

633
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,494
That's why he's trying to recover
in hiding.

634
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,704
If he's trying to recover in hiding…

635
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,122
My gosh.

636
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,208
More lives are being sacrificed.

637
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:17,420
I bet Cho Tae-sin has been helping him.

638
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,924
Now that Cho's out of the picture,
the only one who can help him is…

639
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,302
Baek Hyang-hui.

640
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,100
Why don't we wait until
that crazy wench steps out and attack him?

641
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,726
Let's give it a shot.

642
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,353
Then we can summon the spirit.

643
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,230
The evil spirit inside Shin Myeong-hwi.

644
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,649
If we do that,
we can free my parents' souls

645
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,193
as well as all the other souls

646
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,363
that are locked inside him now.

647
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,116
We must do it as soon as we can,

648
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,618
before Shin Myeong-hwi
becomes even stronger.

649
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,838
I really shouldn't let him
boss me around like this.

650
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,176
How many more lives must I kill
to outpower him?

651
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,360
Let's pull this off.

652
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,820
This may be our last chance.

653
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,030
Stay calm and focused.

654
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,658
-We've done this once, you know.
-All right, let's go.

655
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,131
It's good to see you here.

656
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,215
Don't be delusional.

657
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,843
It's not like I wanted to see you!

658
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:18,226
If I kill one of you,
this will go to shit, right?

659
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,148
Then I should probably kill you.

660
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,992
We're screwed. Those persistent little...

661
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,286
<i>Who tailed you?</i>

662
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,287
<i>They're here?</i>

663
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,788
<i>All of them?</i>

664
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,873
<i>No, not all of them.</i>

665
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,460
<i>Someone followed you</i>
<i>and is eavesdropping on our conversation.</i>

666
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,711
<i>What do we do now?</i>

667
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,712
<i>Where can we go?</i>

668
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,047
<i>If they barge in here with their staffs…</i>

669
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,341
<i>We just need to kill one of them.</i>

670
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:53,970
<i>I know who to target.</i>

671
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,348
<i>That bitch will be an easy one.</i>

672
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,145
Am I wrong?

673
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,939
Should I kill everyone but you?

674
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,859
Like what happened to your family.

675
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,030
No, the barrier…

676
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:15,992
No!

677
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,752
-The barrier…
-It got deactivated.

678
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,758
Is this fun for you?

679
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,969
What's so fun about this? Answer me! Hey!

680
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,610
Hey, by the way…

681
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,987
Did you know?

682
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,074
That your whole family would die?

683
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,998
Perhaps you secretly wanted
all of them dead.

684
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,709
Am I wrong?

685
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,597
<i>He can't use his psychokinetic abilities</i>
<i>inside the barrier.</i>

686
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,226
<i>What's going on?</i>

687
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,403
Looks like your pathetic little prank
has ended.

688
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,574
Then shall we begin the real fight now?

689
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,977
What will you do now?

690
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,522
I've become even stronger,

691
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,859
and it's now time for you to give up.

692
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,699
Says who?

693
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,541
Says who?

694
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,296
Who the hell says
it's time for me to give up?

695
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:30,059
THE UNCANNY COUNTER

696
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,271
We were both doomed to be alone
with no family.

697
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,065
Do we have to finish each other off?

698
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,441
Don't you dare compare me to you!

699
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,069
We just have to get Shin Myeong-Hwi now.

700
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,112
Please don't kill me.

701
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,573
Let's kill them, one by one.

702
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,783
What are you?

703
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:44,701
A Counter?

704
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,577
Wait, what? Coun... Who are you?

705
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,329
You said we should bring this to an end.

706
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,414
Is this the end?

707
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,625
I'll be the one putting an end to it,
you bastard.

708
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,419
Let's win today, no matter what.

709
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,463
I pray that no one else dies.

710
01:01:57,534 --> 01:01:59,222
