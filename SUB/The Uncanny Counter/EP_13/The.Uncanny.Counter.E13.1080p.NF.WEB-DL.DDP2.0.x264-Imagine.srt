JAHYE CHILDREN'S HOME

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,217
A children's home?

6
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,179
What is this? We can pay
and stay somewhere better.

7
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,528
Wait here.

8
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,618
JAHYE CHILDREN'S HOME

00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,995
Do you think there's hot water?

10
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,540
Shut your mouth. Your breath stinks.

11
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,250
That one looks good.

12
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,334
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,462
Cheong-sin, come here.

14
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,262
Come here. Right here.

15
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,564
Let's go.

2010 SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION: GRAND PRIZE

17
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:22,076
ASSEMBLYMEN'S MEETING
FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF CHILDREN'S HOMES

18
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,878
Who's there?

19
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,347
Why is this lunatic here this late?

20
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,481
I wanted to see you before I left.

21
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,236
There are two men who I call my father.

22
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,821
One, the father who raised me.

23
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,616
Then the first father in my memories.

24
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,077
You.

25
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,415
Are…

26
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,501
Are you Cheong-sin?

27
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,963
Have you been well, Father?

28
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,176
Goodness, Cheong-sin.

29
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761
You little rascal.

30
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,721
Why didn't you call before you came?

31
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,265
You surprised me.

32
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,685
You've grown so much
that you're unrecognizable…

33
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,487
You remember

34
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
this scar, don't you?

35
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,204
I only ever did what you told me to do.

36
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,915
I thought it was natural.

37
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,085
My lips bled…

38
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,629
my body was covered in bruises…

39
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,257
and my forehead was gashed…

40
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,801
but I thought it was natural.

41
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,679
Why did I think that?

42
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,728
But you're smiling at me…

43
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,564
as if nothing had happened.

44
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,399
What?

45
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,651
I finally realized…

46
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,654
that I was mistaken.

47
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,905
Shut up.

48
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,533
And that everything about this is wrong.

49
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,577
Shut your mouth, you bastard!

50
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,497
You bastard.

51
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,790
You're still the same.

52
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,584
You haven't changed.

53
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,879
You bastard.
You're still out of your mind.

54
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,881
Fine. It's my duty as a parent

55
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,216
to teach my ill-bred child properly.

56
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,887
Get up, you bastard. I said get up!

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,598
Get up. Get up, you bas…

58
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,321
What is this?

59
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm not who I used to be.

60
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,788
No…

61
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,831
Father.

62
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,083
No, wait.

63
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,544
I'm… I'm sorry.

64
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,963
Please let me live.

65
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,715
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,260
So please forgive me.

67
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,767
I'll accept your apology.

68
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,145
But there's something I want.

69
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,271
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

70
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,166
<i>The release of CCTV footage</i>
<i>from random serial killings</i>

71
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,127
<i>that occurred this afternoon</i>
<i>at a commercial building in Jungjin</i>

72
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,463
<i>has shocked the public.</i>

73
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,549
<i>The police collected</i>
<i>all the footage from the area…</i>

74
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,884
That's Ji Cheong-sin.

75
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,760
Isn't it?

76
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,387
<i>They're narrowing down…</i>

77
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,097
What are those jerks doing?

78
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,765
What should we do?

79
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,435
They'll keep doing that
whenever they get hungry.

80
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,104
It's not something we can handle.

81
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
This isn't good.

82
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,941
Let's go up together.

83
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,529
<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>the tip line or social media…</i>

84
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,036
Ji Cheong-sin has become complete.

85
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,582
Complete?

86
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,546
The host and the evil spirit

87
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,924
have become one.

88
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,300
What?

89
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,635
That's the infamous

90
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,970
final level of the evil spirit.

91
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,889
He's now immortal.

92
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,141
He'll now live forever.

93
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,311
Wait, then what…

94
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,522
What's going to happen now?

95
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,731
Our references say

96
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,567
that an evil spirit who becomes whole

97
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,861
obtains a new kind of power.

98
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,322
What is it?

99
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,702
It can begin to heal itself
just as Ms. Chu does.

100
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,871
What is this?

101
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,962
So how can we capture him?

102
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,548
It's our first time, but I'm sure

103
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,591
you have some kind of data.

104
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,302
Yes, you just mentioned
that you had references.

105
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,638
It's from over a century ago.

106
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,681
What?

107
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,725
It's practically
our first time too, Ms. Chu.

108
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,228
What kind of nonsense is this?

109
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,396
Wait.

110
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,273
So, what do you suggest?

111
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,441
All of us together
barely managed to capture

112
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,693
a level three. So--

113
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,902
One second.

114
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,737
Then…

115
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,574
what will happen now?

116
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,577
I mean, my mom and dad's souls.

117
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,496
If Ji Cheong-sin won't die

118
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,332
and will live forever,
what will happen to my mom and dad?

119
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,461
A month after
an evil spirit unites with its host,

120
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,006
the souls it ate up…

121
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,467
will perish.

122
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,304
Perish?

123
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,681
We can't summon them?

124
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,143
You promised…

125
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,563
to let me see my mom and dad.

126
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,441
You promised!

127
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,279
I have to tell them something
one last time!

128
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,114
Mun.

129
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,955
There is one way.

130
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,459
What is it?

131
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,919
What am I supposed to do now?

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,465
Barrier.

133
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,928
Barrier?

134
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,389
What is that?

135
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,227
<i>The front-runner</i>
<i>in the presidential election,</i>

<i>was arrested by the police</i>
<i>as a murder suspect this afternoon.</i>

138

A twist

146
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,251
couldn't get any more dramatic than this.

147
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,838

Do you know…

151
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,895
how I got past all those great
and mighty smart-asses…

152
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,484
and brought myself to this place?

153
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,610
How?

154
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
By making wise choices.

155
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,449
Choice.

156
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,744
When life gives you a forked road,

157
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,872
you have to choose one person

158
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,166
and abandon the other.

159
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,419
That choice.

160
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,798
Chang-gyu.

Sorry?

Shin Myeong-hwi?

165
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,313
Cho Tae-sin?

166
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,987
Or Noh Hang-gyu?

167
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,295
He will plead the Fifth.

168
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,673
He won't cooperate
with a biased investigation

being held at the police station
in Oh Yeong-deok's constituency.

00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,514
Don't bring politics into a murder case.

172
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,517
You people mixed politics
into this case first.

173
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,521
You obtained the evidence illegally
and announced that the DNA matches his.

174
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,941
Everything you did is considered libel

175
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,153
against a candidate
in the next presidential election,

176
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,571
Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi.

177
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,917
Ms. Jang.

178
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,586
REPORTER KIM HYEON-GYU

179
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,924
-Why won't you answer it?
-Pardon?

180
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,926
Call the reporters
about the admissions fraud

181
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,219
involving Oh Yeong-deok's son.

182
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,137
We need to use that as our counter!

183
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,934
Political slander. A dirty fight.

184
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,187
Do I have to spell out everything?

185
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,364
EONNI'S NOODLES

186
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,209
Barrier?

187
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,670
What is that?

188
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,299
Su-ho.

189
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,677
What is it?

190
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,304
What?

191
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,941
We've only seen this method
in old writings.

192
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,736
It's our first time,
so we can't make any guarantees.

193
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,241
So what is this?

194
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,411
Are you asking us to do something
that's not even verified?

195
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,371
What are these staffs?

196
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,832
You always just sat there.
Where did you get these?

197
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,876
What kind of nonsense is this?

198
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,002
What is this?

199
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,548
These were made with birch trees
planted by the first Yung people.

200
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,928
I guess you could call them
magical staffs.

201
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,512
Like in <i>Harry Potter?</i>

202
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,390
But I'm not sure
if these can really do magic.

203
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,606
Be careful not to get hurt.

204
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,983
It could get dangerous.

205
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,736
We could get hurt?

206
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,739
Why are you telling us to do this?

207
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,741
You haven't even examined this.

208
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,242
This is the only way…

209
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,578
to catch a level four.

210
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,538
-Su-ho, are you serious--
-No.

211
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,332
Let's hear them out first.

212
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,708
He says it's the only way.

213
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,254
Okay.

214
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,507
U-sik, you go first.

215
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,268
Now,

216
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,813
everyone, watch closely.

217
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,399
Especially you, Mun.

218
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,643
<i>What you're seeing right now</i>
<i>is the barrier.</i>

219
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,231
<i>Someone from Yung</i>
<i>or someone who's with them</i>

220
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,400
<i>can raise this staff to create a barrier.</i>

221
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,445
<i>And those who have souls in them</i>

222
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,198
<i>will become weak</i>
<i>once they're trapped in this barrier,</i>

223
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,285
<i>and they can't use any powers</i>
<i>like psychokinesis.</i>

224
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,415
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>Counters will lose their spiritual powers</i>

225
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,958
<i>as the territory powers them.</i>

226
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,339
Then if we can bring Ji Cheong-sin
into this barrier,

227
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,551
we can also summon him, right?

228
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,219
Right?

229
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,138
<i>But remember,</i>

230
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,933
<i>in order to use your power</i>
<i>within this barrier,</i>

231
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,977
<i>you need Yung's territory.</i>

232
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,316
<i>That means, Mun, you must be</i>
<i>in full control of the territory.</i>

233
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,526
Enough!

234
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,002
It almost killed me to just stand here.

235
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,130
Are you sure we can do this?

236
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,925
Those who create it are outside,
so it's possible.

237
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,012
But you won't able to move
while you hold the barrier up.

238
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,265
And though it isn't as bad
as being inside, it's still draining.

239
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,311
There's a chance
you won't be able to hold out.

240
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
It's even tough for the people of Yung.

241
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,859
He must be summoned quickly
to maintain the safety of the Counters

242
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,445
who are outside the barrier,
as well as the ones inside.

243
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,282
Everyone, remember.

244
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,077
When the territory is gone,

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,995
the barrier will be gone too.

246
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,914
And once the barrier is gone,

247
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,876
the Counters could also find themselves
in danger.

248
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,380
Be careful.

249
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,468
And, Mun…

250
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,223
in creating the barrier

251
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,810
and summoning the evil spirit
within that barrier,

252
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,980
the most important thing is the territory.

253
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:09,982
Do you understand?

254
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,359
I'll do it.

255
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,695
I will…

256
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,365
<i>make sure I'll control</i>
<i>the territory of Yung.</i>

257
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,838
<i>In order to carry out Wi-gen's plan,</i>

258
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,092
<i>I have to be able to call</i>
<i>the territory to me</i>

259
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,219
<i>at will.</i>

260
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,848
<i>This isn't good enough.</i>
<i>We won't stand a chance.</i>

261
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,223
Ms. Chu.

262
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,351
Can we really let Mun keep doing that?

263
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,395
He's been doing that for hours
without a break.

264
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,982
He must be that desperate.

265
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,402
It's not like anyone else can do this
for him.

266
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,863
Goodness, I miss

267
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,785
the days when he used to act silly
around us.

268
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,081
What does he want to tell them?

269
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,375
What?

270
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,627
Mun, I mean.

271
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,964
He said he has something to say
to his parents.

272
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,842
Parents and kids miss one another

273
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,970
even when they are
in each other's presence.

274
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,722
And they said goodbye so abruptly.

275
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,933
I'm sure he has millions of things to say.

276
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,270
So why are you so interested?

277
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,813
That's not like you.

278
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,148
Interested? I'm not interested.

279
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,109
He's in high school.

280
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,446
Hey.

281
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,865
Gosh.

282
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,709
Think of this as our last chance
to catch Ji Cheong-sin.

283
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,795
He learns very quickly,

284
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,422
so we have to catch him

285
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,923
once we have him trapped.

286
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,675
Yes.

287
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,262
So the ones
who will be holding these staffs

288
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,724
are you, me, Mo-tak, and Mun.

289
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,934
If the four of us will be holding these,

290
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,686
who'll summon him?

291
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,896
Oh, it's--

292
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,315
Who do you think?

293
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,401
Mun will have to do it himself.

294
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,405
He'll call forth the territory
and summon Ji Cheong-sin.

295
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,656
He's doing it?

296
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,160
There's an old adage for this.
"The one who tied the knot must untie it."

297
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,912
Speak of the devil.

298
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,998
He shows up as soon as I mention him.

299
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,333
Were you listening?

300
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,210
See? It fits perfectly in my hands.

301
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,962
-Hi-yah!
-Goodness.

302
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,343
My gosh. Stop fooling around in here.

303
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,889
Jang-mul is going to take
one of the four staffs.

304
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,768
What can we do?
We have no one around here.

305
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,019
What do you mean?

306
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,564
Ms. Chu, have you forgotten already?

307
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,233
Think of our beautiful days in the field.

308
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,403
We worked in great harmony,
like a ping-pong game.

309
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,239
-Give. Yippee.
-Take. Whoopee.

310
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,449
What's with me?

311
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,619
What do kids call this nowadays?

312
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,661
Tiki-taka, right?

313
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,998
Where did he get that from?
He's way too loud.

314
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,378
-Anyway, Chairman Choi,
-Yes?

315
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,298
it's not that I don't trust you,

316
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:07,094
but you're going out in the field
for the first time in a while.

317
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,137
You might not be like your old self.

318
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,597
-Will you be okay?
-I see.

319
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,602
We aren't in the position
to worry about my age or condition.

320
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,730
Wi-gen told me everything too.

321
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,610
We only have a month
to summon Mun's parents.

322
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,863
In soccer, we call this the stoppage time.

323
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,575
It's when even the goalie
gets out on the field to score.

324
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,245
Ha-na.

325
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,789
Make sure you stay sharp too.

326
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,792
Ji Cheong-sin thinks we're dead,

327
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,503
so he'll step into our territory
at least once.

328
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,421
I'll be on the lookout.

329
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,132
Anyway,

330
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,425
where's Mo-tak?

331
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,303
Don't even get me started.

332
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,182
I've been too heartbroken
to look at that kid these days.

333
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,561
If he's sad, he may as well just say so.

334
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,063
He spaces out all day long.

335
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,149
Sometimes, he stays out all day,

336
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,568
doing who knows what out there.

337
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,779
If Mo-tak makes another mistake,

338
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,823
they warned us they'll disqualify him.

339
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,617
I'm worried sick.

340
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,127
<i>The culprit is a detective.</i>

341
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,379
<i>Someone who served 20 years.</i>

342
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,050
All the cameras in the vicinity

343
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,135
were either broken or just off her route.

344
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,597
<i>It's someone who knows this area well,</i>

345
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:21,436
<i>and I'm sure the CCTV footage</i>
<i>was already taken care of.</i>

346
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,074
You surprised me!

347
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,992
What's with you, man?

348
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,619
Are you crazy?

349
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,371
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,502
Wait, so you waited here for five days

351
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,296
to get my dashcam footage?

352
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,091
Goodness, you poor thing.
I was away on a trip.

353
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:56,012
Yes, you seem to always park
your car over here.

354
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,556
Well, I usually do.

355
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,936
Anyway, so, what's on that footage?

356
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:11,152
The woman I love was here, then…

357
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,738
My goodness.

358
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,826
I see. Goodness.

359
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,204
I understand how you feel.

360
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,956
That can happen.

361
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,292
You should cheer up.

362
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,544
Forget her quickly and live a new life.

363
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,922
I caught my wife cheating on me

364
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,341
in a parking lot too!

365
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,844
Goodness, that damn brat.

366
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,431
Why do these people
always have affairs in parking lots?

367
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,851
Sir, that's not…

368
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,269
I get it.

369
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,770
I know how you feel.

370
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,273
I understand.

371
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,319
Goodness, this brings back old memories.

372
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,321
Goodness, I know.

373
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,322
That's not it.

374
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,948
I know how you feel too.

375
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:01,703
Damn it, I'm about to cry.

376
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,830
EONNI'S NOODLES

377
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,128
The dashcam footage…

378
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,090
of the cars in the parking lot
on the day Jeong-yeong died.

379
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,217
You went out…

380
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,971
looking for these yourself?

381
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,682
They're calling it a suicide
and won't investigate,

382
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,559
so I'm doing it myself.

383
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,148
This and this.

384
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:54,941
And this one too.

385
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,111
The culprit's silhouette
was caught on camera.

386
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,864
But it's too dark to see who it is.

387
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,618
Could you put in a request
with the NFS's Digital Analysis Team?

388
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,413
I'll give it a try.

389
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,671
Can I really trust you?

390
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,298
Sorry?

391
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,721
Jeong-yeong told me…

392
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,516
not to trust anyone at the police station.

393
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,187
That they were the people
who destroyed the evidence

394
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,022
that was handed over to the NFS.

395
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,983
And you knew Jeong-yeong's whereabouts

396
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,652
better than anyone else.

397
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:44,866
So can I really trust you…

398
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:50,747
and believe you aren't on their side?

399
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,833
You… You're…

400
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,087
blaming the wrong man.

401
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,131
I'm really not…

402
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,760
on their side.

403
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,309
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

404
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,560
So why?

405
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,480
Why was Mr. Shin's case reported to Seoul?

406
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,107
We asked for their cooperation,
but they're ignoring us.

407
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,943
It's a high-profile case,

408
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,778
so they're walking on eggshells, too.

409
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,738
Damn it!

410
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,117
Learn how to knock!

411
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,833
I found evidence from the scene
of Jeong-yeong's death.

412
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,088
-What?
-What's the evidence?

413
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,297
Where did you get it?

414
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,549
From Ga Mo-tak.

415
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,761
He found dashcam footage from the cars
that were in the parking lot

416
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,971
and went to the NFS.

417
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,185
All right. Great work.

418
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,479
You may leave.

419
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,906
You idiot. Didn't you get rid of the CCTV
and dashcam footage?

420
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,199
I did get rid of it.

421
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,744
Damn it, this has never happened before.

422
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,622
Why are you standing around?
Run over to the NFS and stop him!

423
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,709
Remember. If things go haywire,

424
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,460
you and I will both go down.

425
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,255
That'll be the end of us, you idiot!

426
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,339
Yes, sir.

427
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,383
Hurry up! Run!

428
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,888
Damn it.

429
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,103
Han-ul, follow me.

430
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,651
What are you doing, you punk? Follow me.

431
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,910
What's going on? What's with all of you?

432
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,872
<i>You idiot. Didn't you get rid of the CCTV</i>
<i>and dashcam footage?</i>

433
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,291
<i>I did get rid of it.</i>
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

434
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,460
<i>Why are you standing around?</i>
<i>Run over to the NFS</i>

435
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,086
<i>-and stop him!</i>
-You asshole!

436
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,421
-Stop him.
-Get him off.

437
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,174
-Give it back. Give it to me!
-Let go of him.

438
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,842
-How dare you?
-You need to stop.

439
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,344
-You asshole.
-Stop it.

440
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,428
-Stop it.
-Let me go!

441
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,265
-Let me go, you jerk!
-Stop that.

442
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,100
We should straighten this out.

443
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,187
The asshole here…

444
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,358
is you, asshole.

445
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,059
I found evidence

446
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,769
from the scene of Jeong-yeong's death.

447
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,199
<i>You idiot. Didn't you get rid of the CCTV</i>
<i>and dashcam footage?</i>

448
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,785
<i>I did get rid of it.</i>
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

449
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,412
<i>Why are you standing around?</i>

450
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,664
<i>Run over to the NFS and stop him!</i>

451
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,416
<i>Remember. If things go haywire,</i>

452
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,251
<i>you and I will both go down.</i>

453
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,003
Choi Su-ryong, you're under arrest

454
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,963
for Detective Kim Jeong-yeong's murder

455
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,257
and destruction of evidence.

456
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,677
You have the right to remain silent,

457
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,887
and to consult an attorney…

458
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,852
Mo-tak.

459
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,439
How could you…

460
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,110
do that to Jeong-yeong?

461
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,255
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,552
How do you call yourself human?

463
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,262
-Mo-tak.
-Calm down.

464
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,389
I looked up to you.

465
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,225
Su-ryong.

466
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,478
How did you

467
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,730
end up this low?

468
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,899
I'm sorry, Mo-tak.

469
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,323
And…

470
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,452
all for what?

471
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,182
CHIEF'S OFFICE

472
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,274
Thanks, Detective Kang.

473
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,400
No.

474
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,236
I should apologize.

475
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,321
I'm really not…

476
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,908
on their side.

477
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,411
Yes, I'm sure you aren't.

478
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,413
You probably aren't.

479
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,916
But remember this.

480
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,710
Not taking action
when you witness an evil deed

481
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,464
is another form of wickedness.

482
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,886
I have an idea.

483
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,479
Detective Kim must've been very lonely.

484
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,690
I should've been more helpful.

485
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,821
Wait, Mo-tak.

486
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,870
This is the key to her locker.

487
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,706
I haven't been able
to give it to her family yet.

488
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,377
LIEUTENANT KIM JEONG-YEONG

489
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,275
<i>I have to think back to that time.</i>

490
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,361
Why?

491
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,188
Why?

492
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,324
Mun.

493
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,785
It's me. Hey, it's me.

494
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,663
-Ms. Chu.
-Oh, sorry.

495
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,625
-Goodness, Mun.
-I'm sorry.

496
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,961
You should've studied hard like this.

497
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,714
Let's go up and eat some noodles.

498
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,174
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm all right.

499
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,135
You could've gone to SNU.

500
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,596
Here. I topped it
with a lot of dried seaweed.

501
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,515
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

502
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:39,191
I remember when I first
made those noodles for you.

503
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,401
We're done.

504
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,779
Hello.

505
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,081
Thank you

506
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,293
for the noodles and also for my leg.

507
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,879
You must be hungry. Eat up.

508
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,220
Hey, what's with you?

509
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,362
You're a big boy now, Mun.

510
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,324
Really?

511
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,038
I feel

512
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,166
kind of sorry for you, Mun.

513
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,296
You don't have to be sorry.

514
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,550
I pretty much forced you

515
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,470
to join us as a Counter.

516
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,765
You should be out having fun with friends

517
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,434
instead of catching evil spirits.

518
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,439
I made the decision to do this.

519
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,571
I think about this from time to time.

520
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,449
What would life have been like

521
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,619
if I had died in a coma?

522
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,291
I get sick and tired of seeing
those trashy evil spirits.

523
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,336
But whenever I'm in that mood,

524
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,755
I go make some noodles.

525
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,968
Once I get some hearty broth in me,

526
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,178
it makes me feel great,

527
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,806
and when I see people enjoy this,

528
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,392
that also makes me feel wonderful.

529
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,148
And, yes, the world
isn't just full of evil spirits.

530
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,526
We get this time to laugh, chat,

531
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,862
and live with one another.

532
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,156
That's life.

533
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,784
That's what I think.

534
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,419
-Mun!
-Mun!

535
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,546
Hey, what's going on?

536
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,632
What brings you here?

537
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,342
"What brings you here"?

538
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,678
Do you have any right to say that to us?

539
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,472
Seriously. You always ignore our calls.

540
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,932
When you do answer,
you say you're too busy to see us.

541
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,851
Sorry.

542
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,395
We can't resolve this with words.

543
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,232
-Hello.
-Hey, you two.

544
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,985
Could you close your eyes for a moment?

545
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,778
-My eyes? Sure.
-For a moment.

546
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
-Wait, why…
-Thank you.

547
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,656
-You!
-Ouch!

548
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,992
-You jerk!
-Goodness, kids.

549
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,076
Goodness, Mun.

550
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,328
He's tired. Let him go.

551
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,418
It's been forever since we did this.

552
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,419
Forever, my ass.

553
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,716
Hey, wait. Isn't that Shin Hyeok-u?

554
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,809
I can't believe he ended up like that.

555
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,977
Stop glaring at me.

556
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,024
Hey, Hyeok-u.

557
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,320
So why did you stop paying?

558
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,698
I stopped giving you special treatment
ages ago.

559
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,408
Instead of the president's son,

560
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,993
he became a murderer's son.

561
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,830
I thought we'd go to the Blue House.
We'll have to visit him in prison instead.

562
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,667
Mun, let's go.

563
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,337
-Hey, Mun.
-Hey.

564
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,466
Stop it.

565
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,972
I told you…

566
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,559
not to beat up friends of my friends
or their friends.

567
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,106
Damn, you're lucky.

568
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,441
Let's go.

569
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,913
Are you okay?

570
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,877
Getting a kick out of acting cool?

571
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,552
Mind your own business.

572
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,811
Goodness. That annoying kid.

573
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,062
He's so ungrateful.

574
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,773
That rude jerk.

575
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,536
Ms. Jang.

576
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,913
We just have to get past this.

577
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,000
We've done well up to this point.

578
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,046
I have only one more wish left.

579
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,006
I want…

580
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,300
to give my everything

581
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,219
for my country and our people.

582
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,349
I can't go down like this.

583
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,227
And I could dream of doing this…

584
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,522
all thanks to you.

585
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,366
Ms. Jang, you know…

586
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,368
that…

587
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,995
you have my trust, right?

588
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,754
GYEONGIN POLICE STATION

589
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,838
Ms. Jang!

590
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,635
Let's go for a drive.

591
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,476
Let's go.

592
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,108
-Give it to me.
-I got it.

593
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,989
What are we doing here?

594
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,741
Are you here to do charity work?

595
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,035
I hate kids, so I never had one.

596
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,162
So why should I watch other people's kids?

597
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,622
Shut up. They'll hear you.

598
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,376
We're here because you made trouble.

599
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,087
We should stay here until it gets quiet.

600
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,091
What? How long do you expect me
to be with these rascals?

601
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,386
What are you doing?

602
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,683
Here.

603
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,103
Mister.

604
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,524
When will our father come back?

605
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,359
Your father?

606
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,822
Something urgent came up,
so he'll be back in a few days.

607
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,326
But is it really okay for us
to keep playing?

608
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,036
We'll get in trouble.

609
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,539
It's okay. It's all right.

610
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,291
Just do as you like.

611
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,418
You won't get in trouble from now on.

612
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,521
Hey.

613
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,441
How long do you think
you can fool those kids?

614
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,402
What good will it do
to fool them for a short while?

615
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,572
What's so bad about seeing
the dark side of the world early on?

616
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,159
Don't you think they'll be shocked

617
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,536
when they find out the truth?

618
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,039
They're already--

619
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,126
Hey, wait.

620
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,129
Do you think you would've been different

621
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,924
if you'd grown up with a nice family?

622
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,051
Shut up.

623
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,094
If you speak up again,

624
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,180
you'll never get to speak again.

625
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,008
<i>He stepped on it.</i>

626
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,137
Okay, the Year of the Dog.

627
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,015
"No matter how tough things are,
don't lose courage."

628
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,101
He stepped on it. We've seen him before.

629
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,310
We saw him with Ji.

630
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,813
-Call Jang-mul right now.
-Okay.

631
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,524
What about Mun?

632
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,362
Okay, fine. I won't ignore you.

633
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,655
-Pick it up.
-Go.

634
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,490
Let's go. Bye.

635
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,616
-Bye.
-Bye.

636
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,292
No!

637
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,638
Are you okay?

638
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,019
Did that really happen?

639
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,355
<i>What happened?</i>

640
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,401
Ms. Chu.

641
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,986
Ms. Chu, no!

642
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,657
<i>Anger or the desire to kill</i>

643
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,409
<i>wasn't…</i>

644
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,745
<i>what summoned Yung's territory.</i>

645
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,625
I told you not to hurt my friends.

646
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,543
Is it that hard?

647
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,170
<i>It was my desire</i>

648
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,380
<i>to save someone.</i>

649
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,841
<i>That was it.</i>

650
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,014
Mun…

651
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,017
is over there.

652
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,950
Hey, kid.

653
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,952
Hello.

654
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,038
We've met already.

655
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,040
I was still glad to see you.

656
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,793
Do you want some delicious snacks?

657
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,378
Really?

658
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,339
Yes. It's really delicious.

659
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,300
Come with me.

660
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,684
The outskirts of Jungjin.

661
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,687
JAHYE CHILDREN'S HOME

662
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,439
Jahye Children's Home.

663
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,816
Near the border of Seoul.

664
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,113
Is it really good?

665
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,535
I want to go.

666
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,124
You can't.

667
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,836
I'm hungry, too.

668
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,471
Ji Cheong-sin is inside.

669
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,357
I told you not to mess with kids.

670
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,942
It's not-- I…

671
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,712
What's going on? What's wrong with him?

672
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,912
Hurry up and run.

673
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,127
Pack up.

674
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,837
We're leaving.

675
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,843
Mr. Shin.

676
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,555
You've become rather worn out.

677
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,021
What's happening?

678
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,857
What do you mean?

679
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,777
You told me to mind my business.

680
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,613
Then why are you here?

681
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,033
I came to say farewell.

682
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,160
This is the last time
I'm checking in with you.

683
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,708
-What?
-Don't be too sad.

684
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,628
Well, technically speaking,

685
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,464
you cut me off first.

686
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,718
Cho Tae-sin, you bastard.

687
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,642
I never knew
you could be so harsh with your words.

688
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,227
You asshole.

689
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,108
Mr. Mayor.

690
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,735
You have every right to get angry,

691
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,697
but you should see this first.

692
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,156
It wasn't easy to get this.

693
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,589
I'm sure you already know

694
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,174
that Kim Yeong-nim and Ms. Jang
were very close

695
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,676
back when she volunteered.

696
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,845
REFORMERS' PARTY, SHIN MYEONG-HWI

697
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,346
I WILL WORK FOR THE PEOPLE!

698
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,599
That's why

699
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:10,604
Ms. Jang asked Kim Yeong-nim
to pet-sit her dog from time to time.

700
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,148
And she must have missed her dog,

701
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,859
so she installed a pet cam.

702
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,779
You know,
the kind that takes videos of the pet

703
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,074
and sends the videos to the owner's phone.

704
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,368
What you're seeing now

705
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:30,123
was caught on that pet cam.

706
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,296
And this video was sent

707
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,133
to Ms. Jang's cell phone.

708
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,431
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu

709
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,644
went through so much trouble
cleaning up this mess.

710
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,730
Don't you remember?

711
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,279
Right here. This is the climax.

712
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,700
Three…

713
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,453
two…

714
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:10,622
one.

715
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,375
Ta-da.

716
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,805
Mr. Shin.

717
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,724
I believe…

718
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,812
life is all about making choices.

719
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,697
I am dying to know

720
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,034
what you will choose to do.

721
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,317
You should've gotten here sooner.

722
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,820
Time is gold to Counters.

723
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,989
You're here early for once. Don't nag.

724
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,575
The territory just disappeared.

725
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,576
Ha-na.

726
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,077
What's going on in there?

727
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,334
Ready to go?

728
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,878
I said, are you all ready to go?

729
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,923
There are lots of kids.

730
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,467
I can hear Ji Cheong-sin, too.

731
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,719
Are the kids being held hostage?

732
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,054
I doubt it.

733
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,388
How do you know?

734
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,854
<i>Ji Cheong-sin grew up here.</i>

735
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,361
The kids are laughing.

736
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:06,905
Laughing?

737
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,181
You might as well adopt them.

738
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,939
Where are we going now?

739
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,441
Go your own way.

740
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,360
There's no reason
for us to stick together.

741
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,695
You pestered me to join you first.

742
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,698
Now that everyone knows my face,
what did you say? Go my own way?

743
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,575
Did you already forget?

744
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,328
What did I say I'll do if you get noisy?

745
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,917
If you're going to stick around, shut up.

746
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,467
Shit.

747
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,556
Let's bring it in.

748
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,057
What? All of a sudden?

749
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,350
Hurry up and do it.

750
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,060
-Don't grab me that tightly.
-Hey.

751
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,145
-Come in.
-Ha-na.

752
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:22,856
Okay.

753
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,235
-Mun, don't get nervous.
-Don't.

754
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,987
Just do as you've always done.

755
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,322
Let's go see your parents.

756
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,782
Yes.

757
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,410
We have to see Cheol-jung, too.

758
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:38,746
Okay.

759
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,082
I'll call the territory

760
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,168
and summon him there.

761
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,670
Your eyes look determined. That's it, Mun.

762
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,505
Okay.

763
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,215
We can do this!

764
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,216
-We can do it.
-Hey.

765
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,217
That was useless.

766
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,878
JAHYE CHILDREN'S HOME

767
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,950
I thought he died…

768
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,161
You.

769
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,542
What on earth are you doing?

770
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,046
Let's end this.

771
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,765
You coward.

772
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,268
You couldn't take me on alone,
so you came up with this crazy plan.

773
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,353
No.

774
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,189
It's okay to be a coward
with an asshole like you!

775
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,956
I'm summoning this evil spirit,
Ji Cheong-sin…

776
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,919
to Yung!

777
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,574
Go!

778
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,163
No!

779
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,791
You…

780
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,960
Move aside! Move!

781
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,504
Move.

782
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,089
Please don't!

783
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,051
Please let him go this once.

784
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,555
I won't do that again.

785
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,522
Please don't hit him.

786
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,358
I'm so sorry.

787
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,570
Please…

788
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,160
Please don't do it.

789
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,747
Watch and see

790
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,583
what happens to your parents.

791
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:41,632
No!

792
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,978
<i>We have a news flash.</i>

793
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,397
<i>The mayor of Jungjin, Shin Myeong-hwi,</i>

794
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,150
<i>was found unconscious</i>
<i>around nine o'clock this evening</i>

795
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,527
<i>in a jail cell</i>
<i>at the Gyeongin Police Station.</i>

796
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,030
<i>The police are investigating the details,</i>

797
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,533
<i>but some suggest</i>
<i>he suffered from a great deal of pressure</i>

798
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,118
<i>while he was being questioned</i>

799
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,829
<i>as a suspect</i>
<i>in the murder of Kim Yeong-nim</i>

800
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,249
<i>and decided to take extreme measures.</i>

801
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,837
<i>Shin was sent to a nearby hospital</i>
<i>to get treated,</i>

802
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,339
<i>but according to our source,</i>

803
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,258

THE UNCANNY COUNTER

805
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,255
<i>I'm sorry, Mun.</i>

806
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,716
<i>I won't give up like this.</i>

807
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,594
If you're right, it found a host
with the same vibrational frequency.

808
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,347
In other words, it must've gone
to someone who's that evil.

809
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,683
What? You're alive?

810
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:15,893
-Where's Shin Myeong-hwi?
-What?

811
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,061
Where is he?

812
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,064
<i>-More lives are being sacrificed.</i>
<i>-Let's do everything we can.</i>

813
