1
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:17,820
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:19,071
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:44,305
What will you do now?

4
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:47,766
I've become even stronger,

5
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:51,103
and it's now time for you to give up.

6
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:58,027
Says who?

7
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:06,744
Says who?

8
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,832
Who the hell says
it's time for me to give up?

9
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:51,288
Mun.

10
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:54,959
Let's get that asshole first.

11
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,994
We were both doomed to be alone
with no family.

12
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:32,162
Do we have to finish each other off?

13
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,248
Don't you dare compare me to you!

14
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:05,154
Damn it.

15
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:18,000
We've known each other
for seven awful years.

16
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:21,670
It's time to put this behind us,
you asshole.

17
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:46,820
Mun!

18
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:49,281
-Mun!
-No!

19
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,248
Ms. Chu...

20
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,208
Ms. Chu.

21
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,918
Ms. Chu.

22
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,294
Ms. Chu!

23
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:03,337
Old man.

24
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,380
Ms. Chu.

25
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,757
-Please keep her safe. Mun.
-Yes?

26
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,966
-Ms. Chu.
-Ha-na needs us.

27
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:11,261
I'm fine.

28
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,679
-I'm okay.
-Are you?

29
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:30,280
You're still breathing?

30
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:47,965
I'm summoning…

31
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:50,342
this evil spirit.

32
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:29,483
EPISODE 15

33
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,484
I'm sorry.

34
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,069
It's my fault. The staffs…

35
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:34,696
I'm sorry.

36
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:37,199
I know

37
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,035
you did your best, given the situation.

38
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,914
It's a shame that the staffs are broken,

39
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:46,583
but even after the barrier disappeared,

40
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,377
we put up a good fight against Shin.

41
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,088
If we work as a team

42
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:52,881
and stay as a team,

43
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:55,133
we can catch him.

44
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,261
We can do this.

45
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,513
You're right.

46
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,557
Ha-na had Baek Hyang-hui summoned,

47
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:04,309
so we only have Shin Myeong-hwi left.

48
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,061
That's right.

49
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,605
All that's left is the biggest asshole.

50
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:12,568
And Mun's getting better
at using his abilities.

51
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:15,571
Summoning our territory
is a piece of cake now.

52
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:17,990
The rocks.
You all saw him lift them up, right?

53
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,200
This kid has no limits.

54
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:22,703
Sounds as if his power is yours.

55
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,873
You always point these things out.

56
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:28,208
But, still, be careful.

57
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,086
It won't be easy
to go up against pure evil.

58
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,507
We have five days left.

59
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,678
Before these souls
held captive by the evil spirit perish,

60
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,722
we must get this done.

61
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:44,266
Yes, of course.

62
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:47,144
We'll make Shin pay for his crimes,

63
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:49,313
get Mo-tak's revenge,

64
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,649
then summon the evil spirit
to save Cheol-jung.

65
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:56,903
And Mun should get to see his parents too.

66
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,037
Meeting's over. Good work.

67
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,996
Let's go.

68
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:09,875
-Follow me.
-What?

69
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,084
-Come on.
-Why?

70
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,878
-Mom.
-Yes?

71
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,130
Are you all right after that attack?

72
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,507
I'm totally fine. I was barely injured.

73
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:31,605
You don't need to worry about me.
Just go on home.

74
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:33,565
Goodness, great work today.

75
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:35,692
Get plenty of rest so you don't get sick.

76
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:36,902
You get some rest too.

77
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,405
The old man got home safely too.

78
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,616
It must've taken its toll on him,

79
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,951
being out in the field
for the first time in ages.

80
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:46,828
Yes.

81
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,082
Mun.

82
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,377
You might feel a lot of pressure

83
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,546
as you continue to find
all kinds of powers you didn't have.

84
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:00,592
And because you want
to rescue your parents quickly,

85
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,802
you might feel rushed.

86
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:07,099
But this isn't just your fight.

87
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,268
It's also a task…

88
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:13,730
for all of us as Counters.

89
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,024
So…

90
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,527
don't put all the pressure on yourself.

91
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:21,363
Okay.

92
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:25,909
Come to the training room
by six in the morning tomorrow.

93
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:27,494
Okay.

94
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,079
What?

95
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:31,957
Hasn't it been a while?

96
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,460
That makes no sense.

97
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,797
Why in the world would I turn myself in

98
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,799
when I should be fleeing abroad?

99
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,676
I didn't say you turned yourself in.

100
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,928
You were sleeping in front of the station.

101
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:48,473
Yes, so why would a fugitive
be sleeping in front of a police station?

102
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:53,103
I don't remember.
I have no recollection at all.

103
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,148
Well, in any case,
you're back where you belong.

104
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:57,691
That's what matters.

105
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,235
Hey, wait.

106
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,280
Then what happened to my face?
Who did this?

107
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:07,409
-Hey! Something is seriously wrong!
-Hey!

108
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,582
Be quiet, will you?

109
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,589
Who's this bitch?

110
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,017
Damn you.
I'll step on you and break your neck.

111
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,492
He's getting stronger and stronger.

112
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,702
We need to kill him.

113
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:51,870
We need to kill him

114
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:53,455
before he gets even stronger.

115
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,010
Mr. Mayor?

116
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:12,641
Mr. Mayor, it's you.

117
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,184
Mr. Mayor.

118
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:25,779
PART-TIME JOBS WITH ACCOMMODATION

119
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:27,948
RESULTS FOR PART-TIME JOBS
WITH ACCOMMODATION

120
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,375
You know your dad has changed.

121
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,336
You've seen those eyes too.

122
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:58,979
I can't believe you invited me in.

123
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,981
This is such a huge honor.

124
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:02,482
Don't mention it.

125
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:03,692
Let's go inside.

126
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:04,734
Sure.

127
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,321
This way, please.

128
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,189
EONNI'S NOODLES

129
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,084
I have to move much faster than I do now

130
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,128
if I want to catch him.

131
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,141
Mun.

132
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:20,560
Ha-na.

133
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,187
Take a seat.

134
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,734
Oh. I'm fine, really.

135
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,495
I saw my family yesterday.

136
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,624
Baek Hyang-hui strangled me yesterday,

137
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,250
and I saw them…

138
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:46,795
for a split second.

139
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,176
Ha-na. Hey, Ha-na.

140
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,845
Ha-yeong.

141
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,514
Ha-na.

142
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,190
Ha-na.

143
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:09,985
You have to go back.

144
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:11,945
Mom.

145
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,613
They're all waiting for you.

146
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,408
Dad.

147
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,418
It might've been a dream.

148
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,845
Normally…

149
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:41,141
it's tough for me
when I'm reminded of my family.

150
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:44,310
I hate it.

151
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:49,733
But…

152
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:52,944
I guess I missed them.

153
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:56,156
When I got to see them,

154
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:00,952
it was great.

155
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,129
I'll help you meet them.

156
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,215
I'll make sure you get to say that thing…

157
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,138
you have to tell your parents.

158
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:46,581
You know, you used to throw people off
just for brushing up against you.

159
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,584
-What's going on?
-This?

160
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:53,505
You're doing it again.
Man, I'm sick of this.

161
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:55,715
What?

162
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:00,970
Love prevails even when people
are in the middle of war. Of course.

163
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:05,100
Stop trying to play Cupid.
It'll make things awkward. Man.

164
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,559
Why are you suddenly leaving?

165
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,603
To make breakfast! Happy?

166
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:13,817
We're here to train.

167
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,027
Let's go.

168
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:20,573
EONNI'S NOODLES

169
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:31,584
EONNI'S NOODLES

170
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:35,630
Goodness.

171
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:37,632
How can you call yourselves a family?

172
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:40,677
You should check in with each other.

173
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,846
Keep it down.

174
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,140
Who called this old man here?

175
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:48,935
Ms. Chu, you have to see a doctor.
Why won't you listen to me?

176
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,604
I don't need to see a doctor.
Can't you tell?

177
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,314
I'm just suffering from fatigue.

178
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:55,650
Stop making a fuss
and get back to business.

179
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,069
Are you sure you're okay, Ms. Chu?

180
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:03,116
You heal us when we get sick,

181
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:04,909
but when you're sick…

182
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,705
there's nothing we can do for you.

183
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,749
-I need to lie down.
-Okay, go ahead.

184
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:28,099
-Come here.
-Hey, wait, whoa!

185
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:29,893
My gosh, hey!

186
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:30,977
Come here.

187
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,314
Why? What?

188
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:36,649
Tell us. What else can you do?

189
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,235
You walk, run, and now you can fly.

190
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:43,698
Wait, did I forget to erase your memories?

191
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,619
I knew it. He's been erasing our memories.

192
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:50,997
No, I was just mumbling to myself.
Don't take it too seriously.

193
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,541
Forget it. Anything we can do to help?

194
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,836
Oh, anything you can do? No.

195
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:02,675
It feels like you've been out there doing

196
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,261
something amazing
with these powers you suddenly got.

197
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:08,348
I can't believe my friend is a hero.
Everything is swell now.

198
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:09,849
-Get a grip.
-Okay.

199
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,726
So anything we can do to help?

200
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,605
Ask away. We're totally ready.

201
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:32,288
Level two.

202
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:34,916
Guys, I'm sorry.

203
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:38,962
It's a level two.
Near Jungjin Intersection.

204
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:00,483
Hi.

205
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,403
What do you want?

206
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:06,823
You're putting on a good act.
Are you an actress?

207
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:08,700
Which one? The evil spirit or the host?

208
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:26,884
It's frightening
to have you right behind my back.

209
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:31,139
Hey, your feet stink through your shoes.

210
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:33,933
I'm busy, so I'll make it quick.

211
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,527
Sir, are you okay?

212
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,446
You must be in shock.

213
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:48,197
But just one second, please.

214
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,035
Who's this? Are you a Counter?

215
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:55,079
Wait, who are… A Count… What?

216
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:56,247
Hey, Mun.

217
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,458
Hey, Mo-tak!

218
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:02,378
"Mo-tak"?

219
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:05,923
"Mo-tak"?

220
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,302
Sorry. I thought I was still in Singapore.

221
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:10,595
Mr. Ga,

222
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,055
sir.

223
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,354
Hey, Jeong-gu! Jeong-gu.

224
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:21,189
Jeong-gu!

225
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:26,361
Man, Jeong-gu. What's going on?
Why are you here? When did you get back?

226
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,196
You two know each other?

227
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,822
-This guy.
-Jeong-gu!

228
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,992
What are you doing here?

229
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:35,453
Why didn't you get here sooner?
I sent you a plane.

230
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:38,623
But you only chartered a plane.
You should've sent a limo too.

231
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:40,208
I took a bus all the way here!

232
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,543
Wait, who's this guy?

233
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:45,463
Oh, this guy is…

234
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,133
Hey. Who's this?

235
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,511
Peace.

236
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,764
This is Mr. Oh Jeong-gu.

237
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:56,182
This is Mr. Choi Jang-mul.

238
00:20:56,766 --> 00:21:00,561
Mr. Oh became my new partner
after you retired.

239
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:01,646
I see.

240
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:03,773
There aren't many Counters
who end up retiring, but…

241
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:06,609
Why not? Because they all die?

242
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,486
What's he saying?

243
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:10,780
Even after retirement,

244
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,408
your powers and responsibilities
as a Counter remain.

245
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:16,202
So I decided to have a little meeting.

246
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:19,747
Man, you're going to make me slave away
just for bringing me back to life.

247
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,626
Anyway, hey.

248
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:26,879
My man, I have a question.

249
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:30,800
I heard the Jangmul Group
has been sponsoring Counters.

250
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:31,717
Is that true?

251
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:32,635
What?

252
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:34,720
So it's true!

253
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:39,142
Yes! This means
I won't ever have to worry about money.

254
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,060
I like that about this job.

255
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,396
Wow, listen to this rude punk.

256
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:45,398
How can this guy be a Counter?

257
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:48,109
It's tough to find one these days.

258
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:53,197
Jeong-gu is a special agent
who'll be dispatched

259
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:55,366
to Singapore, Asia's hub.

260
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:56,576
Dong-pal.

261
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,788
I can already tell
how hopeless this kid is.

262
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,957
If you keep working with him,

263
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,501
you'll end up dying
before your time is up.

264
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,628
This guy is clueless.

265
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:08,880
I didn't want to do it.

266
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:11,465
I have no regrets in this world.

267
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,677
-I'm not doing it.
-What a rude little brat.

268
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,598
What will you become when you're older?
Where are your manners?

269
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:21,601
We're both working for the afterlife.
It's better to be casual.

270
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:25,646
Okay. That's that.

271
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:29,025
-I'd like to make a deal with you.
-A deal…

272
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,612
Why don't you have the Jangmul Group
release my album?

273
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:35,489
Hey, Dong-pal.

274
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:40,870
Don't ever make me sit here again
with this brat. Got it?

275
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,915
Why not? You don't like rock music?

276
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:45,791
I can sing trot songs.

277
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,002
Shush. I'm leaving.

278
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:51,297
Hey, wait! There will be
a huge trot music fad soon!

279
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,761
Stop complaining. Once we're there,

280
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:58,512
just make sure you heal Ms. Chu.

281
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:03,184
I should've known something was fishy
when you offered to release my album.

282
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,937
Stop the car over there. I'm leaving.

283
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:08,356
So he's a singer?

284
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:10,691
A former aspiring singer.

285
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:13,069
He ran out once or twice
to go to an audition

286
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,738
when he was training under me,

287
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:17,406
but he never made it and came back.

288
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,785
Don't say that. He'll think it's true.

289
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:24,705
I made it to the final round
of the last audition I went to,

290
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:28,876
but Ms. Chu came for me saying
Counters shouldn't become well known.

291
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,921
Said Jeong-gu to Ms. Chu
to keep the story straight,

292
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:34,465
but Ha-na read her mind,
so we all found out.

293
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,806
Ha-na looks like
she'd be good at keeping her mouth shut.

294
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,267
Anyway, did you two introduce yourselves?

295
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,061
This is the Korean ace, So Mun.

296
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,188
Hello, I'm So Mun.

297
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,275
Oh, you're Cheol-jung's replacement.

298
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,861
And this guy works in Singapore.

299
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,073
He's a Counter.

300
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:01,826
He can also heal people like Ms. Chu.

301
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:06,163
Wait, so he's an ace,

302
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:07,748
but I'm just a Counter?

303
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:11,085
Drop me off right here. I'm going home.

304
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,004
Just stick around for a bit, Jeong-gu.

305
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,631
I'll promote the heck out of your album.

306
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,633
You'll be a K-pop star.

307
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,594
So just heal Ms. Chu, and…

308
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:23,806
I'm sorry, but I've been low on energy.

309
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:25,182
I bleed when I blow my nose.

310
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:28,978
It'll be faster
if you contact the guy in Hong Kong.

311
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,062
Mr. Oh.

312
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:35,484
I saved your life back there.

313
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:39,739
What?

314
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:41,032
He's right.

315
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:44,201
You almost got beaten
to death by that evil spirit,

316
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,203
but Mun saved your ass.

317
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,372
Then you should pay him back
for saving you.

318
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,499
Or you can go ahead and die here.

319
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,085
Your choice.
Do you want to get beaten to death?

320
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:54,837
Jeong-gu.

321
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:57,882
Mun can be scary when he gets mad.

322
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:05,056
I'm scared.

323
00:25:08,017 --> 00:25:09,352
This place isn't for me.

324
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:11,729
Man, I'm so out of place.

325
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:24,825
The rumors were true.

326
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:27,119
He can control the territory.

327
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,790
So you've heard the rumors about Mun?

328
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:33,667
Okay.

329
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,004
Relax. I'll get started.

330
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:13,916
Goodness, that feels much better.

331
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,168
Darn it. I might die.

332
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:18,295
Goodness, thank you.

333
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:20,381
So, Mr. Oh.

334
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:21,841
Yes? What?

335
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:24,677
Why is your hair still black?

336
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:26,429
What?

337
00:26:28,806 --> 00:26:32,101
Mae-ok, you should dye your hair.
What is that?

338
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:36,272
I can't believe you came this far
to do me this favor.

339
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:39,150
Of course. I should be here
if you aren't well.

340
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,153
Forget that chartered plane.
I would've swum here.

341
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:44,780
Anyway,

342
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,533
will you make me some noodles?

343
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:49,410
Yes, of course, I will.

344
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:50,661
A double serving at that.

345
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,413
No, don't do that. I'll get fat.

346
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:55,207
Make enough for one.

347
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:58,627
Okay.

348
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,840
Man, I got on the plane and flew here…

349
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:05,384
to eat these noodles.

350
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:11,974
It's good.

351
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:14,768
Sorry.

352
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:19,523
I couldn't come back right away
after hearing Cheol-jung's news.

353
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:23,736
I heard you've been busy
going here and there to provide support.

354
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,573
But we have to summon that evil spirit

355
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:29,241
and meet Cheol-jung again.

356
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,580
Anyway, thanks for your help, Jeong-gu.

357
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:36,332
Thanks for making the long trip.

358
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,793
Well, of course, I should be here.

359
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,254
Anyway,

360
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:48,886
I won't say anything to your team
since you asked me not to,

361
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:53,140
but you know as well as I do
what your condition is like.

362
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:55,100
You won't last long.

363
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:58,145
You can't be out in the field.
You need to rest.

364
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:01,148
You might die first
while trying to save someone.

365
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:04,860
Such a nag.

366
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:09,114
I hope you behave
and don't get any odd ideas.

367
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:15,204
So? Will he really help you
release your album?

368
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:16,956
Why would I do that at this age?

369
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,750
I'm leaving on the first flight.

370
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:22,920
I feel much more refreshed thanks to you.

371
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,463
Thank you so much.

372
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,633
Eat well before your flight.

373
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:30,219
Goodness, let me get you more soup.

374
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,287
CCTV IN OPERATION

375
00:28:58,664 --> 00:28:59,832
Hyeok-u.

376
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,601
Three exits. The garage,
the front and the back gates.

377
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,436
We will

378
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,938
make sure we catch him
before it's too late.

379
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,064
I'm ready.

380
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:28,944
Then let's get going.

381
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:30,946
How's Hyeok-u doing, Ms. Chu?

382
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:33,032
He seems quite startled.

383
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:34,909
He'll calm down in time.

384
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:37,161
Are you feeling…

385
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:39,038
I mean, how's your condition?

386
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,582
What do you take me for? Let's head over.

387
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,000
Let's get back before dinner.

388
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:43,959
Okay.

389
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:51,800
-Jeong-gu.
-Jeong-gu.

390
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:52,801
What about your flight?

391
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,887
You can stay and make dinner.

392
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,930
I'll go.

393
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:58,140
What are you talking about?

394
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:00,225
She just got better,

395
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:01,727
so I'll go in Mae-ok's place.

396
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,103
Don't you get it, Mo-tak?

397
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:04,021
Come here.

398
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:07,107
Why should you go?

399
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:08,442
I'll tell them everything.

400
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:09,401
You little…

401
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,904
I didn't feel at peace.

402
00:30:11,987 --> 00:30:13,530
I was worried about you.

403
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,700
And the noodles were great too.

404
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:25,626
So Mr. Oh, are you sure you'll be okay?

405
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,670
We've fought him a few times, so we know.

406
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,088
But this guy is…

407
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:30,214
Man.

408
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:35,552
Mo-tak, will you tell him?

409
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:38,180
Do I have to get disciplined
by a baby who's just started?

410
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,849
That baby is our best guy,

411
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:42,059
so you better listen.

412
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:46,397
I've been on a business trip
in the Philippines with his team before.

413
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,816
Jeong-gu is pretty good.

414
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,859
He just tries to spare himself too much.

415
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:53,195
No, I think his talent level
is the problem.

416
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:55,364
He didn't seem all too useful that day.

417
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:57,324
He didn't seem that good.

418
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:58,283
He took a blow.

419
00:30:58,367 --> 00:30:59,410
A big one.

420
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,995
Hey. Goodness.

421
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:03,539
Are you talking about that incident?

422
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:05,666
When I was still jetlagged from my flight

423
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,001
right after I landed.

424
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:10,421
Of course, you were jetlagged.
There's an hour difference with Singapore.

425
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:12,256
There's no way you'd be fine.

426
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:15,926
Goodness, what a pathetic excuse
to make to your junior.

427
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,970
Mun, you're good, so just let it slide.

428
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:18,971
Okay.

429
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,516
Ga Mo-tak is the problem around here.
It's that punk.

430
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:24,476
"Punk"?

431
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:28,772
You must have missed my punches
while you were away.

432
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:33,152
Stop it.

433
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:35,696
He has never hit me before.
What are you talking about?

434
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:37,740
I gave you special treatment.

435
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:39,575
Anyway, let's make this work.

436
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:41,910
Okay. Let's do this.

437
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,038
I'm a bit nervous, though.

438
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:55,924
You're up.

439
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,303
How are you feeling?

440
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:01,263
I'm fine.

441
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:04,475
So you're Mun's friend, right?

442
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:06,643
You must be hungry.

443
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:08,062
I'll make you some noodles.

444
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:11,231
Thank you.

445
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:16,612
That happens once in a blue moon.

446
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:33,128
Something seems weird.
I can't detect anything.

447
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:35,422
Has he run off already?

448
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:37,883
It is what it is. Let's come back later.

449
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,760
Jeong-gu.

450
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:42,971
The house is a ways away.

451
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:45,432
Our territory may not be there.

452
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:46,767
Let's try going in.

453
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,171
Mo-tak.

454
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:17,840
Is he here?

455
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:18,924
Be quiet.

456
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:22,678
Damn it.

457
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,059
Why won't he move?

458
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,104
Something's weird.

459
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:17,816
I can't detect the evil spirit.

460
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,734
What?

461
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:19,902
Shin Myeong-hwi's dead?

462
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:23,906
He's not dead either.

463
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:26,992
He's still breathing softly.

464
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,835
-The restaurant.
-No way.

465
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:39,338
-There's an evil spirit at the restaurant.
-What?

466
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:41,131
-Ms. Chu. Ms. Chu?

467
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:43,884
-She won't answer.
-She's in danger!

468
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:45,844
It went into Hyeok-u. Hurry.

469
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:46,970
Wait.

470
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:49,556
Even if the evil spirit changed hosts…

471
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:52,851
there has to be a reason why
it left him alive.

472
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:54,478
-What?
-The evil spirit…

473
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,855
might return to him.

474
00:34:57,814 --> 00:34:58,899
-Then…
-Ha-na.

475
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:00,776
We'll wait here.

476
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:04,112
If the evil spirit ends up
returning to Shin Myeong-hwi…

477
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:07,866
I'll finish him.

478
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:16,208
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

479
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,793
Most people say it's good.

480
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:21,755
I hope they're doing okay.

481
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:28,595
Where is everyone?

482
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,266
Oh, they had something to take care of.

483
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,143
Did they head over to kill my dad?

484
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:39,314
Hyeok-u.

485
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:41,441
He deserves to die.

486
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:45,696
A guy like him should die.

487
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:53,954
But there's no use in killing him now.

488
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:56,665
What?

489
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:01,878
Weren't you all looking for me?

490
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:15,600
You.

491
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:32,409
Please spare me, Dad.

492
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:35,662
I told you we should've killed him.

493
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:36,788
Wait.

494
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,460
Let's use him…

495
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:46,298
and kill them one after the other.

496
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:26,630
Fine.

497
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:28,548
Let's do this.

498
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:33,512
Come at me, you evil spirit.

499
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,212
You…

500
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:17,472
Ms. Chu.

501
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,439
You cowardly evil spirit.

502
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:26,982
I'll kill you!

503
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:52,966
Come out. Come out of Hyeok-u's body,
you damned evil spirit!

504
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:27,876
Mo-tak, he escaped again.

505
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,211
How's Ms. Chu?

506
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:30,504
Thankfully, she's fine.

507
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:57,030
It's time!

508
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:58,532
I'm summoning this evil spirit.

509
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,942
That blow completely woke me up.

510
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:34,985
Jeong-gu.

511
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:38,029
He's at the final level.
They're completely united.

512
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:40,699
Spare yourself as you always do
and get behind me.

513
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,118
Come on, don't make me lose my spirit.

514
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,411
I never back out.

515
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:45,453
You stay behind me.

516
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:46,454
Come on.

517
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,126
Damn it.

518
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:05,974
Did you say you wanted to end
our seven awful years?

519
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:07,183
Then is this the end?

520
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,268
I'm the one…

521
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:10,812
who's going to
put an end to this, asshole.

522
00:41:26,703 --> 00:41:28,455
Mo-tak! Our territory is disappearing.

523
00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:31,708
We have to run. It's way too dangerous!

524
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:33,418
Hurry!

525
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,258
Mo-tak!

526
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,803
Mo-tak, are you okay?

527
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:49,351
Hey, what is it? What's wrong?

528
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:52,437
Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu!

529
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,647
Jeong-gu!

530
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,483
Jeong-gu!

531
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:58,109
Jeong-gu, it's okay.

532
00:41:58,193 --> 00:41:59,402
Jeong-gu.

533
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:00,528
Come on, man...

534
00:42:01,196 --> 00:42:02,113
Jeong-gu.

535
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:09,871
I'm…

536
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:13,541
I'm disappearing. Aren't I, Wi-gen?

537
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:25,428
Jeong-gu.

538
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:29,432
Stay with me.
Stay with me just a bit longer.

539
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,601
Mo-tak.

540
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,188
I feel so bad for Dong-pal.

541
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:42,696
Jang-mul once said Dong-pal would
die early because of me.

542
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:46,199
Hey, man. Stop talking.

543
00:42:47,242 --> 00:42:49,035
You have to make your album too, kid.

544
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,831
Yes, I'll release an album.

545
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:58,837
I'm on top of the world

546
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,423
With people who love me

547
00:43:02,006 --> 00:43:04,217
Stay still. Stop singing and stay still.

548
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,677
Stop singing.

549
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:10,432
Jeong-gu.

550
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,642
Hey, Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu!

551
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:15,687
Hey, man. Keep singing.
Just sing, you punk.

552
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,688
Jeong-gu.

553
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:19,107
Wi-gen.

554
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:24,738
What happens after Yung?

555
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,007
Jeong-gu.

556
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:49,596
Mun, summon our territory.

557
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:50,638
We need it now.

558
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:54,934
Although we can't see him,
I'm sure his partner from Yung is here.

559
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:57,604
We need our territory.
Without it, his partner…

560
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:00,440
Jeong-gu!

561
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:24,547
Mr. Oh.

562
00:44:29,177 --> 00:44:30,136
I'm sorry.

563
00:44:32,972 --> 00:44:35,850
I can't… I can't breathe.

564
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,061
It's my fault.

565
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:41,773
It's… It's my…

566
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:45,568
Wi-gen, how did you survive this?

567
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:53,701
What's going on?

568
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:18,851
What in the world...

569
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:27,819
Don't die.

570
00:45:29,237 --> 00:45:30,280
Not a single one of you.

571
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:34,367
Mun.

572
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:39,080
I don't want…

573
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,083
anyone to die from this moment on.

574
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:44,752
What…

575
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:46,713
What's going on?

576
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:53,428
I'm alive. I'm alive!

577
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,684
I'm alive.

578
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:03,646
It wasn't just me.

579
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:14,699
He's a little door for us.

580
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:19,245
He's a bridge between…

581
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:22,290
the world and Yung.

582
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:29,172
EONNI'S NOODLES

583
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:01,829
I was a detective…

584
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:04,749
then a Counter.

585
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:08,127
I've seen numbers of people die.

586
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,130
But how is this…

587
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:15,426
never easy for me?

588
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:17,679
Not even once.

589
00:47:22,684 --> 00:47:23,601
Mo-tak.

590
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:28,523
I thought Cheol-jung would be
the last one.

591
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:32,193
But then there was Jeong-yeong
and Jeong-gu...

592
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:54,090
Once you finish that…

593
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:55,800
go and get some rest.

594
00:47:57,593 --> 00:47:58,594
Jeong-gu…

595
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:01,597
saved me…

596
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:04,559
then left the world.

597
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:07,729
He ended up doing that.

598
00:48:11,357 --> 00:48:13,025
How will I ever repay him?

599
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,364
Jeong-gu has arrived safely at Yung.

600
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:22,034
He's been wanting to rest,
so he said it's great.

601
00:48:22,118 --> 00:48:24,996
Also, you shouldn't get any weird ideas.

602
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:26,748
That's what he said.

603
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:30,752
Shin Myeong-hwi…

604
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:33,296
and that evil spirit.

605
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:36,048
I'm catching them.

606
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,177
I'll make sure I catch them…

607
00:48:40,845 --> 00:48:43,473
if it's the last thing I do.

608
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,143
No matter what.

609
00:49:32,605 --> 00:49:33,940
POLICE

610
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:48,246
Listen up, Son.

611
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:50,915
I don't care who it is.

612
00:49:51,707 --> 00:49:53,876
If anyone tries to stop me,
I'll kill them all.

613
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,211
So…

614
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:58,005
if it's too tough
to cause no trouble at school…

615
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:02,510
let me know now.

616
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:14,939
I'll take it to your room.

617
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:16,065
Sure.

618
00:50:33,249 --> 00:50:36,419
I'm sorry. Please let me out.

619
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:38,337
I'm sorry, Dad.

620
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:52,393
You must have a lot of memories…

621
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:54,687
you wanted to forget.

622
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:19,545
What...

623
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,175
You're up.

624
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:28,137
What is this?

625
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:30,389
Why was I asleep in this shithole?

626
00:51:32,516 --> 00:51:34,310
Come on out. Let's eat.

627
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,896
Have you gone insane?
Why would I eat with you?

628
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:38,981
Is your friend up too?

629
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:42,276
Mun, I'm done making breakfast.

630
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:44,987
Come on out.

631
00:52:01,587 --> 00:52:02,755
Hey, grab a seat.

632
00:52:12,139 --> 00:52:13,224
All right.

633
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:17,728
It's his first time here, right?

634
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:19,230
It is.

635
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:21,649
Hello.

636
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:24,276
Gosh, you're handsome.

637
00:52:26,946 --> 00:52:28,823
Let's eat, then.

638
00:52:28,906 --> 00:52:29,949
Let's eat.

639
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,617
Eat up.

640
00:52:36,956 --> 00:52:38,040
Eat up.

641
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:45,631
Grandpa, this looks great.

642
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:47,049
-Grandma, eat up.
-What? Okay.

643
00:52:49,593 --> 00:52:51,220
-You too, Grandpa.
-What?

644
00:52:51,804 --> 00:52:53,681
You eat the big piece.

645
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,653
You can stay longer.

646
00:53:12,324 --> 00:53:14,535
What the heck are you doing?

647
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:16,746
You came to see me.

648
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:19,915
Do you seriously think I brought you here?

649
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,213
I don't know what happened…

650
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,966
but leave me alone.

651
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:31,385
Got a place to go?

652
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:35,556
Hey, don't you know who I am?

653
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:39,602
My house can't be compared to this place.

654
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:41,312
Worry about yourself.

655
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:46,067
You don't want to go back
to that awesome house.

656
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:53,115
You don't want to see your father.

657
00:53:54,784 --> 00:53:56,368
What do you know?

658
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:58,412
That's why you came here yesterday.

659
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:03,167
You needed to stay somewhere
away from your father.

660
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:12,718
Thanks for coming.

661
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,388
Only because you asked me for help.

662
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,310
You know his family runs
a vacation villa, right?

663
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:28,442
If you need a place to stay,
you can stay there for a while.

664
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:21,495
Today is the last day.

665
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:23,831
Don't strain yourself…

666
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,041
and stay calm.

667
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:29,920
I will make sure
I summon that evil spirit.

668
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:41,390
Ms. Chu, will you be all right?

669
00:55:52,443 --> 00:55:53,611
Don't say that.

670
00:55:54,278 --> 00:55:57,656
Do you expect me to back out
after Jeong-gu died like that?

671
00:55:59,074 --> 00:56:00,159
I can't do that.

672
00:56:01,827 --> 00:56:03,454
We all promised Mun…

673
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,332
that we'd help him see his parents.

674
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:19,678
You're right.

675
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:21,805
We have to make him smile.

676
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:26,143
And I owe one to Detective So Gwon.

677
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:49,166
STRIKE AGAINST DEMOLITION

678
00:57:02,304 --> 00:57:03,556
That looks perfect.

679
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:07,476
Sorry?

680
00:57:09,186 --> 00:57:10,938
It's time to put an end to this…

681
00:57:12,815 --> 00:57:14,900
-for both you and me.
-For both you and me.

682
00:57:15,985 --> 00:57:18,529
Do you realize who I am now?

683
00:57:20,364 --> 00:57:22,616
Who are you? What are you doing?

684
00:57:26,745 --> 00:57:27,955
Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:57:28,038 --> 00:57:30,165
I must have fallen asleep. Sorry.

686
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:44,054
Something like that happened?

687
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,018
This is where
Shin Myeong-hwi wanted to meet.

688
00:57:49,101 --> 00:57:51,812
It's near my grandparents' church,
so I know the area.

689
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:54,648
The former residents recently moved out
for the redevelopment.

690
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:55,983
If we stay in the grounds,

691
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:57,943
no one else will get hurt.

692
00:57:58,027 --> 00:57:59,361
And look.

693
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,582
Let's make sure we win today.

694
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:15,044
Let's meet your parents today, Mun.

695
00:58:16,712 --> 00:58:20,591
Anyway, Mun's a big boy now.

696
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:25,888
In the past, he would've thrown a fit

697
00:58:25,971 --> 00:58:28,766
then left to fight him alone
without telling us.

698
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:31,602
Not just that.
He would've been gone by now.

699
00:58:33,354 --> 00:58:36,106
I've grown a bit, haven't I?

700
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:41,236
Okay, then. Shall we get going?

701
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,030
Let's go.

702
00:58:44,073 --> 00:58:47,242
Old man, you can stay here.

703
00:58:47,326 --> 00:58:48,952
What are you talking about?

704
00:58:49,453 --> 00:58:52,081
I need to be there to protect Ms. Chu.

705
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:53,415
We need…

706
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,418
someone who can…

707
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:59,880
welcome the new Counters.

708
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:04,218
What is this guy talking about?

709
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:06,387
Wait here.

710
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:08,097
Once I get back…

711
00:59:08,972 --> 00:59:11,141
we can go for a drive or whatever.

712
00:59:13,102 --> 00:59:14,937
Gosh, Ms. Chu.

713
00:59:15,896 --> 00:59:18,732
Why don't we take a picture?

714
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:20,693
A picture sounds good.

715
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:44,133
STRIKE AGAINST DEMOLITION

716
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:45,926
STOP THE DEMOLITION RIGHT AWAY!

717
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:01,400
REVEAL THE TRUTH
AND PUNISH ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE

718
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:03,652
I won't let anyone get hurt.

719
01:00:04,403 --> 01:00:06,196
I won't let anyone die.

720
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:09,533
I will make sure I protect everyone.

721
01:00:11,118 --> 01:00:12,661
As long as evil spirits prevail…

722
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:17,833
more people will continue
to lose the ones they love.

723
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:20,169
More people will experience sorrow.

724
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:31,180
I will make sure I win today.

725
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,896
So I'll see you today.

726
01:00:41,273 --> 01:00:42,357
Mom.

727
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:44,610
Dad.

728
01:01:34,827 --> 01:01:38,455
In the very end, we may not be with you.

729
01:01:38,956 --> 01:01:41,875
You thought you could handle me
when you were this weak?

730
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:43,794
Get up and fight, no matter what.

731
01:01:43,877 --> 01:01:45,712
Is this some kind of system error?

732
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:47,422
-Let's try one more time.
-How...

733
01:01:47,506 --> 01:01:48,715
Then this must be…

734
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:49,758
How long has it been?

735
01:01:50,592 --> 01:01:54,471
Will Mun's parents recognize Mun?
He's 18 now, you know.

736
01:01:55,097 --> 01:01:56,014
Thank you.

737
01:01:57,224 --> 01:01:58,267
No problem.
