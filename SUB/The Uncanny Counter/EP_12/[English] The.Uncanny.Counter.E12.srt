1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:06,922
THE UNCANNY COUNTER

2
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,596
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

3
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,847
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,076
Stay with me.

5
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:24,371
Jeong-yeong, stay with me.

6
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:26,832
Help!

7
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,085
We need help over here!

8
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:31,920
Jeong-yeong.

9
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,756
Are you Detective Kim Jeong-yeong?

10
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:37,092
I thought you'd be a guy.

11
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,846
You remember Su-ryong?

12
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,015
I remember things that are very old…

13
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,183
But why?

14
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:46,810
Do you…

15
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:48,854
remember everything?

16
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,397
Yes.

17
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:53,942
Jeong-yeong.

18
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:55,902
We have

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,155
a lot

20
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:00,157
<i>to catch up on.</i>

21
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:01,658
We do.

22
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:05,412
Jeong-yeong, please…

23
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,330
Jeong-yeong.

24
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:12,335
-Did she get shot?
-She's still alive. She's alive.

25
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,088
Jeong-yeong! Can you hear me?

26
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,590
Can you hear me?

27
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:17,799
OPERATING ROOM

28
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,760
Can you hear me?

29
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,804
I'll be waiting here.

30
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,223
I'll be waiting right here.

31
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,142
I'll be waiting…

32
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,811
DO NOT ENTER

33
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:55,962
What's up? I have an appointment.

34
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,339
Where are you going?

35
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,382
Why can't you tell me what's going on?

36
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,385
Something dangerous, right?

37
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,014
I need to get a haircut
before I meet your parents tomorrow.

38
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,557
That's not important now.

39
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:09,768
It is. Nothing's more important than that.

40
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,019
Mo-tak.

41
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:14,731
Whoever dares to mess with me

42
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:15,816
will learn a lesson.

43
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:20,028
So don't worry.

44
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:23,448
It'll rain later. Get your umbrella.

45
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:25,033
Hey.

46
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,749
Then did you… Hey, wait!

47
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:18,170
Have you…

48
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:20,547
been waiting for me

49
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:22,966
for the past seven years?

50
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:27,554
No. Not anymore.

51
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:32,392
I finally…

52
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:36,271
remember everything,

53
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:40,984
so don't do this to me.

54
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:43,528
Charge to 150 joules.

55
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:45,155
-Got it, 150 joules.
-Clear.

56
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:47,282
Shock!

57
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:50,869
Jeong-yeong.

58
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:52,621
Jeong-yeong!

59
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,714
DO NOT ENTER

60
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:06,968
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

61
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:17,520
DO NOT ENTER

62
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,530
DO NOT ENTER

63
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,086
Jeong-yeong!

64
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,672
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

65
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,715
Jeong-yeong…

66
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,521
EPISODE 12

67
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:05,860
-Hello.
-Oh, you're here.

68
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:12,075
I'm coming from her funeral.

69
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,327
Is the burial tomorrow?

70
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes, I'm sure you guys

71
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:19,791
all want to go to the funeral

72
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,292
but say your goodbyes later.

73
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,299
There's no "later."

74
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,972
Today's the last day I can do it.

75
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:35,098
You'll go there?

76
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,226
Mo-tak, please calm down
and think rationally.

77
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,603
You're aware
they all think you guys are dead.

78
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:42,272
You shouldn't be seen now.

79
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,608
But I need to say a proper goodbye.

80
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,486
We never really had a chance to talk.

81
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:51,656
Mo-tak.

82
00:06:58,413 --> 00:06:59,456
I'll go with him.

83
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,488
I'm so sorry for your loss.

84
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,043
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

85
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:15,490
I'm sure they found his traces
at the scene of Kwon Jin-seung's death.

86
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,534
Why can't you connect it to Jeon's case?

87
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:19,744
They're connected in a way.

88
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,165
The chief has been doing his best
to cover up those cases.

89
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:30,213
She committed suicide.

90
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:32,674
-Suicide?
-Hey, shush.

91
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,678
Jeong-yeong submitted the permit herself
at 10 a.m.

92
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,638
and picked up a gun with live rounds.

93
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:42,475
We've confirmed that the serial number
matches the one she got.

94
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:49,732
What happened?

95
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,609
Any idea why she took her own life?

96
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,237
She wasn't cut out
for working with others.

97
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:57,490
And she seemed emotionally unstable.

98
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,743
Mo-tak, don't.

99
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:01,703
Mun.

100
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,582
Let go.

101
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,001
Those bastards are saying
she took her own life.

102
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,177
JUNGJIN FUNERAL HOME

103
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,053
JUNGJIN FUNERAL HOME

104
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,851
JUNGJIN FUNERAL HOME

105
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,878
No!

106
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:54,255
No…

107
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,216
Gosh…

108
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,224
How did you

109
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,811
cope with it?

110
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:52,355
You lost

111
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,483
your parents at the age of 11.

112
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,236
It couldn't have been easy.

113
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,115
With your injury…

114
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,702
And you also suffered from aphasia.

115
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:22,135
Mo-tak.

116
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:26,723
Between you and my dad,

117
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,599
who was older?

118
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:34,564
Your dad was

119
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:37,567
a year younger than me.

120
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,406
But he never used honorifics toward me.

121
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:49,245
When we meet my dad in heaven,

122
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,874
you should teach him a big lesson.

123
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:08,681
It's okay.

124
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,518
One's enough. No more.

125
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:15,646
Mo-tak.

126
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:20,234
You see, when you're a Counter,

127
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:22,320
the gap

128
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,072
between life and death

129
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,410
doesn't seem so huge,
and that's comforting.

130
00:12:30,787 --> 00:12:32,246
That's how I feel, at least.

131
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,583
Although I'm not sure
if this is any consolation to you.

132
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:41,589
You little rascal.

133
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,426
Thanks.

134
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:48,638
Sure.

135
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:52,850
-Mun.
-Yes?

136
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,938
About Jeong-yeong…

137
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,483
The police shot her.

138
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,567
What?

139
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:06,197
I know

140
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:08,282
because I saw

141
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,744
Jeong-yeong's

142
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:14,622
last memory.

143
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,958
Jeong-yeong! Can you hear me?

144
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:24,006
That watch.

145
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,384
A watch? What about it?

146
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:28,428
It was the watch

147
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:30,972
that is only given to officers

148
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,892
who have been with the force for 20 years.

149
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:41,149
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

150
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:45,194
Hey, we're closing this case.

151
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,157
And Han-ul is joining our team,
so create a new position for him.

152
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,744
Han-ul. Hey, buddy.

153
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:55,621
Bring all the cases
that Jeong-yeong was working on.

154
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,875
Everything including those
on Noh Hang-gyu and Noh Chang-gyu.

155
00:13:58,958 --> 00:13:59,792
Yes, sir.

156
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,094
KIM JEONG-YEONG

157
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:13,389
But let's pretend
you never saw these pictures.

158
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,849
What's your plan?

159
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,644
You just gave me the fake names
registered with the burner phones.

160
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:20,188
That's all you did. Got it?

161
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,690
Answer me.

162
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,066
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,752
Team 3, this is Kang Han-ul.

164
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:44,629
<i>Hello, this is Ga Mo-tak.</i>

165
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:58,726
<i>I had the phone company</i>
<i>look up the number.</i>

166
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:02,230
<i>They said they have</i>
<i>no record of that number.</i>

167
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:05,775
Jeong-yeong's case…

168
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:08,694
Aren't they treating it as suicide?

169
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:11,280
Yes.

170
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,199
Any CCTV footage?

171
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,410
All the cameras in the vicinity

172
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:19,539
were either broken or just off her route.

173
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:21,749
And no dashcam footage, obviously.

174
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:24,919
Well…

175
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:27,755
I know she didn't take her own life.

176
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,842
She supposedly picked up the gun
at 10 a.m. on the 8th,

177
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:32,969
but she was with me then.

178
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,346
I don't know who did it,

179
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,182
but someone at the precinct
picked it up under her name

180
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,768
and gave it to Ji Cheong-sin.

181
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:42,854
Ji Cheong-sin?

182
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,235
She said Ji Cheong-sin is still alive.

183
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,696
She confirmed the burnt corpse wasn't his.

184
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:58,119
Even so,

185
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,706
I don't think Ji Cheong-sin was the one
who shot her.

186
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:03,207
What?

187
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:11,173
How many officers

188
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:17,430
at Jungjin Police Station have been
with the force for over 20 years?

189
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,140
I'm not sure.

190
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,351
I only joined them under probation
two months ago.

191
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,436
Can you…

192
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:26,647
find out?

193
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,858
Do you think it was someone in the force?

194
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,404
I'm scared.

195
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:41,954
I'll find out.

196
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,624
Be careful.

197
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:46,918
And don't trust anyone.

198
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,970
Did they kill Jeong-yeong because of this?

199
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:04,143
How far along was she
in the investigation?

200
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:07,313
She froze Noh Hang-gyu's
borrowed-name account.

201
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:08,439
So this is about money?

202
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:11,984
That's when the chief started
openly putting pressure on the case.

203
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,782
Can I see the documents regarding this?

204
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,206
They were funding the campaign illegally.

205
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,959
Clearly, the money went
to Shin Myeong-hwi.

206
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,086
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

207
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:32,380
-Five billion won?
-My goodness.

208
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:36,717
So they killed her just because
she found out about the illicit funds?

209
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,303
Just like they killed Mun's father
seven years ago?

210
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,347
But this time, it's different.

211
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,267
My dad's case was seven years ago,
whereas this has only just begun.

212
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,103
We can use this to take them down.

213
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:50,147
Not if we use the same method.

214
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:56,028
The memories won't be considered evidence,
and they'll destroy all solid evidence.

215
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:59,448
They made people believe that
the burnt corpse is Ji Cheong-sin's,

216
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:02,535
and no one even remembers
that mountain of garbage anymore.

217
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:07,206
They keep killing officers on the case.

218
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,417
Then what should we do
with these bastards?

219
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:15,756
Let's do things their way.

220
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:17,925
"Their way"?

221
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,306
They think
Ji Cheong-sin burned us to death.

222
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,392
We'll move quietly
as if we're actually dead.

223
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:27,935
These five billion won…

224
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:29,979
Let's steal it.

225
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:32,064
-That money?
-We'll steal it?

226
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,733
Are you kidding me?

227
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,401
Actually, she has a point.

228
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:38,404
Even if it gets stolen,
they can't report it to the police.

229
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,614
They can't prove it's their money.

230
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,200
So we'll rob them of their campaign funds?

231
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:44,368
Okay.

232
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,328
We'll hang them out to dry.

233
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:48,664
Who will they reach out to
when the money runs dry?

234
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:50,458
Another financial backer.

235
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,418
They'll call me their savior.

236
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,380
What will we do with that money though?

237
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:59,508
Since it came from the people's pockets,

238
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:02,053
-we'll return it to them.
-Bingo.

239
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:05,097
Then let's do it. We have to do this.

240
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:06,098
Before that…

241
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,854
We must break them up first.

242
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:16,734
Mayor Shin, Cho Tae-sin, Choi Su-ryong.
We have to break them up.

243
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,111
Only then will we have a chance.

244
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,073
-Right.
-When the money disappears into thin air,

245
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:24,158
they'll be suspicious of one other.

246
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,326
Okay.

247
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:28,370
I'll try to pull some strings.

248
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,331
Guys, hold on.

249
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:34,710
Our job is to capture evil spirits,
not go after corruption.

250
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,629
Those in Yung won't be okay with this.

251
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:39,131
Will you let a murderer become president?

252
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,550
Gosh, no. We can't let that happen.

253
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,845
They love money,
so we'll use money to take them down.

254
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:46,931
I'm going to Yung.

255
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:48,057
I'll go with you.

256
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,286
How did it go?

257
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,956
We had a long meeting about it.

258
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,209
They joined hands with an evil spirit.

259
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,211
They hired an evil spirit as their hitman.

260
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:18,379
Yes, I know.

261
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,047
So…

262
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:23,384
we've decided to cooperate
with your decision.

263
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:25,761
Mo-tak.

264
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:31,016
But this really isn't just about
getting your revenge, is it?

265
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,605
Thanks for your help.

266
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:43,070
Oh, he's back.

267
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:47,199
Mo-tak, how did it go?
Do we have their permission?

268
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:51,162
In regard to taking down those assholes,
they won't intervene at all.

269
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,538
Yes!

270
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:54,165
-Nice.
-Let's do this!

271
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:56,750
We'll have to do this
as quietly as possible,

272
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,752
so let's close the restaurant for a while.

273
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,379
Okay, let's do that.

274
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:05,342
We'll capture Ji Cheong-sin
and help Mun's parents ascend.

275
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,803
We can reopen after that.

276
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:22,151
EONNI'S NOODLES

277
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:47,551
EONNI'S NOODLES

278
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:49,553
ONLY OPEN WHILE SUPPLIES LAST

279
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:55,309
FOR LEASE INQUIRE

280
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,234
Oh, five cell phones?

281
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,862
Got it. No problem, Boss.

282
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,656
They're getting five burner phones.

283
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:05,866
Five?

284
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,951
Hang-gyu and Chang-gyu
must be getting out.

285
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,412
Just a second.

286
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,999
I did it. All done.

287
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,460
-Hey, woman.
-Mimi!

288
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,336
-What the…
-Mimi!

289
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,922
-Where did this dog go? Mimi!
-What's with this woman?

290
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,883
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Mimi!

291
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,342
My gosh.

292
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,640
Confirmed.

293
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,854
CELLULAR HUB

294
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,377
Shin Myeong-hwi.

295
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,432
I'm here.

296
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,226
Oh, boy.

297
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,773
Jeez, that girl.
I'm going to totally whack her.

298
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,942
Haven't you heard the news?
She killed herself.

299
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,653
-Who?
-Right, Boss?

300
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,907
Bam!

301
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,325
For real?

302
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,120
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

303
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,255
What's this?

304
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,343
SHIN MYEONG-HWI, CHO TAE-SIN,
NOH HANG-GYU, NOH CHANG-GYU

305
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,687
Hey. Let's go to the sauna first.

306
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,230
Get your act together.

307
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,691
We have to cover up the exposed account.

308
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,943
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

309
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:12,200
SHIN MYEONG-HWI, CHO TAE-SIN,
NOH HANG-GYU, NOH CHANG-GYU, CHOI SU-RYONG

310
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,415
It must've been stressful for you.

311
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,584
I'm sorry for causing you concern, sir.

312
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,043
<i>It was stressful indeed.</i>

313
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,171
What happened to Ga Mo-tak?

314
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,173
He's dead. I set him on fire.

315
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,425
<i>Fire?</i>

316
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,176
Are you sure he's dead?

317
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,055
That punk, Ji Cheong-sin,
knows how to put on a show.

318
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,932
All right.

319
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,917
-Give us a moment.
-Yes, sir.

320
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,180
What are you doing in my office?

321
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,019
Meeting the party leader today?

322
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,563
Are you busy these days?

323
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,482
Of course, the election's coming up.

324
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,943
Hang-gyu's been released.

325
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,196
The election will be much easier now.

326
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,616
My secretary is putting
the camp together for me,

327
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,744
so you and Mr. Noh
don't need to worry about it.

328
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,625
What? So you want us out?

329
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,043
It's grown in scale.

330
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,421
Then we'll make the necessary arrangements
to befit the scale.

331
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,677
I'm heading out now.

332
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,554
Tidy up the table and help me pick a tie.

333
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,514
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

334
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:03,061
Give us a moment, please.

335
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,646
I haven't finished my coffee.

336
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,252
We'll call you at this number from now on.

337
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,754
I've already put together a team
to assist you.

338
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,550
We can take you anywhere in the country,
so just relax and enjoy the ride.

339
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,564
This cookie is very good.

340
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:57,949
Hey, lady!

341
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,161
They wouldn't die that easily.

342
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:04,164
They died in a fire. You call that easy?

343
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,416
Jeez.

344
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,252
Let's take it easy, okay?

345
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,796
Gosh, I got out of the lockup
less than an hour ago.

346
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,214
Let's go to the sauna.

347
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,677
Hop in.

348
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,684
EONNI'S NOODLES

349
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,812
FOR LEASE INQUIRE

350
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,489
Sir.

351
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,830
-This is Mr. Choi Jang-mul.
-Yes, I know.

352
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,791
-I'm a fan of yours.
-My gosh.

353
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,879
I've seen you at events,
but this is our first meal together.

354
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,298
Right.

355
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,180
It was years ago,

356
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,142
but I went to jail once

357
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,603
for breach of duty and embezzlement.

358
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,688
-You?
-Yes!

359
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,817
I had a heart attack
while I was behind bars.

360
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,485
I nearly died.

361
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,903
My gosh.

362
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,366
Having gone through that,
I decided to change my ways.

363
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,245
This is a rather embarrassing thing
to say as a businessman,

364
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:29,624
but I wanted to sell my products
to help those in need.

365
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,543
"Spread the wealth."

366
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,087
Since I've been running my business
with that motto,

367
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,173
people remember nothing about me
going to jail.

368
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,301
It's definitely helped me clean up
my disgraceful past.

369
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,096
My goodness, don't be so modest.

370
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:47,725
You've been giving back to the community
for 20 years. That's who you are.

371
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,185
Gosh, I'm flattered.

372
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,312
I'll pour you one.

373
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,648
-Oh, thank you.
-My pleasure.

374
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,326
TAESIN GROUP

375
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,754
I have a bad feeling about this, Hang-gyu.

376
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,714
What's wrong?

377
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,176
The construction for the reservoir
is coming along nicely.

378
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,471
I'm talking about Shin Myeong-hwi.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

379
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,808
Now that he's announced
he's running for president,

380
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,811
all the hotshots are running to him
offering help.

381
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:35,190
Is this just a little hiccup
in our relationship

382
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,108
or a sign that a breakup is imminent?

383
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,196
I whacked all those who could've
caused trouble for him. This prick…

384
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,366
I think he'll ditch us and fly away.

385
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,244
Mayor Shin can't mess with us.

386
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,662
You know that.

387
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,583
No, that's not true.

388
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,462
But…

389
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,090
I think we need insurance.

390
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,718
"Insurance"?

391
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,014
Oh, my.

392
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,354
My gosh, how time flies.

393
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,897
Do you have to go?

394
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,693
Yes, we shouldn't stay out late
given the current situation.

395
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,448
And we've touched upon
all the important things anyway.

396
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:27,408
I'll get going, then.

397
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,790
Then get home safely,
my campaign club leader.

398
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:38,044
My gosh, the campaign club leader for
presidential candidate Shin Myeong-hwi.

399
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,630
Just hearing that title
puts a smile on my face.

400
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,216
After you.

401
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,596
Mayor Shin. Five billion won, okay?

402
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,015
If you can get five billion ready,

403
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,892
then I'll contribute the same amount.

404
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,852
If you say you only have ten million,

405
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,063
then I guess that will be it.

406
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,275
-Yes, well understood.
-All right, then.

407
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,072
Get home safely.

408
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,045
CHO TAE-SIN

409
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,217
Hey.

410
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,012
Get some bullets ready, Mr. Cho.

411
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:31,931
<i>Five billion won. In cash.</i>

412
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,851
<i>Five billion? The entire amount in cash?</i>

413
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,102
He took the bait.

414
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,770
<i>What do you need it for?</i>

415
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,442
I just need to show it to someone.

416
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,990
The game has begun.

417
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,784
Sleep well tonight.

418
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,464
SUITCASES BLOWOUT SALE

419
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,782
Hello.

420
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,081
Why are they not making a move?

421
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,837
-That's Noh Chang-gyu.
-Down!

422
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,964
They think we're dead. We can't be seen.

423
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,018
Which car should we tail?

424
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,521
-The one with the suitcases.
-Yes, obviously.

425
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,438
Let's go.

426
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,774
People called me a smart cookie
when I was little.

427
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,534
JUNGJIN FINANCE

428
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,451
Come on, hurry.

429
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,328
Come on.

430
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,043
<i>Jae-cheol, what are you doing?</i>

431
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,754
<i>I'm throwing money into a suitcase</i>

432
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,926
Those guys need a break.

433
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,470
They're clearing out all the banks.

434
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,810
-Hey, move it.
-Jeez.

435
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:45,565
Looks like they'll keep taking cash out
until the banks close.

436
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,358
We should thank them for doing this.

437
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:56,409
But one of the cars
is at the reservoir now.

438
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,327
-What?
-The reservoir?

439
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,123
Oh, I think this is the one
that Noh Chang-gyu was in earlier.

440
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,251
Wait, Noh Chang-gyu
is at the reservoir now?

441
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,919
Hey, they're leaving.

442
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,130
My gosh.

443
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,716
They're gone.

444
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,027
Hey, you! How many hours
is this going to take?

445
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:34,030
I told you to just dig around
the transformer!

446
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,615
Damn it.

447
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,161
TRANSFORMER IN FRONT OF THE MOUNTAIN

448
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,412
This is it.

449
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,835
This is probably the last stop.

450
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,174
NOH HANG-GYU

451
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,643
<i>Hey, I found it.</i>

452
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,561
I rummaged through all the garbage here.

453
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,274
The yellow suitcase, right?

454
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,567
A suitcase?

455
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,529
-What?
-That's what he found at the reservoir.

456
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,780
A suitcase?

457
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,865
Not one of those?
There's another suitcase?

458
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,492
Oh, I see.

459
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,118
Mo-tak, it's 4 p.m. now.

460
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,829
Okay, let the operation begin.

461
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,391
Guys, quick.

462
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,568
-Hey, move.
-What?

463
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,030
Damn it. We've got a flat tire.

464
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,909
Hey, we've got a flat tire.

465
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,661
What's the insurance company for?

466
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,830
-Call them now!
-Okay, I'll call.

467
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,373
Hurry! We don't have time.

468
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,084
Jungang Insurance?

469
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,211
We've got a flat tire.

470
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,386
Hello, we just put in an emergency
service request due to a flat tire.

471
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,723
Oh, my husband did.
But you don't need to come.

472
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,808
It looks like it just lost a little air.

473
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:27,393
We can get it fixed on our own.

474
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,478
Sorry for the trouble. Yes, thank you.

475
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,896
And I love you back.

476
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,942
Mo-tak, come in.

477
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,876
I'm here from Jungang Insurance.

478
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,423
-What?
-What are you doing?

479
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,216
I'm taking out the spare tire.

480
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,761
-Don't touch anything. You do it.
-This is very heavy.

481
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,597
-Hey, man. I got this.
-My gosh. Thank you.

482
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,194
The car is too heavy right now.
Can you please step out?

483
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,445
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

484
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,238
This is ridiculous.

485
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,782
-What's he doing?
-Damn it.

486
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,951
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

487
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,329
-Gosh.
-What the hell?

488
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,790
-No!
-Gosh, hey!

489
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,874
-Hey, man.
-Goodness.

490
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:33,626
Oh, dear.

491
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,712
Jeez, what a joke.

492
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,798
That idiot. Does he even know
how to do it?

493
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,509
-This is ridiculous.
-Hey, close the trunk.

494
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,593
We don't have time.

495
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,471
Hey.

496
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,015
-Hey, look.
-Hey.

497
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,225
-Hey, man.
-Get up.

498
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,394
-Jeez!
-God, you scared the crap out of me.

499
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,229
-I'm so sorry.
-What the hell!

500
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,064
-This is nuts.
-I've got a leg cramp!

501
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,357
-No!
-Stay still.

502
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,403
Which side? Let me see.

503
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,404
Let me see.

504
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,280
We just need to knock that guy out.

505
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,741
-Hey, I told you.
-Hey.

506
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,326
Come on. Let me see!

507
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,663
Excuse me.

508
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,123
You're pretty.

509
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,417
Hey, gorgeous. What's up?

510
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,001
Peekaboo.

511
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:29,098
Oh, boy.

512
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,683
-My leg…
-Which one?

513
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,143
-I got it.
-Take his shoes off.

514
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,894
-If you take my shoes off…
-Goodness.

515
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,187
-This is gross.
-Gosh.

516
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,483
-The left one! Yes!
-Is it the left leg?

517
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,569
-Goodness gracious.
-This is gross.

518
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,370
-Sir.
-I'm tearing up.

519
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,330
-My gosh.
-Are you all right?

520
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,582
I think I'm better now.

521
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,791
Help me put my shoes on.

522
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,126
-Jeez.
-Here, help him.

523
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,961
-Man, you're so demanding.
-I'm sorry.

524
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,052
Hurry up, will you?

525
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,305
Yes, I'll get it done quickly.

526
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,266
-What now?
-Hey!

527
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,726
What's he doing?

528
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,186
-Hey!
-I'm slightly anemic.

529
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,937
-Jeez, this thing here...
-Hurry.

530
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,439
Hurry!

531
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,149
Gosh.

532
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,901
-Did you not have lunch?
-Hey, move!

533
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,110
Hey, hurry.

534
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,403
-Move!
-Wait.

535
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,488
Hey.

536
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,114
No, wait!

537
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,658
Be quiet.

538
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,578
Wait!

539
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:38,209
Jae-cheol.

540
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,878
I couldn't breathe for some reason.

541
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,297
Jae-cheol!

542
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,466
Hey, is it done?

543
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,634
It's almost done.

544
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,053
-Hurry up!
-Okay. I'll wake you up when it's done.

545
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,262
-Do it quickly.
-Okay.

546
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,725
This is odd. Why am I so tired?

547
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,436
The memory card?

548
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,822
It's all done now. Thank you.

549
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,074
-Jeez.
-Okay, bye. Get lost.

550
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,116
-Hop in.
-Okay.

551
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,451
-Let's get going!
-Hurry up.

552
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,744
We'll get going now.

553
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,175
Well done.

554
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,303
-Let's go to the reservoir.
-What?

555
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,138
Why?

556
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,766
The yellow suitcase Noh Chang-gyu found…

557
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,686
It must have something to do
with Kim Yeong-nim.

558
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,522
Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone
all the way there

559
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,482
and dug it up himself.

560
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:45,901
Let's go.

561
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,486
Let's go.

562
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,785
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NOH HANG-GYU

563
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,747
I think we need insurance.

564
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,541
"Insurance"?

565
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,918
The thing we buried at the reservoir.

566
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,341
Dig it up.

567
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,596
Yes, sir.

568
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:26,984
Damn it.

569
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,904
If that gets exposed, I'll be in trouble.

570
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,743
Hey, what should I do with this?

571
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,328
Take it to the office?

572
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,168
Gosh, can you decide quickly?

573
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,211
That stench is killing me.

574
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,923
I'll text you an address.
Drop it off there.

575
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,634
Hey, what the hell is inside
that suitcase?

576
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,218
Don't even be curious.

577
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,471
Forget what you saw today
after the job is done.

578
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:03,979
NOH CHANG-GYU

579
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,402
"Premium Oak Sauna
in Siyeong-dong, Jungjin"?

580
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,237
-What?
-"Oak Sauna"?

581
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,906
Why is he going there?

582
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,668
RED CLAY PREMIUM OAK SAUNA

583
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,883
This is the place.

584
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,135
RED CLAY PREMIUM OAK SAUNA

585
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,181
RED CLAY PREMIUM OAK SAUNA

586
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,356
What does he need to do here?

587
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,779
Take it out.

588
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,169
He might go the other way.

589
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,382
Ms. Chu and Ha-na,
go the other way and block the exit.

590
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,591
Okay.

591
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,935
Hello.

592
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,355
My, look at that solid flame.

593
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,151
The charcoal smells so good.

594
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,736
-Did you get the heads-up?
-Yes.

595
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,656
Here.

596
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,953
-Hey.
-Yes.

597
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,246
-Throw it in there.
-Okay.

598
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,831
I guess they're going to burn it.

599
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,332
They want to incinerate it.

600
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,960
Gosh! It's too hot.

601
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:50,878
What the hell?

602
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,671
Just throw it in there!

603
00:43:57,342 --> 00:43:58,510
Ga Mo-tak.

604
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,805
Do you want me to throw you guys
in there too?

605
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,349
Shall I throw you guys in there?

606
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,440
No, don't!

607
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,736
We're back, Boss.

608
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,789
We took the money out
and closed all 17 accounts.

609
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,582
Well done.

610
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,173
Should I send these to Mayor Shin's camp?

611
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,175
Send them directly to Mayor Shin.

612
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,262
If he gets a whiff of cash,
he won't get any funny ideas.

613
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,180
Sir.

614
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,933
Would you like to see?

615
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,478
No need.

616
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,897
I have to send it off, so if I see it…

617
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,692
I won't want to let it go.

618
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,209
Hey! Wake up.

619
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:15,754
Where's the suitcase?

620
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,384
It's burning.

621
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,844
I only see the flame.

622
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,638
Why am I so dizzy?

623
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,639
Oh, me too.

624
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,476
Hey.

625
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,687
We did throw it in there, right?

626
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,357
I see that your hair is burnt.

627
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:36,859
What?

628
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,653
-Why is your hair burnt?
-Sorry?

629
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,744
What happened?

630
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,517
What? How could they
shove a person into this…

631
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,019
Don't touch it,

632
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,937
or it'll become inadmissible.

633
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,612
Let's pray for her soul.

634
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,209
What should we do?

635
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,212
I don't know how I feel about
letting the police know.

636
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,672
Mo-tak, you remember everything now.

637
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,466
Any cop you can trust?

638
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,135
If there were
even one colleague like that,

639
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,930
Jeong-yeong would still be alive.

640
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,768
And my former colleagues
must've changed a lot by now.

641
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:59,191
We have five billion won in cash

642
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,985
right beside a young woman's
skeletal remains.

643
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,780
Am I supposed to cry or laugh now?

644
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,242
Shin Myeong-hwi
must have a political rival.

645
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,160
Oh Yeong-deok?

646
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,204
Yes, good idea!

647
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,665
The police station in his constituency.

648
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,167
He won't try to cover it up at least.

649
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,211
In that precinct,

650
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,213
there's a detective I know.

651
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:25,592
Great. Tell him about the case
you were investigating seven years ago.

652
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,058
GYEONGIN POLICE STATION

653
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:36,103
The autopsy will take a while
since we only have the skeleton.

654
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,189
I'll call you when we have the DNA info.

655
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:41,775
By the way,

656
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,152
the suspects you have in mind…

657
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,821
Are you sure it's them?

658
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,738
Yes.

659
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:48,907
I'll show you.

660
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,659
I'm scared to even confirm it.

661
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,452
So…

662
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,663
investigate it quietly.

663
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,999
I'm counting on you.

664
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,808
What is that?

665
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,394
Oh, that.

666
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,689
He looked homeless, so I killed him.

667
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,274
There won't be any problems.

668
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,235
No matter how much I eat,
I'm still hungry.

669
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,361
I'm sorry.

670
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
It stinks.

671
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,115
Get rid of it.

672
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,575
Will do.

673
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,910
We'll leave tomorrow.

674
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,705
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KIM JI-YEON

675
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,207
Where did she go?

676
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,710
Hey, Baek Hyang-hui!

677
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,796
She went out with the voice recorder.

678
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,132
Hey!

679
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,966
Hand over that purse.

680
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,261
-What?
-So I can complete my look.

681
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,851
What does he want from me?

682
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,817
Babe?

683
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,072
Hey! Babe!

684
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,508
Where's my voice recorder?

685
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,262
I'll give it to you. I'll give it back!

686
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,310
I'm hungry.

687
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,771
Hey!

688
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,234
Hey, don't hurt the woman.

689
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,736
Let her go!

690
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,781
I'm hungry.

691
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,212
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

692
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:15,030
Mayor Shin, I'm a man of my word.

693
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:20,285
And you'll go on to achieve
greater things, so let's not dillydally.

694
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,536
We'll do this right away.

695
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,372
You're absolutely right.

696
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,250
Well, then…

697
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,796
Oh, you don't have to show me.

698
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,470
What is this?

699
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,556
Oh, what's with all the bottled water?

700
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,352
Why is this filled with bottled water?

701
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,324
Why is this filled with bottled water?

702
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,325
Water?

703
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,785
What's he saying?

704
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:07,082
Oh, my. You must've been parched.

705
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,794
Hey, what… What happened?

706
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,588
This is…

707
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,340
What's this?

708
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,144
My money.

709
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,232
-My money!
-Get out.

710
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,151
-Mr. Mayor.
-I said, get out!

711
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,361
My gosh.

712
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,158
-I didn't know you had other guests.
-Well…

713
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,327
There must've been some kind of error.

714
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,288
Let's eat together another time.

715
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,790
Just the two of us, with no one else.

716
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,916
Mr. Kim!

717
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,794
We're taking them back.

718
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,713
Hold on.

719
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,383
I'll wait for your call.

720
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,509
Okay.

721
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,433
Sir.

722
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,909
This is beyond embarrassing, you idiots!

723
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,331
Clearly write the names
of those three jerks

724
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,082
and submit them to the NFS.

725
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,879
They're DNA samples from the suspects
in the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

726
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:36,796
Yes, sir.

727
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,552
Do you expect me to believe that?

728
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,054
That's the situation now, sir.

729
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,891
If you can give us more time,
we'll try to get you about two billion.

730
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,059
Two billion?

731
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,186
Are you kidding me?

732
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,772
-Are you kidding me right now?
-No, sir.

733
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,274
You made me look like
a complete moron, and what?

734
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,568
Please give us about a week.

735
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,653
You piece of…

736
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,282
A week?

737
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,326
A week?

738
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,245
A whole week?

739
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,377
At your service, sir!

740
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,631
Damn it.

741
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,341
Shin Myeong-hwi.

742
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,094
Am I your bank or what?

743
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,597
We're talking 5 billion won here, not 500.

744
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,059
I'm the one who lost five billion won.

745
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,895
How dare he flip out on me?

746
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,647
-Bastards.
-No, wait.

747
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,982
You little...

748
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,817
How dare he dump water on my face?

749
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,739
You just wait and see.

750
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,450
I will never

751
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,161
forget this.

752
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,292
You little shit.
You even got rid of the dashcam footage.

753
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,918
Don't you dare play dumb!

754
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,296
Who took the money if you guys didn't?

755
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,173
-You bastards.
-No, please…

756
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,925
Please believe me. It wasn't us.

757
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,095
I really don't remember anything.

758
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,347
Is that so?

759
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,434
I'll help you refresh your memory.

760
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,102
-Down on all fours.
-No, please…

761
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,605
Let's say, 50,000 won each time.

762
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,190
Let's do this just 100,000 times.

763
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,484
-Get back up.
-Please…

764
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,404
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

765
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,198
It's okay. We have a long way to go.
Back on all fours.

766
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,992
-Get back up.
-Boss.

767
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,994
Boss, what's going on?

768
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,662
You little shit.

769
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,914
Please help me. It really wasn't me.

770
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,708
Hey, what?

771
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:41,629
I really don't remember anything.

772
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,131
You too?

773
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:49,179
Hang-gyu, I also don't remember anything
from yesterday.

774
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,432
What happened?

775
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,725
I don't remember anything.

776
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,268
I'm dumbfounded.

777
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,856
Sir.

778
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,692
Those rats. Could they be alive?

779
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,403
Who?

780
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,696
Ga Mo-tak.

781
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,947
What?

782
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,574
What? Ga Mo-tak is dead?

783
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,873
That little…

784
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,002
EONNI'S NOODLES

785
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,092
Stay still, will you?

786
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,637
He said he'd let me know
as soon as the results are out.

787
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,097
He'll call.

788
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,142
I'm worried things might go wrong.

789
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,689
We did our best, Mo-tak.

790
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,649
Yes.

791
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,568
We nearly died several times.

792
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,655
I just feel bad.

793
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,324
Even after death,

794
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,410
they can't rest in peace.

795
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,996
When I think about them…

796
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,464
Answer it.

797
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,845
Hello?

798
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,223
Yes.

799
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,518
Okay.

800
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,813
What did he say?

801
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,067
They did

802
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,319
a DNA analysis on the remains.

803
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,449
And what? Just tell us!

804
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,995
The one on her clothes
matches Noh Hang-gyu's.

805
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:37,912
My gosh.

806
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,833
The one found underneath her nails
matches Mayor Shin's.

807
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,042
-My gosh!
-Yes!

808
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,628
My gosh, we did it.

809
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,923
So Shin Myeong-hwi is now
a murder suspect, right?

810
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,425
Yes.

811
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,218
After seven years.

812
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,440
Mayor Shin.

813
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,906
We have to interview you
in regard to the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

814
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,240
Who?

815
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,744
You're a murder suspect now.

816
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,370
That is absurd.

817
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,499
Go get ready.

818
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,750
We'll wait here.

819
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,138
God damn it!

820
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,644
Ga Mo-tak, you bastard.

821
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,105
What is going on? Kim Yeong-nim…

822
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,942
Murder?

823
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,944
Chang-gyu just checked.

824
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,780
Those rats took Kim Yeong-nim's remains.

825
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,532
"Those rats"? Who?

826
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,202
-Ga Mo-tak.
-What?

827
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,745
But he's dead!

828
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,879
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu.

829
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,427
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

830
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,429
Come with us.

831
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,851
Shin Myeong-hwi!

832
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,310
-He's coming out!
-There he is!

833
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,895
-Mayor Shin!
-Mr. Mayor!

834
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,730
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-A comment, please!

835
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,399
-Is it true?
-Say a few words!

836
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,359
-Mr. Mayor!
-Did you really kill her?

837
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,944
-Is it true?
-We're on your side!

838
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,320
Tell us the truth!

839
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,115
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Is it true? Tell us.

840
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,283
Mr. Mayor!

841
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,159
-Do you admit it?
-Thank you.

842
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,661
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

843
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,954
-Move back.
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

844
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,415
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-A comment, please!

845
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,459
This is nothing
but a ridiculous political trap.

846
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,794
That bastard.

847
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,880
-Trust me.
-He hasn't learned his lesson yet.

848
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,089
Please protect me.

849
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,133
I'll clear up all the suspicions

850
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,927
and return to my post.

851
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,845
Thank you.

852
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,221
-We trust you!
-We trust you!

853
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,139
You can't come in.

854
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,640
-Move back.
-We'll protect you!

855
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,600
-Gosh.
-Mun.

856
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,185
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-We trust you!

857
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,062
-You can't do that.
-Oh, hold on.

858
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,856
Let him go.

859
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:10,940
Shin Myeong-hwi!

860
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:11,983
Shin Myeong-hwi!

861
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,192
Shin Myeong-hwi!

862
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,527
Shin Myeong-hwi!

863
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,154
How are your parents doing?

864
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,239
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

865
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,992
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

866
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,744
You guys all seem to be doing well.

867
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,079
I'm relieved.

868
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,124
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

869
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,543
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

870
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,837
Don't think this will end
with Kim Yeong-nim.

871
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,132
My mom and dad.

872
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,385
I'll make you pay for everything you did.

873
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:09,052

THE UNCANNY COUNTER

875
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,722
How have you been, Father?

876
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,516
Shut up, asshole!

877
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,809
You haven't changed a bit.

878
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,561
Ji Cheong-sin and the evil spirit
have become one.

879
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,314
What's going to happen
to my mom and dad's souls?

880
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,024
You told me not to worry about it.

881
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,651
Then why are you here?

882
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,027
The video footage.

883
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,405
This is the highlight.

884
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,448
How are we supposed to catch him?

885
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,367
By binding him.

886
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,661
I spotted one. Where's So Mun?

887
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,790
I summon Ji Cheong-sin, the evil spirit!

888
