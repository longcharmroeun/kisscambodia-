1
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,850
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS

2
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,253
My lord! I'm stuck!

3
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,935
My lord!

4
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,344
Hurry up!

5
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,429
Shit! Hurry up!

6
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,806
What are you doing?

7
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,017
Open it already!

8
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,269
Hurry!

9
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,064
Hurry up! Shit!

10
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,862
Hurry! Come on!

11
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,171
The key! Where's the key?

12
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,799
There's no door!

13
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,301
The key! Bring me the key!

14
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,388
Open it! Now!

15
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,643
Open it!

16
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,813
Lock it! Now!

17
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,940
Hurry up! Lock it!

18
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,513
No! Don't go there!

19
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,592
Please, help. Help!

20
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,390
No! Stop!

21
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,309
No! Don't come any closer!

22
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,503
Come here. Come.

23
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,766
Here.

24
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,436
Help!

25
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,522
-Open the door!
-Help!

26
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,023
-Someone is out there.
-Help me!

27
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,942
-This way! Here!
-Come this way!

28
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,777
-Run!
-Hurry!

29
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,904
The door is locked!

30
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,323
This way!

31
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,508
Let go of her!

32
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,885
Oh, no!

33
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,056
-She got bitten!
-Let go! Let go of her hand!

34
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,309
What are you doing?
She was already bitten!

35
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,355
Grab the baby. Hurry!

36
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,691
Let go of her!

37
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,528
Let go! She was bitten!

38
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,284
Let go of her!

39
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,911
Please, help me!

40
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,189
These peasants are attacking noblemen!

41
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,530
Shut the gate! Shut it now!

42
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,162
Shit!

43
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,845
These look great.

44
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,723
-It is so heavy.
-Hurry!

45
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,100
What is going on?

46
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,476
Run!

47
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,066
Hey! Park!

48
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,236
We caught fish! Come here!

49
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,988
Is that him?

50
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,198
It is obviously him.

51
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,616
My gosh.

52
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,952
He must have drunk a lot today.

53
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,580
Hey! Are you drunk?

54
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,208
-Who are those people?
-My gosh.

55
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,418
Hey.

56
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,837
What is going on?

57
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,839
-Hey.
-What is wrong with them?

58
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,341
Hey! What is that?

59
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,727
Stop running. You will get hungry.

60
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,313
Stop fighting. Don't bite him!

61
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,981
That will scar!

62
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,899
-Let go!
-You punk.

63
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,651
-I said, that will scar.
-Let go!

64
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,030
Get off me!

65
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,468
Father.

66
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,764
What is wrong?

67
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,916
Deok-i, stay here.
I will go look for your sister.

68
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,919
Do not come out.

69
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,205
Mommy!

70
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,750
What is wrong with you?

71
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,920
You are scaring me!

72
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,256
Stop it, Mommy!

73
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,465
Stop it!

74
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,184
Your Royal Highness!

75
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,239
Your Royal Highness!

76
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,546
Your Royal Highness, run!

77
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,469
Hold on tight!

78
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,632
You must aim for their heads.

79
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,176
Your Royal Highness! The barracks.

80
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,387
You must go to the barracks.

81
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,608
We must hurry, Your Royal Highness.

82
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,735
Your Royal Highness!

83
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,329
Is anyone inside?

84
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,623
Please let us in!

85
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,002
Is anyone inside?

86
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,503
Is anyone there?

87
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,592
-Monsters are chasing us!
-I don't think anyone is here.

88
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,181
Your Highness.

89
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,643
Please climb up.

90
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,689
Excuse us. I'm sorry,
but please step aside!

91
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Step aside!

92
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,282
-We should climb the wall.
-Let us climb the wall!

93
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,839
Get off the fence at once!

94
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,926
Someone is inside!

95
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,803
Get rid of them.

96
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,471
Shoo them away. Now!

97
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,768
-Don't shoot!
-Get rid of them.

98
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,105
Your Royal Highness!

99
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,065
Are you all right?

100
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,067
How dare you?

101
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,236
He is the Crown Prince of this nation!

102
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,153
Open the gate!

103
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,489
Please, let us in.

104
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,116
Don't try to fool me!

105
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,369
Don't give me your nonsense, and scram!
All of you!

106
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:40,541
Anyone who climbs over this wall
shall be dealt with by law!

107
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,460
-Let us climb up! Come on!
-Let us climb up, too!

108
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,921
How dare you?
What do you think you're doing?

109
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,137
Why, those...

110
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,514
Get down! Down!

111
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
-Let the children in!
-Didn't you hear me? Push them off!

112
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,730
-Go down!
-Scram!

113
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,565
-Get away!
-Go down!

114
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,525
-Go down!
-I said, scram!

115
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,235
Get down!

116
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,528
Don't come up here!

117
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,989
Shoot! Shoot the arrows!

118
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,828
How dare you?

119
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,747
If you get any closer,

120
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,625
these arrows will pierce your bodies!

121
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,295
Please help us!
Please don't leave us here to die!

122
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
What the...

123
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,104
Your Royal Highness, you must go.

124
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,274
Run! Everyone, run!

125
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,817
Run!

126
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,127
Your Royal Highness.

127
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,591
That female physician spoke the truth.

128
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,301
How could this happen?

129
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,582
The baby inside you
will be the king of this nation,

130
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,876
so be careful.

131
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,548
You must teach him
what happens to a powerless king.

132
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,930
Until the new Crown Prince is born,

133
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,769
you must make sure His Majesty
has plenty to eat and drink.

134
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,540
Mommy.

135
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,695
Stop! Just stop already!

136
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,407
Shit! I'm exhausted.

137
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,212
My clothes got dirty.

138
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,131
I shall prepare fresh clothes.

139
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,313
Go for a walk.

140
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,439
Come down.

141
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,078
My lord!

142
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,123
My gosh!

143
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,291
Why you...

144
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,333
Oh, my. My lord.

145
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,128
My lord.

146
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,131
Thank goodness you are safe.

147
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,924
Where were you until now?

148
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,135
I was...

149
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,886
I wanted to save you,

150
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,016
so I brought all those soldiers.

151
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,726
Save me? Now?

152
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,436
Do you know what I went through?

153
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,980
I would have died last night
if not for her!

154
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,817
Well...

155
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,072
That jerk! It was all that jerk's fault!

156
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,532
-What?
-What are you doing?

157
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,491
Capture him now!

158
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,534
Yes, my lord.

159
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,417
It was all his fault.

160
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,838
He... knew all about those hideous things,

161
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,049
but he hid it from us.

162
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,842
I told you, didn't I?

163
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,094
That they were not dead.

164
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,764
How dare you glare at me like that?
I shall...

165
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,766
He is correct! Tell us now!

166
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,019
What are those monsters?
Where did they come from?

167
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,479
I...

168
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,648
I will tell you.

169
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,360
They were the ill at Jiyulheon
and their families.

170
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,654
They could not withstand
starvation any longer

171
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,530
and ate a corpse, then...

172
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,157
-What?
-They became monsters

173
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,910
that crave human flesh and blood at night.

174
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,496
During the day, they hide
where the sun doesn't reach

175
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,165
and sleep as if they were dead.

176
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,919
Human corpse... What...

177
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,420
How could they do that?

178
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,047
If that is true,

179
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,342
why did you leave those corpses like that?

180
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,010
You should have buried them

181
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,429
when they were asleep
or gotten rid of them somehow!

182
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,433
My lord, you must punish them
for their crimes.

183
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,268
I'm fine with being punished,

184
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,938
but isn't it urgent
to get rid of the bodies?

185
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,149
When the sun sets,
more monsters will come.

186
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,693
Then bury them quickly!

187
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,652
Even so,

188
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,070
-Yes--
-...they'll climb out.

189
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,030
You must cut off their heads
or burn them.

190
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,410
-Burn the bodies?
-What?

191
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,162
Who says you can burn the bodies?

192
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,417
-Who...
-Well...

193
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,003
She is the former commander's mother.

194
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,967
Never desecrate the body
you got from your parents.

195
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,053
My precious son is our family's only son
for three generations.

196
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,431
If you so much as lay a finger
on his body,

197
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,057
you will have to answer to me!

198
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,976
If you lay a finger on the bodies

199
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,603
of my family,
you will have to answer to me too!

200
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,736
-Well, they are correct.
-What?

201
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,239
With noblemen, even if they commit
grave crimes like murder,

202
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,534
you cannot punish them
without the Royal Court's consent.

203
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,785
You know that, right?

204
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,912
-But...
-On top of that,

205
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,082
if we burn all those bodies,

206
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,543
we will face an angry backlash
from the upper class.

207
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,295
Then what do I do?

208
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,671
My gosh.

209
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,471
-We should burn the peasants' bodies
-Okay.

210
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,723
...and hold proper funerals

211
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,058
for the bodies of the aristocrats.

212
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,186
Then we should bury them

213
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,481
deep into the ground. How about that?

214
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,734
There are so many. How can we
differentiate nobles from peasants?

215
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,445
Goodness. We can separate

216
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,740
the bodies in silk from those in rags.

217
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,244
-Great idea.
-Thank you.

218
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,996
Split them into two groups!

219
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,456
-Go on.
-Go.

220
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,709
Someone responsible
for the people' safety

221
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,669
is this incompetent?

222
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,882
What are you doing?

223
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,596
The instant you draw your sword,
you lose your head!

224
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,019
Who are you that you dare do this?

225
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,437
You are not only incompetent,

226
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,397
but also endlessly vile.

227
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,484
You locked the doors
to the barracks last night,

228
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,528
countless innocent people died.

229
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,656
If I had opened the gate,
the soldiers would have been in danger.

230
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,699
Firing your arrow at me

231
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,869
is punishable by death
and annihilation of your family.

232
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,329
You have committed treason!

233
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,249
By the way, who are you?

234
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,554
The four-clawed dragon... You are...

235
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,515
It's an honor to greet the Crown Prince!

236
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,312
What did he just say?

237
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,647
What are you doing?

238
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,399
He is the Crown Prince!

239
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,241
I should kill you right this instant,

240
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,910
but we need help so...

241
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,828
Spare my life.

242
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,289
I shall punish you
after resolving the situation.

243
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,504
How many soldiers are alive?

244
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,967
Only 50, Your Highness.

245
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,554
-That is correct.
-Have every soldier search for bodies.

246
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,265
They must burn them immediately.

247
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,017
You cannot do that.

248
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,061
I understand how you feel,
having lost your family.

249
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,355
But we must burn them
to avoid future harm.

250
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,399
Light a signal fire and send messengers

251
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,319
to spread the word and request support
so we can quarantine Dongnae.

252
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,862
And transport survivors

253
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,822
using boats on either quayside

254
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,034
to safety before nightfall.

255
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,871
Cho Beom-pal, the magistrate of Dongnae,

256
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,123
shall heed Your Royal Highness' command!

257
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,751
-We shall obey!
-We shall obey!

258
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,568
The signal fire has been lit!

259
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:47,382
HANYANG

260
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,841
Where is the Chief Scholar?

261
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,259
He is waiting inside.

262
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,973
I came out of respect to him,

263
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,101
but things are tense now
with talk of treason.

264
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,313
It doesn't look good to meet
secretly like this.

265
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,400
We have something urgent to tell you.

266
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,610
This way, please.

267
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,077
What do you mean?

268
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,122
Corpses were found in the King's palace?

269
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,334
Something strange is happening there
for sure.

270
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,422
Lord Cho Hak-ju is hiding it from us.

271
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,801
I know you are one of his men.

272
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,013
However, I'm telling you
because I believe you know

273
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,389
what is right and wrong.

274
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,186
I can't believe it.

275
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,522
It can't be.

276
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,777
There is only one way
to find out the truth.

277
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,947
Let us go to the King's palace.

278
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,868
If we go and see His Majesty in person
and confirm that he is safe,

279
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,536
everything will become clear.

280
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,664
The Queen has forbidden
anyone from entering

281
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,916
the King's palace.

282
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,087
We serve His Majesty, not the Queen.

283
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,843
Lord Ahn Hyeon will join us.

284
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,598
Do you mean the Lord Ahn Hyeon?

285
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,185
He is staying low in his hometown,

286
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,854
mourning the loss of his mother
for three years,

287
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,814
but if he takes action,

288
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,986
all the scholars and subjects of the land
will follow him.

289
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,763
I was keeping an eye on Chief Scholar,

290
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,891
and I noticed a servant running.
I found this on him.

291
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,393
It's a letter meant
for Lord Ahn Hyeon in Sangju.

292
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,232
All he did was read books.

293
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,609
If he wants to challenge me,

294
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,904
he would need Lord Ahn Hyeon's help.

295
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,031
What should we do?

296
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,243
Leave them be.

297
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,452
Are you sure?

298
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,996
Lord Ahn Hyeon saved the nation
during the war three years ago.

299
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,084
If he supports the Crown Prince,
the people may as well.

300
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,335
Lord Ahn Hyeon...

301
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,006
can never oppose me.

302
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,136
No matter what.

303
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,183
DONGNAE

304
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,562
My lord, I have brought the criminal.

305
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:50,982
Okay.

306
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,278
Send her in.

307
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,954
You wanted to see me?

308
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,375
Yes. I called you here today because--

309
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,378
It is all my fault.

310
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,672
I should have reported it right away,

311
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:19,177
but they were like family to me,
so I thought I could cure them.

312
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,469
Please kill me.

313
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,387
No...

314
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,391
No. That is not it.

315
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:29,770
Well, it's your duty as a physician
to cure people.

316
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,565
That is not all.
You saved my life last night.

317
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,233
You are too kind, my lord.

318
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,652
-I merely--
-No.

319
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,696
Well...

320
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,157
I swear...

321
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,702
I will repay you for what you did.

322
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,872
Until all my hair...

323
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,584
turns white,

324
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,338
I will keep you by my side.

325
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,928
Do you need a physician?

326
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,805
Do you have an ailment, my lord?

327
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,894
-No, that is not--
-You are flushed.

328
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,355
Are you always like that?

329
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,734
Or are you usually fine,
but get flushed when you're nervous?

330
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,196
It may be
because your heart or liver is unhealthy.

331
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:24,450
If you do not mind,
may I check your pulse?

332
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,244
My pulse?

333
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,624
Men and women must be separated,

334
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,752
but that is not a problem between us.

335
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,462
Sure.

336
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,548
Take your time and check my pulse.

337
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,311
Do you have difficulty urinating?

338
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,023
-Did you just say--
-Your lower abdomen may be strained.

339
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,277
You may feel pain in your penis, too.

340
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,073
My... penis?

341
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,492
I think...

342
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,954
it's gonorrhea.

343
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,248
Gonorrhea?

344
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,167
What? My...

345
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,169
Something's wrong with my thing?

346
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,212
Don't worry.

347
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,548
It isn't that serious yet.

348
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,342
You will be fine once you take medicine.

349
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,928
My lord.

350
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,264
The Crown Prince's guard is here.

351
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,599
Okay.

352
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,560
Show him in.

353
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,026
The Crown Prince ordered me
to bring that physician.

354
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,820
Oh... I see.

355
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,905
In that case...

356
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,409
You should. Sure. Go ahead.

357
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,381
My lord! This is the head clerk.

358
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,054
Okay. What is it?

359
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,768
During the last night's mayhem,
all the battleships were destroyed.

360
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,271
And there aren't enough boats
to evacuate the people.

361
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,441
There is one decent cargo ship,

362
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,445
so it can set sail in about two hours.

363
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,448
How can we evacuate all those people
with just one cargo ship?

364
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,450
I know. That is...

365
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,202
How is the search for bodies coming along?

366
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,412
Hey.

367
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,583
We made every soldier available
search for bodies,

368
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,126
but to no avail.

369
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,255
Then find as many as possible. Go!

370
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,389
Nothing is going right.

371
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,726
No!

372
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,106
-I'm sorry, my lord.
-The Crown Prince gave us a command.

373
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,652
Come up with a plan before sunset.

374
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,953
Yeong-ju.

375
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,182
Master!

376
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,934
What's going on?

377
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,811
It wasn't like this.

378
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,855
In Hanyang...

379
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,733
It wasn't like this in Hanyang.

380
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,942
When Dan-i...

381
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,028
When Dan-i...

382
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,988
was bitten,

383
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,576
he was sick for days
and died as a human being.

384
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,079
But...

385
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,457
when those people

386
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,168
got bitten,

387
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,838
they turned into the same monster.

388
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,798
The disease has changed.

389
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,760
It has begun to spread.

390
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,264
What are you talking about, Master?

391
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,435
I can fix it.

392
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,145
I can...

393
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,148
fix this disease.

394
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,653
I logged everything
about the disease. Everything...

395
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,093
TWO HOURS AFTER STICKING A NEEDLE
COATED WITH CRUSHED RESURRECTION PLANT

396
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,097
INTO HIS MAJESTY'S FOREHEAD,
HE CAME BACK TO LIFE

397
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,314
This disease can be cured?

398
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,817
Is that true?

399
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,945
That is what he said.

400
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,534
"The cold valley that is foggy
four seasons of the year.

401
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,413
The plant with a purple flower
that blooms in early autumn

402
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,041
will resurrect a person who has died."

403
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,587
Did you go to the valley to find it?

404
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,839
I thought I could figure out a way

405
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:16,010
to cure the diseased
if I found that plant, so I went there,

406
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,346
but I couldn't find such a plant.

407
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,850
For now, there is no way
to cure this disease.

408
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:27,813
Your Highness.

409
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,024
I need to tell you something.

410
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,328
I cannot find Commander Cho's head.

411
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,163
If someone took it

412
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,082
to Cho Hak-ju...

413
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,794
This is utterly frustrating.

414
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,258
You should've talked to him nicely.
Why did you do that?

415
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,637
He is Cho Hak-ju's precious only son.

416
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,139
If he receives that only son's
decapitated head,

417
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,642
he won't forgive us.

418
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,852
I won't forgive him either.

419
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,811
Pardon?

420
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,317
You were accused of treason
and fled all the way to Dongnae.

421
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,653
How do you plan to fight him?

422
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,655
I have a justification now.

423
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,282
I must gather support.

424
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,408
Justification?

425
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,744
What justification?

426
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,334
Stay alive.

427
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,176
You must stay alive.

428
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,851
Father...

429
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,314
has passed away.

430
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,652
Pardon?

431
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,906
His Majesty has passed away?

432
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,076
Cho Hak-ju and the Queen

433
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,829
used the resurrection plant on him

434
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,540
after he passed away...

435
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,876
to protect their authority.

436
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,050
That journal and that female physician

437
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,469
will testify to that fact.

438
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,057
Sangju...

439
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,853
I shall go to Lord Ahn Hyeon.

440
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,902
Hurry up. Hurry.

441
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,116
Just a minute.

442
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,118
Hurry. Move quickly.

443
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,626
Finish up before people flock here.

444
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,587
Let us go.

445
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,842
Why is he bringing a pig?

446
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,766
The ship is leaving! Hurry!

447
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,101
Everyone ran away! Hurry up!

448
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,278
Hey! Excuse me!

449
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,905
Hey, what is going on?

450
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:23,989
Take care!

451
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,465
It's quicker by boat to Sangju.

452
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,760
They are almost done fixing the ship,
so let's go to the dock.

453
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,862
Oh, no!

454
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,490
Don't leave us, my lord! Please!

455
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,534
Take us with you!

456
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,578
Don't abandon us!

457
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,748
Please take us with you!

458
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,041
My lord!

459
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:19,586
-Please take our baby! Just our baby!
-Please come back!

460
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:31,932
Why those...

461
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,726
They should do something
instead of just whining.

462
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,436
Why are they so foolish?

463
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,025
Is it okay for us to do this?

464
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,197
It is impossible to get rid
of all the corpses before the sun sets.

465
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,908
It will be mayhem again at night.

466
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,743
Staying there

467
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,830
is like running into fire
carrying kindling.

468
00:47:56,206 --> 00:48:00,794
You and the noblemen
are the pillars that sustain Dongnae.

469
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,920
-Right.
-I agree.

470
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,048
You must stay alive and rebuild Dongnae.

471
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,642
You are positive that the Crown Prince
left Dongnae safely, right?

472
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,519
Yes, of course.

473
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,480
I saw the two of them leave
with my own eyes.

474
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,774
You need not worry, my lord.

475
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,777
Did he take that female physician
with him?

476
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,195
Who?

477
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,908
Never mind.

478
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,161
-Excuse me.
-Do not worry, and--

479
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,329
-Hey.
-My lord.

480
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,965
Will it be okay?

481
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,217
The Crown Prince is still there.

482
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,887
If he finds out we left like this,

483
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,264
he will have our heads.

484
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,727
We shot arrows at the Crown Prince
last night.

485
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:03,190
He said he'll annihilate our families.
We are dead either way.

486
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,484
But...

487
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,654
Okay. Good.

488
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,590
Come on, now.

489
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,634
Don't worry.

490
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,679
The Cho clan has control
over the Lees in this world.

491
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:34,846
If we...

492
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:40,769
stay on the magistrate's good side,
we will be able to find a way to survive.

493
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,285
