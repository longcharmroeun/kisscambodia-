1
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,808
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS

2
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,609
Eat, Your Highness.

3
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,906
It's not Your Highness's fault.

4
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,868
You did your best to save those people.

5
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,495
If I had stepped in sooner,

6
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,498
I could have saved them.

7
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,042
Then you would have ended up dead.

8
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,632
You said you must stay alive.

9
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,510
Didn't you conspire treason
in order to stay alive?

10
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,309
I wanted to be different.

11
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,273
I wanted to be different from those...

12
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,443
who abandoned the weak.

13
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,615
And you were.

14
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,037
That is how I saw it.

15
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,464
I will look for some herbs
to remedy the wound.

16
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,806
Is he back?

17
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,602
Not yet, I am afraid.

18
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,854
His name is still unknown.

19
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,234
His name Yeong-sin
and his identity tag are fake.

20
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,572
At the moment, we need someone
who knows the area well.

21
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,576
Did Your Highness
not see him wield the rifle?

22
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,080
Not even palace guards are that skilled.

23
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,792
Those who can match that level of prowess

24
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,419
are the members of Chakho.

25
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,298
Are you talking about the elite troop
that hunts tigers?

26
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,340
Yes.

27
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,427
Since tiger hunting is dangerous,

28
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,763
the members are chosen
based on their fighting skills

29
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,849
regardless of their social status.

30
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,852
Many of them are quite dangerous.

31
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,603
They would do anything

32
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,939
to stay alive.

33
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,321
They would do anything to stay alive?

34
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,239
They are like me, then.

35
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,699
Your Highness.

36
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
Speak to me.

37
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,753
No soldiers are on our tail.

38
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,464
I also checked villages on the way.

39
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,382
The disease has not spread yet,

40
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,593
but the people are already
terrified by rumors.

41
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,595
Judging by the empty houses,

42
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,722
many villagers must have already fled.

43
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,385
A monster! It's a monster!

44
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,158
Water. Give me some water. Water!

45
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,661
Is that...

46
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,704
Magistrate Cho?

47
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,457
Your Highness?

48
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,668
Your Highness. Are you really--

49
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,087
Your Highness, I--

50
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,677
Do you know the blood
the people you abandoned shed?

51
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,345
Please stop.

52
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,306
He is not even worth killing.

53
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,150
Did you not run for your life?
What happened to you?

54
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,278
Well, the cargo ship...

55
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,947
The disease spread on the ship.

56
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,159
What do you mean?

57
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,290
An infected corpse was on the ship.

58
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,877
The corpse infected everyone on board.

59
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,463
Only I was able to make it out alive.

60
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,839
Where is the ship now?

61
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,886
The disease started to spread
when we reached Seongju, so...

62
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,014
If that is the case,

63
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,351
they will reach Sangju soon.

64
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,478
Messengers were already sent,

65
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,396
so Sangju must be prepared for it.

66
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,314
Actually,

67
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,902
only city-fortresses near Dongnae
were notified of the disease.

68
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,116
If Mungyeong Saejae in Sangju falls,

69
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
the disease will reach Hanyang in no time.

70
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,964
We leave for Sangju right away.

71
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,971
Your Highness!

72
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,683
Please... Let me come with you.
Your Highness!

73
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,429
Sangju is over that mountain!

74
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,389
Once Sangju is breached,

75
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,766
the disease will spread
all over the nation.

76
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,310
We must stop it.

77
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:09,609
SANGJU

78
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,688
Are the rumors true?

79
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,066
-What?
-A cursed disease is spreading.

80
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,319
They say a headless ghost
appears in the night.

81
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,297
A signal fire has been sent from Dongnae.
The messenger is yet to arrive,

82
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,883
so the local government
doesn't know the details.

83
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,134
However,

84
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,846
a strange rumor is spreading
across Gyeongsang.

85
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,432
A disease is spreading in Dongnae,

86
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,936
and its victims do not seem to stay dead.

87
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,873
Get ready.

88
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,585
I am leaving the mountains.

89
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,547
This talisman

90
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,509
will chase away all diseases and ghosts.

91
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,886
The talisman

92
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,724
written in cinnabar by this young shaman
is only ten bun.

93
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,016
Only ten bun, people!

94
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,145
-Give me one, please.
-Here, it's ten bun.

95
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,063
Give me one too. This is all I have.

96
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,691
How dare you try to bargain with me!

97
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,568
You are bad luck. Shoo! Ten bun!

98
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,944
-Bring the money.
-Damn it!

99
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,822
-Lord Ahn Hyeon.
-Lord Ahn Hyeon!

100
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,407
-Lord Ahn Hyeon!
-He is here!

101
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,222
My lord, upon my inspection,
I found something peculiar by the stream.

102
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,099
You must see it for yourself.

103
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,688
Why is a ship that belongs to the nation

104
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,107
stranded here at this stream?

105
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,151
I suspect a huge commotion, my lord.

106
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,654
It must be why a signal fire
was sent from Dongnae.

107
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,506
There is a village deep in this forest.

108
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,508
Yes, slash-and-burn farmers.

109
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,762
I smell... grilled meat.

110
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,014
I smell pork.

111
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,488
Here and on the deck,

112
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,948
there's blood everywhere.

113
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,984
The floors and walls are covered in blood,

114
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,989
so where are the injured or the dead?

115
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,337
You never know when we will eat again,
so eat up while you can.

116
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,342
-Eat up!
-Do not forget to chew.

117
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,679
-Don't eat too much rice.
-It's good.

118
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,805
Eat the pork...

119
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,690
This is odd.

120
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,402
People are dying of famine,
but they eat rice and pork.

121
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,367
What brings you by deep into this forest?

122
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,077
Where is this food from?

123
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,996
Well,

124
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,626
we received it as payment
for helping out at a party.

125
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,132
No way.

126
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,134
Move. Get out of my way!

127
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,096
Step aside.

128
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,598
I told you to move!

129
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,439
I see cargo from the ship!

130
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,942
They must have looted the ship.

131
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,276
I apologize!

132
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,029
Please spare my life.

133
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,238
We are terribly sorry.

134
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,243
It was not our intent
to steal from the ship.

135
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,580
The food was just too good to pass up on.

136
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,583
-Please spare our lives!
-Please spare our lives!

137
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,793
Please forgive us.

138
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,254
Was there anyone on the ship?

139
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,675
Everyone was dead when we arrived.

140
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,635
I went to check on the ship this morning.

141
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,597
The passengers were gnawed at
as if animals had attacked them.

142
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,057
Please believe me.

143
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,643
What about the bodies?
Did you just leave them there?

144
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,270
Animals would have gotten to them,

145
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,523
so we buried them all.

146
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,857
Where did you bury them?

147
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,819
Where?

148
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,740
You all committed a heinous crime.

149
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,619
However, I understand you did so
out of hunger.

150
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,456
If you are honest with me,
I will lessen your punishments.

151
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,797
Let us lead the way.

152
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,179
I found wheel marks!

153
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,660
Are we not there yet?

154
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,581
We are almost there.

155
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,805
Is this the place?

156
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,935
What are you doing? Keep leading the way!

157
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,617
We know that those who steal
government property get beheaded.

158
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,912
What are you talking about?

159
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,414
We have lived long enough lives,

160
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,793
but our children do not deserve to die.

161
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,588
Without you to talk of our crimes,
our sins will stay hidden.

162
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,759
You damn bastards.

163
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,552
Do you know who you are addressing?

164
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,262
Lower your weapons!

165
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,062
This matter is graver than stealing.

166
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,647
If this does not get sorted,

167
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,565
not only you and your children

168
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,319
but everyone in Gyeongsang might die.

169
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,615
Now lead us to the corpses!

170
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,163
Has hunger impaired your hearing?

171
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,624
Where are the bodies?

172
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,087
You're stepping on them.

173
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,705
What is that?

174
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,124
If you wish to live,

175
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,170
raise your weapons and behead them all.

176
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,764
Another wave of monsters!

177
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,130
No. Oh, no!

178
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,800
Help me...

179
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,970
No!

180
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,717
Please come down!

181
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,345
Must I force you down here?

182
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,097
I will be killed if I do.

183
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,976
Everyone wants me out of the palace.

184
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,897
If I am deposed, I will be killed.

185
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,444
I miss my late mother.

186
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,697
You aren't supposed to be here.

187
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,456
This is not...

188
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,501
where you should be.

189
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,258
GANGNYEONGJEON

190
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,427
I do not want to go there.

191
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,097
Master, I would rather go back.

192
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,395
What you said is right.

193
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,438
His Majesty has received

194
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,734
a stack of appeals
that claim your deposition.

195
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,987
To make it worse,

196
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,156
there is no one in the palace
who can protect you.

197
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,324
So...

198
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,077
you must protect yourself.

199
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,126
Your Highness...

200
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,171
is not just trying
to protect your own life.

201
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,049
You are in a battle against injustice.

202
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,343
There are those who are trying to make

203
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,555
the Crown Prince their puppets
for their own interest.

204
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,141
Fighting and winning against that evil

205
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,560
is the only way to uphold justice.

206
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,667
Show your respects!

207
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,878
He is the Crown Prince,

208
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,047
the heir to the throne!

209
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,719
-We greet His Highness!
-We greet His Highness!

210
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,812
It has been a while,

211
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,190
Master.

212
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,578
There is no lie to any of it.

213
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,996
Father...

214
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,584
has passed away.

215
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,879
Lord Cho, obsessed with power,
had Physician Lee Seung-hui

216
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,799
feed my father the resurrection plant
that turned him into...

217
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,760
a flesh-craving monster.

218
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,471
That is what started
the horrific epidemic.

219
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,976
Cho Hak-ju is as atrocious as ever.
You must help.

220
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,605
I will return to Hanyang,
punish the Haewon Cho Clan,

221
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,608
and build this nation anew.

222
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,950
When was the last time...

223
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,370
you had some sleep?

224
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,415
What do you mean?

225
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,252
Have you come all this way

226
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,588
despite the hunger
and disheveled appearance?

227
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,844
Thugs on the street can do so.

228
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,303
However...

229
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,640
Your Highness may not.

230
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,560
The Crown Prince

231
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,395
must always...

232
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,858
look decent and confident.

233
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,746
Sangju is my hometown
and where I currently reside.

234
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,039
I urge you, Your Highness,

235
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,584
to rest peacefully for tonight.

236
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,130
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,985
What kind of a man is Lord Ahn Hyeon?

238
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,281
Why are you asking me that?

239
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,700
Don't you find it odd?

240
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,746
Neither Lord Ahn nor his servants

241
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,081
were alarmed at the sight of the ill.

242
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,835
They swiftly beheaded
and burned the infected.

243
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,296
They didn't hesitate
in fighting the infected.

244
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,675
It's as if they knew well
about the infected.

245
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,643
Escort His Highness.

246
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,604
Also, find his companions a place to rest.

247
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,731
This way, Your Highness.

248
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,299
What did Lord Ahn say?

249
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,803
He did not give me a definite answer.

250
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,183
Can he truly be trusted?

251
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,478
Your Highness.

252
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,439
He may still be mourning,

253
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,692
but even when Lord Cho
suppressed the scholars,

254
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,403
Lord Ahn did not even lift a finger
to help them.

255
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,615
He could be in alliance with Lord Cho.

256
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,992
Watch what you say.

257
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,161
He is not one you speak lightly of.

258
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,081
But Your Highness--

259
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,457
Get some rest too.

260
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,502
You have not been able to
these past few days.

261
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,053
PATIENT JOURNAL

262
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,021
HANYANG

263
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:44,903
Look here.

264
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,031
Why does he get food and not me? Why?

265
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,824
Seriously?

266
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,758
What is wrong?

267
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,218
My gosh.

268
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,806
Over here!

269
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,892
Look...

270
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,969
Feeding the flesh of the infected
to a healthy subject

271
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,724
leads to the transmission of the disease.

272
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,935
This cannot be controlled.

273
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,148
Before it reaches the northern region,

274
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,692
the epidemic must be contained.

275
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,105
MONUMENT TO THE BATTLE OF UNPO WETLAND

276
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,278
TO COMMEMORATE THE VICTORY
OF GOVERNOR AHN HYEON OF GYEONGSANG,

277
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,489
WHO DEFEATED 30,000 JAPANESE SOLDIERS
WITH 500 SOLDIERS

278
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,714
SUMANG VILLAGE

279
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,014
Do not go.

280
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,866
Please do not leave me.

281
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,535
Can you please stay?

282
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,079
Go back inside. I promise I will be back.

283
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,921
Please! Do not go!

284
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,637
You must come back.

285
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,305
You must!

286
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,695
NORTH GATE OF SANGJU

287
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,906
Here comes a messenger!

288
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,375
How did it go? Did you find it?

289
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,836
-Is this it, my lord?
-Yes, it's.

290
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,590
Good job.

291
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,809
Is that the cargo from the ship?

292
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,019
Yes, my lord.

293
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,313
Nothing disastrous happened

294
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,191
thanks to Lord Ahn
locating the infected heading north,

295
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,486
but he mentioned
to heighten security down south.

296
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,403
Anyway,

297
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,823
-is it true?
-May I ask what you are referring to?

298
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,121
I heard that His Highness
is here in Sangju.

299
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,748
Is it true?

300
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,126
My lord!

301
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,756
The Five Armies has left Hanyang

302
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,424
and is headed for Mungyeong Saejae.

303
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:12,999
Hey, Seo-bi!

304
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,542
Seo-bi!

305
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,054
Where have you been all alone?
I looked for you everywhere.

306
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,473
I was looking for medicinal herbs
for His Highness.

307
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,975
Forget about the herbs.

308
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:32,893
Run away with me.

309
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,812
You will die if you return to his side.

310
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,398
-Follow me.
-What are you talking about?

311
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,193
The Five Armies is coming
to arrest His Highness.

312
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,445
What?

313
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,530
Is that true?

314
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,117
Being with a man who committed treason
will ensure your death.

315
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,620
I am of the Haewon Cho Clan,

316
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,165
so I will be able to protect you. Come on!

317
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,002
Are you running away again?

318
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,378
No, well--

319
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,048
His Highness went through hoops

320
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,425
to save the people you abandoned,

321
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,011
but here you are
turning your back on him again.

322
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,349
Is it really hard for you to show bravery
for once in your life?

323
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,434
Well, you see--

324
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,061
Run away on your own.

325
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,313
I will stay with His Highness.

326
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,898
But, wait...

327
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,442
Seo-bi!

328
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,153
Seo-bi!

329
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,946
Seo-bi!

330
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,001
Slow down or you will choke.

331
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,005
You do not have to get greedy.
There is more, so eat up.

332
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,008
My goodness, you look so young
to be pregnant.

333
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,136
Here, let me take it.

334
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,391
Thank you for taking care
of lowly peasants like us.

335
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,017
There is no need to thank me.

336
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,728
Stop talking nonsense and just eat up.

337
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,979
-Sure!
-Thank you.

338
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,023
Eat up and give birth to sons!

339
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,150
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

340
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,906
By the way, who could it be?

341
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,075
Who is taking such good care of us?

342
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,785
How should we know? Just eat up.

343
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,830
-No one is telling us.
-Well,

344
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,041
I am grateful for the food
and the shelter,

345
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,876
but I still find it odd.

346
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,588
Why have they only gathered
pregnant women who have nowhere to go?

347
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,466
Eat up while it's all for free.

348
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,718
It looks like you will give birth
any time soon.

349
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,681
Eat up and just pop out a healthy baby.

350
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
Thank you.

351
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,895
My lady. Yes, you.

352
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,065
How did you end up here?

353
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,817
You do not seem like one of us.

354
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,571
My husband told me to be here.

355
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,408
What do you mean by that?

356
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,494
Does your husband know the master
of this household?

357
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,747
My husband is the Crown Prince's guard,

358
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,624
and he went on a trip
with His Highness.

359
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,253
He was worried to leave me alone,
so he told me to come here.

360
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,005
No wonder.

361
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,632
I knew you were not
a pathetic widow like us.

362
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,885
How sweet.

363
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,345
You have a wonderful husband.

364
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,514
Anyway, please eat up.

365
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,141
-Please enjoy.
-Sure.

366
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,810
Your Majesty, it's time for the assembly.

367
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,897
I shall go.

368
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,876
The Queen shall now enter!

369
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,215
-We greet Her Majesty.
-We greet Her Majesty.

370
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,156
The Court will hear

371
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,618
Her Majesty's royal edict.

372
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,291
"Heaven gave no blessing to this nation

373
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,504
which led to His Majesty
suddenly falling ill

374
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,214
and losing consciousness.

375
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,175
Meanwhile, his son, the Crown Prince,

376
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,594
committed high treason

377
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,640
by desiring the throne for himself.

378
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,101
Such commotion
has disrupted the royal family,

379
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,144
and the throne is left empty.

380
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,647
Now, an awful disease
is spreading through the nation,

381
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,316
bringing nothing but suffering
to the people.

382
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,860
How is this not a tragedy?

383
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,989
I no longer can reject the sincere

384
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,034
and loyal advice
of current and retired officials

385
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,328
regarding the throne staying vacant,

386
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:10,416
which is why I will brace myself
and take over as Queen Regent."

387
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,169
-Thank you for your generosity!
-Thank you for your generosity!

388
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,797
On her first day as Queen Regent,

389
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,134
Her Majesty will relay her first orders.

390
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,638
"To eradicate the disease
terrorizing the land of Gyeongsang,

391
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,765
the Five Armies consisting of

392
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,560
the Military Training Command,
the Royal Commander Division,

393
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,062
and the Southern Fort Command
will be sent to help."

394
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,944
The drum indicates
that they passed the second gate.

395
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,904
They will be here soon.

396
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,617
I see them coming!

397
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,974
THE FIRST GATE OF YEONGNAM

398
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,156
What is that?

399
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,161
"From this moment on,

400
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,081
western and eastern part of Gyeongsang
will be sealed off."

401
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,627
Seal off the first gate!

402
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,253
What is going on?

403
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,383
What are you doing?

404
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,010
Why are you sealing off--

405
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,058
What are you doing?

406
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,269
Stop!

407
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,999
SANGJU

408
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:30,389
"Mungyeong Saejae, the main road
that leads out of Gyeongsang

409
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,433
as well as the gates of Jungnyeong,
Chupungnyeong and Gyeripnyeong

410
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,018
will be sealed off.

411
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:39,022
Anyone who acts against this order
will be executed on the spot,

412
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,525
demonstrating the seriousness of the law."

413
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,571
-Thank you for your boundless generosity!
-Thank you for your boundless generosity!

414
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,653
