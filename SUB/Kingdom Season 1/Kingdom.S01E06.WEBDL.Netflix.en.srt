1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,891
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS

2
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,115
As you ordered,

3
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,575
all the gates have been sealed.

4
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,911
However,

5
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,414
do you really plan to give up
on the entire region of Gyeongsang?

6
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,543
It doesn't compare to Jeolla,
lush and abundant,

7
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,046
but do you really plan to give up
all the grains

8
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,507
the subjects of Gyeongsang offer up?

9
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,055
Do you regard power...

10
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,185
only as a means of coveting money?

11
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,441
How many dead bodies...

12
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,279
do you think are
at the bottom of this pond?

13
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,493
To bring the day
when no one can say a word about

14
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,330
how many bodies I have dumped
in this pond.

15
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,292
That is what power is for.

16
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,713
I'll use that power...

17
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,883
to protect you, Father.

18
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,678
I'm the one
who placed that power in your hand.

19
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,975
I'm also the one
who can take it away from you at any time.

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,522
Do not open the gates

21
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,817
until I give the orders.

22
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,158
What about the Prince?

23
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,625
The Crown Prince is still alive
in Gyeongsang.

24
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,546
Do you plan to let him be?

25
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,055
I'll...

26
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,683
kill the Crown Prince.

27
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,771
I'll...

28
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,691
kill him with my own hands.

29
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,429
Lord Ahn!

30
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,690
Hand over the Crown Prince.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,110
Cho Hak-ju has closed Mungyeong Saejae.

32
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,238
We need the Crown Prince
if we are to get it open again.

33
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,282
Where is he?

34
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
My lord,

35
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,249
they have arrived.

36
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,380
Sure, I'll grant your request.

37
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,341
I'll let you take His Royal Highness.

38
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,852
Your Royal Highness.

39
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,604
You cannot trust anyone.

40
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,192
We must leave this place.

41
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Your Royal Highness.

42
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,702
Crown Prince Lee Chang, come out at once!

43
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,970
You have come a long way.

44
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,182
It's time to return to Hanyang.

45
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,864
Are they not palace guards?

46
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,116
Thank you for guarding the criminal.

47
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,078
As per the King's command,

48
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,747
I shall escort him to prison.

49
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,540
Bind the traitor!

50
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,209
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

51
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,086
How dare you?

52
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,629
Who?

53
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,548
Who is the traitor?

54
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,219
A palace guard,

55
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,680
who should serve the nation and the King,

56
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,019
gave into his personal greed
and became Cho Hak-ju's lapdog.

57
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,233
For oppressing the Crown Prince,
the heir to the throne,

58
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,153
and disrupting the core values
of this nation,

59
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,865
you deserve to be executed.

60
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,327
Execute him!

61
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,126
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,520
Sangju is my hometown
and where I currently reside.

63
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,231
I urge you, Your Highness,

64
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,483
to rest peacefully for tonight.

65
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,945
There is no time to rest.

66
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,238
You should rest

67
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,366
and let your body recover.

68
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,868
How else...

69
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,330
will you fight the chief palace guard?

70
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,167
What do you mean?

71
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,211
Yesterday,

72
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,340
a homing pigeon
delivered this secret letter

73
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,759
from the chief palace guard.

74
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,972
He said Your Royal Highness
was headed this way

75
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,311
and that I should lock you up
until he arrives.

76
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,731
The chief palace guard
couldn't have known

77
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,941
that I was headed here.

78
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,281
One of your companions...

79
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,118
is Cho Hak-ju's mole.

80
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,120
Thus,

81
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:22,335
you must not let anyone know
what we just discussed.

82
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:40,311
None of you shall survive.
Not a single one.

83
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,566
Not only you but your families...

84
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,571
will be trapped in Gyeongsang,

85
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,116
catch the disease, and be decapitated.

86
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,168
What have you just done?

87
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,004
How could you massacre guards
delivering the King's command?

88
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,632
Do you think Lord Cho Hak-ju
will let you get away?

89
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,426
He'll accuse you of treason

90
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,055
-and turn Sangju into a bloodbath!
-Cho Hak-ju has already abandoned Sangju.

91
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,350
He's abandoned Sangju
and the east and west regions

92
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,978
of Gyeongsang and the people therein.

93
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,938
What do you mean?

94
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,898
Do you think those soldiers

95
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,568
blocked off Mungyeong Saejae
just to stop me?

96
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,241
My lord, we have a big problem.

97
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,468
Yangsan, Gyeongju, Daegu,
Hapcheon, Changnyeong...

98
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,264
They came from various parts
of the south to escape the epidemic.

99
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,475
All of them were hit by the epidemic?

100
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,853
If Changnyeong was hit,
the infected will get here

101
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,229
in two days

102
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,273
or as soon as tonight.

103
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,360
You must open the gate and let them in.

104
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,195
If all parts of Gyeongsang were hit,

105
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,364
there will be more efugees.

106
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,160
How are we going to house
and feed them all?

107
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,662
Once we run out of food,
they will start looting.

108
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,331
There will be mayhem.

109
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,667
Then do you plan to sit back
and watch them die?

110
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,765
If you don't open the gate,

111
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,351
the people outside the fortress
will be put in danger.

112
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,393
Open the gate.

113
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,104
We cannot open the gate.

114
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,066
At least the people inside must survive.

115
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,196
I'm sure Cho Hak-ju said the same thing
when he closed Mungyeong Saejae.

116
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,948
That at least they must survive.

117
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,409
This is a sacrifice
for the greater good.

118
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,454
Who are you to decide whom to sacrifice?

119
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,416
If you lock the gate, those outside
will catch the disease and die.

120
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,461
The people inside will be trapped
and die of starvation.

121
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,006
I'm the magistrate of Sangju!

122
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,132
No.

123
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,135
You are no longer qualified
to run this place.

124
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,720
What?

125
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,723
cannot let everyone die
because of an incompetent official.

126
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,143
I'll protect Sangju and the people
from now on.

127
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,021
By what right?

128
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,234
I'm the Crown Prince.

129
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,405
I strip you of the title
from this moment!

130
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,575
It's the Crown Prince's command.

131
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,411
Escort the magistrate out.

132
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,787
Lord Ahn,

133
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,039
you cannot do this.

134
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,126
You will regret this.

135
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,048
Move aside!

136
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,388
What will you do?

137
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,974
Even if we open the gate,

138
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,561
the fortress is not spacious enough
to shelter the refugees

139
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,938
as well as the people outside.

140
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,274
You are correct.

141
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,485
It cannot house everyone.

142
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,989
If we are to save everyone,

143
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
we must protect the entire Sangju.

144
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,494
The infected will soon come charging in.

145
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,830
How can we protect Sangju?

146
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,627
The diseased are corpses during the day
and come alive only at night.

147
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,212
They also fear water and fire.

148
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,549
If we take advantage of that,
we can stop them.

149
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,185
The south of Sangju
is surrounded by water.

150
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,022
If we guard both Byeongseong Stream

151
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,649
and Unpo Wetland against them,

152
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,485
we all can...

153
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,654
survive.

154
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,303
You cannot do this.
How could you tell noblemen to bear arms?

155
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,596
This is nonsense.

156
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,473
It's the Crown Prince's command.

157
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,730
We should be holding books,
not something like this.

158
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,737
Okay, a little more.

159
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,907
Okay, you should go.

160
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,537
I'll check the perimeter.

161
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,306
I think the baby will be born today.

162
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,643
-Will it be a boy?
-We are not sure--

163
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,979
Report to me only when a baby boy is born.

164
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,647
Yes, Your Majesty.

165
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,464
Mom!

166
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,472
The baby is here!

167
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,559
Thank goodness. She has been
in so much pain since last night.

168
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,937
I know. It must have been so hard for her.

169
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,332
It's cold outside. Return to your rooms.

170
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,794
The baby is not crying.
Is something wrong?

171
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,548
Both the mother and the baby are safe.

172
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,427
She is nursing the baby now, so go back.

173
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,267
Is it a boy or a girl?

174
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,146
It's a girl.

175
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,399
-Gosh.
-Why does it have to be a girl?

176
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,151
Who cares if it's a girl?

177
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,153
It doesn't matter,
if the baby is healthy.

178
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,682
Darn it. Oh, no.

179
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,850
You are so...

180
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,983
Thank goodness.

181
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,528
It did not damage Her Majesty's robe.

182
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
Thank goodness.

183
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,074
If you had left a stain on it,
it would have turned into ashes.

184
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,700
What do you mean?

185
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,577
One time,

186
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,831
I saw them burning
Her Majesty's precious silk robe.

187
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,626
-Really?
-Yes, for real.

188
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,462
The head court lady burned it herself.

189
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,841
It only had a tiny blood stain on it.

190
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,717
What a waste.

191
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,636
My gosh.

192
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,265
I could die a happy girl
if I could wear something like this once.

193
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,476
What could lowly girls like us
possibly expect?

194
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,396
We shall go.

195
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,981
Okay.

196
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,408
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

197
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,247
If you're done, you may leave.

198
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,874
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

199
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,811
My lady,

200
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,148
will I really serve Her Majesty?

201
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,484
Why someone lowly like me,
instead of a court lady?

202
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,613
Do not speak and focus on
serving Her Majesty.

203
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
Why are you so slow?

204
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,978
Apologies, Your Majesty.

205
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,919
How dare you?

206
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,192
What do you think?

207
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,529
My baby looks very healthy, does he not?

208
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,036
Please have mercy, Your Majesty!

209
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,109
-I shall carry that for you.
-There is no need. Just go.

210
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,826
What do you think?

211
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,787
This is plenty, is it not?

212
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,766
You are incredible.

213
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,896
How did you pick nothing but weeds?

214
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,022
What?

215
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,318
What? Look closely.

216
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,653
I only picked what you told me to pick.

217
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,866
You must be tired. You should rest.

218
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,201
But...

219
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,912
I'll go and pick it myself.

220
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,664
But... what do you mean I should rest?

221
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,419
How can a man rest
when everyone is working?

222
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,088
Seo-bi!

223
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,092
Is that not more than enough?

224
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,221
There are more medicinal herbs
that I must find.

225
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,265
What more are you looking for?

226
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,810
False lily of the valley.

227
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,521
His Royal Highness's wounds
have not healed yet.

228
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,898
I need that plant.

229
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,276
So, it's for the Crown Prince.

230
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,781
Seo-bi.

231
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,825
Seo-bi.

232
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,953
I'm hurt as well.

233
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,790
You got hurt while running away.

234
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,297
No... You...

235
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,383
You cannot go that way.

236
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,386
The magistrate's office
said that path is dangerous

237
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,305
and strictly forbids entering it.

238
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,725
It's not like there are tigers there.

239
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,978
What is dangerous about it?

240
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,480
Who knows? It's called Frozen Valley.

241
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,691
Maybe it's haunted or something.

242
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,776
We should go back.

243
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,696
What did you just say?

244
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,322
What? What do you mean?

245
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,492
Did you say, "Frozen Valley"?

246
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,202
Yes.

247
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,913
That valley up there is
called Frozen Valley.

248
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,963
Wait...

249
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,633
Why is she so fearless?

250
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,677
Well,

251
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,430
that is her charm.

252
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:34,890
Seo-bi.

253
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,316
Wait, Seo-bi.

254
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,727
It's chilly.
It already feels like winter here.

255
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,025
A place where it's foggy
all year round...

256
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,407
Wait, Seo-bi.

257
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,244
Hold on.

258
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,289
Seo-bi!

259
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,417
Seo-bi.

260
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,229
It's too cold!

261
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,022
It's so cold!

262
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,705
The resurrection plant...

263
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,585
What did you say?

264
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,132
This is the plant.

265
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,511
This plant brought the dead back to life.

266
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,224
This is the plant
that brought the dead back to life!

267
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,821
What is that?

268
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,645
When aiming a gun,

269
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,065
you must keep the muzzle, the barrel,
and the arm straight

270
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,149
as much as you can.

271
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,777
He is good with guns.

272
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,779
He was a member of Chakho.

273
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,241
He's the one from Sumang Village
I spoke of.

274
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,795
Fire!

275
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,341
Do you know him?

276
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,552
No.

277
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,013
I do not know him.

278
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,939
Fire!

279
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,572
Everyone, listen up!

280
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,449
The sun will set soon!

281
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,411
Check your surroundings one more time!

282
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,415
Do not leave your post for any reason!

283
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,291
Do you understand?

284
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,376
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

285
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,133
Cast off the boats!

286
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:43,054
...two! One! Two!

287
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,681
One!

288
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,891
Two!

289
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,138
The ones who went on reconnaissance
haven't returned.

290
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,810
We have arrived, my lord.

291
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,412
THE GATE OF MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

292
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,747
Welcome, Chief Councillor.

293
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,632
What is the status?

294
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,801
Sangju is still safe from the epidemic.

295
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,585
Your Royal Highness.

296
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,922
The sun will rise and we only need
to hang on a little longer.

297
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,932
Your Royal Highness.

298
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,505
It's the horse of the servant
who was out on survey.

299
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,591
Let it through.

300
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,882
The blood has not dried yet.

301
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,678
They will be here soon.

302
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,536
The signal fire is lit.
Sound the drums!

303
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,462
Please, rise.

304
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,812
It's very cold outside.

305
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,481
Get inside, my lord.

306
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,025
-It's the sun!
-The sun is up!

307
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,506
We must prepare for tonight,

308
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,508
so I'll tell them to get some rest.

309
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,722
Everyone, come in!

310
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,433
-We made it!
-Let us pull out for today!

311
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,448
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

312
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,162
Now that the sun has risen,
let us get some sleep.

313
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,830
Let us eat some delicious food!

314
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,914
Let us go.

315
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,259
Do you think it's over?

316
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,182
Pack up quickly,
and prepare for the evening!

317
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,433
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

318
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,849
How are they out during the day?

319
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,024
It was not the sun.

320
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,611
It was the temperature.

321
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,505
