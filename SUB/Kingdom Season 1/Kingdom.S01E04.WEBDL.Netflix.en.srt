1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,850
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS

2
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,157
Is there a ship for us, too?

3
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,918
What is that ship and who is on it?

4
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,964
Military commanders
and high officials of Dongnae.

5
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,675
They all left on that ship.

6
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,635
They didn't even clean up the bodies.

7
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,011
Once the sun sets,

8
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,265
they will wake up again.

9
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,894
Is there another ship?

10
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,314
They all burned down last night.
That was the only ship left.

11
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,693
We must find a place for these people
to hide before sunset.

12
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,362
What about the barracks
from last night?

13
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,447
We can keep all these people safe there.

14
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,994
Well, they tore down the fence
to repair that ship.

15
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,998
We can go to Jiyulheon.

16
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,209
The infected were unable to get out
of there for several days,

17
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,879
so they won't be able to get in.

18
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,553
We will go to Jiyulheon.
Anyone who can walk, will walk.

19
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,181
The old and the sick will be carried
on wagons.

20
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,517
Everyone, hurry!

21
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,269
We will go to Jiyulheon!

22
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,147
Move quickly!

23
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,358
We must get there before the sun sets,
so please hurry!

24
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,909
We shall go, too.

25
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,389
Oh, no.

26
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,768
Are you hurt?

27
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,855
-What's wrong?
-Over there.

28
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,857
There is something weird over there.

29
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,318
Wait, what is that?

30
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,448
It's a monster!

31
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,578
-Monsters everywhere.
-There's one there!

32
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,122
Over there, too.

33
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,667
Your Royal Highness.

34
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,795
If we consider the ones hiding,

35
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,838
they will be in great numbers.

36
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,889
Run!

37
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,766
Run! Now!

38
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,684
Run!

39
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,103
Run to Jiyulheon without stopping!

40
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,565
Run and don't stop!

41
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,608
Hurry!

42
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,610
-Get on this, sir.
-Hurry!

43
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,574
We must go.

44
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,789
Your Highness!

45
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,252
Help him!

46
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,337
Push!

47
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,377
Search the premises.

48
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,463
Shut the gate once the sun sets!

49
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
Go inside.

50
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,667
Your Royal Highness!

51
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,837
Help them over there!

52
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,798
Your Royal Highness! Are you okay?

53
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,104
Your Royal Highness!

54
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,649
You must go.

55
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,150
They're starting to wake up.

56
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,037
Your Royal Highness.

57
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,456
What are you doing? Push!

58
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,835
Your Royal Highness, we don't have time.

59
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,877
You must go!

60
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,878
I'm different!

61
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,173
I'm different from those
who abandoned these people,

62
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,509
and I'm different
from the Haewon Cho Clan!

63
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:11,013
I will never abandon these people!

64
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,774
Get them on!

65
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,277
-Hurry up!
-Hurry. Get on.

66
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,114
Hurry!

67
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,910
Get on!

68
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,757
Run!

69
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,099
-Where's the other wagon?
-I don't know!

70
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,329
Monster ahead!

71
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,151
-Prepare to close the gate!
-They're coming!

72
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,223
Hurry! Run!

73
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,021
Close the gate!

74
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,873
Are you all right?

75
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,504
The elderly and children
will hide in the shed,

76
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,923
and anyone who can fight, grab a weapon!

77
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,174
Yes, Your Royal Highness!

78
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,058
Come this way! This way.

79
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,663
How long until we arrive in Sangju?

80
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:51,502
Well, since the weather is nice,
we should arrive in two days.

81
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,005
Are you sure it's safe there?

82
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,094
Sangju is the second largest city
after Hanyang,

83
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,471
and it's filled with soldiers
who will protect us.

84
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,014
Don't worry.

85
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,980
What was that sound?

86
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,828
My son.

87
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,538
My precious son...

88
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,498
My son...

89
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Hey, who...

90
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,007
-Hey, shine the light over there.
-Okay.

91
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,143
Is someone down there?

92
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,565
Monster! There's a monster!

93
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,568
Help!

94
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,751
It's the sun.

95
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,921
The sun is up, Your Royal Highness.

96
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,440
Your Royal Highness.

97
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,650
The monsters are going away.

98
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,288
They are all gone!

99
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,140
They are all gone. You can come out.

100
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,435
Seo-bi.

101
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,909
Your Royal Highness.

102
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,244
May I come in?

103
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,625
Come in.

104
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,923
I think you should come out.

105
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,856
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

106
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,777
Thank you for saving us!

107
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,113
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

108
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,676
Treat the wounds
and prepare some food to eat.

109
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,845
Yes, Your Highness.

110
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,937
All done.

111
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,815
Here.

112
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,707
-Don't use your right hand for a while.
-Okay. Thank you.

113
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,216
Is that all there is
for the people to eat?

114
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,221
Even that is difficult to obtain.

115
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,266
It was hard enough with the war,
but they were taxed hard, too.

116
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,893
How could they have food?

117
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,520
I heard they ate anything living,
even insects.

118
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,485
Your Highness.

119
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,073
Bring those children to me.

120
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:56,992
Your Royal Highness.

121
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,498
You kids!

122
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,458
Come here.

123
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,377
Get over here!

124
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,761
Your Royal Highness.

125
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,141
We deserve to be killed for what we did.

126
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,197
What is this?

127
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,657
It's food.

128
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,257
Now, go on and play.

129
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,976
Give this to them.

130
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,854
-Your Royal Highness.
-I am fine.

131
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,313
I am sick of it anyway.

132
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,573
Everyone, gather round.

133
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,740
Gather round.

134
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,202
This is from the Crown Prince.

135
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,912
What is this?

136
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,081
It's meat.

137
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,333
-Meat? This is meat?
-Meat?

138
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,543
This is meat!

139
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,461
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

140
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,173
-It's meat!
-It really is meat.

141
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,799
How do we eat this?

142
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,719
-Make some soup with this.
-Is this really meat?

143
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,653
Look! It got bigger!

144
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,080
They are happy with the food.

145
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,667
What will you do now?

146
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,794
I will go to Lord Ahn Hyeon in Sangju.

147
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,054
What is it?

148
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,555
I am from Sangju.

149
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,768
If you wish to go to Sangju,
I will be your guide.

150
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,811
How can we trust you?

151
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,022
Who are you, exactly?

152
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,025
I'm merely one of the people.

153
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,028
Then how do you know how to shoot a gun?

154
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,032
I learned while serving in the war.

155
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,118
You shot a monster right in the forehead
as it charged at you.

156
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,164
Your skills are better than most soldiers.

157
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,625
Who are you?

158
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,734
What is it? Are they the ones
who attacked us yesterday?

159
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,945
-What do we do?
-It must be them!

160
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,870
Traitor Lee Chang, the Crown Prince,
must hear this!

161
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,377
"The criminal, who must be transferred
to Hanyang for investigation,

162
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,674
defied the King's command
and killed the commander of the Royal Army

163
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,634
who came to arrest him.

164
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,094
This crime...

165
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,724
committed by the Crown Prince,
who must uphold the nation's laws,

166
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,686
is an unforgivable act of treason!

167
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,189
The traitor who defied the King's command

168
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,360
must come out voluntarily and be bound!

169
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,698
If you don't come out voluntarily
right this instant,

170
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,368
it will be considered a defiance
against the King's command,

171
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,538
and thus, you will be punished
severely by the law!"

172
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,123
What is he talking about?

173
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,167
Did they just say he is a traitor?

174
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,879
They must be seriously mistaken.

175
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,758
-Right.
-You should go and talk to them.

176
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,636
Your Royal Highness, let me handle it.

177
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,181
Chief!

178
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,183
I, the Crown Prince's guard,
will come out!

179
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,955
Your Majesty's son

180
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,752
killed my son.

181
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,089
I will do the same to him.

182
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,301
No.

183
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,304
I will be merciless

184
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,183
and kill him brutally.

185
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,030
Your Royal Highness!

186
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,888
Your Royal Highness! It's dangerous! Run!

187
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,307
Your Royal Highness!

188
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,977
You must flee!

189
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,019
Your Royal Highness!

190
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,329
Your Royal Highness. Are you okay?

191
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,048
It's my fault.

192
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,551
-Because of me...
-That is correct.

193
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,511
-This is all because of you.
-Shut up!

194
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,889
If we are to survive, you must step up!

195
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,182
-Shut up!
-Otherwise,

196
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,808
we will all die!

197
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,582
They have a gun!

198
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,104
Gun squad, come with me.

199
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,273
The rest of you, stand guard.

200
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,452
They have one gun.

201
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,330
-Have them march in.
-Yes, sir.

202
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,651
At the entrance.

203
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,115
Search the area!

204
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,700
He has been shot.

205
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,872
That way!

206
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,836
Now!

207
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,170
Come on out!

208
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,341
It's dangerous for you to stay.

209
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,010
Go to Yangsan before the sun sets. Hurry!

210
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,660
To the south.

211
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,879
To the west!

212
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,526
We were fooled.

213
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,446
It was the guard.

214
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,200
He knew our signals and led us astray.

215
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,847
Bring the horses. We must chase them.

216
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,889
It's too late.

217
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,725
No need to rush.

218
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,185
Won't you chase them?

219
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,855
There is no need.

220
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,567
I know where they are heading to.

221
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,285
SANGJU, AHN HYEON

222
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,794
-Report it.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,839
The signal fire has been lit!

224
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,678
HANYANG

225
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,849
The signal fire...

226
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,767
The signal fire has been lit.

227
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,608
I heard that the signal fire is lit.
Will there be a war?

228
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,401
Did Japan invade again?

229
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,612
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

230
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,363
We must gather the troops.

231
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,325
We must act before they march into Hanyang
like last time.

232
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,452
I must see His Majesty.

233
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,371
What do you mean?

234
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,416
The signal fire is burning high
up on Cheoncheonryeong.

235
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,460
Our nation is in peril.

236
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,378
We cannot waste a single second.

237
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,255
I'll go to the King's palace.

238
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,424
But...

239
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,218
I agree with Chief Scholar.

240
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,929
I must see His Majesty as well.

241
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,263
But...

242
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,890
Minister, where are you going?

243
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,600
He is going to the King's palace.

244
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,560
-The King's palace?
-Yes.

245
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,189
My lord, wait for us.

246
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,989
Step aside.

247
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,950
I must speak with His Majesty.

248
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,202
We were ordered not to let outsiders in.

249
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,995
How dare you!

250
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,289
Do you not know who we are?

251
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,084
Step back!

252
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,462
How dare you draw your sword at us?

253
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,297
Step aside!

254
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,635
How dare you!
Are you that desperate to see His Majesty?

255
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,013
My lord, I tried to stop them.

256
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,848
You should see His Majesty.

257
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,477
You all are core officials
who lead this nation.

258
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,895
Step aside.

259
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,482
Let us go see His Majesty together.

260
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,685
What do you think you are doing?

261
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,693
Your Majesty,
the signal fire has been lit.

262
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,654
We must see His Majesty
and fix the situation.

263
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,698
Please withdraw your command.

264
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,619
Even if it's an emergency,

265
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,622
how could you barge in like this
when His Majesty is gravely ill?

266
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,083
Please step aside.

267
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,671
We cannot hide
His Majesty's illness any longer.

268
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,839
Father!

269
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,260
Why are you doing this?

270
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,388
We shall go inside.

271
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,015
What are you doing?

272
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,100
Show them out!

273
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,938
Step aside.

274
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,319
Announce us.

275
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,451
Your Majesty, Chief State Councillor
is here to see you.

276
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,207
The sun will set soon.

277
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,240
I think His Majesty is asleep.

278
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,373
His Majesty will wake up soon.
Have a seat.

279
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,046
Come this way.

280
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,343
You have not seen him in a while.
You should see him up close.

281
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,726
Raise the blinds.

282
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:09,250
Do you know why the signal fire
has been lit from the south?

283
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,003
It's neither due to an invasion
nor a war.

284
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,006
A disease has spread.

285
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,466
It's a scary disease
that makes one sleep

286
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,636
when the sun rises and crave
the flesh and blood of living people

287
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,681
when the sun sets.

288
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,635
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

289
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,805
-Please be healthy and live a long life!
-Please be healthy and live a long life!

290
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,580
Look carefully.

291
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,792
This is the King of Joseon,

292
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,295
the father of the tens
of thousands of subjects of the land.

293
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,801
Is this why court ladies' corpses
are carried out daily?

294
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,761
Is it all because of this disease?

295
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,721
What if I say it's?

296
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,809
If he lost his mind due to an illness
and craved human flesh,

297
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,978
is he no longer the King?

298
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,065
If he is not the King, who is he?

299
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,276
He is alive, as you can see.

300
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,736
Do you deny that he is the King?

301
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,701
Is that why you lured
the Crown Prince and scholars

302
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,162
and schemed rebellion

303
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,291
to steal the King's throne?

304
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,130
Lord Cho, what do you...

305
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,761
Although His Majesty
contracted a grave disease,

306
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,806
he is still the King of Joseon

307
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,183
and the lord of the people.

308
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,271
For rebelling against His Majesty
and coveting the throne,

309
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,189
your family should be annihilated.

310
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,526
Arrest Chief Scholar Kim Sun immediately
and behead him.

311
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,862
As for Prince Lee Chang,
who fled to the south,

312
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,114
he shall be deposed

313
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,451
and poisoned to death.

314
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,957
Palace guards, take the criminal Kim Sun
to the Royal Investigation Bureau!

315
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,179
We will begin Chief Scholar Kim Sun's
interrogation!

316
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,730
Since when did you plan all of this?

317
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,487
You should have discussed it with me
if you planned to do something like this.

318
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,243
I may be your daughter,

319
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,412
but I'm the mother of this nation.

320
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,846
I will kill them all.

321
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,681
Every single one of them.

322
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,271
I will kill the Crown Prince, who killed
my son, and everyone who follows him

323
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,483
without any mercy.

324
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,236
I will not forgive anyone

325
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,114
who gets in my way.

326
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,075
So,

327
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,579
don't dare to stop me...

328
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,123
ever again.

329
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,752
I did not put you where you are now

330
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,507
so that you can get in my way.

331
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,429
Give birth to a son.

332
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,224
It has to be a son.

333
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,979
That is what you must do.

334
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,857
Don't worry, Father.

335
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,527
