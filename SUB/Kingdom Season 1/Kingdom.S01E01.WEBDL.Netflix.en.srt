1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,808
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS

2
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,301
You must never...

3
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,887
look inside His Majesty's bedchamber.

4
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,597
Do you understand?

5
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
Yes, my lord.

6
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,981
THE KING IS DEAD. A NEW WIND WILL BLOW.

7
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,949
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

8
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,994
Over 100 of the same notice were posted

9
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,829
all over Hanyang last night.

10
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,665
His Majesty, who is very much alive,

11
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,417
has perished?

12
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,052
Capture everyone who posted these,

13
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,428
wrote these,

14
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,971
or gave instructions to write these.

15
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,182
Bring in every single one of them.

16
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,393
I shall annihilate their entire families.

17
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,024
The same goes for...

18
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,404
those who did nothing
while these notices went up

19
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,906
throughout the capital.

20
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,242
My lord, please spare my life.

21
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,160
My lord, please!

22
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,995
Forgive me, my lord.

23
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,705
-Please, my lord!
-My lord!

24
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,249
Please spare my life!

25
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,260
The Haewon Cho Clan
is rounding up young scholars.

26
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,932
Goodness. Oh, my! What are you doing?

27
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,268
No! Gyeong-seok!

28
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,186
Gyeong-seok! Goodness!

29
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,272
Gyeong-seok!

30
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,155
Arrest them!

31
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,457
Ten days have passed
since His Majesty fell ill with smallpox.

32
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,502
The only two people who had seen
His Majesty during the past ten days

33
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,505
are Chief State Councilor Cho Hak-ju
and his daughter, the second Queen.

34
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,383
No wonder those terrible rumors

35
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,844
of His Majesty passing away have spread.

36
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,529
Halt!

37
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:15,953
We received a report that 89 scholars
from institutions near Hanyang

38
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,581
worked together to post
these heinous notices.

39
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,249
Confess!

40
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,670
The first to confess
will have his life spared!

41
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,257
Who are the real traitors of this nation?

42
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,219
Through the spoils system and extortion,

43
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,266
the evil family of the Queen
is busy feeding themselves.

44
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,435
The traitors?

45
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,731
Look to the Haewon Cho Clan!

46
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,150
How dare you! Shut your mouth!

47
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,444
Those of the Haewon Cho Clan
are but insects

48
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,822
that are sucking the blood of the people.

49
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,535
How do they differ from swine
that eat feces?

50
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,579
Perhaps it is better
for His Majesty to be dead.

51
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,916
He is a feeble king who handed the nation

52
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,878
over to Lord Cho Hak-ju,
the head of those swine!

53
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,129
How dare you!

54
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,050
Did you say it is better
for His Majesty to be dead?

55
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,427
Do you admit to treason?

56
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,402
Then to whom are you referring
by "new wind"?

57
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,030
Who is the new king you wish to serve?

58
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,285
Is it the Crown Prince?

59
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,413
TONGMYEONGJEON

60
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,862
Your Royal Highness.

61
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,865
You have been at my chambers for days

62
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,492
even though I am not fit to move.

63
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,787
Father has been ill for ten days,

64
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,915
but there is nothing I can do for him.

65
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,461
It devastates me that I cannot fulfill
my duties as his son.

66
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,257
Please permit me to enter
the King's palace

67
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,760
and to stay by Father's side.

68
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,471
Your father is lying ill from smallpox.

69
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,391
If you catch it from him and fall ill
while looking after His Majesty,

70
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,769
who will lead this nation?

71
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,605
As a senior member of the royal family,
I can never permit it,

72
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,565
so please leave.

73
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,903
Then just tell me this.

74
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,157
Is Father...

75
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,409
truly alive?

76
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,673
You may have learned
how to be filial toward your father,

77
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,842
but not toward your mother.

78
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,554
How could you be so disobedient
to me in front of the servants?

79
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,723
Do you hate me that much?

80
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:28,104
Or is that hatred more toward...

81
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,899
your unborn sibling?

82
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,277
Your Majesty, how dare I...

83
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,487
If that is not the case,

84
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,490
please head back.

85
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,203
What are you waiting for?
Escort the Crown Prince.

86
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,898
I must see my father.

87
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,401
I will go to the King's palace.

88
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,990
Your Royal Highness, have you forgotten?

89
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,077
The Queen ordered that Your Royal Highness
be kept out of the King's palace.

90
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,078
Step aside.

91
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,706
I said to step aside!

92
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,418
Please be understanding.

93
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,503
Whom do you serve?

94
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,048
Whom do you consider
the King of this nation?

95
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,801
Is it my father or the Haewon Cho Clan?

96
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,013
Is there anyone in the entire palace

97
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,892
who does not follow the orders
of the Haewon Cho Clan?

98
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,643
Your Royal Highness.

99
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,480
-Please be understanding!
-Please be understanding!

100
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,153
Call Mu-yeong.

101
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,930
Your Royal Highness.

102
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,866
Why would you throw something
worth more than my year's salary?

103
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,704
If a tantrum is what you wanted to throw,

104
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,916
you should have aimed it at the Queen.

105
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,418
The greatest virtue a crown prince
must pursue is filial piety.

106
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,630
I cannot ignore the virtue
and risk being deposed.

107
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,424
The wench may be barely of age,

108
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,802
but she is my mother nonetheless.

109
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,928
I see.

110
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,681
Your Royal Highness
is a truly devoted son.

111
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,432
I have a job for you.

112
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,939
Is it...

113
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,194
Is it to go to the King's palace
and see His Majesty?

114
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,114
Bring me the journal
kept at the Royal Infirmary.

115
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,742
The palace guards keep an eye
on the journal day and night.

116
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,703
How can I possibly obtain it?

117
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,123
The pears from Naju,
the pomegranates from Gochang,

118
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,084
and the ginger sweets
prepared with care by the Royal Kitchen...

119
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,589
Did you forget all that you stole from me?

120
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,923
Your Royal Highness.

121
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,592
Think of your wife, who supported you

122
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,427
until you finally passed
the state examination

123
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,803
at the age of 40.

124
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,017
You stole from my dessert table
in order to bring them to your kind wife

125
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,019
who finally got pregnant

126
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,979
after ten years of marriage, did you not?

127
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,189
Your Royal Highness,
you know of my situation.

128
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,484
How long are you planning to use that
against me?

129
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,614
If they find out
that you stole from my dessert table,

130
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,116
you will be fired.

131
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,119
I will be so if I get caught
stealing the journal.

132
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,579
I see.

133
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,833
I hear tonight's dessert table
will have beef pancakes.

134
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,172
I guess I cannot force you.

135
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,849
If I try to sneak in before sunrise
when the guards change shifts,

136
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,019
I may be able to get the journal.

137
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,070
The guards will not be
as frosty before sunrise.

138
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,490
I may be able to get it
if I sneak in during the shift change.

139
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,586
His Majesty went missing?

140
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,171
Forgive me.

141
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,006
I only stepped away for a moment--

142
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,008
If you wish to live, you must find him.

143
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,342
Now!

144
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,058
Father is...

145
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,934
missing?

146
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,662
What are you doing here,
Your Royal Highness?

147
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,374
There was...

148
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,752
something monstrous in the hallway.

149
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,420
Something monstrous?

150
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,339
It sounded like a beast.

151
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,009
It smelled of blood and had a foul stench.

152
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,846
It was not human.
It had the shape of a monster.

153
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,932
That cannot be true.

154
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,309
A monster in the King's palace?

155
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,519
Your Royal Highness must be wrong.

156
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,271
You do not believe me?

157
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:35,108
Your Royal Highness must be weak
from having knelt in contrition for days.

158
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,486
Please return to your chambers

159
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,198
and have a physician check up on you.

160
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,618
Have His Royal Highness's attendants
escort him.

161
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,509
Did you find my father?

162
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,970
What do you mean?

163
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,516
His Majesty...

164
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,894
is lying in his bed at this very moment.

165
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,021
He is lying in his bed?

166
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,360
I shall simply check for myself then.

167
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,158
Your Royal Highness, please stop.

168
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,077
Father, it is Chang.

169
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,745
Please stop, Your Royal Highness.

170
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,122
-Open the door.
-No!

171
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,581
Open it at once!

172
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,339
You dare draw

173
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,009
your sword at me?

174
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,594
It is the Queen's orders.

175
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,972
I am only maintaining the laws
of the palace.

176
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,099
Can a mere commander of the Royal Army

177
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,144
shed the blood of the royal family?

178
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,857
If you can,

179
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,444
strike me.

180
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,709
Where is my father?

181
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,253
Why?

182
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,673
Are you concerned
about your father's safety?

183
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,300
I saw...

184
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,429
a hideous monster
inside the King's palace.

185
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,223
I saw one as well.

186
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,610
A son pretending
to be concerned about his father

187
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,906
when he secretly wishes
for his father to die

188
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,284
so that he can secure safety
and power for himself.

189
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,371
That is the monster I saw.

190
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,623
Not only that,

191
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,583
but I saw monsters

192
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,710
full of evil thoughts

193
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,881
who intend to use that son
to slay His Majesty

194
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,633
and take over this nation.

195
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,635
Those monsters' blood
is filling the courtyard

196
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,929
of the Royal Investigation Bureau.

197
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,808
Once that blood overflows,
the leader of the conspiracy,

198
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,064
the new king they wish to place
on the throne, will be identified.

199
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,441
When the time comes,

200
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,112
even a mere commander of the Royal Army

201
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,407
may shed the blood of the royal family.

202
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:35,038
Your Royal Highness may continue to wait,
but His Majesty will not return.

203
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:39,084
His illness subsided,
so he went to the Queen's palace.

204
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,712
Beom-il,

205
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,924
escort His Royal Highness out.

206
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,968
Yes, Father.

207
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,418
His Royal Highness
must have been startled.

208
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,628
Bring him some medicine
to calm his nerves.

209
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,812
Your Royal Highness.

210
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,316
Did you retrieve it?

211
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:45,859
Yes.

212
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,321
I almost got caught,
but I managed to sneak it out.

213
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,704
Father collapsed ten days ago,

214
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,498
at the end of the month.

215
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,172
"Chills, fever,

216
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,882
and a headache.

217
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,179
Administered the decoction for rashes
numerous times, but it was ineffective.

218
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,309
The fever is too high to be varicella.

219
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,104
The symptoms are severe.

220
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,108
There might not be a cure."

221
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,529
Your Royal Highness,

222
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,364
why are there no more entries?

223
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,615
This cannot be.

224
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,536
Those in the Royal Infirmary must write
an entry every day without fail.

225
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,706
Furthermore,
Father was in critical condition.

226
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,631
Unless they had to hide something

227
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,593
and intentionally omitted entries...

228
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,599
What is happening to my father right now

229
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,602
in his own palace?

230
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,522
Your Royal Highness.

231
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,527
Who is Physician Lee Seung-hui?

232
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,032
He was a royal physician,
but he resigned three years ago.

233
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,201
How do you know of him?

234
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,664
His name is written on the last entry
regarding His Majesty.

235
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,169
PHYSICIAN LEE SEUNG-HUI OF JIYULHEON
IN DONGNAE WAS CALLED INTO THE PALACE

236
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,883
I must go out in disguise.

237
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,720
Pardon? In disguise?

238
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,348
You cannot. Who knows
what the Queen will do to you--

239
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,350
She said not to enter the King's palace.

240
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,769
She did not forbid me
from leaving the palace.

241
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,271
Your Royal Highness!

242
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,856
Prepare to leave.

243
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,026
It will be just you and me.

244
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,737
Then what about...

245
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,323
the beef pancakes?

246
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,959
DONGNAE

247
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:14,549
JIYULHEON

248
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,733
Eat a little more.
You will recover faster that way.

249
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,485
I will have it later.

250
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,863
You call that food?

251
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,201
They will croak from starvation
before the disease kills them.

252
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,041
The government promised
to send us some rice soon,

253
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,751
so wait until then.

254
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,378
Like they would.

255
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,755
Dozens of people die every day

256
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,132
waiting for that rice.

257
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,930
You should rest.

258
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,826
What are you doing?

259
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,163
Those people will become sicker
if they do not eat that,

260
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,998
so watch what you say.

261
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,719
By the way,

262
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,721
when is that Physician Lee coming?

263
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,056
I told you he went to Hanyang.

264
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,183
So, when is he coming back?

265
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,686
I came all the way here
because I heard he was the best.

266
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,480
Your wound will heal quickly

267
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,317
if you shut your trap,

268
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,486
so be on your way.

269
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,614
What did you just...

270
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,701
What the...

271
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,914
What are you looking at?

272
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,762
The medicine is ineffective
since they cannot eat much.

273
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,472
This is bad.

274
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,058
-Physician Lee has returned!
-Hurry!

275
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,477
Physician Lee is back!

276
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,316
There he is!

277
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,383
Welcome back, Master.

278
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,390
What is that, Master?

279
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,732
Prepare for a funeral.

280
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,818
Pardon?

281
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,821
Whose funeral do you mean?

282
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,830
Over here.

283
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,584
Help me with this.

284
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,547
Let's open it.

285
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,931
-My gosh, Dan-i.
-It is Dan-i!

286
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,850
-Oh, my. Dan-i!
-My goodness.

287
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,393
-What happened?
-What happened to him?

288
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,647
-Oh, my.
-Dan-i...

289
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,566
What happened to Dan-i?

290
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,442
How could this happen to him?

291
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,239
Master!

292
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,159
Master, what happened? Please tell me!

293
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,454
What happened in Hanyang

294
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,208
that Dan-i returned
in such a gruesome state?

295
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,837
Please tell me, Master.

296
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,095
Nothing happened.

297
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,015
Nothing.

298
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,268
Nothing happened.

299
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,864
HANYANG

300
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,782
It says they will depose His Majesty,

301
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,660
have the Crown Prince take the throne,

302
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,372
and create a new world.

303
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,960
This is conclusive evidence of treason.

304
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,256
We must bring the Crown Prince
to the Royal Investigation Bureau

305
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,300
and interrogate him right away.

306
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:12,013
Where and how did you find the letter?

307
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,099
Someone reported that one of the scholars

308
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,977
who was arrested had this letter at home.

309
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,271
What a useful informant.

310
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,400
He knew every single one
of the 89 scholars who committed treason

311
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,695
and where the secret letter
that no one knew about was kept.

312
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,365
Who is this informant?

313
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,284
Why is that important?

314
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,541
None of the 89 scholars
admitted to the allegation of treason.

315
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,584
Yet,

316
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,630
you are accusing them of treason based on
the statement of that single informant.

317
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,883
This is an insult
to the Confucian scholars,

318
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,176
the foundation of this nation.

319
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:57,058
Are the Confucian scholars
really the foundation of this nation?

320
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,061
What did those Confucian scholars

321
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,606
ever do for this nation?

322
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,816
What are you saying?

323
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,445
Two disastrous wars

324
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,824
swept through this land.

325
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,952
Do you know...

326
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,539
why we were defeated so helplessly?

327
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,251
It is because weak Confucian scholars,

328
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,337
who only blabbed of the Analects
and Mencius

329
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,298
without taking any action,
led this nation.

330
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,135
The same holds true today.

331
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,887
You are completely out of line,
Chief State Councilor.

332
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,100
What do you think you are doing?

333
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,601
Can you not see?

334
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,563
Should I help you see it better?

335
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,901
Now do you see what it says?

336
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,487
It says they will tear down the King,

337
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,740
disturb the order,

338
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,118
and create chaos,
thus leading this nation to ruin.

339
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,911
After reading such a horrendous letter,

340
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,915
should the members of the Court
sit around and argue about

341
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:07,378
what should be done while doing nothing
as they did during those wars?

342
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,005
Lord Cho,

343
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,215
that is enough.

344
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,522
Arrest the Crown Prince and bring him
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

345
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,367
Where is the Crown Prince?

346
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,203
We do not know.

347
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,587
Give me the same answer again,
and you will lose your neck.

348
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,257
Where is the Crown Prince?

349
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,512
-I truly do not--
-If I may answer,

350
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,139
we have been searching for him all day,

351
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,725
but he is nowhere
within the Crown Prince's palace.

352
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,103
You saw for yourself, did you not?

353
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,190
Find the Crown Prince!

354
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,275
Search all over the palace and Hanyang

355
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,194
and drag him
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

356
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,947
The Crown Prince is no longer...

357
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,950
the heir to the throne.

358
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,661
He is a criminal who conspired treason.

359
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,023
Gosh.

360
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,155
Is anyone there?

361
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,911
It is taking a bath.

362
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,208
Is anyone there?

363
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,334
Sure, sure.

364
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,587
Are you Park Jong-yeong,

365
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,548
-an orderly at the Royal Infirmary?
-Yes, I am.

366
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,597
What brings
the Crown Prince's personal guard by?

367
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,141
I am looking for Physician Lee Seung-hui
from Dongnae.

368
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,809
He entered the palace

369
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,020
on the third of the month
when you were on duty.

370
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,190
I do not know his name,

371
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,526
but the physician from Dongnae
has left already.

372
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,778
The lad who came with him
got severely ill,

373
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,405
so they had to return.

374
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,617
Ask what his symptoms were like.

375
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,330
Why was the lad in critical condition?

376
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,207
Did he catch smallpox?

377
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,835
A dullard like me does not know for sure,

378
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,921
but it was not a disease.

379
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,089
He had deep wounds all over his body.

380
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:02,220
It looked as if he was bitten
by a huge beast.

381
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,273
Your Royal Highness, we must hurry.

382
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,984
We will get caught at this rate.
We must hurry back.

383
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,656
That way is south,
so Dongnae must be in that direction.

384
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,659
I need to know

385
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,037
what happened to my father
and to the royal family

386
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,665
of this nation.

387
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,166
What do you mean?

388
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,418
I must go to Dongnae.

389
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,087
To Dongnae?

390
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,464
Now?

391
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,054
Without eunuchs or court ladies
to serve you?

392
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,806
You and I alone?

393
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,182
We cannot.

394
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,600
I shall go.

395
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,603
Do you know how far it is
from Hanyang to Dongnae?

396
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,022
You almost vomited several times

397
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,066
on the way here from the palace

398
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,693
because of the stench.

399
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,861
How can you make it all the way to Dongnae

400
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,699
on such rough and difficult roads?
It is nearly 350km away.

401
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,494
My life until now has been more difficult
than that.

402
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,079
What about your meals?

403
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,916
You will not even get to see
the delicacies you enjoy in the palace.

404
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,084
I do not care.

405
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,420
We could encounter bandits or rioters.

406
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,297
They might kill us.

407
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,590
I will die anyway...

408
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,010
if I remain here.

409
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,137
Because of the allegation of treason?

410
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,724
Your Royal Highness,
even the Haewon Cho Clan

411
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,893
cannot harm you
for something you did not do.

412
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,605
I did it.

413
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,649
Pardon?

414
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,610
May I beg your pardon?

415
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,611
I...

416
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,531
conspired treason against Father.

417
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,035
Why?

418
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:51,996
How...

419
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,376
You are the Crown Prince.
The throne would have been yours anyway.

420
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,669
So why?

421
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,049
IT HAS ITS MEANING IN CREATING A NEW WORLD

422
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,848
LEE CHANG

423
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,030
Crown Prince...

424
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,491
That is correct.

425
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,660
I am the Crown Prince of this nation.

426
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,164
I am my father's only son,

427
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,459
but I shall die if the Queen
gives birth to a legitimate son.

428
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,712
I am but an illegitimate Crown Prince
born of a concubine.

429
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,174
That was why.

430
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,301
Because I wanted to live.

431
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,059
-Still--
-I still feel the same way.

432
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,106
Many scholars are dying at the Royal
Investigation Bureau to protect me.

433
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,274
The only way to save them and myself...

434
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,444
is in the south, in Dongnae.

435
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,031
I must go to Dongnae,
meet Physician Lee Seung-hui,

436
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,076
and find out

437
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,203
what happened to my father.

438
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,977
All I said was that he took the lad home

439
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,647
because he was in critical condition.

440
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,401
Forgive me, my lord!

441
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,610
I am sure

442
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,030
the Crown Prince went to Dongnae
in search of Physician Lee.

443
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,408
I told you before, did I not?

444
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,453
We should have silenced Lee Seung-hui
by killing him.

445
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,956
Physician Lee...

446
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,293
is still valuable to us.

447
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,335
However,

448
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,672
the Crown Prince is not.

449
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:20,352
Our messengers will not arrive
ahead of the Crown Prince.

450
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,398
You must go and stop him yourselves.

451
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,194
A cavalry of ten on speedy horses
will head out first,

452
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,239
and 50 competent soldiers
of the Royal Army shall follow.

453
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,366
You must stop him

454
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,410
before he reaches Dongnae

455
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,579
and Jiyulheon.

456
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,457
Even if it means you have to kill him.

457
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,294
HANYANG, DONGNAE

458
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:50,633
DONGNAE

459
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,316
I cannot stop thinking about...

460
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,070
the strange wounds

461
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,572
on Dan-i's body.

462
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,204
We shall go.

463
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,842
I see smoke from the chimney.

464
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,846
What is going on?

465
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,354
It has been so long since I last had meat.

466
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,490
I feel much better now.

467
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,785
-This is so good!
-Can I have another bowl?

468
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,415
This is so delicious.

469
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,292
-What is that?
-This is unbelievably delicious!

470
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,607
What is all this?

471
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,026
Is it not obvious?

472
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,404
The patients are starving to death,

473
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,907
but the physician is holed up in his room.

474
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,787
I needed food to live, so I hunted a deer.

475
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,080
A deer?

476
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,459
You found a deer in the mountains?

477
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,962
Did you get the government's permission?

478
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,798
Should we get permission to die too?

479
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,385
People here complain even if I bring food.

480
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,701
My lady.

481
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,664
I am sorry to ask,
but could I have some more?

482
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,958
My wife is trying to breastfeed the baby,
but is having trouble...

483
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,794
-Sure.
-Thank you.

484
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,860
It is all right. Do not cry.

485
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,958
What?

486
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,171
How could you do this?

487
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,174
-How could you?
-What are you talking about?

488
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,925
I saw it.

489
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,553
I saw it.

490
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,557
How could you do that to a person?

491
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,309
How could you...

492
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,520
He was like family to us.

493
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,147
Who cares what he was to you?

494
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,943
Once you die, you are nothing
but a slab of meat.

495
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,197
Are you out of your mind?

496
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,701
He was a person, just like us.

497
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,204
How can a person

498
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,749
-eat another person?
-So what?

499
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,545
Should we all just starve to death

500
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,257
arguing about what we ought to do
as human beings?

501
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,052
If everyone lived that way,

502
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,429
half the population of Dongnae
would have starved to death already.

503
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,014
What do you mean?

504
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,184
How do you think the people
in the south survived?

505
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,938
Do you think His Majesty saved them?

506
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,233
No. What saved them...

507
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,445
were the flesh and bones of neighbors
who starved to death.

508
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,117
That cannot be true.

509
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,037
You live as you wish to live.

510
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,874
I will do whatever I need to do
to stay alive.

511
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,045
It is delicious.

512
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,509
Jong-gu!

513
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,885
Are you all right?

514
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,428
What is it? What is wrong?

515
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,182
Jong-gu!

516
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,643
Jong-gu!

517
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,436
Jong-gu!

518
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,399
Jong-gu!

519
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,327
Jong-gu!

520
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,459
Jong-gu.

521
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,295
Jong-gu!

522
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,166
Master!

523
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,843
Mister.

524
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,637
Mister!

525
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,223
Mister, hold on.

526
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,145
Mister!

527
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,620
Do you have anything more to say?

528
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,496
