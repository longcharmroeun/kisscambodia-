1
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,850
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS

2
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,829
Your Royal Highness,

3
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,248
why are you discarding this?

4
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,166
After eating nothing but this for days,

5
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,752
the mere sight of it makes me sick.

6
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,090
Exactly.

7
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
Why did you do something so dangerous?

8
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,345
You are reckless.

9
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,472
You did not need
to put yourself through this.

10
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,059
I did not do it for my own sake.

11
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,895
If I am dethroned,

12
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,064
do you think
my personal guards will be safe?

13
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,109
Your kind wife will also likely be killed.

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,027
Exactly.

15
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,238
You shouldn't have schemed such a thing.

16
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,366
You speak way too damn much.

17
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,412
Someone so noble like Your Royal Highness
should not say "damn."

18
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,331
Where did you pick up such a term?

19
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,833
Where do you think?

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,545
You are the only person around me
who speaks that way.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,088
I see.

22
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,091
I must admit
that you are quite a fast learner--

23
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,970
I must have been too nice to you.
You just don't know when to stop.

24
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,391
Say one more word,
and I shall annihilate your entire family.

25
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,483
I only said it in jest.

26
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,320
Do not be angry.

27
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,448
How could you jest about
something like that?

28
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,410
How can the Crown Prince's personal guard

29
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,454
be so cowardly? You are useless.

30
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,372
How could I not be afraid

31
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,249
when the Crown Prince says

32
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,584
he would annihilate my family?

33
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,795
Does this amuse you?

34
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,633
What is so amusing about this?

35
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,977
Is this the right path?

36
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,189
They told us
to head to Geumjeong Mountain.

37
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,275
This is Geumjeong Mountain,
so we will get there soon.

38
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,027
You said that before.

39
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
If we do not arrive there
within 30 minutes,

40
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,699
I shall annihilate your family.

41
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,955
Your Royal Highness,
do you truly enjoy jesting about that?

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,831
I do.

43
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,420
Keep jesting about annihilating my family

44
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,048
if it amuses you, Your Royal Highness.

45
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,095
In return, please bestow me with
some seaweed from Gijang if we survive.

46
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,764
I hear that is the best
for pregnant women.

47
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,599
I would appreciate some beef, too.

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,603
It is very odd.

49
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,980
Pardon?

50
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,815
Your Royal Highness,

51
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,025
I left behind my pregnant wife
who is due any day now.

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,237
Is it that odd of me to ask for
some seaweed from Gijang?

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,530
That is not it.

54
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,824
It is too quiet around here.

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,494
I have not even heard an insect chirp
for a while now.

56
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,595
Your Royal Highness,

57
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,348
there is a house up ahead.

58
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,073
JIYULHEON

59
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,708
I think this is the place,

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,419
but it looks odd for a clinic.

61
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,671
What is the blackish red thing
on the stake?

62
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,341
Is that not blood?

63
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,512
Wait here, Your Royal Highness.

64
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,431
Your Royal Highness.

65
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,851
It is locked from the inside.
I shall climb over the wall.

66
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,168
Mu-yeong, are you there?

67
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,715
Is there a problem inside?

68
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,385
Mu-yeong!

69
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,555
Mu-yeong!

70
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,266
Mu-yeong!

71
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,204
I think something terrible happened

72
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,873
to the people here.

73
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,249
Where is Physician Lee Seung-hui?

74
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,293
We came all this way.

75
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,003
We must find him.

76
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,465
Is anyone there?

77
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,428
It is dangerous. Stay close to me,
Your Royal Highness.

78
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,226
Your Royal Highness!

79
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,810
Are you all right?

80
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,229
Are you hurt?

81
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,068
Pull!

82
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,163
-Why is it so heavy?
-There are several.

83
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,415
-What?
-Grab on!

84
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,376
One, two!

85
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,420
One, two!

86
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,547
One, two!

87
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,489
What brings a high military officer
all the way here from Hanyang?

88
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,160
I heard Physician Lee Seung-hui was good,
so I wanted him to examine my brother.

89
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,165
He looks fine, but he is not well.

90
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,093
My brother rushed out and forgot
his identification tag. Please understand.

91
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,595
I understand.

92
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,640
Did you see anyone suspicious

93
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,059
when you arrived here?

94
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,102
I only saw the corpses.

95
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,818
We found all the corpses
hidden under the deck of each building.

96
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,403
There are 48 in total.

97
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,030
Load them up on the wagon

98
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,282
-and take them to the magistrate's office.
-Yes, sir.

99
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,044
His corpse is not here.

100
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,295
Pardon?

101
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,798
Physician Lee's corpse is not here.

102
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,217
He must be alive.

103
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,888
Is it okay for me to be so happy?

104
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,724
How about a little peek?

105
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,520
Okay, everyone!

106
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,731
Here is to our newly appointed

107
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,235
Magistrate Cho Beom-pal

108
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,822
of the Haewon Cho Clan!

109
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,824
Let us drink to him!

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,785
-Thank you.
-Hold on!

111
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,704
Wait! Hold on!

112
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,918
-You must have drunk too much!
-Damn it!

113
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,261
Let me bow before the magistrate

114
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,264
-on this glorious day.
-Sounds great.

115
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,473
Sure!

116
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,934
May you live long and prosper!

117
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,149
My lord!

118
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,986
My lord!

119
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,989
-Something terrible happened.
-What?

120
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,578
How can I possibly believe you?

121
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,843
What is all this?

122
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,929
Are these all corpses?

123
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,514
They were found

124
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,850
in Jiyulheon on Geumjeong Mountain.

125
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,023
Not on my first day in office...

126
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,236
What about the culprit?
Do we know who did this?

127
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,238
There is a suspect.

128
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,074
A man named Yeong-sin,
who was being treated at the clinic,

129
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,577
has been gathering bamboo poles
from all around Dongnae

130
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,912
for the past few days.

131
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,247
-Did you say--
-Bamboo?

132
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,459
There were bamboo spears
on top of the walls of the clinic.

133
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,544
Bamboo spears? Why?

134
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,004
Probably to keep people out,

135
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,923
so they would not find the corpses.

136
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,009
I checked his identification tag,
and it belonged to a man

137
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,719
who died in a war three years ago.

138
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,598
That man is suspicious!

139
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,392
Rally up the troops and find him!

140
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,770
Hurry!

141
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,191
What is going on here?

142
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,029
How could something like this happen?

143
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,115
Please, my lord.

144
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,492
What have I done, my lord?

145
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,453
-I did not do anything.
-Talk to the magistrate, not me!

146
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,915
I'm not who you are looking for.

147
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,750
Please hear me out, my lord.

148
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,807
He is not whom you seek.

149
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,532
What happened?

150
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,660
They are searching for a man
named Yeong-sin, whom they suspect.

151
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,288
What about Physician Lee?

152
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,125
They are too focused on
finding the culprit to think about him.

153
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,509
Where are you going?

154
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,095
I cannot waste time waiting here.

155
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,681
I must find Physician Lee,

156
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,183
even if I must turn Dongnae upside down.

157
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,518
I agree, Your Royal Highness.

158
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,647
We must find that physician so that I can
return to my wife in Hanyang.

159
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,648
Any plan in mind?

160
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,109
Your Royal Highness just said

161
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,903
we shall turn Dongnae upside down.

162
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,364
Dongnae is tiny compared to Hanyang.

163
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,867
It cannot be that hard
to find the physician.

164
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,426
We are almost there.

165
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,470
We will separate into three groups.

166
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,140
If you see the Crown Prince,
take him to the magistrate's office.

167
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,112
GANGNYEONGJEON

168
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,802
Where is the covenant
with the Crown Prince's signature?

169
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,053
What do you mean?

170
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,724
Take that covenant to Lord Cho Hak-ju.

171
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,852
Then you can prevent any more deaths
of the scholars.

172
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,145
Have you lost your mind?

173
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,522
His Royal Highness abandoned us and fled.

174
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,482
We must find a way to survive.

175
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,652
That is enough.

176
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,448
Do you not know why Lord Cho Hak-ju,

177
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,284
who even went after the Crown Prince,
is leaving you alone?

178
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,787
He wants you to submit to him.

179
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,248
If you, the head of Sungkyunkwan,

180
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,376
bring all of the scholars
over to the Haewon Cho Clan,

181
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,504
he will at least spare the lives
of the scholars.

182
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,214
That is enough.

183
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,426
My lord, we do not know
when the Royal Army will storm in.

184
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,138
We must hand it over
before it is taken away.

185
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,681
That is the only way we can survive.

186
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,398
My lord, you have a guest.

187
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,653
Show the guest in.

188
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,831
What brings the head court lady
of the Crown Prince's palace here?

189
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,418
Come in.

190
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,256
A corpse was found in the King's palace?

191
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,759
I cannot believe it.

192
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,427
How could that be possible?

193
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,429
I feel the same.

194
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,808
Only royalty are permitted
to enter the backyard.

195
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,477
How did you get in?

196
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,898
After hearing that something strange
has been happening in the King's palace,

197
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,275
I risked my life to sneak in to see.

198
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,903
Please believe me.

199
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,199
How could I lie about something
that my life depends on?

200
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,577
I understand.

201
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,746
You may go.

202
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,342
This gives us hope.

203
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,391
If what she says is true,

204
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,394
that means something terrible
happened in the King's palace.

205
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,273
Lord Cho Hak-ju hid that from us.

206
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,860
If we find out what happened,

207
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,321
we may be able to destroy
the Haewon Cho Clan.

208
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:21,410
We may be able to save the scholars,
His Royal Highness, and ourselves.

209
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,251
DONGNAE

210
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,983
May I help you?

211
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,698
Are you Kim, the medicinal herb supplier?

212
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,409
I hear

213
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,122
you supplied medicinal herbs to Jiyulheon.

214
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,667
I know nothing about what happened.

215
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,629
No. We are here about something else.

216
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,382
We are looking for Physician Lee Seung-hui
for something important.

217
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,343
Do you know where he is?

218
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,222
All I did was supply herbs.
I do not know anything.

219
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,391
My apologies, but I am busy.

220
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,352
He is not done talking.

221
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,355
Do those of lowly birth not learn manners?

222
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
My elderly father

223
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,781
has not eaten all day
because of all the fuss.

224
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,867
I shall at least bring him some water.

225
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,828
If you wish to flog me, go ahead.

226
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,789
I am going to draw water.

227
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,592
Sorry. My colleague is like that
because he was spoiled as a child.

228
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,386
Please be understanding,

229
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,888
and tell me if you know anything.

230
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,307
I will compensate you generously.

231
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,893
I told you already.

232
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,438
I have not seen him in months.

233
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,945
Anything will do.
Please tell me something.

234
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,033
It is for an important matter.

235
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,494
I will not notify the government.

236
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,581
Yesterday,

237
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,879
Seo-bi, a physician at Jiyulheon,
came to see me.

238
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,049
There is a survivor from Jiyulheon?

239
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,053
Where is she now?

240
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,931
I do not know,

241
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,600
but she probably went to Frozen Valley.

242
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,477
She came to me

243
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,606
and asked all about
the resurrection plant that grows there.

244
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,151
People say it can bring the dead
back to life.

245
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,069
She was so out of it.

246
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,989
She did not seem normal.

247
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,075
What did you say?

248
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,119
A plant that brings the dead back to life?

249
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,162
Yes.

250
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,540
But there is no such thing in this world.

251
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,209
Where is this "Frozen Valley"?

252
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,089
It is called "Frozen Valley"
since it is so cold there

253
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,799
that the water stays frozen
all year round.

254
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,094
I heard it was in Gomi Mountain,
on the north side of Dongnae.

255
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,233
Stay here, Your Royal Highness.
I shall go by myself.

256
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,612
No. I'm scared to be left alone.

257
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,709
It already feels like winter here.

258
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,588
Your Royal Highness, stay behind me.

259
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,925
Your Royal Highness!

260
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,862
Your Royal Highness, it's dangerous.

261
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,804
That is what the dead female physicians
at Jiyulheon were wearing.

262
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,775
Are you Seo-bi,
the physician from Jiyulheon?

263
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,240
Come out.

264
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,288
It is okay. Come out.

265
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,647
Where is Physician Lee Seung-hui?

266
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,653
We came all the way from Hanyang
in search for him.

267
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,238
Where is he?

268
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,116
Physician Lee

269
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,705
could not avoid the disaster.

270
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,999
What do you mean?

271
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,168
Is he dead?

272
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,216
It is...

273
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,177
all because of...

274
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,096
the resurrection plant.

275
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,100
He said that the plant

276
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:25,148
caused everything that happened
in Hanyang and at Jiyulheon.

277
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,359
What do you mean?

278
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,945
Are you saying the deaths at Jiyulheon

279
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,280
are related to what happened in Hanyang?

280
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,204
How did you know
that the people died at Jiyulheon?

281
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,625
Did you see them?

282
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,586
Yes.

283
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,925
They took the corpses to the magistrate's
office to investigate the incident.

284
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,556
Did you move them out of Jiyulheon?

285
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,725
No.

286
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,063
No. Those people are not dead.

287
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,440
It must be stopped.

288
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,949
Damn it!

289
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,117
Who are you?

290
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,869
Stop!

291
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,166
I asked who you were!

292
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,418
Where are they?

293
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,919
Where did they go?

294
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,296
Why you...

295
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,214
Where are the people

296
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,550
who were here?

297
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,399
What happened?

298
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,820
It looks like a beast mauled her,

299
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,449
but the size of the bite marks
is too small

300
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,451
to be those of a tiger or a wolf.

301
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,164
Then was it a fox?

302
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,416
No.

303
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,837
They do not look like
an animal's bite marks.

304
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,550
They match bite marks of a human being.

305
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,053
What? Of a human being?

306
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,222
What? That is absurd.

307
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,184
How could a person bite
another person to death?

308
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,854
Out of my way!

309
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,105
Move!

310
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,365
You cannot leave them here!
You must lock them up!

311
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,285
Who are you to create a ruckus
at the magistrate's office?

312
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,037
I am the man

313
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,081
you were looking for.

314
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,792
I saw everything!

315
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,335
These people are not dead!

316
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,128
He looks like the man we seek.

317
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,088
What?

318
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,839
He is the culprit.

319
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,174
What?

320
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,051
What are you doing? Arrest him!

321
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,108
These people are not dead!

322
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,819
They will soon wake up and attack people!

323
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,029
Please believe me!

324
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,573
Why are you not arresting that lunatic?

325
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,825
Arrest him now!

326
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,747
Oh, my. The corpses will catch on fire.

327
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,060
No!

328
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,827
Where do you think you are going?

329
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,873
There is no time. They will wake up soon.

330
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,791
This wench is insane.

331
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,626
The dead will wake up?

332
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,920
No. It is all true.

333
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,297
What were you saying?

334
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,633
You said that the plant caused something
in Hanyang and at Jiyulheon.

335
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,388
My master said he saved a dead man
in Hanyang with the resurrection plant.

336
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,433
The exact same thing happened
at Jiyulheon.

337
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,728
The dead people came back to life
as monsters.

338
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,772
We must go and stop them!

339
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,858
What were those people who died
and came back to life like?

340
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,487
Did they have a stench
and make sounds of a beast?

341
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,282
That is correct.

342
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,661
Do you have evidence
to prove what you claim?

343
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,916
Physician Lee's journals are kept
in the medicine shed at Jiyulheon.

344
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,043
Everything is written there.

345
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,961
He said if we find the resurrection plant,

346
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,714
we can figure out how to cure the disease.

347
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,175
I came here to find a cure for them.

348
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,510
Please believe me.

349
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,594
I do not have time.

350
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,181
We must go before the sun sets
and prevent any further deaths.

351
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,559
I will go to Jiyulheon.

352
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,354
Go to the magistrate's office with her
and confirm her assertions.

353
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,940
No. How could you believe
a crazy wench and--

354
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,316
It is a grave matter.

355
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,528
Go and confirm whether it is true or not.

356
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,662
Lead the way.

357
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,627
Is this what you came for?

358
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,842
All the way here to Dongnae?

359
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,680
This is His Majesty's command.

360
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:24,734
"Upon interrogating the 89 scholars
who distributed propaganda,

361
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,779
it was uncovered that the mastermind

362
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,199
behind it all was the Crown Prince.

363
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,202
Bring the Crown Prince
to the Royal Investigation Bureau

364
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,870
and get the whole account

365
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,333
of the conspiracy."

366
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,257
I shall obey His Majesty's command
and take you to Hanyang.

367
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,260
I will not bind you
since you are the Crown Prince

368
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,845
of this nation, after all.

369
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,432
Please follow me quietly.

370
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,937
His Majesty's command...

371
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,900
Does this nation truly have a King?

372
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,945
What do you mean?

373
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,739
Why did you call Physician Lee Seung-hui
to Hanyang?

374
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,368
He is the best at treating smallpox.

375
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,828
Then what did he use

376
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,913
the resurrection plant for?

377
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,418
Did my father pass away?

378
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,882
Of course he did not, Your Royal Highness.

379
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,718
His Majesty is...

380
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,554
still alive.

381
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,809
To tell you the truth, his mental capacity
is not exactly there.

382
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:45,023
However, he will be fine
until the Queen gives birth.

383
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,445
Do you want it that badly?

384
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,034
Do you want to covet power that badly?

385
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,538
Is that why you committed acts that
someone who serves the King must not do?

386
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,208
Do you want it that badly?

387
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,796
What have you done, Your Royal Highness?

388
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,967
You were only lucky to be born
as the son of the King.

389
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,762
You have done nothing.

390
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,475
And yet, you always looked
at my father and me

391
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,730
with that look you have now.

392
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,151
As if you were saying, "I am different

393
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,779
from you disgusting insects."

394
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,074
You are correct.

395
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,700
You are insects.

396
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,953
You scorned the King and the royal family.

397
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,664
You brought misery upon the people!

398
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,460
That is what you,
the Haewon Cho Clan, have done.

399
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,677
You told me to strike you, did you not?

400
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,556
I shall grant your wish today.

401
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,608
You said I was simply lucky?

402
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,443
No.

403
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,862
I was chosen.

404
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,950
With the power bestowed upon me
by my father,

405
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,910
I shall...

406
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,288
punish you.

407
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,127
You cannot kill a person with that sword.

408
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,077
You should not have been born
as the Crown Prince.

409
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,303
Confess right now!

410
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,598
-Why did you kill those people?
-Say something!

411
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,892
How many times must I tell you?

412
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,895
They are monsters. They do not die.

413
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,816
We must all flee before the sun sets.

414
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,235
He has lost his mind.

415
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,195
Strike him again!

416
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,082
Excuse me.

417
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,669
My lord!

418
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,296
Please let me in!

419
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,298
I am a physician at Jiyulheon!

420
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,971
Send her in!

421
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,102
What he speaks is the truth.

422
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,354
These people are not dead.

423
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,108
Once the sun sets,
they will rise and maul people to death.

424
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,777
You must lock them up right away.

425
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,700
Have they lost their minds?

426
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,368
Please believe me.

427
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,245
You must lock them up quickly.

428
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,332
Otherwise, all the people in Dongnae
will be put in danger.

429
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,551
You must flee. Hurry!

430
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,354
Imprison those lunatics
right this instant!

431
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,438
Lock them up!

432
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,692
My lord. My lord!
You must evacuate the people!

433
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,487
You must flee right now!

434
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,573
Flee! You must flee!

435
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,493
-Why that...
-Run!

436
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,952
She is so loud.

437
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,748
Why would we flee from the corpses?

438
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,008
It moved.

439
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,279
The royal physician was correct.

440
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,281
His Majesty...

441
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,117
has passed away.

442
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,206
Passed away? What are you saying?

443
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,042
His Majesty is alive.

444
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,803
One month from now...

445
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,184
Until the Queen gives birth to a prince,

446
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,937
he has to stay alive.

447
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,191
-Lord Cho.
-Why are you hesitating?

448
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,361
It is the physician's duty
to save the King.

449
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,617
All you must do is do your duty.

450
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,413
Do not fear anything.

451
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,167
Just do what you did

452
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,338
three years ago.

453
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,299
It moved!

454
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,926
What did?

455
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,120
Hey!

456
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,457
Hey, try lifting that up!

457
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,043
Go on!

458
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,063
-What...
-Why that...

459
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,898
Just use your hand.

460
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,734
Be a man! Why are you such a coward?

461
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,852
What is that...

462
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,863
-The corpse is...
-Honey!

463
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,323
Honey!

464
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,867
Let me go! That is my wife!

465
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,118
She is my wife!

466
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,871
Honey! Darling!

467
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,082
Honey.

468
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,376
Darling! Darling...

469
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,345
