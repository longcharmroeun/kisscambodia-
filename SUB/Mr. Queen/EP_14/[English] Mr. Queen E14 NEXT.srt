1
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:08,283
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:10,513
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:18,852
There are so many things I owe you.

4
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,933
I kept thinking of you...

5
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:27,602
when I tried to leave this place.

6
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,003
Because I will never see you again.

7
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,603
ONE HOUR EARLIER

8
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:10,643
YONG SU POTATO

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:17,412
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

10
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:30,363
Yes. I wrote that.

11
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,402
Did you really write those?

12
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,003
It was not the Queen?

13
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,632
The Queen was at the banquet.

14
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,102
Then what is the reason you used...

15
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,912
wild grapes, pine needles,
and peaches for the appetizer?

16
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:49,143
That is because peaches are in season,

17
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,253
wild grapes will be in season soon,

18
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,352
and pine needles are always in season.

19
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,822
Man Bok.

20
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,692
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

21
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:16,342
The Queen wanted to hide the
fact that she helped you.

22
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,913
It is very late. You
should come back tomorrow.

23
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,252
You should go back to your residence.

24
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,853
I must find out why she helped me...

25
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:35,592
and what she meant when she
said she would betray me.

26
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:46,673
THE QUEEN

27
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:11,092
THE QUEEN IS IN DANGER.

28
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,203
When the day breaks, I
will report it to the King.

29
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,673
Will he be okay through the night?

30
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,413
Do not be in a rush. It might be a trap.

31
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:46,293
There are times when
you sleep like a baby.

32
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:51,133
I fell asleep without realizing it.

33
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:58,272
Have you been watching me?

34
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,242
Why do you always do that?

35
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:08,423
Worrying about me,
trying to understand me.

36
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:14,693
Come to think of it, you're the
first person I saw when I came here.

37
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,063
There are so many things I owe you.

38
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,243
I kept thinking of you...

39
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,873
when I tried to leave this place.

40
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:34,943
Because I will never see you again.

41
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,212
Hong Yeon.

42
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,123
You must be working out a lot.

43
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,092
You've bulked up so much...

44
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,143
This must be a dream.

45
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:11,712
Hong Yeon and the consorts
turned into him...

46
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,313
in my dream last time as well.

47
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:16,782
Are you up?

48
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,393
What is this? What is going on?

49
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:35,732
What is wrong? Who dared to
do something bad to My Queen?

50
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,732
You. You did something bad to me.

51
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,303
Why did her face blink
and change to you?

52
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:44,842
Pardon?

53
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,112
Be frank with me.

54
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:49,482
What happened between us last night?

55
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,712
How frank do you want me to be?

56
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,123
Don't leave anything out
and tell me everything.

57
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:00,152
My gosh. That is a strange request.

58
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:03,422
If that is what you want...

59
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:09,662
When the moon lit up
the dark sky last night,

60
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,833
our hands touched slightly, and
then there were fireworks...

61
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,602
Don't say anything. If you
say something, I'll kill you.

62
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,672
This...

63
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,672
This is just the beginning, My Queen.

64
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:22,482
My Queen.

65
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:24,482
My gosh.

66
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:29,982
It feels...

67
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:33,922
like I have been abandoned.

68
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:35,862
My gosh.

69
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:38,292
Head Eunuch.

70
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,703
Hong Yeon. Hong Yeon.

71
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:42,862
Where did you sleep last night?

72
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,833
I slept in my residence, Your Highness.

73
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:49,073
Did Cheoljong and I really...

74
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,373
EPISODE 14, A WOMAN
WHO MUST DIE TO LIVE

75
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,042
It was all a dream.

76
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,583
The portrait of the
late King was burning,

77
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,882
and it all seemed so realistic.

78
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,982
After what happened
to the fortune-teller,

79
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,923
I could not get my
fortune read properly.

80
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:44,033
Something seems ominous.

81
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:47,563
Court Lady Han. I need to
get my fortune read properly.

82
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,073
Your Highness. Doing that
will cause trouble again.

83
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,203
There is a monk that I know.

84
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,342
It will be okay since it does
not look suspicious to others.

85
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:06,953
When Avalokiteshvara was practicing
the profound Prajna Paramita,

86
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:10,053
he illuminated the five skandhas
and saw that they are all empty...

87
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,323
What do you see?

88
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:18,793
I see the Palace covered in red blood.

89
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,833
Red blood?

90
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,732
Someone will die...

91
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,173
in the Palace today.

92
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,972
Who on earth is it?

93
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:32,612
I do not know who it is,

94
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,752
but it will be a woman.

95
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:43,352
A woman?

96
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,163
Is it perhaps...

97
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,762
Will it be me?

98
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,092
Write me a talisman. One
that will protect me.

99
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,803
I am not a shaman.

100
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,203
There must be a way.

101
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:00,232
If you insist,

102
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,303
make an offering to Buddha.

103
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:07,142
Definately. I will give as
much offering as you want.

104
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,783
The woman that will die in the Palace...

105
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,453
must not be me.

106
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:18,793
Darn it!

107
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,063
I did not get to ask the Queen
what I wanted to ask her.

108
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,092
Gosh.

109
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,033
I will go back to Daejojeon Hall.

110
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,563
Your Majesty.

111
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,673
It is suspicious.

112
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,142
Including the fact that he
disappeared all of a sudden.

113
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,183
That is right.

114
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:46,752
I can draw a composite myself.

115
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:56,622
This is the one.

116
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,273
That is right. This is it.

117
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,673
It is getting clearer. That is right.

118
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,642
No! This is not right!

119
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:15,342
His face...

120
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:20,882
This is his face.

121
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,423
Special Director Hong.

122
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,793
Did you come all the
way here while crying?

123
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,073
There, there.

124
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,903
There, there.

125
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,173
Why did I not consider
that she might not like me?

126
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,913
Why did I spend so many
days debating over...

127
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,553
whether I should choose
love or my family?

128
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,823
The biggest obstacle in love...

129
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:58,023
is none other than...

130
00:11:58,023 --> 00:12:00,293
gaining the heart of
the person you love.

131
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:03,063
What is her reason?

132
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:04,732
She said...

133
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:06,992
I do not like you.

134
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,903
What?

135
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:10,803
Goodbye.

136
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:13,703
My Lady.

137
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,342
At least tell me why.

138
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,313
Why do you dislike me?

139
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:24,982
I...

140
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,283
do not like men with ambition.

141
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,653
There, there.

142
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:37,193
Gosh, how damp.

143
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:41,462
Love usually starts moist...

144
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:44,033
and ends in dampness like this.

145
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,642
- But...
- Gosh, you startled me.

146
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,203
There is good news too.

147
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,112
The King has gotten better,

148
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:54,712
so my prayers were answered.

149
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,083
I am sure you heard about
something else as well.

150
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:03,722
Lord Kim Jwa Geun will be
dismissed due to that incident.

151
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,762
I like the King, and I
respect Lord Kim as well.

152
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,563
My heart has been divided into two.

153
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,892
Why do you like him when you have
never met the King personally.

154
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,673
That is because he is your best friend.

155
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,602
You are a good person,

156
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,602
so your friend must
be a good person too.

157
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,673
My goodness, you.

158
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:32,752
Were you drawing an octopus?

159
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:35,553
What do you mean by
"octopus"? It is a person.

160
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:38,153
This is?

161
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:41,023
I drew it quite well if
you look into it in detail.

162
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,163
- This must be his eyes.
- That is his mouth.

163
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:50,002
- That is his mouth?
- Can you not see the lips?

164
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:58,943
It is best to get your
fortune read in the morning.

165
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,813
Queen Dowager, Her Highness is here.

166
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:09,252
Goodness.

167
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:13,992
Your face has become drawn overnight.

168
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:18,933
As if the King has yet to wake up.

169
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:22,063
What happened to the Queen?

170
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,232
I gave up on a bigger use of her...

171
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,703
and did as you asked.

172
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,212
I am certain that they found...

173
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:33,342
the object in her chamber.

174
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:37,712
The King spent the night in
the Queen's chamber last night.

175
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,982
As soon as he got well?

176
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:42,382
I came to realize once again
through this incident...

177
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:46,653
that if I lose the King, I will die.

178
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,492
Could the woman who will die today...

179
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,632
be perhaps...

180
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,462
I want to die.

181
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,433
Should I just kill myself?

182
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,502
I might feel better if I died.

183
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:37,813
I apologize, Your Highness. I apologize.

184
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:40,742
I denied everything,

185
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:43,043
but the King was filled with certainty.

186
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:45,612
What? What are you talking about?

187
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,183
What do you mean?

188
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,392
Do you smell something burning?

189
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:54,523
Who is it? Which one of you is it?

190
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:55,722
- Where are you going?
- Hold on.

191
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:59,362
Court Lady Choi.

192
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,732
I ended up...

193
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,703
telling him everything.

194
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,073
Is that so?

195
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,612
So let me get this straight.

196
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,012
The King came to me last night
after having a talk with you...

197
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:20,212
which caused this whole
mess. Is that right?

198
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,752
That is not what I said.

199
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,793
Then, the source of my
confusion right now...

200
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,563
is all your fault.

201
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:32,262
What? Why do you feel confused?

202
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,862
You...

203
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,673
It was definitely good.

204
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,203
Perhaps, it was better than before.

205
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:43,002
That's why it's driving me crazy!

206
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,313
Why did I like it? This
cannot be happening.

207
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:48,813
So the spirit doesn't rule the body?

208
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,012
Then, we don't rule our
body or mind at all?

209
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:53,083
Does it mean we are just
slaves to our hormones?

210
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,323
- Gosh.
- Your Highness.

211
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,852
- What is wrong with her?
- Your Highness.

212
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:02,992
What do you mean?

213
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:07,902
She is just being herself.

214
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:12,803
Why didn't it feel awful?

215
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,003
Why not?

216
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:20,213
Feel disgusted! Feel
awful. You should hate it!

217
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,342
Prepare for His Majesty's presence.

218
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,083
Where is My Queen?

219
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,152
Your Majesty, she is...

220
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,563
I am sorry. She was
here just a second ago.

221
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,563
Why is she going such
lengths to avoid me?

222
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,932
Like the tigress last night, she...

223
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,602
Roar!

224
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:55,213
Can you help me find My Queen?

225
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,743
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:59,013
As you can tell, I
have a lot to tell her.

227
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,152
I wonder what it is about.

228
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,632
No. If I see him right now,
I'd be in huge trouble.

229
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,963
What if my body betrays me again?

230
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,362
Yes.

231
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,473
I'm sure Kim So Yong's spirit
ruled over the body last night.

232
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,043
I only liked it because
it was Hong Yeon.

233
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:26,773
If I knew that it was him...

234
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,313
But I still like it.

235
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,213
I must be going crazy.

236
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:45,092
So is this how Jang Bong
Hwan will disappear forever?

237
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,833
Is that it?

238
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,033
I CAME HERE FOR
NOTHING. JANG BONG HWAN

239
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,973
- My Queen.
- Your Highness!

240
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:52,672
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

241
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:53,702
Darn it.

242
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,172
Your Highness.

243
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:58,942
Your Highness!

244
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:02,182
- Your Highness.
- My Queen.

245
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:04,483
My Queen.

246
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,723
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

247
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,622
Your Highness!

248
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:18,892
Your Highness!

249
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:22,003
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

250
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,073
Your Highness!

251
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:30,543
Lord Kim Jwa Geun is about
to lose his position...

252
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,973
because he made it clear that he
tried to assassinate the King.

253
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,313
My goodness.

254
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,283
The more I think about it,

255
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:40,283
the more I am convinced
that this is not his style.

256
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,652
He must have felt cornered.

257
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,892
Because of the explosion,

258
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,122
Lord Kim Jwa Geun lost everything.

259
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,993
On the other hand, the
King gained a lot from it.

260
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,233
Even so,

261
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,293
I doubt the King set up the
explosion, risking his own life.

262
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:56,902
Right.

263
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,973
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

264
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,442
- Are you heading to the conference?
- Yes.

265
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,243
May I ask why you are
here all by yourself?

266
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:10,283
My Queen...

267
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,452
- The Queen?
- The Queen?

268
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:19,452
Your Highness, are you
playing hide-and-seek?

269
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:22,162
- I am really good at that!
- Be quiet.

270
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,273
At last.

271
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,573
Darn it. Stop following me around!

272
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,442
Are you the CCTV camera?
Are you my stalker?

273
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,972
- Darn it.
- What?

274
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:39,171
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

275
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,243
- See you at the royal conference.
- Okay.

276
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,743
Let us discuss this step by step.

277
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,783
My Queen.

278
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:46,882
They are crazy in love.

279
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,882
- My Queen!
- They are playing hide-and-seek?

280
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,952
As if they are kids.

281
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:54,763
What? He is playing
hide-and-seek when he had...

282
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:56,862
a near-death experience?

283
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:02,333
Yes. I have the royal concubines.

284
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,202
We shared our love
through letters all night.

285
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:06,833
They are the guardian angels
of my sexual identity!

286
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,142
- Hello, Your Majesty.
- Hello, Your Majesty.

287
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,842
Hello.

288
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,412
Then, have a good day.

289
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:18,513
My Queen.

290
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:21,112
You are not allowed
to run in the palace.

291
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:24,592
I guess we do not have
a chance to join them.

292
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:26,823
I guess so.

293
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:30,862
By the way, they look so good together.

294
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,773
Fine. I'll get my sexual
identity back with the letters.

295
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:43,243
- My Queen.
- Your Majesty.

296
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:45,973
My Queen.

297
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,132
She is not here either.

298
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:14,333
I have been following her
because I had questions for her.

299
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:16,102
Questions?

300
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,442
I guess she feels
uncomfortable seeing me.

301
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,213
I should stop looking for her.

302
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,713
I hope she will let me know...

303
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:28,422
once she is ready to see me.

304
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:38,533
- Let us go to the royal conference.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

305
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,763
There you are.

306
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,773
You were all over the palace.

307
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:48,273
I have been looking
for you this morning.

308
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,102
What is this about?

309
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:56,112
There you are. Last night...

310
00:22:57,783 --> 00:22:59,182
Let us discuss this on the road.

311
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:00,852
We should go.

312
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:02,682
Go where?

313
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,823
Where are we going now?

314
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:09,793
This is a huge palace.

315
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:36,382
Is he gone?

316
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:41,392
What does he want to
ask me? What's going on?

317
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,463
In this situation, guys
usually ask the girls...

318
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,162
"Did you like it?"

319
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:00,713
To my usual recipient.

320
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:03,983
Yes, Your Highness.

321
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,882
Something feels off.

322
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,323
Court Lady Choi.

323
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,592
Yes, Your Highness.

324
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,963
By the way, why aren't
you nagging me these days?

325
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,963
"You cannot go out, looking
untidy, Your Highness."

326
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:19,833
You should nag me.

327
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:22,432
I decided to stop nagging.

328
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:24,202
What?

329
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,533
What a surprise.

330
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,773
- Okay. Go on.
- Yes, Your Highness.

331
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:34,713
I didn't see that coming.

332
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:59,122
As of today,

333
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:03,493
I declare the end of regency.

334
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:47,902
I hereby declare...

335
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,212
the beginning of my direct rule.

336
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:56,452
- Long live the King.
- Long live the King.

337
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,003
I will die soon at this rate.

338
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,402
This anger will kill me.

339
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,472
Shall I tell them that
you wish to skip the meal?

340
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:27,283
Do you actually want me to die soon?

341
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:28,912
My apologies.

342
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:30,882
But...

343
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:34,922
I am just not sure whether or not I
should let them bring in the food.

344
00:26:34,922 --> 00:26:38,023
If I let them, you will yell at me
and ask if it's for your funeral.

345
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,732
Must I give you instructions...

346
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:43,932
on how to handle every little...

347
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,132
Your Highness.

348
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:49,833
Please calm down.

349
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:55,912
How can I calm down right now?

350
00:26:56,142 --> 00:26:59,642
I have practically lost
all my political power.

351
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,753
I will help you regain your power.

352
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:06,982
I am certain that your
regency will be resumed.

353
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,553
You seem very confident.

354
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:12,622
Your father was like that
too, when he was young.

355
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:16,662
I gave him one last chance.

356
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:19,063
A chance to do what?

357
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:22,372
To figure out a way to
destroy the King's heart.

358
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:26,672
If he succeeds,

359
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:29,172
your priority should be
keeping your position safe.

360
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,243
Yes.

361
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:34,843
However, you will soon realize
that an old tool would not do.

362
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:39,152
You should not underestimate the King.

363
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:43,523
Do you truly think that the
King was behind the explosion?

364
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:47,392
The culprit is the person who
benefited the most from it.

365
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:50,662
I cannot believe that I let such a
brazen brat take over the throne.

366
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:00,273
Your Majesty, congratulations
on finally ending the regency.

367
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:02,942
Thank you.

368
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:07,412
A letter arrived for you
from the Daejojeon Hall...

369
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:09,182
while you were away.

370
00:28:10,113 --> 00:28:11,922
- From the Queen?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:21,593
The thought of telling
you that I miss you...

372
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,063
makes me miss you more.

373
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:28,202
Something must be done about this.

374
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:36,972
That was my last resort, and it worked.

375
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:38,712
So decisive.

376
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:40,912
Let us meet.

377
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:46,482
You are here...

378
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:49,053
to save me from this chaos...

379
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,392
Cheoljong?

380
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,122
How did you find me here?

381
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:55,293
I knew you'd be here because
I told you to meet me here.

382
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:57,962
- The consort told me to come here.
- Which consort?

383
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,632
I liked the thrill that anonymity gives,

384
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,363
so I didn't even bother to
find out which one it was.

385
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,303
Anyway, I know it's not you.

386
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,003
"I sometimes think of other things."

387
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:10,243
"I will be happy drowning to
death in the thought of you."

388
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:13,843
"Please row to me."

389
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:19,523
"Oh, I did not let you go."

390
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:21,583
- Stop.
- Do you get it now?

391
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:23,192
No.

392
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:25,263
What is that cheesy poem? I
have no idea what it's about.

393
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,422
"The name I will die calling!"

394
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:29,892
"It will linger in my mind
as I cannot forget it."

395
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:31,662
Enough. People can hear you.

396
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,503
Why does that matter? You
did not write this poem.

397
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:44,743
The King and I have to talk about
something. Give us some space.

398
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,882
You know what to do.

399
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:47,912
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

400
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:57,192
Have you been surveilling me?

401
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:58,962
Have you been inspecting my letters?

402
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:00,823
What are you talking about?

403
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:03,833
In your letters, you passionately
profess your love to me.

404
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,462
But you put on a straight
face when you see me.

405
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:07,833
You are unbelievably cold to me.

406
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:14,073
- Was it misdelivered?
- Was it misdelivered?

407
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:16,573
So those letters were not for me?

408
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,682
You were the one who caused
the new rush of hormones?

409
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,853
I was counting on you to
protect my sexual identity?

410
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,013
The one who made my heart
flutter every night...

411
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:27,523
was you?

412
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,853
No wonder I thought
you were so two-faced.

413
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:32,323
Why you?

414
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,222
Why is it you, every single time?

415
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:36,432
It's always you. I even
see you in my dreams!

416
00:30:37,162 --> 00:30:38,533
You had a dream about me?

417
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:42,603
Don't get all awkward. If you do,
you're practically admitting it.

418
00:30:42,902 --> 00:30:44,732
There are many types of dreams.

419
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:46,743
Some are awful nightmares
that make you shudder.

420
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:49,343
Why did you help me at the banquet?

421
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:53,712
Have you been following me
around to ask me that question?

422
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:56,783
I thought you'd thank
me. I regret helping you.

423
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,783
You told me to curse at you
if I'm happy to see you...

424
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:01,152
and provoke you when
I'm grateful to you.

425
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:03,523
Since when did you follow my advice?

426
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:05,422
Now, you are criticizing me
for following your advice?

427
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:08,063
What am I to do, then?

428
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,732
You always said "No touching"
but suddenly helped me.

429
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:13,202
Then you declared out of the
blue that you'd betray me.

430
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:15,232
That was...

431
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:18,273
Hold on.

432
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:22,343
You heard me when I said I'd betray you?

433
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:26,583
You said you'd lost your
hearing. Was that a lie?

434
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:28,813
Don't tell me...

435
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,682
Did you orchestrate the explosion too?

436
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,622
I did lose my hearing temporarily.

437
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,952
It just so happened to come
back when you were saying that.

438
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,392
Are you crazy? You nearly died!

439
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:43,162
My Queen.

440
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,593
Did you have to do
something so dangerous?

441
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:06,583
Hey, I told you that this isn't allowed.

442
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:09,523
Hugging me like this, smiling
at me, lying down beside me...

443
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:11,253
You're not allowed to do any of it.

444
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,732
You are not allowed to disallow me.

445
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:29,243
I like you.

446
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:35,482
Do you fall for women this quickly?

447
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:38,212
Just because we spent the night
together? Come on. Don't be so lame.

448
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:39,622
No, that is not why.

449
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:41,253
Then why do you like me?

450
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:45,722
You are arrogant, selfish,
and rough around the edges.

451
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:47,162
And you are never consistent.

452
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,093
You are full of flaws.

453
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:52,603
That's right. So don't like me.

454
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,533
But I still like you.

455
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:58,573
Even if you have more flaws
than anybody else in the world,

456
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:00,972
I still like you.

457
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:12,953
That night,

458
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,823
right before I jumped into this lake...

459
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:19,393
Do you remember what I said to you?

460
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,433
You must love me.

461
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,462
I believed that I was the only
one who could protect you.

462
00:33:28,462 --> 00:33:29,902
That's why I said that.

463
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:33,843
Because I thought I could
only help you if you loved me.

464
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:36,712
Because that was the only way
both you and I could live.

465
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:39,442
Was that the reason?

466
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:40,542
But you know what?

467
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:44,683
That Kim So Yong doesn't exist anymore.

468
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:47,982
That Kim So Yong died that night.

469
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,022
I do not wish to hurt you anymore.

470
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,332
There's no future for us...

471
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:02,573
because I can't forgive you.

472
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,902
I'm not Kim So Yong.

473
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:10,613
So I can't do this.

474
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:31,462
What brings you by? Does
the Queen need something?

475
00:34:32,502 --> 00:34:35,303
- Thank you for your help last time.
- "Last time"?

476
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,973
At the Royal Infirmary.

477
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,643
Oh, that. That happened because...

478
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:43,243
I told you to drink the water
infused with the poisonous herb.

479
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:47,513
Well, you did carry fire in one
hand and water in the other,

480
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,852
but I thought I should still
express my gratitude to you.

481
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:55,053
I found this on my way here.

482
00:34:57,093 --> 00:34:58,252
Wait.

483
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,232
Where did she find this exquisite thing?

484
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,942
The assassination of the King?

485
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:18,042
Why did you set up such a huge plot
without running it by us first?

486
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,882
Look at the predicament he is in now.

487
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:23,613
Lord Kim Jwa Geun must
be reaching his downfall.

488
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:35,393
I understand that you
were tempted by money,

489
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:36,792
but how dare you sell our weapons?

490
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,803
Are you trying to destroy our empire?

491
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,732
You clearly told me
there were no problems.

492
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:43,973
You wish to use people
to achieve your agendas.

493
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:45,973
And we need money to do so!

494
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,542
Are you telling me that
you did this for me?

495
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:52,812
I wanted to present only the results
and keep you out of the process.

496
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,243
And I did my best to do that!

497
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,212
I did that for you...

498
00:35:56,482 --> 00:36:00,183
and for our clan, my lord.

499
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:03,922
You had better be ready...

500
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:06,962
to take all the responsibility
in a worst-case scenario.

501
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,763
I will give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

502
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,143
- Is everyone here?
- My lord.

503
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:30,252
The Queen's father is not here yet.

504
00:36:31,582 --> 00:36:33,123
He was not invited.

505
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,993
We are here because of
the mistake he made.

506
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:39,522
He had been keeping books...

507
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,433
on our clan's assets.

508
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:51,002
Fortunately, the ledger
is in my possession.

509
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:56,312
As long as my influence is
intact, this will be useless.

510
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:57,643
So do not worry.

511
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:00,712
However,

512
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:04,482
I am ousted and lose my influence,

513
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:09,093
I will not be able to protect this.

514
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,623
If you protect me,

515
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,232
I will protect you in return.

516
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:20,232
If we decide to protect you,

517
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:21,803
what...

518
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,002
do you plan to do with the King?

519
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:27,272
If we do not take any action,

520
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:30,812
he may kick all of us out
as we did not impeach you.

521
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:34,913
A council was created to
resolve the national crisis.

522
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:38,453
The Border Defense Council?

523
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:41,453
An incompetent king taking over
the control of the empire...

524
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:43,453
is the biggest national crisis.

525
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:46,723
All the decisions regarding policies...

526
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:50,433
will go through the
Border Defense Council.

527
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:54,263
I have prepared the item.

528
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,602
As you said, we froze the water
with the arsenic in the center.

529
00:37:57,602 --> 00:38:00,172
So when the ice melted, the
arsenic came out as well.

530
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:02,672
And how long did it take
for the arsenic to melt?

531
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:04,913
It depends on the weather,

532
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:07,382
but it is as short as the time
one finishes a cup of tea.

533
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:09,852
I see.

534
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:14,082
By the way, may I ask
who your target is?

535
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:17,623
If I get rid of one
woman from the palace,

536
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:20,922
two men who are threatening
my position will be ruined.

537
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:38,172
I thank you for enduring the pain.

538
00:38:39,513 --> 00:38:42,553
I will not forget how hard
you tried to endure...

539
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:45,082
such painful tortures.

540
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:50,893
Now that you are exposed, staying
in the palace is dangerous.

541
00:38:51,823 --> 00:38:53,292
Leave the palace now.

542
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:56,792
It is time for all of you
to live your own lives.

543
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:48,442
I will ensure...

544
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:54,582
your dream is fulfilled.

545
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,243
It feels empty here for some reason.

546
00:40:20,013 --> 00:40:22,553
Which one of you is
still holding onto...

547
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,752
You are here.

548
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,542
I have to put...

549
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:55,243
a honeycomb-shaped ice
cube in the Queen's drink?

550
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:57,683
Yes.

551
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:04,352
You just need to add the
ice cube to it. That is all.

552
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:18,533
Your Highness.

553
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:23,312
I have a very important
piece of information.

554
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,442
So please help me.

555
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:29,352
What is it?

556
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:32,623
If you promise to spare me first...

557
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:34,852
How dare you?

558
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:36,323
Court Lady Han.

559
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:43,533
I know you are a brave girl.
But you seem terrified in fear.

560
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,533
I do not know what this is about,

561
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:49,602
but I will do everything I
can in my power to help you.

562
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,843
Lord Kim Jwa Geun asked me...

563
00:41:58,712 --> 00:42:00,913
If he was going to like her, he
should've liked her at first.

564
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:03,312
Then, Kim So Yong wouldn't
have tried to kill herself.

565
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,882
And I wouldn't be here either.

566
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,252
But more importantly,

567
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:16,163
I thought I went through
everything there is in the world.

568
00:42:18,093 --> 00:42:20,602
But apparently, there was a world
I hadn't been introduced to.

569
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:23,473
How should I explain the
feelings I had last night?

570
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:28,942
If the world I was used to
is a soft piece of bread,

571
00:42:28,942 --> 00:42:30,172
this was...

572
00:42:33,212 --> 00:42:37,053
No, it was new. I was
intrigued because it was new.

573
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:39,082
Get a grip, Jang So Yong.

574
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:43,022
Darn it. I'm even
confusing the names now.

575
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:45,393
Your Highness.

576
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,993
Yes. Come in.

577
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:57,132
The Grand Queen Dowager has
asked to have brunch with you.

578
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:00,672
Brunch at this hour? Why?

579
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:06,143
I'm not in the mood to cook right now.

580
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:13,823
The Grand Queen Dowager
already prepared everything.

581
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:16,823
Am I going to Tongmyeongjeon Hall?

582
00:43:17,192 --> 00:43:19,093
I've been running around all
day, so I'm quite hungry.

583
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:22,663
They are planning to eliminate My Queen?

584
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:25,763
Kim Jwa Geun has gotten the ledger now.

585
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:27,902
Who knew it was at Daejojeon Hall?

586
00:43:28,363 --> 00:43:29,533
How...

587
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:32,073
I will return to the palace now.

588
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:39,073
This way.

589
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,962
What are you doing? Hurry up!

590
00:43:55,962 --> 00:43:57,132
Okay.

591
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,973
You are ditching me again.

592
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:16,252
You are really making me angry.

593
00:44:31,232 --> 00:44:33,132
Thank you, Your Highness.

594
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:36,732
We are having brunch right
next to this beautiful view.

595
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:40,203
As I just ended regency, I
have a lot of time on my hands.

596
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,843
We should often have brunch.

597
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,542
Yes, Your Highness.

598
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:56,493
It is not brunch without some drinks.

599
00:45:01,163 --> 00:45:05,062
The Queen is the woman who
will die in the palace today.

600
00:45:08,303 --> 00:45:09,772
My son,

601
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:13,143
I can finally get revenge.

602
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,542
I have specially prepared...

603
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:23,613
ice which is more
precious than gold today.

604
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:30,082
This is my first time
seeing ice since I got here.

605
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:33,152
The weather is so hot today.

606
00:46:33,183 --> 00:46:36,323
It is the perfect weather
for a cold beverage.

607
00:46:46,863 --> 00:46:49,632
My Queen. Please.

608
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,102
Please. My Queen.

609
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:14,436
How dare you...

610
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:19,445
I have something to tell the Queen.

611
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,106
How dare you come here? Go away.

612
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:23,015
It is very important.

613
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,776
Dam Hyang?

614
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,845
My gosh. Why are you doing this?

615
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,985
I will end up getting
in trouble as well.

616
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,055
What on earth is so important?

617
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:40,626
Do you know that court maid?

618
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:45,095
Yes. She is a girl that I see
often in the Royal Kitchen.

619
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,066
Dam Hyang. What is wrong?

620
00:47:49,675 --> 00:47:51,106
The thing is...

621
00:47:55,276 --> 00:47:56,945
The thing is...

622
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,816
I apologize.

623
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:24,776
I am here to attend the
Grand Queen Dowager's meal.

624
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:28,345
I told you it was okay as this
is a gathering among women.

625
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:32,515
It is my first time visiting the
Queen in a gathering like this.

626
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:34,345
Please forgive me.

627
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:37,985
It is an honor for me.

628
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:41,425
How are things going with
keeping an eye on your husband?

629
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,235
Since the King has just woken up,

630
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:52,436
I will do my best to do so.

631
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:57,575
You should go ahead and drink up
before the precious ice melts.

632
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:10,155
How does it taste?

633
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:12,925
It tastes so refreshing.

634
00:49:16,856 --> 00:49:18,425
It was so refreshing that
I could not control myself.

635
00:50:00,235 --> 00:50:01,336
My Queen!

636
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,546
Your Highness!

637
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,126
How dare you?

638
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,456
What on earth are you doing?

639
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,996
- Are you okay?
- What? Yes.

640
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,635
How dare you throw a stone at the Queen?

641
00:50:32,336 --> 00:50:34,066
I am okay, Your Highness.

642
00:50:40,146 --> 00:50:42,175
Imprison that court maid right away.

643
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:44,876
She will be punished for lese-majesty.

644
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:48,285
Your Highness.

645
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:51,885
Come with me.

646
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:54,425
Dam Hyang.

647
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,496
I treasure her greatly.

648
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:08,765
I am really okay, so
please do not be mad.

649
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,735
This has nothing to do with you.

650
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,546
She has created disorder
in the Internal Court,

651
00:51:13,546 --> 00:51:15,675
and she has demolished
the discipline of Joseon.

652
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:18,376
She is just a child.

653
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:20,416
I am sure she had a reason.

654
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:22,046
She would not do such
a thing for no reason.

655
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,655
If you continue to act this way,

656
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:25,715
I will add the charge of misconduct...

657
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,626
and give her a bigger punishment.

658
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:34,425
Why did you come here in such a rush?

659
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:39,195
Did you already know that that
child would try to hurt the Queen?

660
00:51:41,106 --> 00:51:42,965
Are you trying to involve me too?

661
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:46,746
It is because the timing of
your appearance was too perfect.

662
00:51:46,776 --> 00:51:48,405
I ran over here because I was anxious...

663
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,916
as the person who was
planning treason...

664
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,546
is at the place where the
Queen is having a meal.

665
00:51:53,086 --> 00:51:54,746
This meal has been ruined.

666
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:56,715
I will return to Tongmyeongjeon Hall.

667
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:11,865
I will make sure to punish
the child who ruined our plan.

668
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:14,506
You should take responsibility too.

669
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:16,805
That way it does not
compromise our family name.

670
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:25,445
What would happen to her?

671
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:28,215
They won't flog that
little girl, will they?

672
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,086
Are you really okay?

673
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:32,885
Does your tongue feel numb or
is your heart beating too fast?

674
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:35,686
What are you talking about? It
sounds like you're saying...

675
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,095
Let us go someplace else.

676
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:40,066
I will go to Daejojeon
Hall with the Queen.

677
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:41,965
Yes, Your Majesty.

678
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,345
From now on,

679
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:02,515
be careful of everything you
consume be it a meal or a beverage.

680
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:05,256
Is someone coming after me?

681
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,095
I believe that Kim Jwa Geun...

682
00:53:10,095 --> 00:53:11,996
and the Grand Queen Dowager
tried to poison you.

683
00:53:13,325 --> 00:53:16,365
You're lying. I didn't do anything.

684
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:22,405
Is she trying to kill me because
I helped with the banquet?

685
00:53:23,276 --> 00:53:24,675
A ledger was found...

686
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:27,945
in Daejojeon Hall.

687
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:30,015
A ledger?

688
00:53:32,615 --> 00:53:35,345
The object that Kim Jwa Geun
and my father asked me about...

689
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,256
Why is everyone making such
a fuss about this ledger?

690
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:41,425
Did you not bring it
here from your home?

691
00:53:42,026 --> 00:53:43,626
I had no idea that such
a thing even existed.

692
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:46,026
I never saw it at home let
alone in Daejojeon Hall.

693
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,026
I see.

694
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:51,796
She tried to poison me to
death, not dethrone me.

695
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:55,666
Then did Dam Hyang save me?

696
00:53:56,135 --> 00:53:57,206
It seems that way.

697
00:53:57,436 --> 00:53:58,905
That beverage...

698
00:54:00,075 --> 00:54:02,106
But I already drank it.

699
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:05,246
I will ask Dam Hyang myself.

700
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,015
I'll ask her myself.

701
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:09,856
Will Dam Hyang be okay?
She has to be okay.

702
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:12,356
Those who tried to take your life...

703
00:54:12,356 --> 00:54:13,885
will not let her get
out of this unscathed.

704
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:18,496
Save her, please.

705
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,796
I will do my best.

706
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:22,155
I did not do anything wrong.

707
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:24,226
I did not steal this money.

708
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,496
I have been saving up for years...

709
00:55:27,496 --> 00:55:29,325
to free my younger sibling from slavery.

710
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,305
Please do not kill me.

711
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:38,936
If I die, my younger sibling...

712
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:46,115
Tell me everything you know...

713
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,115
about this norigae.

714
00:56:04,735 --> 00:56:06,905
- Dam Hyang.
- Your Highness!

715
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:10,106
Are you all right, Your Highness?

716
00:56:10,106 --> 00:56:11,905
I should be asking you that question.

717
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:14,046
Thank goodness...

718
00:56:14,476 --> 00:56:18,246
the ice hadn't melted fully
when you drank the beverage.

719
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:20,985
The ice?

720
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,715
She is to be transported at once!

721
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:24,715
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

722
00:56:27,526 --> 00:56:29,996
What? Where are you taking her?

723
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,566
Your Highness, you cannot be here.

724
00:56:36,996 --> 00:56:39,195
You know that this girl
didn't do anything wrong.

725
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,606
I am not following.

726
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:45,506
She is only guilty of saving my life.

727
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,606
I am not sure who told you what,

728
00:56:48,945 --> 00:56:50,215
but please return to your chamber.

729
00:56:53,015 --> 00:56:54,115
What if I refuse?

730
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:57,985
That court maid will be handled
according to our protocols.

731
00:56:58,985 --> 00:57:01,226
If you stay here, you
will also get in trouble.

732
00:57:02,456 --> 00:57:04,296
Escort Her Highness back
to the Daejojeon Hall.

733
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,325
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

734
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:11,796
- Let go!
- I will escort her.

735
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:22,006
Please return to your
chamber, Your Highness.

736
00:57:22,646 --> 00:57:26,646
Causing a scene here like this
will not help that girl in any way.

737
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,445
Your Highness.

738
00:57:47,265 --> 00:57:50,436
Dam Hyang. I'll get you
out very soon, okay?

739
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,776
Don't be scared.

740
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:55,876
Yes, Your Highness.

741
00:57:57,945 --> 00:58:00,485
Your Highness, we should get going.

742
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:03,916
I will get you out no matter what.

743
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,376
How dare a mere court maid
hurl a stone at the Queen?

744
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:34,985
She is guilty of lese-majesty.

745
00:58:34,985 --> 00:58:38,356
No, it is more than that.
She is guilty of treason.

746
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,155
I heard her father did not pay
his military service taxes...

747
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:43,155
and also committed treason.

748
00:58:43,155 --> 00:58:44,856
Clearly, it runs in the blood.

749
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,626
Ministers, you are overreacting.

750
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:51,865
We do not know the full story
yet and why she did such a thing.

751
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:55,006
The Donghak bandits'
growing influence...

752
00:58:55,006 --> 00:58:57,276
is becoming a threat to the Royal Court.

753
00:58:57,436 --> 00:58:59,135
We must tighten discipline...

754
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,976
by having this serve as a deterrent.

755
00:59:00,976 --> 00:59:02,976
You are even dragging the
Donghak believers into this now?

756
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:06,445
How dare she hurl a stone at the Queen?

757
00:59:06,445 --> 00:59:09,345
I am certain that she was
influenced by rebellious beliefs.

758
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:13,256
"Rebellious beliefs"? That court
maid is only five years old.

759
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:15,026
With all due respect,

760
00:59:15,256 --> 00:59:17,825
I must bring up the fact
that some suspect...

761
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:21,325
you had come in contact with Donghak
believers in your Ganghwa days.

762
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:25,035
Is this your new weapon now?

763
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:28,706
If you try to protect the court
maid and refuse to punish her,

764
00:59:29,035 --> 00:59:33,546
we will have no choice but to
assume that you, Your Majesty,

765
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:36,175
also support their rebellious thoughts.

766
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:40,345
All you need to do is punish
that court maid for what she did.

767
00:59:40,985 --> 00:59:42,686
Then all of this will be over.

768
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,655
That would do, right?

769
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:54,465
The Grand Queen Dowager
wanted us to be firm about it.

770
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:57,436
Is she taking her anger out on him...

771
00:59:57,436 --> 00:59:59,066
for pushing her off the throne?

772
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,805
How dare a mere court maid...

773
01:00:01,805 --> 01:00:06,175
ruin our golden opportunity
to get rid of the Queen?

774
01:00:27,595 --> 01:00:29,465
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

775
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:31,996
It must be going well, right?

776
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:35,506
If a meeting runs late,
it's never a good sign.

777
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:39,805
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

778
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:04,566
Your Highness, this way!

779
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:05,666
Okay.

780
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:14,845
Engrave this moment in your
mind and never forget it.

781
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:20,015
Court maids should not see or
hear anything in the palace...

782
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:24,856
and should never engage in
any rebellious thoughts.

783
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:28,155
If you ever associate yourself
with Donghak believers...

784
01:01:28,155 --> 01:01:31,756
and their beliefs, you
will end up like this.

785
01:01:33,296 --> 01:01:35,265
That court maid is only a kid.

786
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:38,135
Be quiet.

787
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:43,305
I thought we caught
the big fish this time,

788
01:01:44,805 --> 01:01:47,776
but it was this kid? Unbelievable.

789
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:57,785
Are we too late?

790
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,396
I suppose you now understand how I feel.

791
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,776
She was only trying to
save you, Your Highness.

792
01:02:19,976 --> 01:02:21,206
That's why they killed her.

793
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:24,876
They tried to kill me,
but she got in the way.

794
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,885
This kid didn't do anything wrong.

795
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:12,155
You said yourself...

796
01:03:13,496 --> 01:03:17,595
that they're dumping their
sins on this little girl.

797
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,805
Why didn't you save her?

798
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,006
It was a sacrifice that had to
be made for the greater goals.

799
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:30,845
"Greater goals"?

800
01:03:32,715 --> 01:03:33,985
You mean, your own safety?

801
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:40,015
Aren't you the one who said that
this world is an unfair place?

802
01:03:40,856 --> 01:03:44,655
I prevented a bigger calamity
with this small sacrifice.

803
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:47,265
"Small sacrifice"?

804
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:51,436
Because it's...

805
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,305
just a weak, little girl?

806
01:03:58,006 --> 01:03:59,436
Incompetence is sin.

807
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:03,206
You do not even have the power
to protect this little kid,

808
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:07,115
and that is sin in and of itself.

809
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:34,405
Why don't we come up with
our own hand signals?

810
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:35,506
Like this one.

811
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:37,715
This means whatever I'm saying is a lie.

812
01:04:38,046 --> 01:04:39,175
What do you think?

813
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:52,687
MR. QUEEN

814
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:10,816
<i>As of today, I'm the
crazy one in this palace.</i>

815
01:05:10,816 --> 01:05:14,686
<i>I will show you what happens
when you mess with me.</i>

816
01:05:14,686 --> 01:05:16,746
<i>Did you try to get rid of the Queen?</i>

817
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:18,655
<i>- Dam Hyang...
- Dam Hyang...</i>

818
01:05:20,015 --> 01:05:21,256
<i>All in.</i>

819
01:05:21,256 --> 01:05:22,655
<i>Kim Byeong In should
not be underestimated...</i>

820
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:24,456
<i>as even the Jo clan is
in the palm of his hand.</i>

821
01:05:24,456 --> 01:05:25,626
<i>Let's form an alliance.</i>

822
01:05:25,626 --> 01:05:28,496
<i>As of this moment, forget "No touching".</i>

823
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:30,026
<i>Calm down, my heart.</i>

824
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,195
<i>It's kind of like a test.</i>

825
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,436
<i>Want to stay for some noodles?</i>
