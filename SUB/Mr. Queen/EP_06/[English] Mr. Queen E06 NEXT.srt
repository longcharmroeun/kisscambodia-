THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:14,348
EPISODE 6

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,387
Right. Over here.

5
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:20,257
In the tactics section
of "Wubei Zhi",

6
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:23,327
if there are fewer
allies than enemies,

7
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:24,998
run away to a rough area.

8
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:29,298
And if you are unable to
protect it, retreat and...

9
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,537
She is a strange woman.

10
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,637
Gosh, Your Majesty.

11
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,137
She behaves strangely.

12
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:43,777
Until when should I dance to
royal ancestral rite music?

13
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:45,148
I...

14
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,788
served in the Special Forces.

15
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:52,158
- She speaks arrogantly.
- Come at me.

16
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,088
You must think you're
a king or something.

17
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,387
I am the king.

18
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,698
Thank you.

19
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,398
Have you lost your mind?

20
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,538
Never mind. I
don't care anymore.

21
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,208
Get lost.

22
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,378
She also acts so wildly.

23
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:24,758
At times she makes decisions
that seem like Buddha.

24
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:30,488
So please do not hurt those
who did nothing wrong.

25
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,098
And at other times, she
gets as mad as a demon.

26
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,868
If I don't get angry in this
situation, am I a human?

27
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,327
I'd be Buddha!

28
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,238
In some ways, she is very human,

29
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:42,267
and trying to understand
this mysterious woman...

30
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,478
It's too late. Your
understanding means nothing now.

31
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,907
Is it really too late?

32
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,047
Was my explanation difficult?

33
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,517
- What did you say?
- You were not paying attention.

34
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,928
What were you thinking about...

35
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,027
that you were not paying attention
to your favorite book on tactics?

36
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:06,928
You must have been thinking
about Lady Hwa Jin.

37
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,528
No, I was not.

38
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,038
There is no need to lie.

39
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:16,938
The look in your eyes shows that
you were thinking of a woman...

40
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,337
I was thinking about the Queen.

41
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:19,837
Pardon?

42
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:21,908
So please refrain from saying
such uncomfortable things.

43
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:24,478
The Queen is a woman,

44
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:27,248
but you know that I
do not see her as one.

45
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,448
It makes sense. Since
she is so unpredictable,

46
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:32,658
you are inevitably
bothered by her.

47
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,728
The Queen is the most
eccentric and strange person...

48
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:40,397
I have met in my entire life.

49
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,968
As if she has come
from a different world.

50
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,867
An expression that best
describes the Queen is...

51
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:53,837
Let me see.

52
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:59,248
It is a word that describes a
being from outside of this world.

53
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:00,378
Alien.

54
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:02,848
- "Alien"?
- Yes.

55
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:08,258
It fits her very well.

56
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,357
Alien.

57
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,538
Has it finally stopped raining?

58
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,667
It was raining so hard.

59
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,538
I hope that nobody
suffered any damages.

60
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,978
I agree.

61
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,378
I am worried.

62
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,077
Until when are you going to
speak in a weird way like that?

63
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,917
Until today. Just until today.

64
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:41,058
Everything will be back to
its place tomorrow! Yes!

65
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:48,068
No way.

66
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:58,408
Your Majesty!

67
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,547
Open the gates! It
is the King's order!

68
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,788
- Open the gates!
- Open the gates!

69
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,407
I CAME HERE FOR
NOTHING. JANG BONG HWAN

70
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:13,878
Are you okay?

71
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:14,948
Darn it.

72
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:16,748
What are you doing?

73
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:18,277
Not too long ago,
you tried to kill me.

74
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,248
I should ask you the same thing!

75
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:22,387
I cannot believe you tried
to end your life again.

76
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,618
Have you lost your mind?

77
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,858
Why do you care if I die or not?

78
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:28,657
Isn't it what you wanted?

79
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,767
So don't interrupt and get lost.

80
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,868
It is not too late for
me to understand you.

81
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,907
Let us do as you said.

82
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:44,637
No touching.

83
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,418
That's right. No touching.

84
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:55,748
- Goodness.
- Darn it.

85
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,818
What are you doing? Let me go!

86
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,017
Darn it!

87
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,287
You said you wanted no touching,
so why are you giving up on life?

88
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:06,657
You want me to kill
you, don't you?

89
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,027
How dare you touch me
without permission?

90
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,868
It makes sense
that you are angry.

91
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:13,168
I have committed a great sin
and a debt I cannot repay.

92
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:17,568
I know it all sounds like excuses,
but there was a misunderstanding.

93
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:21,448
Misunderstanding or not, I
don't care about your situation.

94
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,178
Please at least
listen to my excuses.

95
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,077
I don't want to listen
to your excuses.

96
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,318
- Move.
- No.

97
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,618
Since I agreed to no touching,

98
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,488
I will not leave you alone.

99
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:36,727
Do you even know what
no touching means?

100
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:37,727
I do.

101
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:41,698
I remember everything
that you said to me.

102
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:43,868
No touching.

103
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:47,037
Living a happy and fun life.

104
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:50,467
You must live, My Queen.

105
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,637
You've missed out the
most important word.

106
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:54,808
"Separately".

107
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,977
You live as you want,
and I live as I want.

108
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,847
The emphasis isn't
on the word "live".

109
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,647
It is on "separately".

110
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,248
I will do everything that I can
to abide by your no-touching rule.

111
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,457
I will look for a way for
both you and I to live.

112
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,527
Forget it. Forget about
the no-touching rule!

113
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:11,227
Why not?

114
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,628
The no-touching rule I'm talking
about is different from yours.

115
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,227
One small thing has made
them totally opposites.

116
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:18,868
They are not different.

117
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:20,767
I will prove it to you.

118
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:23,767
So let us follow the
no-touching rule.

119
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,777
I won't follow the
no-touching rule!

120
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:29,308
Let us follow the
no-touching rule!

121
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:31,178
Darn it.

122
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,398
EPISODE 6, BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING
AND MISUNDERSTANDING

123
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,127
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

124
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:53,938
Your Majesty. What is going on?

125
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:55,438
Call for the Head
Eunuch quickly.

126
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:59,237
I am okay, so take
care of the Queen.

127
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:01,847
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,717
Your Highness.

129
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,278
Hurry.

130
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,857
I CAME HERE FOR
NOTHING. JANG BONG HWAN

131
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:20,617
I missed you.

132
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,257
I also missed you.

133
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:27,457
Are you inside?

134
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:29,827
Yes, Father.

135
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,768
I see that you are
already dressed.

136
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,308
Did you sleep well?

137
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:41,847
Yes.

138
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:46,217
I woke up early as today is
the day you enter the Palace.

139
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:49,418
I will do my best so
that I do not taint...

140
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:51,558
your name and our family.

141
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:54,587
I'm glad it is not raining anymore.
It will be easier to get there.

142
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,528
Finish getting ready.

143
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:57,587
I will.

144
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:22,018
I was on the brink of
suffocating to death.

145
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,688
Honestly, I could've been in
danger if Cheoljong didn't save me.

146
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:27,018
Why won't this woman come back?

147
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:36,298
What happened to
you and the King?

148
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:38,198
Why did you go to the
lake at this hour?

149
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:44,007
Are you still taking your time?

150
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,938
I finished wiping
everything down.

151
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:55,918
When did you even leave? I
was keeping my eye on you.

152
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:00,318
Did you jump into
the lake again?

153
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,288
It's not what you think.

154
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:09,668
Your Highness. I have brought
the outfit you can change into.

155
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,327
Then how did you get wet?

156
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:15,337
It's nothing. I was excited to
see the lake filled with water,

157
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,707
so I went swimming.

158
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:19,808
Pardon?

159
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:21,977
The two of you went swimming?

160
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,648
You must not do that.

161
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:27,077
What if you end up
catching a cold?

162
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:32,518
Perhaps the lake isn't
the way to go back.

163
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:35,257
This doesn't make sense.

164
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:47,237
Your Majesty.

165
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:49,308
You are here.

166
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,737
I looked everywhere for you.

167
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,438
Why were you in such a hurry...

168
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,648
Why are you so wet?

169
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,818
- It is nothing.
- But...

170
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,627
My life is filled with sin,

171
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,298
so I will live to help
you, Lady Hwa Jin.

172
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,278
I am sorry. I did not see you.

173
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,217
Did you really not see me?

174
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,227
If a person without any
power knows too much,

175
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:24,497
they will die in the end.

176
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:29,367
That is the rule of the palace.

177
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,577
I must live.

178
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:36,347
Lady Hwa Jin told me to live.

179
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:06,408
The Queen fell into the
lake again at dawn today.

180
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,847
But this time, the King also...

181
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:16,087
It seems like nobody knows
why they both fell in.

182
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,288
Will this be...

183
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:23,827
enough to prove my use to you?

184
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,428
Relay that message
to the Queen Dowager.

185
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,798
Should I describe the Queen's
behaviors as they are?

186
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:33,898
As you relay that
message to her,

187
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,068
tell me everything you
see and hear from her...

188
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,707
no matter how small it is.

189
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,778
It is not up to you to choose
which information is useful.

190
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,818
I will do as you say.

191
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:50,148
From now on, you will be
report to the court lady...

192
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,518
that handles the
Queen's bedchamber.

193
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,028
Bedchamber, my lord?

194
00:15:58,188 --> 00:15:59,827
That position comes
with a high salary.

195
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,827
Thank you, my lord.

196
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,068
The Queen Dowager will think
you will be more useful to her.

197
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,268
And keep a close eye on the
Queen's whereabouts as well.

198
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,278
Yes. Leave it to me, my lord.

199
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:25,518
Should I draw a
bloomed flower...

200
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,987
or a budding flower?

201
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,288
What do you think, O Wol?

202
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,568
His Majesty is the only one...

203
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,068
I have left now.

204
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:46,808
Your Highness, the
Queen Dowager is here.

205
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,247
Hello, Your Highness.

206
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,747
You were drawing orchids.

207
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,888
Is it finished?

208
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:05,628
Not yet.

209
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,828
I have not decided whether
to add a flower or a bud.

210
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,297
Let me see.

211
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:15,108
In my opinion, a
budding flower will do.

212
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,507
It will make them
curious and wonder...

213
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:23,047
what kind of flower it will be.

214
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,527
Gosh, how beautiful.

215
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,537
I hope the buds would not
face any misfortunes...

216
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:49,668
of withering away without
being able to bloom.

217
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,007
Oh, right.

218
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:56,178
I came here because I
have a small gift for you.

219
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:10,688
Thank you.

220
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,358
I did not know what you liked,

221
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,358
so it took me some time as
I gave it a lot of thought.

222
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,178
I heard that you are
an excellent archer.

223
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,777
I am planning to
learn archery myself.

224
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:33,348
I prepared some for you
as I got them for myself.

225
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,257
These are beautiful
and strong arrows.

226
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,287
Thank you.

227
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:45,128
That is not the
real gift, though.

228
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:49,497
The real gift will
be delivered...

229
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:51,698
to His Majesty during the
meeting in court today.

230
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:01,908
Where if not the lake?

231
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,878
The only thing in
common is water.

232
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,418
There's one more.

233
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,257
Both of us were on
the verge of death.

234
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,188
Oh, my. What if I try it
and really end up dying?

235
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:18,957
Dying hurts so much.

236
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:24,098
I'm sure there is a safe
and peaceful way to go back.

237
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:27,368
I should understand
this woman first.

238
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,908
I am Kim So Yong.

239
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,908
I ended myself.

240
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,118
"Desert your false self"?

241
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:42,418
"Desert your false self"?

242
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,557
Why did I try to kill myself?
Because I don't want to live.

243
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,658
Of course, that's why
she won't come back.

244
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,428
This woman... Did she
run away from home?

245
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,797
I finally understand
why you are doing this.

246
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:04,438
You obsess over the lake...

247
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,207
and keep mumbling to yourself.

248
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:08,378
Right now, you are...

249
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,277
trying to get your
memories back, right?

250
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:18,287
Yes. That's right.

251
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,017
Okay.

252
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,828
That brings me to this question.
When I fell into the lake,

253
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:24,987
you said I didn't wake up although
I was pulled out right away.

254
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,158
Yes.

255
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:29,128
Darn it. I knew
it. She ran away.

256
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,928
This isn't fair.

257
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,938
I want to go back.

258
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,307
This is kidnapping!

259
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:40,878
The grilled gizzard shad can
bring back runaway wives.

260
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:44,307
But memorial services for
spirits who left their bodies?

261
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:46,418
A ritual?

262
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:50,547
Yes. I should hold
a huge ritual.

263
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:52,388
I will plaster this place
with expensive talismans.

264
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,557
Are you outside,
Court Lady Choi?

265
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:03,868
Is there anyone who specializes
in rituals or talismans?

266
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,098
Pardon?

267
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:09,007
You should not take an
interest in shamanism,

268
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:12,007
but you will end up
doing it anyway, right?

269
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:18,007
There is one person that
comes to my mind now.

270
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:20,348
But what?

271
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:33,128
Why did she come all the way
here? What does she want to know?

272
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,067
To what do I owe this pleasure?

273
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:38,938
I heard you were the expert.

274
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:42,168
I am? In what?

275
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,878
I need some spiritual guidance.

276
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:49,848
Things like rituals
or talismans.

277
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:53,717
Did she figure out that
I got a new talisman...

278
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:55,178
to curse her?

279
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,717
My gosh. How vulgar.

280
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:01,957
Why do you need such items?

281
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,787
It's not a big deal.

282
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:07,757
I need to bring in a spirit
that has left the body.

283
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,168
I'm sure this happens
often. You know?

284
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:14,737
She is cleverly trying
to bond with me.

285
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:18,108
I am sure she wants to expose
me for having talismans.

286
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,537
What a sly fox.

287
00:22:20,678 --> 00:22:23,408
I do not believe in such things.

288
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:26,277
Like ghosts or spirits.

289
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:31,987
Then, what is the
purpose of this place?

290
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,027
You got the wrong idea.

291
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:43,297
This is not a shamanistic place.

292
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,767
This is where I
cleanse my heart.

293
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:47,668
I see.

294
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,537
What is this?

295
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:53,477
Seriously?

296
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:59,078
But whose spirit are
you trying to summon?

297
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:04,688
Should I say we are
very intimate or tight?

298
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,317
It's a woman, so don't
get the wrong idea.

299
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:09,457
I see.

300
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:14,358
It must be your mother
whom you have never seen.

301
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:20,037
My gosh. My heart
breaks for you.

302
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:22,737
You must be lonely
in the palace.

303
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,938
But you must miss
your late mother.

304
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:26,537
Is that why...

305
00:23:27,477 --> 00:23:29,547
you were trying
to end your life?

306
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,477
Is that what you think?

307
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,618
You can tell me everything.

308
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:39,457
I did not give
birth to the King...

309
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:42,527
but based on the
genealogy, I am his mother.

310
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:47,898
Starting today, I will cherish you
as my daughter and take good care...

311
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:50,898
I already have two mothers.

312
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:55,838
But the truth is, I wasn't
trying to kill myself.

313
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,838
Then, why did you say that you
were trying to end your life?

314
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:00,678
Exactly.

315
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:02,707
Why on earth did I do that?

316
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:05,378
So you want me to guess?

317
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:09,118
It means she has
an ulterior motive.

318
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:15,188
So she is threatening me and
saying that I should be on my toes.

319
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:23,856
Darn it. That wasn't
helpful at all.

320
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,527
The royal conference
has not been held yet.

321
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,567
But she is making a move
already to threaten me?

322
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:36,307
Court Lady Han, they must
also have a little bird...

323
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,977
that delivers rumors to them.

324
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:42,047
Pardon? But who would do that?

325
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:47,447
She barged in confidently
and dropped clues on purpose,

326
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:52,186
so it must be someone we
cannot figure out easily.

327
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:55,557
Contact the fortune-teller,
Court Lady Han.

328
00:24:56,457 --> 00:25:00,596
I must get a reading.

329
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,366
She was tormented by something,
so she tried to take her own life.

330
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,076
But she couldn't even die.

331
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,576
So her soul was like,
"Whatever. I'm out."

332
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:14,176
And she's not returning.

333
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:16,346
What was she tormented by?

334
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:19,217
The Grand Queen Dowager said
she didn't want to become Queen.

335
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,287
Why not?

336
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:23,557
Because Cheoljong
didn't love her...

337
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:26,356
and was head over heels
for another woman?

338
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:28,257
Gosh, no way.

339
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:30,356
Did she try to take her own
life because of that jerk?

340
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:35,467
Her Highness is talking to
herself more than usual.

341
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,037
Many are listening.

342
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,936
That is the least
of my concerns.

343
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:41,936
I nag her about it, but I
should really let it go.

344
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,076
She will kill someone
soon at this rate.

345
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:49,717
But then again, I know this
now that I've experienced it.

346
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:52,787
Being a queen is like
sitting in a barless prison.

347
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:55,916
From a noble family and
chosen to become Queen,

348
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,356
which means she
never really dated.

349
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,126
She probably had never even seen
a boy until she met Cheoljong.

350
00:26:01,356 --> 00:26:03,896
And given the fact that
he is King and all that,

351
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,767
I understand why she
fell hard for him.

352
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:12,267
Hold on a second. She must be
having a lot of fun right now.

353
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:14,636
After leading an ascetic
lifestyle all her life,

354
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,807
she experienced a new world.

355
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,346
What if this woman is...

356
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,076
She'd better not be doing
funny things with my body!

357
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,697
What the...

358
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,317
Stop!

359
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:02,557
Come back at once. I'm
going to teach you a lesson!

360
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:03,957
You won't come back?

361
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,356
What is so interesting that
you are all staring at it?

362
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:10,326
Then I'm going to...

363
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,596
stab your body. Until it bleeds!

364
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,267
It'll hurt, big-time.

365
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:20,336
You don't think I can do it?
I'm doing it, okay? Here we go!

366
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,477
Gosh, that hurts.

367
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,186
This time, I'm actually going
to do it until I see blood.

368
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:40,457
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

369
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:42,557
That really hurt!

370
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,957
- It hurt so much.
- Let me help you up.

371
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,666
It hurt...

372
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,967
- My gosh.
- I have reached my limits.

373
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:55,676
Coming back, not coming back.

374
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,507
Coming back.

375
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:00,906
Not coming back.

376
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:06,947
More?

377
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:09,886
Your Highness, please
do not be concerned.

378
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,856
It will return when
the time is right.

379
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,926
But by then, I
would already be...

380
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,037
Calling the spirit.

381
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,436
Are you here?

382
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:32,277
Calling the spirit.

383
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,507
Are you here?

384
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,646
Since we're sharing
each other's bodies,

385
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:41,747
let's have an open,
candid conversation.

386
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:47,356
You are talking to yourself
again, Your Highness?

387
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:50,596
Consider this a
self-conducted exorcism...

388
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,727
or a conversation with the self.

389
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:55,596
What will you do if
strange rumors spread?

390
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:58,396
Word travels exceptionally
fast in the palace.

391
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:00,366
What is that? It looks nice.

392
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,606
His Majesty bestowed this
upon Your Highness as a gift.

393
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:04,807
I went and got it for you.

394
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,086
"CHANGES OF ZHOU"

395
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:18,886
There is something inside.

396
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,186
NO TOUCHING.

397
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,096
My gosh! How pretty.

398
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,326
Gosh, look at him
going on about this.

399
00:29:27,326 --> 00:29:30,166
When I wanted to do it, he
turned me down. So why now?

400
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:38,176
Did you catch a cold?

401
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,777
I knew this would happen.

402
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,376
You got soaked in the rain
and even played in the water.

403
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,717
Gosh, what do I do with you?

404
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:48,487
Yeon.

405
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,217
This isn't a cold.

406
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:53,527
Then what is it?

407
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:54,787
This is...

408
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,626
a disease called despair.

409
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,497
I thought everything would be
resolved once the lake filled up.

410
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:07,237
You see, hope is
such a cruel thing.

411
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,777
To regain memory, you even
wanted to do a shamanic ritual.

412
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:15,477
I hope you can stop
trying so hard.

413
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:17,977
If you had a lot
of good memories,

414
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,717
you would not have tried
to take your own life.

415
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,317
For the sake of your happiness,

416
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,886
maybe it is better that
it never returns...

417
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:27,386
No! It must return.

418
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:31,396
I can't live like this.

419
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,136
I'll tell the royal kitchen to make
foods that can help treat your cold.

420
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,767
Your Highness should eat
that and get some rest.

421
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:42,636
No, I will make this
woman surrender...

422
00:30:42,636 --> 00:30:45,876
and come back of her own
accord, at all costs.

423
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:52,517
Here, blow your nose.

424
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,947
Hey, don't treat me like
a kid. I'm not an idiot.

425
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:00,787
One more time.

426
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:07,896
- Eunuch Cha.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:14,567
Your Majesty, you have a cold.
Please return to your chamber.

428
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:16,636
No, this is not a cold.

429
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,307
This is...

430
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:24,477
I suppose it is a
cold. You were right.

431
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:27,947
Still no word from
Daejojeon Hall?

432
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,856
- No, Your Majesty.
- Did she receive the book?

433
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,487
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:36,957
Of course, it would not be
easy to open a closed heart.

435
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,197
I have a favor to ask of you.

436
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:41,797
I need you to get me
something precious.

437
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,537
By "something precious",
do you mean...

438
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,836
What are you thinking?

439
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,817
We hereby appoint
Kim Byeong In...

440
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,886
as the head of the
Department of Justice.

441
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,856
I trust that you will
excel in this position.

442
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,527
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

443
00:32:14,697 --> 00:32:17,666
I have heard so much about
you. The youngest to pass...

444
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,267
the civil service exam and
skilled in martial arts.

445
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:22,606
Despite all your knowledge
and talent in martial arts,

446
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,477
you had been refusing to accept
a post in the government,

447
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:27,076
which left everyone curious.

448
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:30,277
What prompted you to
change your mind this time?

449
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,416
"One must save one's
country in times of crisis."

450
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,757
At this time of crisis,
I wish to contribute...

451
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:38,886
to restoring order
in this nation.

452
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:44,826
"Crisis"?

453
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,727
My goodness, the ministers must
have been keeping it from me...

454
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:50,067
for they did not want
to cause me concern.

455
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:53,207
Who is it this time?
Qing or the Japanese?

456
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:55,737
An internal crisis...

457
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,406
is more dangerous
than an external one.

458
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:04,447
There is an internal crisis
that never existed before?

459
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:06,086
That must mean...

460
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:19,396
Oh, I have a cold.

461
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:24,166
Gosh, a sage king ought to know
how to look after his health.

462
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:31,306
Open wide.

463
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,447
You must return
to your chamber...

464
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,317
and get some rest
after you finish this.

465
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:43,317
No, I'll stay out here so
my cold will get worse.

466
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:44,317
I'm going to abuse this body.

467
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,626
It's not my body anyway.

468
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:49,056
I'll never let it
stay warm and full.

469
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:52,157
I want more.

470
00:33:57,597 --> 00:33:58,637
Your Highness,

471
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,567
abusing your body would not
help you regain your memory.

472
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,907
It will only cause you pain.

473
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:06,476
You keep saying that
it is not your body,

474
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:09,047
but it is yours even though
your memories are gone.

475
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:12,047
Who will suffer? You, of course.

476
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,246
Even without your memories,

477
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:17,456
I am sure you will
have a happy life.

478
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:20,927
Look at the sky. The weather
is great today. How nice is it?

479
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,427
Right. It's free of fine dust.

480
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,206
The breeze carries the
smell of fresh compost.

481
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:38,436
Korean food for all three meals.

482
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,577
Yes, this is enough
to make me happy.

483
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,246
Of course. I'm happy with it.

484
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,246
Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:52,117
Your Highness, are you crying?

486
00:34:52,617 --> 00:34:55,086
No. I'm not crying.
I am so happy.

487
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,097
Like you said,

488
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,197
I'll try to like this place
and live a happy life here.

489
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:03,936
Are you that sad because your
memories are not returning?

490
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:13,007
This is an appeal from tens
of people from the court...

491
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:16,047
including myself as we are
greatly worried about...

492
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,746
the Queen's state.

493
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:19,447
What on earth...

494
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,246
Are you discussing
to depose the Queen?

495
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,856
- What?
- What?

496
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:28,456
The Queen habitually
tries to end her life,

497
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:31,527
so we would like to
strengthen the Internal Court.

498
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,867
I ask you to consider
deposing the Queen.

499
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:40,936
The Queen has made a false
statement in order to keep...

500
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,836
Royal Noble Consort Eui safe.

501
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:46,407
After falling into the
lake, her mind has been ill.

502
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,407
She confuses herself
with someone else.

503
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,746
And whenever she looks at the water,
she jumps and tries to kill herself.

504
00:35:50,746 --> 00:35:52,246
Everyone is
gossiping about that!

505
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:54,916
If you believe gossips
have any truth to them,

506
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,887
the gossip that Royal
Noble Consort Eui...

507
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:59,927
had pushed the Queen
also must be true.

508
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,186
What?

509
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:02,956
- How dare you?
- Hey.

510
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,797
Be quiet!

511
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:10,496
I will dismiss this appeal as
it was not handled properly.

512
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:13,266
You must file this
properly to Seungjeongwon.

513
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:16,336
However, I can guarantee you
this as I am her husband,

514
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:18,007
the closest person
to observe her.

515
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,976
Her mind is not ill.

516
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:26,887
- However...
- Things are getting heated.

517
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:30,056
I'd like to ask to end the
royal conference here for today.

518
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,387
Let us.

519
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,027
Your Highness.

520
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:42,226
What brings you here, my cousin?

521
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:43,936
I heard that you were here.

522
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:48,336
Did you hear the news?

523
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:52,177
- What?
- His Majesty is here.

524
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:54,246
My Queen.

525
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,246
You are already here.

526
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:01,047
You are the one who
is late, Your Majesty.

527
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,016
I thought perhaps, I
was being sensitive,

528
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,987
but it is no secret that my head
of the Department of Justice...

529
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,427
is unhappy with me.

530
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:08,927
Head of the
Department of Justice?

531
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,327
You dismissed and
humiliated the Queen...

532
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,726
who had saved your lover
in front of everyone.

533
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:18,536
I can picture how you have been
treating the Queen all this time.

534
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:21,536
Perhaps, that must be why
she tried to end her life.

535
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:25,706
Well, don't look at me.

536
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,907
In the end, the Queen is
in a predicament because...

537
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:30,817
she saved Royal
Noble Consort Eui.

538
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:33,686
- What will you do then?
- In a predicament?

539
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:36,217
I will not let her
be in a predicament.

540
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:39,626
How? What can you do?

541
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,126
Are you crossing the line...

542
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:47,126
as the Queen's cousin...

543
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:49,896
or as the adopted son
of Lord Kim Jwa Geun?

544
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:52,597
You have no power
to protect her.

545
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,036
I am objectively telling
you what I am seeing.

546
00:37:56,436 --> 00:37:57,706
I have no power?

547
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:01,947
I agree.

548
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:07,086
However, I do not have to
defeat power with power.

549
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:09,717
There is a way to defeat it
in a peaceful and safe way.

550
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,757
If it requires me to be
more peaceful, I will be.

551
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,027
If it means to
protect the Queen,

552
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:17,996
I will stay weak as
long as anyone wants.

553
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:20,327
There is no need for that.

554
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,927
I will protect the Queen.

555
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:28,336
It is faster to defeat
power with more power.

556
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:38,817
Hey.

557
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,916
What's going on here?

558
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,317
It sounds like it's my problem.

559
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,617
Why are you two
fighting about it?

560
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:46,257
What's going on with me?
What is it this time?

561
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:49,487
I received an appeal to
depose you, My Queen.

562
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,867
Gosh. Right after I decided
to try to like this place?

563
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,666
They were eager
to kill me before.

564
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,266
Now, they want to kick me out.

565
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,737
Who brought up to
depose you before today?

566
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,666
The Grand Queen Dowager
was angry at me.

567
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,806
I will talk to her.

568
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:08,376
I do have a solution in mind.

569
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:13,146
Oh, no. You caught a
cold too, My Queen.

570
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:19,217
You too?

571
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:22,757
Although this is urgent,

572
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:25,297
you must go back
inside and rest.

573
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:29,797
If that is everything you
wanted to say, leave us be.

574
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,166
We must discuss something
as a husband and a wife.

575
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,806
There is something I must
tell you, so I will wait.

576
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:40,447
- I will come back again.
- Okay.

577
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,856
I was going to wait until
you had an answer for me.

578
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,226
But I am running out of time.

579
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,956
Starting now, I will follow
the no-touching rule.

580
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,697
Why are you bringing
that up now?

581
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,927
If you do not wish to follow
it, I will follow it alone.

582
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,666
No touching.

583
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,536
You misunderstood that.

584
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:08,706
- Give me your hand.
- Why?

585
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:11,007
What are you doing?

586
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:27,226
My life...

587
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,056
was always in the
hands of your clan.

588
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,297
I must have been
blinded by that.

589
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:39,697
I failed to see that you are also
an innocent woman who is trying...

590
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:42,166
to make the best
of what you have.

591
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,476
I am sorry that it
took me so long.

592
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:49,077
Please give me one more chance.

593
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:52,347
A chance to understand you...

594
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,956
as an individual
without any prejudices.

595
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:02,956
You didn't have to do that.

596
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:04,456
I know you are not
fond of big gestures.

597
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:08,697
But I should apologize to
you properly at least once.

598
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:09,896
Suit yourself.

599
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:11,567
Fine. Let's do it. No touching.

600
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:13,467
I'm in no place to
turn down anyone.

601
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:20,376
Then, today is our first day.

602
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:22,306
What?

603
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:24,016
The first day of our
no-touching rule.

604
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,347
- Don't say something like that.
- Why not?

605
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:29,586
Just don't. Never
say that again.

606
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,487
What is wrong with what I said?

607
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:33,757
Today is our first day.

608
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,056
My gosh. Just don't say that!

609
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:40,126
I mean, saying today
is our first day...

610
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:41,766
Stop it!

611
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:44,666
I bet you know what
that means, right?

612
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,237
Today is our first day...

613
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:49,436
Stop it. That's so disgusting!

614
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:50,777
- But it is our first day.
- Stop it.

615
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:52,237
- Our...
- Stop it.

616
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:56,277
Then, now that we
have settled on that,

617
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,447
I will do my best
to protect you.

618
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:02,117
Right. I have no
time to waste either.

619
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,717
Bye.

620
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,157
Wait. Please do
not run. Do not...

621
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,097
You might get hurt.

622
00:42:24,677 --> 00:42:25,936
Go ahead.

623
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:30,246
If the Queen is unhappy,
you will be unhappy too.

624
00:42:31,077 --> 00:42:33,447
- Is that a threat?
- Just my concern.

625
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:39,927
You are only her cousin, but
you are way too overprotective.

626
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,327
No, you are way too
indifferent, Your Majesty.

627
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,757
I know I do not hold much power,

628
00:42:46,427 --> 00:42:48,197
but there are
proprieties to follow.

629
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:50,666
If you cross the line again,

630
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,666
I will raise a question
regarding your behaviors.

631
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:56,976
Please go ahead.

632
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,047
I will make you write...

633
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:04,947
a very lengthy apology letter.

634
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,847
A very long one.

635
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,817
You might have to
stay up all night.

636
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:15,987
And your fingers will hurt.

637
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:33,646
Do they truly believe
she can be deposed?

638
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,047
Because of that mere appeal?

639
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:38,146
They are trying to gather
power through the appeal.

640
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,547
They will gather people
who dislike our clan...

641
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:44,516
and increase the number of
appeals. It is very obvious.

642
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:48,286
How dare they make their
move so recklessly?

643
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:50,856
We were bound to go
through this at least once.

644
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:52,556
Your Highness,

645
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:55,067
the Queen is here.

646
00:43:57,097 --> 00:43:58,237
Show Her Highness in.

647
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:22,126
I apologize deeply
for worrying you.

648
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:28,097
I deserved to be deposed.

649
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,297
However, even if I get deposed,

650
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,766
the Grand Queen
Dowager must depose me.

651
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:38,806
It is not right for a member of
the Pungyang Jo clan to do so.

652
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:43,416
No matter how foolish you may
be, nobody can bear to see...

653
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:45,416
someone boss around one
of their subordinates.

654
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,786
This is a matter of pride.

655
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,657
If I get deposed by someone
from the Pungyang Jo clan,

656
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:52,487
it will not be my loss,

657
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,056
it will be the loss of
the Andong Kim clan.

658
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,527
If you are so aware of that,

659
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:00,496
how could you do something
to be accountable for?

660
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,226
What they rely on
are the rumors.

661
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:04,197
I will take care of it.

662
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:05,237
How will you do that?

663
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:06,766
You must never let a
good crisis go to waste.

664
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:09,367
If you give me a bit of time,
I will take this opportunity...

665
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:11,836
to change my reputation.

666
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,956
Today, the King
took your side...

667
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,226
when he received the appeal.

668
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:30,197
Cheoljong, that jerk, did?

669
00:45:31,697 --> 00:45:33,766
The fact that the
Queen took action...

670
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:36,166
did not go to waste.

671
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:42,936
I must give the Queen
Dowager Jo a proper lesson.

672
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,476
I must show her who the
owner of this palace is.

673
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:54,516
Are these all the
palanquin bearers?

674
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:56,956
The thing is...

675
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:58,757
Select some more. Make
sure they're funny.

676
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,427
Yes, Your Highness. Funny.

677
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:02,726
Pardon?

678
00:46:05,927 --> 00:46:07,927
Make sure they are tall
and have nice bodies.

679
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:09,697
Obviously, they
must be young too.

680
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:16,106
Are you really choosing
palanquin bearers?

681
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,306
I'm not simply choosing riders
to carry the food palanquins.

682
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,577
You'll be surprised
when you find out.

683
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,717
What I'm choosing is...

684
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:37,757
- Right. Did you hear the rumors?
- What rumors?

685
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:40,467
The Queen did not try
to commit suicide.

686
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,467
She was trying to save the King
and the Royal Noble Consort Eui.

687
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,507
She was trying to save the King
and the Royal Noble Consort Eui,

688
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:49,637
so she lied and said she was
trying to commit suicide.

689
00:46:49,836 --> 00:46:50,836
Gosh, it's hot.

690
00:46:51,277 --> 00:46:53,007
- Is it family...
- Or husband.

691
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:54,746
- That is...
- The question.

692
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:58,047
As a result, she lost the confidence
of the Grand Queen Dowager...

693
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:01,146
But the Queen put a silver
knife to her throat and said...

694
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:04,056
"I will escape from
this unlucky fate..."

695
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:05,686
"where I cannot
choose either side."

696
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:09,527
That is what she said.

697
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,197
She was the witch
of the royal villa.

698
00:47:11,657 --> 00:47:12,657
According to the rumors,

699
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:14,427
she experienced a
world of paradise.

700
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,237
Because she fell into the lake?

701
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,867
After she met the
Great Jade Emperor,

702
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,436
she transformed into a fairy.

703
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,617
This is good.

704
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:33,617
I'm not simply choosing riders
to carry the food palanquins.

705
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:35,217
I'm choosing storytellers.

706
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:38,817
They're human tabloids who will
spread rumors like a disease.

707
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,856
Pardon?

708
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:44,327
When rumors begin spreading,
it ends up becoming infectious.

709
00:47:44,456 --> 00:47:47,266
It spreads so fast that not even the
person who started them can stop it.

710
00:47:47,626 --> 00:47:50,067
It also evolves in
unexpected ways.

711
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,597
But if she did not
try to commit suicide,

712
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:55,606
that means that the person who
pushed the Queen into the lake...

713
00:47:57,277 --> 00:48:00,277
Does that mean that the
Queen risked her life...

714
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,047
to save the concubine
who tried to kill her?

715
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,117
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my goodness.

716
00:48:10,086 --> 00:48:11,617
I suddenly have chills.

717
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:15,487
You must really
get some rest now.

718
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,327
This will not do. I will
carry you if I must.

719
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:20,626
Gosh. All right.

720
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:23,797
Now that Court Lady Choi
doesn't nag me, you do.

721
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:26,097
Is there a law of
conservation of nagging?

722
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:30,836
I haven't seen Court Lady
Choi for a while now.

723
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:33,036
It's so cold.

724
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,376
Can you hug me a bit
tighter? It's cold.

725
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,286
Your Highness!

726
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:20,456
How could you hurt yourself?

727
00:49:20,456 --> 00:49:23,896
Do you want to see
me lose my mind?

728
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:27,097
How could you go
swimming with the King?

729
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:30,536
Do you intend to put
the nation in danger?

730
00:49:30,536 --> 00:49:32,597
A talisman? A ritual?

731
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:36,036
You must not participate
in such superstitions.

732
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:39,936
You must not speak
like that either!

733
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:42,876
Everything from 1 to 10,

734
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:47,246
you must not do any of it!

735
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:02,396
I do not feel refreshed
even after doing this.

736
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:06,297
If I nag her, Her
Highness will be troubled.

737
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:11,277
If I do not nag
her, I am troubled.

738
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:16,806
What can I do about this?

739
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:28,527
Your Highness!

740
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,140
- Did you hear the rumors?
- Pardon?

741
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,350
Everyone in the Palace
is talking about it.

742
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:37,350
They said that the
Queen risked her life...

743
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,080
to save you, who
tried to kill her.

744
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:41,120
Who would say such things?

745
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,721
Did the Queen say that?

746
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,991
She changed the rumors that she
was the witch of the royal villa...

747
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:49,330
to say that she is like Buddha,
a fairy, and a virtuous woman.

748
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,861
She managed to get everyone
to change their tune.

749
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:57,671
From now on, people will curse you
and say you are a wicked woman.

750
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:02,210
This was her plan
from the start.

751
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,241
She came to see me at Seoneonjeon
Hall, and she threatened me.

752
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:07,511
This was why.

753
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,680
I will visit with the
King and tell him...

754
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,921
so that he does not get fooled
by the Queen's lies anymore.

755
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:17,051
I am not sure about that.

756
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:21,631
Will he believe in what you say?

757
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,261
The King will believe
in what I tell him.

758
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,201
The King rejected the appeal
for the Queen's dethronement.

759
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:37,310
The Royal Noble
Consort Eui is here.

760
00:51:42,451 --> 00:51:43,511
Hwa Jin.

761
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:48,850
I was about to visit you as I had
something to discuss with you.

762
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:52,020
What did you want to
speak with me about?

763
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,160
During today's council
before the throne,

764
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,401
I received an appeal for
the Queen's dethronement.

765
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,330
Is that so?

766
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,270
The Queen was put in
danger in order to save us,

767
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,870
and I thought it would not
be right to stay quiet.

768
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:10,741
So I would like to ask the Royal
Secretariat to withdraw it.

769
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:12,540
Is that okay with you?

770
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,210
Do you want me to ask my father?

771
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:19,850
He is highly respected,
and many people follow him.

772
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:24,991
Is this a hard request?

773
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:29,960
No, it is not.

774
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,201
I will write a message
to my father myself.

775
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,531
Thank you.

776
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:36,701
Your Majesty.

777
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:40,540
There is something I have
always wanted when I came here.

778
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,310
Just like when we first met,
I hope you can forget...

779
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,180
all the things you fear
when you are with me.

780
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,511
I want to be that
kind of person to you.

781
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:54,221
You are already a
big comfort to me.

782
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,620
I apologize,

783
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:00,991
but we have not spent
the night together yet.

784
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:08,131
I have made you lonely.

785
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:11,241
I know that you have been busy.

786
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:12,770
I was not thinking straight.

787
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:15,441
I will visit your
chamber tonight.

788
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,441
However, you and the
Queen are supposed...

789
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:20,810
to spend the night
together tomorrow.

790
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,350
Do not worry about that.

791
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:27,080
Then I shall meet
her to comfort her.

792
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,691
And I will write a
letter right after that.

793
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:30,551
Good idea.

794
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,631
Royal Noble Consort Eui
is here to see the Queen.

795
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:43,801
I apologize. Her
Highness has a cold,

796
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:45,901
so she took some herbal tonic...

797
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:47,571
and just fell asleep.

798
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,870
Too bad.

799
00:53:50,511 --> 00:53:51,640
I will come back another time.

800
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,060
You're here.

801
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:10,191
You were fast asleep like a
puppy napping in spring...

802
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,370
I heard you are
not feeling well.

803
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,310
I'm not feeling the greatest,

804
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,451
but I have no regrets since it
was for the sake of justice.

805
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,180
- "Justice"?
- Let's not stand around here.

806
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,850
Come on in.

807
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:44,031
Give us some privacy so...

808
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:47,201
I mean, so we can
relax and catch up.

809
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,151
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

810
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,091
Why are you sitting so far away?

811
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:20,160
This makes me feel
distant from you.

812
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:23,000
Come closer.

813
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,131
No, I am okay here.

814
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,540
Then I shall come closer.

815
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:32,241
I showed up like a prince
and saved her life,

816
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:34,781
so those cold eyes should
be filled with love now...

817
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,721
What? How come...

818
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:42,250
The look in your
eyes has changed,

819
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,921
but why colder than before?

820
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:48,191
I will withdraw the appeal.

821
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:52,430
So I am no longer
indebted to you.

822
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,830
Thank you.

823
00:55:56,171 --> 00:55:59,971
I bet you are thinking that
everything is going your way.

824
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,310
No, I'm not.

825
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:04,511
Nothing's going my way.

826
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,441
You lost His Majesty
because of those lies,

827
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,951
so you will lie to get him back?

828
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:10,111
What are you talking about?

829
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,551
I'm not the most honest
person, but I never lie.

830
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:16,491
I knew you would play dumb.

831
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:18,691
No, I'm not playing dumb.

832
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:23,430
And I've told you
numerous times.

833
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,000
I really have no interest
in the King whatsoever.

834
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,730
All right, then.

835
00:56:30,571 --> 00:56:32,770
I will trust you on that.

836
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:37,810
Why don't we do something tonight
to build a stronger friendship?

837
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,241
How about a pajama party...

838
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:42,281
I mean, an undergarment party.

839
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:45,821
I am spending the
night with His Majesty.

840
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,551
Why?

841
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:50,850
And on top of that,

842
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:54,191
did you really have to
tell me this in person?

843
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:57,460
This bluntly? In
this hurtful manner?

844
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:01,971
You seem quite upset for someone
who has no interest whatsoever.

845
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:03,531
I said I had no
interest in the King.

846
00:57:03,531 --> 00:57:05,671
I never said I wasn't
interested in you.

847
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:09,071
Prove to me that your
kindness toward me is sincere.

848
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:12,841
If your words and actions
fail to match once again,

849
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,980
I, too, will fight
with all my might.

850
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,821
Since you're so determined,
I should give up.

851
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:25,660
Okay, fine.

852
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:29,861
I'll give up and send my
blessings to the two of you.

853
00:57:30,631 --> 00:57:32,031
It's your loss.

854
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,301
Too bad you failed to
recognize my charm.

855
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,770
I shall leave now.

856
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:50,011
She's a difficult one.

857
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:54,651
That cruel woman.

858
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:14,571
15, 20...

859
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,511
How can I help you?

860
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:26,520
I feel awfully frustrated
and distressed.

861
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:29,921
I am here to heal
my frustrated heart.

862
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:32,591
You came to the wrong place.

863
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:35,761
We sell pretty much
everything here,

864
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,960
but we don't sell medicine.

865
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,361
I have to close up now.

866
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:41,801
Please. This way.

867
00:58:43,131 --> 00:58:44,870
- Well...
- This way, please.

868
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:48,870
That precious thing.

869
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:50,810
What?

870
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:56,210
You know, that precious
object from Qing.

871
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:39,921
I asked the two of you to
meet with me to go over...

872
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,330
what was discussed at
the royal conference.

873
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,531
How dare they discuss
the deposal of the Queen?

874
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:47,930
They are attacking the
entire Andong Kim clan!

875
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:50,631
The royal court with a queen...

876
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:53,000
who can jump into
the lake anytime.

877
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:55,241
How precarious!

878
00:59:56,671 --> 00:59:58,341
How dare you slander the Queen?

879
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,551
You'd better not run
your mouth like that.

880
01:00:01,551 --> 01:00:02,910
Run my mouth?

881
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,951
I did not come here to put
up with such an insult.

882
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,901
What are you doing?

883
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,100
Are you trying to provoke me?

884
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,611
I am simply asking you
to stay to hear the rest.

885
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,210
You little...

886
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:51,131
Like I mentioned earlier, no
one in this room is losing.

887
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,801
So would you please
stay and hear me out?

888
01:00:58,801 --> 01:00:59,941
Have a seat.

889
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,991
I am not sure if you
would remember this.

890
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:23,361
The letter Queen Dowager sent
to Royal Noble Consort Eui.

891
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,631
The location, date, and time
written in this letter...

892
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,930
coincide with when and where
the Queen's accident took place.

893
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:32,701
That letter is fake.

894
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:35,511
Can you prove that it is fake?

895
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,680
This letter and the appeal
for the Queen's dethronement.

896
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,951
I would like us to
exchange the two.

897
01:01:47,821 --> 01:01:49,790
This deal will ensure
that the two families...

898
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,020
will never have to be distressed
about the same issue again.

899
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,230
That is my offer.

900
01:01:58,031 --> 01:01:59,261
What do you say?

901
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:19,821
Did Your Highness ask for me?

902
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,921
I wrote the letter His
Majesty had asked me to write.

903
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,290
Could you deliver
this to my father?

904
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,460
I will...

905
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,060
persuade His Majesty.

906
01:02:34,401 --> 01:02:38,301
His Majesty is genuinely
trying to return the favor.

907
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:41,310
Although the Queen is probably
feeling differently about it.

908
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:46,011
However, what matters to me
is how His Majesty feels.

909
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:50,381
So it is okay.

910
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:55,221
Your Highness, we are
ready for your bath.

911
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,451
So far, it is okay.

912
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:33,421
Queen Dowager.

913
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:35,960
Has everything
been well with you?

914
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:40,261
No, I have not been well. That
is why I asked to see you.

915
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,770
I feel awfully anxious
and worried again.

916
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:50,011
Please calm down.

917
01:03:51,111 --> 01:03:53,710
I will help you find the
answer you are looking for.

918
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:21,870
His Majesty is getting ready to
visit Her Highness's chamber.

919
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,370
I must speak to His Majesty.

920
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,011
Give us some privacy.

921
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,781
Yes, Your Majesty.

922
01:04:37,151 --> 01:04:39,120
Deposing the Queen will grant
us the chance we needed.

923
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:42,160
Your Majesty, why are
you trying to stop it?

924
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,691
Even if we go that route,

925
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:45,631
she will simply be
replaced with someone else.

926
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:49,401
The Queen has been making
decisions that are in favor of us.

927
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:51,270
Out of everyone who can
occupy that position,

928
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,100
she is the best option for us.

929
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,071
Is she making you waver?

930
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,480
Please answer my question.
Is she making you waver?

931
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,421
Yes.

932
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:07,721
She is.

933
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:12,091
She risked her life to save her
husband, who had tried to kill her,

934
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:14,290
as well as the woman her
husband is in love with.

935
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,830
Not because she is
boundlessly merciful,

936
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,091
and not because she
has forgiven me.

937
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:19,560
She did it because she could
not turn away from the truth.

938
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,100
She never even expected me
to apologize or thank her.

939
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,770
She quietly did what she thought
was right for justice's sake,

940
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,540
and this crisis has
befallen her now.

941
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,071
So how could I not waver?

942
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,011
Will you betray Royal
Noble Consort Eui...

943
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,651
as well as us?

944
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:43,421
I do not have any romantic
feelings for the Queen.

945
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:46,160
She is simply not our enemy.

946
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,631
Hence, I am not
betraying anyone.

947
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,060
You are growing fond of
her, which is dangerous.

948
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,361
If you are fond of her,

949
01:05:54,361 --> 01:05:56,531
it will be used against us.

950
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,640
I will make sure
that never happens.

951
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,701
Fine.

952
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,571
Then please promise
me this one thing.

953
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:06,941
If the Queen's stance
and attitude change,

954
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:10,611
or if she turns out to
be one of our enemies,

955
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,520
will you...

956
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,651
not hesitate...

957
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,161
to behead her?

958
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:48,590
Can you not answer
this question?

959
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:50,121
If the Queen...

960
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:54,461
indeed turns out to
be one of our enemies,

961
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,430
I will behead her
with my own two hands.

962
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:19,050
My gosh, looks like I'm
already getting better at this.

963
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,420
Did you seriously
do that by hand?

964
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,590
When it comes to embroidery,
every woman in Joseon...

965
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,560
is as skilled as I am...

966
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,991
DESCENDANTS OF THE BRIGHT LAND

967
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:31,361
Well, I guess not.

968
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:35,901
Not everyone has to be
skilled in embroidery.

969
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:39,600
You're good at everything
on top of being so strong.

970
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,670
I was considered a weakling
among the servants.

971
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,510
Everyone tells me that
I look like a violet.

972
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:51,380
My gosh, everyone in Joseon
is such a skilled craftsman.

973
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,251
Let's see now.

974
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,920
- Pull it.
- Okay.

975
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:02,961
DESCENDANTS OF THE BRIGHT
LAND INAUGURATION CEREMONY

976
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,100
We'll put this up in front
of the Royal Stables.

977
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:08,531
We'll begin operating
the business right away.

978
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:10,970
Shall we charge for delivery?

979
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,970
I need some cash
to go to Oktajeong.

980
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,300
Your Highness.

981
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,140
I brought you a wind
orchid, which is very rare.

982
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,241
Wind orchid?

983
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,050
Did word get out about my
inauguration ceremony already?

984
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:25,920
Who sent me this?

985
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:29,850
CONGRATULATIONS, NO TOUCHING

986
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:33,420
It is from His Majesty.

987
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:39,430
My gosh, no!

988
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:41,871
That jerk.

989
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:44,071
I'm trying to focus on work
to forget about everything.

990
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,041
Is he showing off or what?

991
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,611
I'm a thousand times better.

992
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:52,180
I mean, look at this. It's
such a brilliant idea.

993
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,281
I'm creating jobs, which
the King can't even do.

994
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:56,651
During the Joseon period where the
notion of convenience doesn't exist.

995
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,321
I've invented this
amazing service.

996
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:04,191
Does she feel intimidated
because I'm so amazing?

997
01:09:04,951 --> 01:09:06,791
Well, that's understandable.

998
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:08,661
Whatever.

999
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:12,831
Did hearing all this
obnoxious nonsense...

1000
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:17,470
ruin my palate? Why can I
not get the taste right?

1001
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:19,741
Hold on.

1002
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:23,911
Since the concept of convenience
doesn't even exist in Joseon,

1003
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:27,380
whatever I do will be
considered Joseon's first...

1004
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,180
No, the world's first!

1005
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:08,180
I feel so motivated
all of a sudden.

1006
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,291
So here, I can be Thomas
Edison and Steve Jobs?

1007
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:15,161
No. Is there anyone who
achieved even greater things?

1008
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:18,361
A hero who saved mankind.

1009
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:33,081
Inside the Queen's body,

1010
01:10:34,781 --> 01:10:37,880
I see something that
should not be there.

1011
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:40,480
A wicked soul.

1012
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:46,520
She is possessed
by a wicked soul!

1013
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:51,930
You must do
something about this.

1014
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,060
If not, the world...

1015
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:02,071
The world will be
thrown upside down!

1016
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,081
Yes, Willis Carrier.

1017
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:09,310
The man who invented the
first air conditioner.

1018
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:17,350
Your Highness!

1019
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,791
Wake up, Your
Highness! Please...

1020
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:20,791
Your Highness!

1021
01:11:21,461 --> 01:11:23,060
Hey, move!

1022
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,970
She is... She is not breathing.

1023
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:40,241
I do not feel any pulse.

1024
01:11:55,755 --> 01:11:56,755
MR. QUEEN

1025
01:11:56,755 --> 01:11:57,995
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, FAMILIES,

1026
01:11:57,995 --> 01:11:59,094
DYNASTIES, AND EVENTS ARE

1027
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:17,780
<i>The Queen is unconscious.</i>

1028
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,750
<i>You mean, she has
stopped breathing?</i>

1029
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,591
<i>If her qi energy returns,
she will live. But if not...</i>

1030
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:24,721
<i>The hospital? Wait, am I back?</i>

1031
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:26,521
<i>I will show you...</i>

1032
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,431
<i>what kind of man
the King truly is.</i>

1033
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:32,761
<i>The eyes of a man who is
hiding his true colors.</i>

1034
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:34,361
<i>Clear. Shock!</i>

1035
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:40,200
<i>- My Queen.
- The investigation will begin now.</i>

1036
01:12:40,301 --> 01:12:41,441
<i>Stop.</i>

1037
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,471
<i>She is my woman.</i>
