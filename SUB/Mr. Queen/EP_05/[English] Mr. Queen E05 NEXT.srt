00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,121
EPISODE 5

4
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,461
Everyone has a fatal weakness.

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,870
Even Superman becomes nothing
more than a pervert...

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,641
who wears underwear on the outside
when faced with kryptonite.

7
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,111
If Superman becomes like that,

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,980
imagine what would happen
to ordinary people.

9
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:49,861
I will tell you the truth.

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,760
Grand Queen Dowager, I
will obey your order!

11
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,630
She is not the one who
should be beheaded!

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,370
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,070
Please.

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,880
Will you go against
the King's order?

15
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,861
To an ordinary person, this world
is like a minefield of weakness.

16
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,660
We become one
another's weakness...

17
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,671
and drag everyone
to the underworld.

18
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,910
Even someone as perfect as me,
Jang Bong Hwan, had a weakness.

19
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,111
That is none other than...

20
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,850
I can't bear to see some other
guy looking cooler than me.

21
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,850
Those who tried to
harm the Queen were...

22
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,891
Wait!

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,591
Especially when it's in front
of a woman I'm interested in.

24
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,731
I need to be the coolest person
in front of them to be satisfied.

25
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:02,501
You could say it's
the only weakness...

26
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,270
of someone who is so perfect.

27
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,320
Since I am the alleged
victim of this incident,

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,290
allow me to shed
light on the truth.

29
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,160
I...

30
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,190
was trying to take my own life.

31
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,501
I won't let you be the
only cool one here.

32
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,540
Stay still, Cheoljong.

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,640
I should be the hero.

34
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,410
So please do not hurt those
who did nothing wrong.

35
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,850
Nice one.

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,521
What kind of a ludicrous
statement is this?

37
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,021
Grand Queen Dowager.

38
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:01,961
I apologize, but I was
trying to end my own life.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
"DESERT YOUR FALSE SELF"

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,501
This is the suicide note that
I carry with me all the time.

41
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,301
I am going back tonight anyway.

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,711
I don't care if things
get chaotic here.

43
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:20,940
Why on earth would you do that?

44
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,781
Furthermore, why would you
try to end your life...

45
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,781
on the night before
you became queen?

46
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,681
The thing is...

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,621
What on earth is the reason?

48
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,561
The reason why I was so depressed
that I wanted to die was...

49
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,531
I'm sure I had a reason.

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,831
Your Highness!

51
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,140
Darn it!

52
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,841
Your Highness!

53
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,871
So Yong.

54
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:07,260
Is he going to
carry me right now?

55
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,561
Don't.

56
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,461
Don't come near me. Go away!

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,781
Grand Queen Dowager.

58
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,691
The Queen is saying
false things...

59
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,261
in order to save the life
of someone lesser than her.

60
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,761
Please look fondly upon
the virtuous heart...

61
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,031
of forgiving someone who had
committed a great sin against her,

62
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,560
and show mercy.

63
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,401
Oh, my. Is that how
he translated it?

64
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,761
What is so interesting that
so many people have gathered?

65
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,531
Your...

66
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,031
Your Highness.

67
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:30,610
What on earth has happened?

68
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:33,511
All right then.

69
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,211
Since the Queen
is trying so hard,

70
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,781
I will show mercy after
seeing her efforts.

71
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,881
EPISODE 5, A HEEL THAT
CAN EASILY GET HURT

72
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,091
It has been a while since we had
such an interesting spectacle.

73
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:22,321
I wonder what the Queen was
thinking when doing that.

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
Perhaps it is the
heart of a woman.

75
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:29,031
Regardless, we can be sure that it
was not a plan from the Kim clan.

76
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,060
Yes.

77
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,831
Are you going to
Seoneonjeon Hall?

78
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:37,000
I need something other
than prayer today.

79
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,410
She is nothing but a
weak Royal Noble Consort,

80
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,781
but she is our only arrow.

81
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:46,151
So we must put some
poison on that arrowhead.

82
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Goodness.

83
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,910
What do you mean she
tried to end her life?

84
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:17,410
What do you mean by that?

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,750
I need to bide my time and
wake up at the right moment.

86
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,881
I am such a foolish father
to not realize that.

87
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,091
I have committed a great sin.

88
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,891
I have committed a great sin.

89
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,191
It is all my fault.

90
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,060
I should have taken
better care of her.

91
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,930
This is all because
I am lacking.

92
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,670
What on earth is the reason?

93
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:40,870
You should know since you
assist her in close proximity.

94
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,670
She would try to jump into the water
multiple times whenever she could,

95
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,281
and I thought it was because
of the shock from falling in.

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,881
"Multiple times"?

97
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,850
How much was she suffering?

98
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,050
Your Highness.

99
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,420
Your Highness.

100
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,100
My gosh. Enough already.

101
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,430
If you keep crying,
I can't wake up.

102
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:17,310
This is not the time
for us to be crying.

103
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,040
If she sees us crying,

104
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,151
imagine how upset she would be.

105
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,381
That's right.

106
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,110
You are right.

107
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,221
At times like this, we must
stand by her side and be brave.

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,421
Should I get up now?

109
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,791
- So Yong.
- My gosh.

110
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,390
When your mother
gave birth to you,

111
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:44,071
she lost her life.

112
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,201
Is he starting again?

113
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:51,941
Your Highness.

114
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,010
Her Highness grew up...

115
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:58,480
without ever getting the chance
to see her mother's face.

116
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,551
I feel so bad for her.

117
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,520
I had no idea that she
was suffering so much,

118
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,051
and all I did was telling her
she could not do this or that.

119
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,561
I would chase after her...

120
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:14,161
and nag her all the time.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,500
I might as well have been...

122
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:22,171
the person who pushed
her into the lake.

123
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,010
Goodness, Your Highness.

124
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,480
Your Highness!

125
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,411
I give up.

126
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,750
This is not a
situation I can handle.

127
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,951
GWANGHWAMUN

128
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,671
My Queen.

129
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,980
Please..

130
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,280
take care of yourself.

131
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,451
Your pathetic father...

132
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,221
apologizes to you.

133
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,071
Byeong In.

134
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,071
I am entering the Palace today.

135
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,941
I am finally meeting the
King for the first time.

136
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,010
Are you that happy?

137
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,821
It is because I am curious.

138
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,451
One day, he appears
as an ugly fool,

139
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,120
and on a different day, he looks
as though he was made from jade.

140
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,291
In my dreams.

141
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Last night, he looked
exactly like you.

142
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:04,140
I believed that I had to give
up on you to make you happy.

143
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:08,880
You were so happy before
you entered the Palace.

144
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:12,451
However, after entering the Palace,
you tried to end your own life.

145
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,390
Is it because of that?

146
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,110
She is crazy! She
has lost her mind!

147
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,980
"DESERT YOUR FALSE SELF"

148
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,850
She spent the past few nights with
the King. Are you sure that...

149
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,221
she was not the one who was
won over instead of the King?

150
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,421
Please calm down, Your Highness.

151
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,561
There is nothing to be
gained from being mad.

152
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,890
How can I not be mad?

153
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,661
We lost the perfect opportunity
like this so easily.

154
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,801
I cannot believe we shot
ourselves in the foot!

155
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,500
Furthermore, did you see the
King's behavior just now?

156
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,171
That arrogant glare.

157
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:12,671
I saved him from living his days
as a countryman and made him king,

158
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,980
yet he dared to rebel
against me like that?

159
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,880
We must discipline
him if he rebels.

160
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,880
I will tighten the reigns,
so he knows his place.

161
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,661
What is the point of spending
time taking care of myself?

162
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,461
It all falls apart when I
worry over something once.

163
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,630
Call for Park, the doctor.

164
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,130
Yes, sir.

165
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:47,071
To be honest, the
Queen came to see me...

166
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,350
on the night she
fell into the lake.

167
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:59,650
Grand Queen Dowager. I...

168
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,691
will leave the Palace.

169
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,860
What are you talking about?

170
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,600
I cannot endure the
position of Queen.

171
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,831
I do not want to
live in such misery.

172
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:18,671
I had heard the rumors that
you have been acting atrocious,

173
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,341
but it was all on purpose...

174
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,181
so that you would
not become Queen.

175
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,880
How cute.

176
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,280
I cannot believe you thought you
could get your way like that.

177
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,951
You were taking your lessons
diligently to become a queen.

178
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,821
I do not know what
suddenly changed your mind,

179
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,490
but I do not wish
to know either.

180
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,431
Your fate was decided
upon your birth.

181
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,161
You were to become queen
and serve your family.

182
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:45,571
That is your fate and
the reason you exist.

183
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,071
Did you rise to your
position on your own?

184
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:51,140
No, you did not.

185
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,380
That is why you cannot step
down on your own either.

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,411
If you want to die,
die in the Palace.

187
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,780
I thought she said such things
because kids these days are...

188
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,081
too sheltered they make a
big deal out of small things.

189
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:06,120
That is why I did not
give it much thought.

190
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,561
I never considered that she jumped
into the lake to commit suicide.

191
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,500
If she was willing to end her
life to avoid becoming queen,

192
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,530
her crazy behavior
today is also...

193
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,870
A way to step down from
her position as Queen.

194
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,171
If that is the case,

195
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,880
I will not let the
Queen get away with it.

196
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,911
Wait for me! What if you fall?

197
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,650
I told you that you
could take your time.

198
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,061
Who dares to block my way?

199
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,701
Grand Queen Dowager?

200
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:51,431
You will not be able to go home.

201
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,541
- What?
- The Queen, Jang Bong Hwan,

202
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:58,811
has been ordered to stay here
forever until the day he rots,

203
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,681
and live in pain
while being impotent.

204
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:12,551
No.

205
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:15,421
I don't want to.

206
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,831
I don't want to be impotent!

207
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,230
Your Highness!

208
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,600
What a terrible nightmare.

209
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:32,370
You tried to commit
suicide in the lake...

210
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,041
and just now, you fainted
and I was so worried...

211
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,711
Calm down. I understand
how you feel.

212
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:39,951
I am going to die with you!

213
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,661
That's enough already.

214
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:52,461
I've already reached the max amount
of tears I can handle for a day.

215
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,561
It's not like it's contagious,
but how can you cry three times?

216
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,530
I ended up falling asleep
while waiting for you to stop.

217
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,801
Right. I am sure you do
not wish to see me cry.

218
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,770
You are pretty when you smile.

219
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,250
What about Court Lady Choi?

220
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,321
She insisted on bringing
your medicine herself.

221
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:21,061
Great Lord Yeongeun
stayed by your side...

222
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:23,191
and returned home when
the sun went down.

223
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,561
If you woke up a bit sooner,
you could have seen him.

224
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:29,161
Thank goodness I didn't see him.

225
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:30,860
Pardon?

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,870
If he finds out
that a guy's soul...

227
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,801
is occupying his
precious daughter's body,

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,600
he would be so upset.

229
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,870
Let's hurry before Court
Lady Choi comes back.

230
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,880
I'm sure the lake is
filled now, right?

231
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,510
You want to go to the
lake at this hour?

232
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:47,921
Today is finally the day.

233
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,760
- You are in a good mood now, right?
- Of course.

234
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,061
All I have left to do
is to go back home...

235
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,961
and leave an afterglow
of a handsome man.

236
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,791
Oh, right.

237
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,900
- Hong Yeon.
- Yes, Your Highness.

238
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,931
I was able to endure
this thanks to you.

239
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,441
I don't know about anyone
else, but I'll miss you.

240
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,740
Oh, that's right. I'll
miss Court Lady Choi too.

241
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,181
Hong Yeon. There's a will you
must leave for your descendants.

242
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,310
A will?

243
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,681
Buy land in Gangnam.

244
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,320
You have to tell them this.

245
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,151
If you leave it for
about 200 years,

246
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,121
your future generations
will live wealthy.

247
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:32,530
This is all I can give you.

248
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,201
Okay, let's go.

249
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,340
Your Highness.
Please be careful.

250
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:44,411
Keep up your energy.

251
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,480
Hurry. You must hurry.

252
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,121
What is this?

253
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,691
Why did you go back
to the old method...

254
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:01,221
when I created a
perfect system for you?

255
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:02,461
The thing is...

256
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:05,891
The well has dried up.

257
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,000
That is why we have been
getting water from over there...

258
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,530
and bringing it
over here, but...

259
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,401
Can you tell me that again?
I think I misheard you.

260
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:21,980
It sounds like you're telling me you
won't be able to fill it by today.

261
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,611
Please forgive
us, Your Highness.

262
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:27,050
- Please forgive us, Your Highness.
- Please forgive us, Your Highness.

263
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:34,421
A high-ranking government
official must keep his promises.

264
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,790
You said you would
fill the lake by today.

265
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,090
The closest well from here...

266
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:42,601
is still far away.

267
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,101
It will take at least
a week and a half...

268
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,800
Please kill me!

269
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,540
- Please kill me!
- Please kill me!

270
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,080
- Please kill me!
- Please kill me!

271
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,211
Why do you guys always
ask to be killed?

272
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,621
Is it because you don't
believe I'll actually kill you?

273
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,721
Do you want me to show you
what behavioral integrity is?

274
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:07,290
Do you want to face the consequences
of depositing a fake check?

275
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,060
Forget it. I'm sure it will still
work even if it's not filled.

276
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,101
No, Your Highness.

277
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,671
Why are you acting
like this too?

278
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:22,401
I will not allow you
to end your life again.

279
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,671
It's not like that.

280
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,671
I'm not trying to die.

281
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,111
Then what are you trying to do?

282
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,381
Well...

283
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:34,050
I'm trying to live. This
is the only way I can live!

284
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,520
You can go after
you kill me first!

285
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:44,691
Gosh. How come you're so strong?

286
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,131
Let go of me.

287
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:48,101
If that granny
changes her mind...

288
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:51,770
and gets rid of the water in
the lake again, I'm doomed!

289
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,000
Everyone, stop Her Highness!

290
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,601
How dare we touch Her Highness?

291
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,540
Your Highness!

292
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,941
Please no!

293
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,641
I will stop nagging
you from now on!

294
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,151
I will never say no to you!

295
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:07,211
You cannot do this,
Your Highness!

296
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:08,421
You said you wouldn't.

297
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,351
You said you wouldn't
say no to me!

298
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:12,391
Darn it.

299
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,691
You cannot do that.

300
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,330
Even if you tickle me...

301
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,211
I have lost my ability
to laugh a long time ago.

302
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,050
Darn it.

303
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:40,881
I won't do it. Forget it.

304
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,280
Darn it.

305
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,721
Gosh. Darn it.

306
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,391
So you don't want me
to go in there, right?

307
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,530
Fine.

308
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,171
Raise your head.

309
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:07,871
Straighten your back.

310
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,451
Can you swim?

311
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,260
Is that it?

312
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,891
If I go farther, the
water will be deeper.

313
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,601
Okay. Go ahead.

314
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:35,800
- Gosh.
- Yes, that's it!

315
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,540
I slipped!

316
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,881
- Darn it.
- Your Highness.

317
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,980
The Grand Queen Dowager asked
for your attendance immediately.

318
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:49,721
Darn it.

319
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,590
Lee Saeng Mang. That name
was my foreshadowing.

320
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,361
Darn it.

321
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,790
- My gosh.
- Goodness. Nice.

322
00:21:58,431 --> 00:21:59,530
Good.

323
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,361
What is wrong?

324
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,901
Do you get this kind of
feeling too from time to time?

325
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,971
You know, everyone is busy
doing something except for me.

326
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,810
You are the center
of my world, my lord.

327
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,651
Well, people who have
great hunches like me...

328
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:21,881
sometimes get the
wrong hunch like today.

329
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,490
I did not order naengmyeon.

330
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,921
You give me the pleasure
of serving you every night.

331
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,161
It is from my heart.

332
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:34,461
Let me say something.

333
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:37,030
It might seem to you I am here to
have fun, but that is not true.

334
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:44,141
I am only here because I need
to find out the whereabouts...

335
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:45,911
of Lee Saeng Mang
who had disappeared.

336
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,740
But why are you desperately
looking for that man?

337
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,681
I get the feeling
that there is...

338
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:57,451
an important secret
behind his disappearance.

339
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,351
My sixth sense tells me...

340
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,361
that Lee Saeng Mang...

341
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:06,230
is at the center of the problem.

342
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,661
- What problem?
- I do not know.

343
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,601
Pardon?

344
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,911
They are testing me right now.

345
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:27,881
- About today...
- It is my fault.

346
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,621
For forcing you to marry him
when you did not want to.

347
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:39,730
Do you not want to be
the Queen that badly?

348
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,901
Enough to throw
away your own life?

349
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,730
Enough to be deposed
as the Queen?

350
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,270
She tried to end her life because
she didn't want to be the Queen?

351
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,540
Fine.

352
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,340
As you desperately want it, I
will let you leave the palace.

353
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,840
I will depose you.

354
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,441
You will be stuck at your
house and never be able to...

355
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,280
set foot outside for
the rest of your life.

356
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,510
No.

357
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,750
I can only go back
through the lake here.

358
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,651
I do not remember it.

359
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:08,691
I have not regained my memories
since falling into the lake.

360
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:10,560
You have not regained
your memories,

361
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,290
but you remember that you
wanted to kill yourself?

362
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,830
I still have painful feelings.

363
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,601
And I am sure that I was the one
who embroidered the suicide note.

364
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:23,340
But I do not know why I
wanted to kill myself.

365
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,441
If you have not
regained your memories,

366
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,411
why did you interfere?

367
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,810
As you cannot give me a reason,

368
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,711
I take that you just
wanted to go against me.

369
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:35,721
No.

370
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,421
I do not have any
intention to oppose you.

371
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:41,760
Today, you have directly
challenged my authority.

372
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,691
I must get out of this.

373
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,861
But I don't have a solution.
Gosh, I can't think of one.

374
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,060
And I cannot forgive you for it.

375
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,171
I deserve death, Your Highness.

376
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,971
You ought to end my life.

377
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,240
I am confused due to
the lack of my memories,

378
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,010
but I cannot turn my
back on my family...

379
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,980
or my husband.

380
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,881
Please punish me...

381
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,651
with poison, so I
can end this pain.

382
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:17,721
What they really want
isn't deposing the Queen.

383
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,861
Is it that easy for you
to give up on your life?

384
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,230
You jumped into
the lake yourself.

385
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,701
And now, you want
to drink the poison?

386
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,201
Why are you so weak?

387
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:29,141
They want to confirm that they
have power over the Queen.

388
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,300
My foolish decision
to end my life...

389
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,371
caused this whole
misunderstanding.

390
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:35,681
My action deserves death.

391
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,580
So I beg you to punish me
with death, Your Highness.

392
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,121
Your death will
not fix anything.

393
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,550
The Queen Dowager will have...

394
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,820
an advantage over you
because of this incident.

395
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,020
But this goes beyond you.

396
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,790
This will be a disadvantage
against the entire Kim clan.

397
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,601
- I will try...
- Please calm down.

398
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,310
I will ask this one last
time, Your Highness.

399
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:11,510
Do you truly want
to leave the palace?

400
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,080
I want to...

401
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,721
live in the palace.

402
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,861
What do you think,
Your Highness?

403
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:34,300
As I do not hold any old memories,
I have been born a new person.

404
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,441
I will become the perfect queen.

405
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,211
I do not believe promises
that come in words.

406
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:48,080
I will show you with my actions.

407
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:52,691
Please give her a
chance, Your Highness.

408
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,020
Okay.

409
00:26:57,191 --> 00:27:00,530
I am truly grateful
for your kindness.

410
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:04,401
I will never worry
you from now on.

411
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:06,601
I am not worried.

412
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:11,540
"DESERT YOUR FALSE SELF"

413
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,971
Because we do not
have any weaknesses.

414
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,480
If there is a problem,

415
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,951
we can carve it out.

416
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:34,631
He meant it.

417
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,431
It's a real warning.

418
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:53,636
It's so dark.

419
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:57,606
Should I bring more
lanterns, Your Highness?

420
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,475
No. I was talking
about my future.

421
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:10,786
Prince Yeongpyeong raided
the place with his men.

422
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:12,655
"His men"?

423
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:14,856
Were they royal guards?

424
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:17,425
They were specially trained.

425
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:18,655
How many?

426
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:20,626
Not many.

427
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:23,995
- Seven.
- They have been training...

428
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,796
only seven men in hiding?

429
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,205
You are out of medicine.

430
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:36,046
You would've become the best warrior
if it weren't for the disease.

431
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,346
I'm grateful...

432
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:40,116
that I am alive
due to your help.

433
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:42,185
Thank you, my lord.

434
00:28:48,056 --> 00:28:50,755
If you fail once again no
matter what the reason is,

435
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:53,225
you will not get this
medicine anymore.

436
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:55,465
I will keep that in mind.

437
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,276
So far, we thought...

438
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:17,415
the Queen fell into the lake to
frame Royal Noble Consort Eui.

439
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:22,255
We also thought she lied she lost
memories with an ulterior motive.

440
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,786
I cannot believe that she
tried to end her own life.

441
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:27,955
She might have planned all this
to win over you, Your Majesty.

442
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,695
She planned this as she expected
me to stand up for Consort Eui?

443
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:33,636
If you did not come forward,

444
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,405
she could have
framed Her Highness.

445
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:38,136
If you did step up,

446
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:41,036
she could have persuaded you.

447
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:47,445
Prince Yeongpyeong,
you assume...

448
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,786
everything the Queen says and
does is out of hidden malice.

449
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:50,945
The Queen...

450
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,415
is the core of the Kim clan.

451
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,086
What kind of people are they?

452
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:59,596
They are the ones that
killed our whole family.

453
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:01,155
I cannot...

454
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,965
forget it even for a moment.

455
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:09,106
I cannot forget it either.

456
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:11,765
But look at what the Queen
has chosen to do today.

457
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,975
She revealed the truth for
me who tried to kill her...

458
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:18,106
and Royal Noble Consort Eui
she came up against so much.

459
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:22,546
Do you still think your unchanged
hostility towards her...

460
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:25,915
is right?

461
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:30,826
- Your Majesty.
- If it is really a suicide attempt,

462
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:33,626
I killed the Queen twice.

463
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:02,126
Why are you here?

464
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,425
I have something to say.

465
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,796
You made things
complicated for nothing.

466
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:10,126
My fate is already in
your family's hands.

467
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:14,566
Just ask me to hand over
the letter next time.

468
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:17,165
Do you not like me...

469
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,675
because I'm from
the Andong Kim clan?

470
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:22,405
I did not say I do not like you.

471
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:24,646
Do you like me then?

472
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,886
If I were not Andong Kim,

473
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,596
do you think you would have
seen me in a different light?

474
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:40,856
No, I would have not.

475
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,896
You became the Queen because
you are from the Kim clan.

476
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:48,066
I always tried my best.

477
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:51,165
I am not going to be crowned as
queen just because of my name.

478
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:54,475
I dedicated my whole life
to this yet people say...

479
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:59,015
You will get what you
wanted so bad tomorrow.

480
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:03,515
It is late and we have an
important event tomorrow.

481
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:06,086
Please go to your
bed chamber now.

482
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:12,356
You should love me.

483
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:19,536
Is that an order?

484
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:30,745
My coldness pushed
her into the lake.

485
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:36,215
If she tried to end her own
life because of your coldness,

486
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:38,856
she would have fallen
into the lake by herself.

487
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:41,886
But she manipulated the letter
and fell in front of Her Highness.

488
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,985
I see an ulterior motive.

489
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,155
"Motive", you say.

490
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:50,265
I should go to see the Queen.

491
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:54,066
The bad ones come with a smile.

492
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:56,935
If she did that
to change my mind,

493
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:01,005
I would be able to
tell by her attitude.

494
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:04,846
Please take care of Royal
Noble Consort Eui here.

495
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:28,396
Pretending to be a
perfect queen for 15 days.

496
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:30,406
Would I be able to stand it?

497
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:34,236
If it goes wrong, I'll be trapped
in a suffocating woman's body...

498
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:38,376
and imprisoned as a dethroned queen
in the suffocating Joseon era.

499
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:46,086
I dug my own grave.
Who can I blame?

500
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:50,885
Your Highness,
the King has come.

501
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:54,756
Of course, it's Cheoljong.
That punk needs to be blamed.

502
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,225
I wouldn't have stepped up
for her if he didn't act cool.

503
00:33:58,566 --> 00:33:59,595
Open it.

504
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:03,365
Before that, I wouldn't have done
it if he was not incompetent.

505
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:07,736
Even before that, this
woman wouldn't have...

506
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,176
tried to commit suicide
if he was nice to her.

507
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:11,676
- No, even way before that...
- My Queen.

508
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:14,546
How are you feeling?

509
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:19,385
You're that worried about me and
still put a sword to my neck?

510
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:25,495
There's not even one day I felt
comfortable after coming here.

511
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:27,725
As soon as I opened my eyes, they
said tomorrow is the wedding day.

512
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:30,566
My husband who sleeps under the same
blanket with me tries to kill me.

513
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,865
And even the family that was on
my side threatens to dethrone me.

514
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:36,966
What do you mean dethrone?

515
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:38,805
Why? Are you tempted?

516
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:42,705
It's a perfect opportunity to put
Jo Hwa Jin in my place, right?

517
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,805
Why are you so worked
up like a fighting cock?

518
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,245
I did not come to
fight with you.

519
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:50,385
I get angry just by
looking at your face.

520
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:51,546
Don't you think I would?

521
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:52,986
You who tried to kill me,

522
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,385
and your lover
you would die for.

523
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:58,455
I'm about to die as I'm
trying to save you two.

524
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:01,156
Before I kill myself, they will make
me kill myself first at this rate.

525
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:03,426
If I don't get angry
in this situation,

526
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:06,095
am I a human? I'd be Buddha!

527
00:35:08,296 --> 00:35:10,535
You must have so many reasons to
get angry at me. I understand.

528
00:35:10,535 --> 00:35:11,535
No.

529
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,305
Don't try to understand me.

530
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,305
Don't even say...

531
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:17,046
that you understand
after all that.

532
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:20,975
You should've understood me...

533
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,086
before putting a
sword to my neck.

534
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:27,955
No. You should've understood
this woman when she tried to...

535
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:31,955
kill herself on the
night before the wedding.

536
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:36,426
It's late. Your understanding
means nothing now.

537
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:41,236
Hey, get out. I'm too
tired to get angry.

538
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,606
I will come back after your
emotions are stabilized.

539
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,075
Don't come unless you're
going to kneel and beg me.

540
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:56,015
I will come back.

541
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:01,716
I said don't come!

542
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:35,115
Are they filling the
lake with water again?

543
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:40,325
Her Highness requested
Grand Queen Dowager.

544
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,455
Why?

545
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,765
I do not know the reason,

546
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:47,865
but I heard Her Highness
was at the lake today...

547
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:50,966
to supervise it by herself.

548
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,415
Your Majesty.

549
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:10,586
I am sorry for worrying you.

550
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:17,095
I was afraid that
I might lose you.

551
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:23,236
Are you hurt?

552
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,106
Your wound is more
painful to me...

553
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,946
than mine.

554
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:33,816
Today...

555
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:37,586
was very cruel to you, Hwa Jin.

556
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:42,426
I am sorry for dragging
you into this trouble.

557
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:46,196
Thinking how lonely and
painful you must have been...

558
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:48,396
because of the troubles
in the palace...

559
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,825
I did not call you
to share my tragedy.

560
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:53,836
So never do that again.

561
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:57,035
If you sacrifice
yourself to save me,

562
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:59,606
how can I stay sane?

563
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:04,305
I will never do something
that makes you afraid.

564
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:07,646
Until the situation is settled,

565
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:11,046
Prince Yeongpyeong
himself will guard you.

566
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:16,656
How about O Wol?

567
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,356
- Well...
- Special Director Hong has come.

568
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:21,626
Come in.

569
00:38:25,265 --> 00:38:26,635
How is Royal Noble
Consort Eui's maid doing?

570
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:28,535
She is getting treatment
at Royal Infirmary.

571
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,435
My brother did so much for this.

572
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:34,676
Thank you.

573
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,745
Did you meet with the Queen?

574
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:43,385
Yes.

575
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:45,656
- How was she?
- She was angry.

576
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,356
- Pardon?
- She blamed me...

577
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:50,185
for my lack of affection which
forced her to end her life.

578
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:53,055
And she showed hatred
as I tried to kill her.

579
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:55,126
She exploded with her emotions.

580
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,725
To think that she did
this to win me over,

581
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,196
her action does not make sense.

582
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:00,495
On top of that,

583
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:03,765
the Kim clan tried
to depose her.

584
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:07,435
Moreover, Kim Byeong In
has not figured out...

585
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:09,776
that the piece of robe
belongs to Your Majesty.

586
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:11,305
I knew it.

587
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,146
The Queen remained
silent about it.

588
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:15,946
I do not know what
her intention is,

589
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,845
but it does seem the Queen
is acting on her own.

590
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:21,615
I thought I would be able to...

591
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:24,285
figure out what kind of person
she is by her decisions.

592
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:27,225
But she puzzles me even more.

593
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:36,966
Father, this is Byeong In.

594
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:38,205
Yes. Come in.

595
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:50,885
I thought you quit smoking.

596
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,086
I did.

597
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,256
I am sorry about
today's incident.

598
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:05,265
Why would you apologize for it?

599
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:08,066
What do you plan to do?

600
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:11,236
I will try to talk
some sense into her.

601
00:40:11,236 --> 00:40:13,836
And if she fails to
understand, she will be gone.

602
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:18,006
Who are you referring to?

603
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:20,546
It could be anyone.

604
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,115
There is no such thing
as an eternal ally.

605
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:29,885
I am afraid this is not the
right time to bring this up,

606
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:32,026
but I must tell you something.

607
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:34,095
Okay. Go ahead.

608
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:38,696
I have decided on the
magnitude of my dream.

609
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,396
I am happy to hear that.

610
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,265
Which position is it?

611
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:45,236
I will be the head of the
Department of Justice.

612
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,176
The head of the
Department of Justice?

613
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:51,075
Is being a warrior all
you want for your dream?

614
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:54,415
I will start from a position
where I can handle...

615
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,385
and make my own path.

616
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:58,046
Is that so?

617
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:03,086
You are saying, you want
to make your own path?

618
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,696
The Royal Noble
Consort Eui is here.

619
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:18,765
Do not move.

620
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:26,676
Your Highness.

621
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,656
I am sorry.

622
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:37,126
I should have
resisted to the end.

623
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:40,595
Your busted knees are the proof.

624
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:42,865
I know.

625
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,336
They are nothing.

626
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:49,165
With the medicinal
herbs for a few days,

627
00:41:49,535 --> 00:41:51,805
I will be able to
run in no time.

628
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:56,006
Yes. I am sure you will recover.

629
00:41:58,046 --> 00:41:59,946
Who would hurt you so
brutally like this?

630
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:03,915
I could not see anything
as he was wearing a mask.

631
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:07,486
But I do remember his voice.

632
00:42:08,856 --> 00:42:09,885
Your Highness.

633
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:12,285
Please excuse me
for saying this.

634
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:14,926
When people who are not from
the royal family get hurt,

635
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:17,165
they cannot stay in the palace.

636
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:20,535
But how could she leave
the palace in this state?

637
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,705
That is the custom
of the palace.

638
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:26,236
Everything from here
shows no compassion.

639
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:34,915
If anyone tries...

640
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:37,716
to harm you on your way
out, use this as a bribe.

641
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:39,955
Once you get out of the palace,

642
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,955
use this to keep
you comfortable.

643
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:43,626
No. This is too much.

644
00:42:44,785 --> 00:42:46,555
I will send a
letter to my family.

645
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:48,356
Do not worry.

646
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,435
Thank you for your service.

647
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:58,006
I am too ashamed
to face Lord Jo.

648
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:00,305
I cannot go.

649
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:05,006
O Wol, you and I have
grown up together.

650
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:07,745
You are my family.

651
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:10,245
You must hang in there,

652
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,415
for me to do the same.

653
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,055
Be more courageous for me.

654
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,256
You must live.

655
00:43:20,426 --> 00:43:21,696
Do this for me.

656
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:54,325
- What happened?
- It was crazy yesterday.

657
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:55,526
The Queen...

658
00:43:58,595 --> 00:43:59,665
My lord.

659
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:01,995
Did you hear?

660
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:05,635
High Majesty threw daggers with
his eyes at Grand Queen Dowager.

661
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:07,035
His eyes got so big.

662
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:10,406
Hey. You.

663
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:14,515
His Majesty lifted her in
front of the Queen and...

664
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:19,915
Royal Chef, did you hear?

665
00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:23,455
His Majesty held the sword
and the Grand Queen Dowager...

666
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,026
Did you hear what happened
at Donggungjeon Hall?

667
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:29,466
I heard they do
that all the time.

668
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:48,245
The head of the Department of
Justice will be appointed today.

669
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:49,946
"Will be"?

670
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:53,385
We have a request
of an appointment.

671
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:55,515
Who has been recommended...

672
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:58,086
to be the head of the
Department of Justice?

673
00:44:58,426 --> 00:45:01,156
It is Byeong In of
the Andong Kim clan.

674
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,535
That is quite a surprise.

675
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:12,365
I am sure there are many candidates
in the Department of Justice.

676
00:45:12,365 --> 00:45:14,106
If I appoint someone who has
passed the civil service exam...

677
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:15,635
as the head of the
Department of Justice,

678
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:17,406
there will be complaints.
Do you not think so?

679
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:20,376
We unanimously agreed
on this recommendation.

680
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:23,745
"Unanimously"?

681
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:28,816
I did not expect such
harmony among my people.

682
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:33,856
As I have heard, he must
be an excellent individual.

683
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:41,336
The royal notice of appointment
has already been prepared?

684
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:46,276
To catch up with your swift
decisions as I am a slow king,

685
00:45:46,606 --> 00:45:48,975
perhaps, I should
cut down on my sleep.

686
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:51,305
Please do not say so.

687
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:54,216
You must take care of your
health and produce an heir.

688
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:59,245
He is no king. He
is a breeding horse.

689
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:19,676
You are always humble. Please
do not lose your humility.

690
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:22,606
Yes, Your Highness.

691
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:34,086
The Pungyang Jo clan...

692
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,426
has brought this
disaster upon ourselves.

693
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,486
Because of Royal Noble Consort
Eui's false confession,

694
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:41,696
we have suffered
such a humiliation.

695
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,906
The failure is the
cause, not the result.

696
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,475
Pardon?

697
00:46:55,135 --> 00:46:57,606
That is what the
Queen Dowager said.

698
00:46:58,345 --> 00:47:00,546
We agreed on the appointment
of Kim Byeong In...

699
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:03,546
and helped them reinforce
their tradition...

700
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:05,785
because we lost.

701
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:08,955
More defeats will decrease
our chance of winning.

702
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,586
She said...

703
00:47:11,725 --> 00:47:14,126
we must make the move first.

704
00:47:42,256 --> 00:47:44,285
Do you think O Wol was
able to recover a bit?

705
00:47:44,455 --> 00:47:46,055
I will look into
how she is doing.

706
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:49,095
She is a lively girl, so she
is always running around.

707
00:47:50,595 --> 00:47:52,896
She will never be able
to run around again.

708
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:56,506
If she had not come to
the palace with me...

709
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:00,535
Do not think too much about it.

710
00:48:01,176 --> 00:48:02,946
Sometimes, thinking
can put you in a swamp.

711
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:06,446
The more struggle, the deeper you
fall. It will be more painful.

712
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:10,086
What do you do...

713
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,955
to clear your head when you
have a lot on your mind?

714
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:14,816
I...

715
00:48:16,555 --> 00:48:18,055
go to Special Director Hong.

716
00:48:18,785 --> 00:48:20,825
He can comfort you.

717
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:23,365
He is so silly.

718
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,165
When I am with him,
he makes me angry.

719
00:48:26,765 --> 00:48:28,066
And when I vent my anger on him,

720
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:32,205
I am out of the swamp
before I notice it.

721
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:39,676
Then can you make me angry?

722
00:48:42,316 --> 00:48:44,345
- That is...
- Or...

723
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,535
You must not move.

724
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:57,385
I have finished.

725
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:03,466
What is wrong?

726
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:06,495
It is nothing.

727
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:11,305
Did you get hurt?

728
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:15,635
You must not touch me.

729
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:22,615
I have a cramp.

730
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:27,356
Has it been that long?

731
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:28,486
Thank goodness.

732
00:50:30,156 --> 00:50:32,285
You focused so hard that
you forgot the time.

733
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:50,106
If you wanted to sew, you
should do it in Daejojeon Hall.

734
00:50:50,106 --> 00:50:52,276
Why are you doing it
in the royal kitchen?

735
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:00,756
But are you really
sewing something?

736
00:51:03,986 --> 00:51:06,426
I promised to be reborn
as the perfect queen.

737
00:51:08,296 --> 00:51:09,765
Did you say perfect?

738
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:14,765
You must be free. Do you want
me to give you some work?

739
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:16,365
Oh, my back.

740
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:19,066
When will I finish all of this?

741
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:22,376
What happened?

742
00:51:25,106 --> 00:51:27,345
- Come in.
- Wait.

743
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,026
Is that from
Tongmyeongjeon Hall?

744
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:40,356
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Let me see.

745
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:48,665
Since she has tasted a
new dish that I made,

746
00:51:48,665 --> 00:51:50,736
I'm sure she's tired of the
same old meals she used to have.

747
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:04,086
Okay. Bring this to the saboksi.

748
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:07,955
If they cover the food palanquin
with a cloth about this size,

749
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,415
it will prevent the
food from getting cold.

750
00:52:09,586 --> 00:52:11,426
Tell them to make it nicely.

751
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:12,486
All right.

752
00:52:16,196 --> 00:52:18,126
Are you going to the lake
after sending me off?

753
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:19,725
Have you seen anyone who...

754
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,135
work so hard like this
when they want to die?

755
00:52:21,696 --> 00:52:23,865
Also, you must've forgotten
because it's become so natural,

756
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:25,935
but I'm being watched by a CCTV.

757
00:52:34,876 --> 00:52:36,486
What are you worried about?

758
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:45,725
Now, shall I try
to work my magic?

759
00:52:55,066 --> 00:52:56,165
Your Highness!

760
00:52:57,435 --> 00:52:58,466
Yes!

761
00:53:08,946 --> 00:53:10,015
Your Highness!

762
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:12,586
Hey, you. Is the
ground meat ready?

763
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:14,055
Yes.

764
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,986
Hurry up and bring it over.

765
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:19,426
Bring me some salt.

766
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:21,656
The Queen wants me to
bring this to her first.

767
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,236
My goodness.

768
00:53:31,805 --> 00:53:33,776
Fine. Do whatever you want.

769
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,575
Let me see how well
things work out.

770
00:53:47,054 --> 00:53:49,684
What if we asked the
Queen to prepare a meal...

771
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:55,295
Grand Queen Dowager, this
is the Head Inspector.

772
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:59,425
The Queen has prepared
lunch for you.

773
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:05,434
Should I tell him
not to bring it in?

774
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:09,635
Goodness.

775
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:11,175
What is it?

776
00:54:13,204 --> 00:54:15,815
She is so tactless.

777
00:54:18,644 --> 00:54:19,715
Your Highness.

778
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,425
Your lunch has arrived, but...

779
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:29,595
TONGMYEONGJEON HALL

780
00:54:37,704 --> 00:54:39,034
Be careful.

781
00:54:42,775 --> 00:54:44,905
That is...

782
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:12,965
The Queen has told me that...

783
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:18,574
the theme of today's
lunch is COSI.

784
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:21,715
"COSI"?

785
00:55:23,175 --> 00:55:25,284
I have never heard this before.

786
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:26,715
Is it from Mencius?

787
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:30,155
No, it is not. Is it from
"The Analects of Confucius"?

788
00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:32,255
It means that...

789
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:36,295
the food is crunchy
on the outside...

790
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:38,095
and soft in the inside.

791
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:41,565
Oh, really?

792
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:52,845
The food palanquin is here!

793
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,695
Here. Take the dishes.

794
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:13,124
Be careful.

795
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:17,505
Your Highness.

796
00:56:18,135 --> 00:56:20,905
She was very satisfied,
and she complimented you.

797
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:26,074
In particular, she saw
the food palanquin...

798
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:28,115
and asked how you came up
with such a briliant idea.

799
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:30,115
Of course. That's
an obvious result.

800
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,184
It's an item that was successful
in the competitive nation of Korea.

801
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:37,354
Josean's deliveryman.

802
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:42,324
I'm so proud of myself.

803
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:45,994
Generally speaking, a woman
of the royal family...

804
00:56:45,994 --> 00:56:47,095
must always be humble...

805
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:48,135
Are you...

806
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:50,235
going to nag me right now?

807
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:55,574
Must they be humble?
It was a question.

808
00:56:56,374 --> 00:56:59,505
No. Life is hard even if
you live off your own pride.

809
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:05,014
I do not know what she is
saying, but it is still annoying.

810
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:10,255
It is a stroke of good luck
in the midst of misfortune...

811
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:11,925
that O Wol was able to survive.

812
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:16,624
I am sure this experience
has made you more aware...

813
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:19,624
of what kind of people
the Kim clan are.

814
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:23,164
I had no idea they
would go this far.

815
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:25,505
I am sure you are
scared and in shock.

816
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,505
However, this is
just the beginning.

817
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:34,744
They never give up
the game they missed.

818
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:40,655
They said the late king did
not die because of his disease.

819
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:43,824
Then...

820
00:57:46,324 --> 00:57:50,324
He thought the Kim
clan is ruining Joseon.

821
00:57:51,565 --> 00:57:53,324
Do you know your sin?

822
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:54,994
He dragged down Kim
Hong Geun in power...

823
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:56,494
and exiled him.

824
00:57:56,565 --> 00:57:59,604
He revised the law on bribery.

825
00:58:00,735 --> 00:58:01,905
He stood up...

826
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:04,644
against the Kim clan like that.

827
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:08,514
But they are not the kind of people
who would sit back and watch.

828
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:15,585
Fortunately,

829
00:58:15,585 --> 00:58:17,824
he avoided a misfortune...

830
00:58:18,224 --> 00:58:21,525
and was finding evidence to
reveal the people behind it.

831
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:32,204
After the late King
had passed away,

832
00:58:33,204 --> 00:58:35,104
his food taster disappeared.

833
00:58:35,574 --> 00:58:37,244
He must have been poisoned.

834
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:40,445
If we had moved more quickly,

835
00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:42,644
he would have been alive.

836
00:58:44,485 --> 00:58:47,815
I told you. It is
not late for you yet.

837
00:58:48,184 --> 00:58:51,025
But if you miss this
moment, it is too late.

838
00:58:52,085 --> 00:58:54,494
It was a court maid
called O Wol this time.

839
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:57,724
But it will be you next time.

840
00:58:59,224 --> 00:59:00,994
I will make appeals.

841
00:59:02,195 --> 00:59:04,135
To request to
dethrone the Queen.

842
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:07,474
You do not have to do anything.

843
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:10,445
The King will like it that way.

844
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:13,845
All you need to do
is to approve it.

845
00:59:19,585 --> 00:59:22,854
Queen Dowager,
please forgive me.

846
00:59:26,255 --> 00:59:29,025
But I need your help.

847
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:36,335
All you need to care
about is the King's heart.

848
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:41,604
The King will see the Queen in
a different light after this.

849
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:44,244
Without knowing
her ill intention.

850
00:59:49,115 --> 00:59:52,715
The weather is gloomy
today. It might rain.

851
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:54,184
Court Lady Han.

852
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:57,354
The room is dark.
Light the candles.

853
00:59:57,854 --> 00:59:58,885
Yes, Your Highness.

854
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:28,554
You will not see
His Majesty tonight.

855
01:00:29,454 --> 01:00:30,985
Why are you...

856
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:34,354
Will you be satisfied only
after taking everything I have?

857
01:00:34,994 --> 01:00:37,065
Did you change the
content of the letter?

858
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:41,164
You changed something that
is even more important.

859
01:00:41,835 --> 01:00:43,595
Why can I not
change such a thing?

860
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:48,804
I am not sure what
you are talking about.

861
01:00:50,644 --> 01:00:53,914
I know your lies.

862
01:00:58,385 --> 01:01:00,715
If His Majesty knows
the truth I know,

863
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:04,554
you will understand me.

864
01:01:05,824 --> 01:01:08,595
The feeling when your loved one
is looking at you with despise.

865
01:01:09,054 --> 01:01:10,124
How cruel it is...

866
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:14,065
to see those eyes...

867
01:01:15,595 --> 01:01:17,405
for the rest of your life.

868
01:01:25,104 --> 01:01:28,574
If you want to keep the
lie, leave the palace.

869
01:01:30,845 --> 01:01:32,784
You found my weakness.

870
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:36,385
Reveal the truth to the King.

871
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:40,124
But you will have to reveal
another truth as well.

872
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:43,394
That you...

873
01:01:44,664 --> 01:01:46,224
tried to kill His Majesty.

874
01:01:55,505 --> 01:01:57,374
You know everything.

875
01:01:59,045 --> 01:02:00,175
You...

876
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,275
can not do anything.

877
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:10,425
I swear...

878
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:14,255
you will also lose
someone dear to you.

879
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:56,095
What is the matter?

880
01:02:59,034 --> 01:03:00,735
You know it as well.

881
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:02,874
His Majesty...

882
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:06,045
is weak when he feels guilty.

883
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:09,644
It is what you have
to pay for surviving.

884
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:11,945
It is what guilt is.

885
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:22,394
Did you go this far just
to win the King's heart?

886
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:41,345
Hurry and take them in
before they get wet.

887
01:03:41,345 --> 01:03:42,615
Hurry and take them in.

888
01:03:47,014 --> 01:03:49,784
The cloud looked unusual
for the last few days.

889
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:51,925
It is finally raining.

890
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:56,095
My rank in this life is higher
than my rank in the real life.

891
01:03:56,994 --> 01:03:59,494
But why is my life
more miserable?

892
01:03:59,724 --> 01:04:00,735
Your Highness.

893
01:04:00,735 --> 01:04:04,664
Do you think I have this
life and the next life too?

894
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:09,034
According to the parallel
universe theory, it's possible.

895
01:04:13,945 --> 01:04:14,945
Here.

896
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:17,284
This is our current life.

897
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:20,854
This is another life, Okay?

898
01:04:21,585 --> 01:04:23,115
It is freaking difficult.

899
01:04:25,385 --> 01:04:27,394
The way she speaks...

900
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:29,755
became weird hanging
out with the Queen.

901
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:35,235
Do you think this puppy was
also a human in the past life?

902
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:37,434
It's possible.

903
01:04:38,034 --> 01:04:39,565
That Mr. Fool over there too?

904
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,345
Sure. He would've done
anything I asked him to do.

905
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:49,014
How about me?

906
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:54,684
You will always be
Court Lady Choi.

907
01:04:55,954 --> 01:04:57,684
Hong Yeon, you...

908
01:04:58,054 --> 01:05:00,795
Do you think my parents...

909
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:02,894
will have a comfortable
life in their other life?

910
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:04,124
What?

911
01:05:04,124 --> 01:05:07,664
My mother has four
fingernails only.

912
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:10,965
She lost her fingernails while
picking out stones in cold winter.

913
01:05:11,135 --> 01:05:15,675
In her other life, she would
have ten fingernails, right?

914
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:19,474
Yes, right.

915
01:05:19,474 --> 01:05:21,514
My father's eye would
be perfectly fine, too.

916
01:05:21,815 --> 01:05:23,074
What happened to your father?

917
01:05:23,414 --> 01:05:25,914
- He was whipped with a pitchfork.
- What?

918
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:27,885
He must have borrowed rice to
fulfill the military duty...

919
01:05:27,885 --> 01:05:29,655
and have not paid the interest.

920
01:05:30,115 --> 01:05:32,655
They need to threaten people
to make them pay it back.

921
01:05:33,885 --> 01:05:36,655
one out of every two households has
someone that is disabled like that.

922
01:05:38,624 --> 01:05:39,695
Don't worry.

923
01:05:39,865 --> 01:05:42,764
In their other life, all your
mother's fingernails are so shiny...

924
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:44,304
that she doesn't need
to get her nails done.

925
01:05:44,304 --> 01:05:45,804
Your father's eyes...

926
01:05:45,804 --> 01:05:48,775
are sparkling as if he's
wearing colored contacts.

927
01:05:49,934 --> 01:05:54,244
I want to see my mother
with ten pretty fingernails.

928
01:05:54,974 --> 01:05:56,074
POUTY

929
01:05:58,144 --> 01:05:59,184
Me too.

930
01:06:00,345 --> 01:06:02,054
I want to see my mom.

931
01:06:04,184 --> 01:06:07,854
You do not even know
your mother's face.

932
01:06:08,354 --> 01:06:09,394
Oh, no.

933
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:12,724
Why did you bring up her mom?

934
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:16,364
I mean, it's another mom.

935
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,064
I was talking about Lady Lee Soon
Shin who is alive and healthy.

936
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:22,605
She's even doing Zumba
for fun these days.

937
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:24,045
Why are you making me
feel like an orphan?

938
01:06:29,975 --> 01:06:31,814
Gathering at the royal kitchen
where women are forbidden...

939
01:06:31,814 --> 01:06:33,784
and whining like that.

940
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:36,454
I cannot understand women.

941
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:41,895
Mother?

942
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:45,524
Mom.

943
01:06:59,944 --> 01:07:01,975
It's raining and sentimental.

944
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:05,645
Hey. Bring me some
pajeon and makgeoli.

945
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,715
You should go to
Daejojeon Hall quickly.

946
01:07:08,715 --> 01:07:10,515
The rain is not going
to stop for a while.

947
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:13,555
How do you know?

948
01:07:13,555 --> 01:07:15,824
Are you a supercomputer from the
Meteorological Administration?

949
01:07:15,954 --> 01:07:18,124
I do not understand what
you are talking about,

950
01:07:18,664 --> 01:07:21,095
but given my wrist
hurts like this again,

951
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:23,265
it will rain heavily overnight.

952
01:07:25,864 --> 01:07:27,105
How heavy will it be?

953
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:29,605
I am not sure.

954
01:07:31,774 --> 01:07:34,944
If it hurts this much,
it will pour buckets...

955
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:38,114
for a good several
hours at least.

956
01:07:39,314 --> 01:07:41,185
Pouring buckets?

957
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:45,185
Then the lakes and wells
will be filled with water?

958
01:07:58,605 --> 01:07:59,664
Head Eunuch.

959
01:08:00,874 --> 01:08:02,005
Yes, Your Majesty.

960
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:06,475
"CHANGES OF ZHOU"

961
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:08,675
To focus on the
consecutive bed-sharing,

962
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:11,614
I want to go to my bed
chamber after reading more.

963
01:08:12,145 --> 01:08:14,185
It is late. You may leave first.

964
01:08:14,855 --> 01:08:15,885
Yes, Your Majesty.

965
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:26,895
"WUBEI ZHI"

966
01:08:55,095 --> 01:08:57,765
I will come back after your
emotions are stabilized.

967
01:08:57,765 --> 01:09:00,694
Don't come unless you're
going to kneel and beg me.

968
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:03,194
I said don't come!

969
01:09:13,475 --> 01:09:15,874
I knee every day,

970
01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:21,484
but I did not kneel before
the person I should.

971
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,064
Your Highness!

972
01:09:33,164 --> 01:09:34,935
You are going to catch a cold!

973
01:09:35,034 --> 01:09:36,965
Catching a cold is nothing!

974
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,064
When the sky is
helping me like this!

975
01:09:39,064 --> 01:09:41,274
Oh, my, Your Highness.
You cannot do this!

976
01:09:42,135 --> 01:09:44,374
Please come to your senses.

977
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,675
Your Highness.

978
01:10:17,675 --> 01:10:18,874
Your Highness?

979
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:21,314
Once again.

980
01:10:21,314 --> 01:10:22,715
What are you saying,
Your Highness?

981
01:10:22,874 --> 01:10:24,885
Okay! Yes! This is great!

982
01:10:24,885 --> 01:10:26,045
Your Highness.

983
01:10:26,385 --> 01:10:28,355
What is that, Your Highness?

984
01:10:35,095 --> 01:10:36,795
What kind of woman is she?

985
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,595
She is so unpredictable.

986
01:10:39,965 --> 01:10:42,095
Oh, yes! Okay!

987
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:44,864
What is the matter,
Your Highness?

988
01:10:47,305 --> 01:10:49,805
Why are you alone unlike usual?

989
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:00,954
Did you come out to
get rained on too?

990
01:11:02,515 --> 01:11:04,685
I came to apologize to you.

991
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:08,154
Never mind. I
don't care anymore.

992
01:11:08,355 --> 01:11:09,454
No.

993
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:11,795
I cannot turn a
blind eye like this.

994
01:11:11,965 --> 01:11:14,164
I said never mind.
Why are you so clingy?

995
01:11:15,135 --> 01:11:16,135
"Clingy"?

996
01:11:18,864 --> 01:11:20,904
I'm a simple person.

997
01:11:21,074 --> 01:11:22,475
I curse when I'm
glad to see someone,

998
01:11:22,605 --> 01:11:24,675
and I pick a fight
when I'm thankful.

999
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:26,545
I hate sweet talkers so,

1000
01:11:27,105 --> 01:11:28,145
get lost.

1001
01:11:32,744 --> 01:11:33,845
"Get lost"?

1002
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:36,314
I gathered my
courage to apologize,

1003
01:11:36,314 --> 01:11:38,284
and that is the only
thing you can say?

1004
01:11:38,725 --> 01:11:41,425
Hey. If it's up to a person
who apologizes and...

1005
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:44,154
not a person who is apologized
to, is it an apology?

1006
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:50,864
But there are rules
for the royal family.

1007
01:11:51,034 --> 01:11:53,704
Until when are you going to
speak in a weird way like that?

1008
01:11:55,204 --> 01:11:57,374
Until today. Just until today.

1009
01:11:57,774 --> 01:12:02,114
Everything will be back
to its place tomorrow!

1010
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:04,885
Yes! Ah, yes!

1011
01:12:04,885 --> 01:12:06,715
Your Highness.

1012
01:12:06,715 --> 01:12:08,585
- Ah, yes!
- Your Highness!

1013
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:10,585
Yes!

1014
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:15,694
Your Highness! Please
come to your senses.

1015
01:12:15,694 --> 01:12:16,925
Yes!

1016
01:12:20,124 --> 01:12:23,034
I cannot share a bed with you today
because you have hurt my feelings.

1017
01:12:26,164 --> 01:12:27,305
Sleep by yourself tonight.

1018
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:33,005
Oh, yes! I'm so
happy to hear that!

1019
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:36,975
That was a smooth move.

1020
01:12:43,215 --> 01:12:44,585
Did you come out
without an umbrella?

1021
01:12:44,984 --> 01:12:47,425
It feels great to get rained
on like this sometimes.

1022
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:51,164
It feels like it washes
all the worries away.

1023
01:12:54,194 --> 01:12:56,295
Don't feel sad.

1024
01:12:56,295 --> 01:12:57,765
Your Highness,
will you go inside?

1025
01:12:58,404 --> 01:13:01,034
Oh, my goodness. Your Highness!

1026
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:02,274
Please!

1027
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:06,404
What is it? Why is it
thundering at this very moment?

1028
01:13:06,404 --> 01:13:08,074
The sky is enraged!

1029
01:13:09,175 --> 01:13:10,515
Be enraged!

1030
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:14,385
Be enraged by my pelvic
movements and pour it more!

1031
01:13:15,385 --> 01:13:18,324
Your Highness! You
cannot do that!

1032
01:13:18,324 --> 01:13:20,225
Oh, yes!

1033
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:21,324
Please!

1034
01:13:22,124 --> 01:13:23,595
Your Highness!

1035
01:13:23,595 --> 01:13:25,994
The Queen's mental illness
is getting worse every day.

1036
01:13:25,994 --> 01:13:27,935
She tries to end her own
life at every chance.

1037
01:13:28,364 --> 01:13:31,034
The core of the Internal
Court is shaking.

1038
01:13:32,305 --> 01:13:35,734
Would it not be right...

1039
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:37,305
to petition for
dethroning the Queen?

1040
01:13:37,944 --> 01:13:40,774
- You are right.
- Yes.

1041
01:13:40,774 --> 01:13:43,444
It is time for the
Pungyang Jo clan...

1042
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:45,715
to gather strength.

1043
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,135
They have shown their
vulnerable neck in front of you.

1044
01:14:03,994 --> 01:14:06,105
You must bite it off.

1045
01:14:11,545 --> 01:14:13,904
The core of the Internal
Court is in danger.

1046
01:14:14,244 --> 01:14:17,515
Dethroning the Queen is
the right thing to do.

1047
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:29,395
There was an immortal
being called Achilles.

1048
01:14:29,454 --> 01:14:31,564
But the heel was his
only vulnerable spot.

1049
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:34,024
They say he died from
an arrow in that heel.

1050
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:37,135
That's the origin of the
expression, "Achilles' heel".

1051
01:14:38,465 --> 01:14:39,935
The actual reason
behind his death...

1052
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:43,074
is that there was no artisan
to make armor boots for him.

1053
01:14:43,074 --> 01:14:44,505
They say...

1054
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:47,944
We might've not needed each other
if we didn't have a weakness.

1055
01:14:47,944 --> 01:14:50,345
Avoiding danger...

1056
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:53,515
We're each other's weaknesses,
dragging each other to our misery.

1057
01:14:55,984 --> 01:14:59,624
But we also make up for each other's
weakness and save each other.

1058
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:23,374
Hong Yeon.

1059
01:15:24,074 --> 01:15:26,715
You must keep my will
to buy land in Gangnam.

1060
01:15:26,845 --> 01:15:29,015
Yes, Your Highness.

1061
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:32,324
Court Lady Choi.

1062
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:35,024
You went through a
lot because of me.

1063
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:05,725
Finally.

1064
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:13,765
CHOONDANGJI LAKE

1065
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:31,114
I CAME HERE FOR
NOTHING. JANG BONG HWAN

1066
01:16:32,114 --> 01:16:33,414
I should write
something to celebrate.

1067
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,774
Now, everything will go
back to where it should be.

1068
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:54,855
MR. QUEEN

1069
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,095
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, FAMILIES,

1070
01:18:56,095 --> 01:18:57,194
DYNASTIES, AND EVENTS ARE
UNRELATED TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

1071
01:19:13,774 --> 01:19:16,045
<i>The Queen is the most
eccentric and strange person...</i>

1072
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:18,244
<i>I have met in my entire life.</i>

1073
01:19:18,244 --> 01:19:20,515
<i>As if she has come
from a different world.</i>

1074
01:19:20,515 --> 01:19:22,914
<i>Whose soul are you
trying to call upon?</i>

1075
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:26,454
<i>Then I'm sure this woman has
completely lost her mind.</i>

1076
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:28,925
<i>The internal crisis
is more dangerous...</i>

1077
01:19:28,925 --> 01:19:30,824
<i>than the crisis from
outside, do you not agree?</i>

1078
01:19:30,824 --> 01:19:32,064
<i>You are saying, there
is an internal crisis...</i>

1079
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:33,295
<i>that was not there before.</i>

1080
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:34,364
<i>That means...</i>

1081
01:19:34,364 --> 01:19:35,864
<i>The interest that His Majesty
has towards the Queen...</i>

1082
01:19:35,864 --> 01:19:37,795
<i>will end up becoming
our weakness.</i>

1083
01:19:37,994 --> 01:19:40,904
<i>Then today will be our
first day together.</i>

1084
01:19:41,105 --> 01:19:42,105
<i>What?</i>
