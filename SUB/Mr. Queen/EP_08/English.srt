1
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:08,532
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:10,702
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,381
Did Special Director
Hong find anything out?

4
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,982
It seems that Kim
Byeong In figured out...

5
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,681
that the piece of the robe
he found is from the Palace.

6
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,622
He is following close behind us.

7
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,351
We should hurry as well.

8
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:34,352
- This is not attack training.
- Is that so?

9
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:42,622
Why are you acting like this?

10
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:45,092
It is unlike you to
lose your reason.

11
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:48,661
I have been constantly refraining
myself, so I am getting impatient.

12
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:08,551
EPISODE 8, A
DANGEROUS RELATIONSHIP

13
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,822
EPISODE 8

14
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:36,382
Here.

15
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:41,382
Let us go.

16
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,491
Did you go hunting?

17
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,702
There is the old saying
"Be comfortable..."

18
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,572
"Relax and wait until
they get tired."

19
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:05,641
While I rest, my
enemies will get tired.

20
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,282
You are correct.

21
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:12,081
How did you catch
it without a bow?

22
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:18,021
Using a bow made my arms
and my fingers hurt,

23
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,621
so it made me think that it
was not made for hunting,

24
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:24,292
but to torture people.

25
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:29,102
Since your fingers and arms
kill you after using a bow,

26
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:30,931
it is a hunting
device after all.

27
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:37,972
Anyway, it is easier to
catch animals with a trap.

28
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:41,482
It is dangerous for just
the two of you to go.

29
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:46,081
You must always have security with
you whenever and wherever you go.

30
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,322
I will do that next time.

31
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:54,521
What shall we do about how you must
still be royal guard commander?

32
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,421
When the Queen's father
is feeling better,

33
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,391
I will return his post to him.

34
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,162
Right.

35
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,002
For the sake of the
Training Commander's health,

36
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,371
take this.

37
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,401
It is okay. I do not need it.

38
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:09,002
Do not refuse.

39
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,111
It is a royal gift.

40
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,371
I see.

41
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:23,822
Have you heard that
the Queen has woken up?

42
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,422
Is that so?

43
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,391
How is she feeling?

44
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:30,192
Luckily, she is healthy.

45
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,862
She overcame it.
Luckily, she overcame it.

46
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:37,101
I must go see the
Queen right away.

47
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,442
My gosh.

48
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,211
This is not the time
for you to visit her.

49
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,151
Since the Queen
has gotten better,

50
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,781
the worst-case scenario
has been avoided.

51
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,922
I will go and look
for the ledger myself.

52
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,192
Then I will go with you.

53
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,992
If we go together, they
will be more vigilant.

54
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,562
You should keep an eye on the
situation inside the Palace.

55
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:22,512
The weather is very nice today.

56
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:24,812
Catch me if you can!

57
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,262
It must be spring.

58
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,562
Will you marry me?

59
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:44,331
I may look like this,
but I own a goat.

60
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:49,002
Goodness. I do not know.

61
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,411
Your Majesty!

62
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:08,721
I wanted her to return so badly.

63
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,831
But only her memories came
back instead of her soul.

64
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:15,002
Her memories came to me
before from time to time.

65
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:18,401
I had a headache and my ears
rang whenever that happens.

66
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,901
But this time, it came
to me so smoothly.

67
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,911
Hong Yeon. You're 19
years old this year.

68
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,481
Your first name isn't Hong Yeon.

69
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:32,512
Your last name is Hong, and
your first name is Yeon.

70
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,382
It's my sense of smell.

71
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:37,322
The memories related to my
sense of smell are coming back.

72
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,622
But the thing is...

73
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:42,922
why am I so good at this?

74
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:46,091
That is because you played
this ever since you were young.

75
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,401
Now that you have
regained your memory,

76
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,002
your talents have
come back as well.

77
00:06:57,812 --> 00:06:59,012
This is so messed up.

78
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:02,481
After being in that vegetative
state, everything got messed up.

79
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,351
Wait.

80
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:07,182
Why have I been thinking
in this woman's voice too?

81
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,052
Did I...

82
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,192
lose my voice?

83
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:17,362
What are you talking about?

84
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,432
I hear you just fine.

85
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,461
I gained my finger, but I
lost my voice. It's like...

86
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,802
"The Little Mermaid".

87
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:30,942
The witness who sold Court Lady Han
arsenic and said it was rodenticide,

88
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:32,841
and the circumstances that
brought it into the royal kitchen.

89
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,781
You must make sure that
nobody can find a problem...

90
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,041
with those two things.

91
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,822
I have something to say to the
head of the Department of Justice.

92
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:49,161
How strange.

93
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,331
The Palace has always been big,

94
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:55,831
but it feels particularly
big and empty today.

95
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,802
The Queen is entering.

96
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,132
Do I perhaps...

97
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:33,501
I agreed to give the Queen Dowager
some time, so keep that in mind.

98
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,302
- Pardon?
- It is following the order...

99
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,642
of the Internal Court,

100
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,412
so we will wait for now.

101
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,412
However, prepare everything...

102
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:43,981
so that we can use
it at any time.

103
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,611
Instead, you must ensure
to keep it a secret.

104
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,351
We may have drawn up the
big picture this time,

105
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:52,422
but the Queen Dowager
might be connected to...

106
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:54,221
the people who tried
to hurt the Queen.

107
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:58,062
If we leave her alone, the
Queen might be in danger again.

108
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,231
The people who are
trying to hurt the Queen?

109
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:04,162
The Queen admitted that the lake
incident was an attempted suicide,

110
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:06,371
and this time it was
due to her health.

111
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,871
Is there something else?

112
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:18,251
Ever since she entered the Palace,
her life has been in danger.

113
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:19,581
That is why I am suspicious.

114
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,751
I understand.

115
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,991
There is much to do to prepare
for the royal conference...

116
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,822
without the King.

117
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:27,961
I will get going now.

118
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:29,961
Did something
happen to the King?

119
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,131
He went to visit the Queen.

120
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,562
Is that so?

121
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:37,971
Byeong In!

122
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:41,902
I did not know you were here.

123
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:43,642
You can talk.

124
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,971
Get home safely.

125
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,581
The sun is at high noon. Why
would you tell him to go home?

126
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,481
I stayed up all night,
so I got confused.

127
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:58,392
What were you working on
that you stayed up all night?

128
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:01,162
I was up all night partaking
in a secret mission.

129
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:04,221
I ended up going through all
sorts of things because of it.

130
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,032
Did you find out anything?

131
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,202
Byeong In. I am in trouble.

132
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:15,741
I have fallen in love with a woman
I should not fall in love with.

133
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,042
Who on earth is it?

134
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,741
For some reason, the Palace
seems really empty today,

135
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,182
so my heart feels empty too.

136
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:25,452
I thought about why
I felt like that,

137
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:28,851
and there is only one woman who
is missing from the Palace...

138
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,422
right now.

139
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,052
The Queen.

140
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:35,822
It seems that I am in
love with the Queen.

141
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:38,831
- What did you say?
- How am I in love with my cousin?

142
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,432
This violates the moral law
of family relationships.

143
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,631
We are from the
same family lineage.

144
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,532
No, this is no
different from incest.

145
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:49,442
Furthermore, she is someone else's
woman as she is married to the King.

146
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:50,942
I have lost my mind.

147
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,942
I did not even lose it
gracefully. I am a complete mess.

148
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,241
Even if all those
things are secondary,

149
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,481
what is most important...

150
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,511
is that she is so
much older than me.

151
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,081
Is this not wrong?

152
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,121
Is the fact that she is
older important here?

153
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,392
Why are you getting upset at me?

154
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,761
You are speaking
nonsense right now.

155
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:09,961
I am sorry.

156
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:12,361
I will not say anything anymore.

157
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,702
No, it is fine. I am
sorry for getting mad.

158
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,272
You have never
raised your voice,

159
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:20,471
let alone got mad at me.

160
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:22,672
You have changed after
getting a government position.

161
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:24,302
It is because I was flustered.

162
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:26,711
I was not really mad at you.

163
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,011
Why did you come to
have such a thought?

164
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:34,552
It is because I am
constantly reminded of her.

165
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:37,452
How she held the
parasol for the Queen,

166
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,721
how she stayed right
next to the Queen,

167
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:43,392
and how she ran while carrying
herbal decoction for the Queen.

168
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:46,792
I keep thinking about Hong
Yeon, the Queen's court maid.

169
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,631
If you are reminded
of Hong Yeon,

170
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,532
why do you think you are
in love with the Queen?

171
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:53,831
Do you not know who I am?

172
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,341
I am the 16th descendent and
only son of the 3rd generation...

173
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,841
of a family of judges,

174
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,241
Kim Hwan.

175
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,381
How could someone like me fall
for a court maid like her?

176
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:03,511
That is why I must be in
love with the Queen...

177
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,522
Am I in love with a court maid?

178
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:16,162
I support your difficult love.

179
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:25,702
"DONGMONGSEONSEUP"

180
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:35,711
JO HWA JIN

181
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:56,831
Your Highness.

182
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:02,371
Where is the King?

183
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,471
He went to the Queen's home.

184
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:07,412
Why did he go there
all of a sudden?

185
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,111
The Queen has regained
consciousness.

186
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:11,952
He is using his visit as an
excuse to look around her home.

187
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:17,221
Did you get hurt?

188
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,491
It is nothing serious.

189
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,631
I will go visit
the Queen as well.

190
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,581
To what do I owe this pleasure?

191
00:13:58,461 --> 00:13:59,991
Skinny,

192
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,432
fat,

193
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,131
tall,

194
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,902
and short.

195
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,672
Everyone comes in
different shapes and sizes.

196
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:12,871
But you all have
one thing in common.

197
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:14,312
That would be...

198
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,081
your eyes.

199
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,851
You have the best
eyesight and aim.

200
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:25,192
And you are the shooters I
have personally handpicked.

201
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:28,292
I have an average
build and height.

202
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,961
Which group do I belong to?

203
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,591
You can be a slow-witted man.

204
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,131
So here is the name I
have given your group.

205
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,101
Alienated Unit.

206
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,672
You have been dispatched...

207
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:45,142
to the front lines as you
were considered insignificant.

208
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,072
With this rifle,

209
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,182
you will be the best
soldier in Joseon.

210
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,751
Just like me.

211
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,121
Rifles can end someone's life.

212
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,361
But they can...

213
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:10,761
also save lives.

214
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,302
Get into a formation
of five to fire.

215
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:23,042
This is a hassle, but I still
need to save this empire.

216
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:27,711
Fire!

217
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:37,491
I came here to collect
something I need.

218
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:41,601
The first item is
the phoenix hairpin.

219
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,802
The phoenix hairpin?

220
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:46,902
Is that a gift for the Queen?

221
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:50,371
If this was meant for the Queen,
I would have asked Sanguiwon.

222
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:55,881
I do not need a gold plated
hairpin for the Queen.

223
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,042
I need one made of jade.

224
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:02,922
However, according to the royal
decorum, only the Queen...

225
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,022
can wear a phoenix hairpin.

226
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,292
Exactly.

227
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:15,461
And as for the
second item I need...

228
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:23,501
I knew it. She wanted to
lure His Majesty out here.

229
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,642
Speed up. We must
arrive there quickly.

230
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:31,211
Yes, Your Highness. Speed up.

231
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,292
Before the Queen tells
him the secret...

232
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:45,731
There is one difference between
my story and "The Little Mermaid".

233
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,802
She got her feet but I got my
hands at the expense of my voice.

234
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,131
It's a surprise
after a surprise.

235
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,272
Am I going to lose
myself little by little?

236
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,241
If I stay here,

237
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:59,772
that jerk, Secretary Han,
will get everything he wants.

238
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:01,981
I can frame his
ancestors for treason,

239
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,682
hunt down the Hans, and
uproot his ancestors.

240
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,582
I can destroy three
generations of Hans,

241
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,182
so he never gets conceived.

242
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:13,392
But which clan did he belong to?

243
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,461
Why does she have
so many mood swings?

244
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:24,702
Are you all from the
Namsadang Troupe?

245
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:26,071
How come you're so
good at neolttwigi?

246
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:29,672
This is not a big deal
for the women of Joseon.

247
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,372
This is the only way to
look beyond these walls.

248
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,612
I didn't know the
meaning behind it.

249
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,551
Right. After living
here for a week,

250
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:42,082
living as a woman in Joseon
is harder than I expected.

251
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,781
On top of that, I'm the Queen.

252
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:49,922
But if it means I get to
take my bloody revenge...

253
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:51,491
Let's go.

254
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,402
It will be okay if I
don't smell anything.

255
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:57,932
Then, I will stop getting
her memories back.

256
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:59,471
And I'll get my voice back.

257
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:02,602
Starting today, I will
live for my revenge.

258
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:05,412
To do that, I need
a lot of power.

259
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:06,942
Hong Yeon.

260
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:10,342
As the Queen, what must I
do to gain a lot of power?

261
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:13,281
I do know a definite
way to gain more power.

262
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,122
What is it?

263
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:19,751
More than anything, producing an
heir will get you a lot of power.

264
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:22,922
"Produce"?

265
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:24,721
How dare you use such
an inhumane word?

266
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,392
Oh, right.

267
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:30,461
My best friend Sunwon is on
my side. She's super powerful.

268
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,102
Who is Sunwon?

269
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,231
She has a countrified name.

270
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:37,071
Queen Sunwon. I was talking
about the Grand Queen Dowager.

271
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,311
Hong Yeon, If I want to make
a good impression on her,

272
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,142
- what should I...
- Producing an heir. Definitely.

273
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:46,612
I ought to give her a present.
What should I give her?

274
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,622
Something small, shiny,
expensive, and beautiful.

275
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:52,592
Hold on.

276
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:56,291
This smell...

277
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:01,602
My memories are coming
back. They are coming back.

278
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:24,682
This one is called Sky. The
one in the back yard, Ground.

279
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:26,251
And the one next to the
guest room is Black?

280
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:28,221
Yes. Your father gathered more
assets while you were gone.

281
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,422
The storage rooms are all full.

282
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:33,291
Sky, ground, black...

283
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:37,162
Think about all the storage rooms
all over Joseon, not just these...

284
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:39,471
Your family might have to go
through every Chinese letter.

285
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,001
Oh, my eyes!

286
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,041
Look at me, born
with a "gold" spoon.

287
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,541
This one.

288
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:53,412
This one, too.

289
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,221
Except for those two,

290
00:19:57,852 --> 00:19:59,321
pack up the rest.

291
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,652
The rest?

292
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,061
Let's pack the rest and
go back to the palace.

293
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,662
I can already picture
your father in shock.

294
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:10,531
Starting today, I will
be the queen of lobbying.

295
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:13,672
Your Highness.

296
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:17,372
His Majesty has arrived.

297
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,342
Gosh. Why?

298
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,342
I'm going to head back in soon.

299
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,041
Tell him to wait for
me at the palace.

300
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:27,981
What are you talking
about, Your Highness?

301
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,221
I should be showing my loyalty
to the Grand Queen Dowager.

302
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:31,952
I'm going to distance
myself from the King.

303
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,162
What are you doing?

304
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:51,571
Gosh. I have to clearly show my
loyalty when I'm taking sides.

305
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:52,741
Goodness.

306
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,811
Why did he bring the
whole parade here?

307
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,082
All these royal families
are attention-seekers.

308
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:02,382
Show him your respect,
Your Highness.

309
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:04,852
It is all right.

310
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:23,602
Therefore, I install So Yong
of the Kim clan as the Queen.

311
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:31,882
Congratulations
on your selection.

312
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:01,041
I picked them up on my way here.

313
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:07,152
My Queen.

314
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:11,781
Your face is red. And you
are breathing quickly.

315
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,251
Do you have a hard
time breathing again?

316
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:17,862
My face is fine. And
I'm breathing fine too.

317
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,592
I must've eaten too much of that
invigorating food this morning.

318
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,902
Back off, So Yong.

319
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:25,172
Get out of my... I mean, get
out of your body right now.

320
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:26,702
What are you doing now?

321
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:29,102
I don't have a
place to go anymore.

322
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:31,741
Are you trying to hit
the flowers or your body?

323
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:34,511
Hey. Why do you keep...

324
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,912
- Goodness. Stop it.
- Darn it.

325
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:39,981
I won't let you take
it away. It's mine!

326
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:43,352
I did not know you would
love them this much.

327
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,251
I didn't say I love it.

328
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:47,321
I just think staying here is
better than living in a corpse.

329
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:50,622
How come you become more
peculiar whenever you wake up?

330
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:54,132
I'm not the peculiar one here.
You're the one with peculiar lines.

331
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,162
"I picked them up on my
way here?" Seriously?

332
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,872
How can that kind of
line last two centuries?

333
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:00,531
I really picked them
up on my way here.

334
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:03,172
Oh, sure. Fine. Okay.

335
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:05,311
It is true.

336
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,741
Sure thing.

337
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:09,442
The King does not lie.

338
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,011
- Sure. Okay.
- What is wrong with you?

339
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:15,182
- My gosh. Goodness.
- Your Majesty.

340
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:18,592
Your Majesty.

341
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:23,692
You have blessed our humble
abode with your visit.

342
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,392
Thank you, Your Majesty.

343
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:28,961
No, please get up.

344
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:34,231
Of course, I should check on my
Queen and make sure she is okay.

345
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:37,402
How have you been? Is
everything okay with you?

346
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:39,311
Yes, of course.

347
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,442
Let us go inside.

348
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:44,642
- Sure.
- Great.

349
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,082
Your Majesty, enjoy
the warm welcome.

350
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:52,291
Please excuse me. I must go get
ready to return to the palace.

351
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,652
- Let's go.
- What? You are leaving already?

352
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,521
Do you plan to return
to the palace today?

353
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,332
I recover quickly.

354
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,432
Even so,

355
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:06,031
you have just recovered.

356
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,672
Father is right.

357
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:11,172
There is no need to rush, so
take your time to fully recover.

358
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:18,342
I am concerned the Internal Court
would be struggling without me.

359
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:20,882
Things are peaceful
at the Internal Court.

360
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:22,922
More so than when you
were at the palace.

361
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:26,321
Perhaps a lot more peaceful.

362
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:28,622
I apologize.

363
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:31,721
I have been doing my best,

364
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,561
but I suppose you are not
satisfied with my efforts.

365
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:38,132
- Well...
- You're already used to the palace,

366
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:41,001
so spending time
with your father...

367
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,241
does not delight you in any way.

368
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:45,001
Gosh.

369
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:50,781
Because I was so focused on
doing my duty as the Queen,

370
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,452
I failed to think about
how you would feel, Father.

371
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:57,352
Then I shall return to
the palace tomorrow.

372
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:03,061
Then let me take the two
of you to the guesthouse.

373
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:07,932
I fell for his trick.

374
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,362
Let us go.

375
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,071
What is wrong with her?

376
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:36,952
I need you to do
something for me.

377
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,922
There is something that should
not exist. Bring it to me.

378
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:49,263
It is inside the secret safe at the
residence of the Queen's father.

379
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:51,503
Yes, my lord.

380
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:01,612
I am elated to see the two of you
together right before my eyes.

381
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,083
I am so happy that
I could die now.

382
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:07,882
I should have visited
you sooner. I apologize.

383
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:10,622
My gosh, there is no
need to apologize.

384
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:14,452
Just hearing about how in
love the two of you are...

385
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:20,993
makes me truly grateful.

386
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,803
Since my Queen is so special
and different from other women,

387
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,672
I have always wondered what kind
of environment she grew up in.

388
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:34,412
I suppose this is it.

389
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:36,983
Because I raised her by
myself without a mother,

390
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:39,083
I always paid extra
attention to everything...

391
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,053
to make sure she gets all
the care that she needed.

392
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,823
That must have been very hard.

393
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:46,493
My gosh, not at all.

394
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:49,293
The Queen has been doing
very well on her own...

395
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:51,523
since she was little.

396
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,862
Right, so I have heard.

397
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,202
However, she is such a
strong, independent woman...

398
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:01,632
that she will not open
up to me emotionally.

399
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,843
Perhaps it is because I
just do not know enough.

400
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,412
Or is it because a woman's
mind is a complex thing?

401
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:10,142
It is awfully difficult
for me to understand her.

402
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:13,612
Gosh, it is certainly not
because you do not know enough.

403
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,882
All men have difficulty
understanding women.

404
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,452
They are as difficult as
the Buddha's teachings.

405
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:21,952
Don't try to understand.

406
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:25,462
Marital relationships
thrive on misunderstandings.

407
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:28,432
What do you mean?

408
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:30,702
Without a misunderstanding,

409
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:33,402
you wouldn't even get
married in the first place.

410
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:41,142
I wish to understand
everything about you.

411
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:47,053
Don't.

412
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:48,612
Which is why I would like to
take a look around the house...

413
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:50,222
she grew up in.

414
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,523
May I?

415
00:27:51,952 --> 00:27:54,692
It would be nice to take a walk
with my Queen and catch up.

416
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:57,493
My gosh, it is just like
any other commoner's house.

417
00:27:57,493 --> 00:27:58,932
There is nothing special,

418
00:27:58,932 --> 00:28:01,862
but I will be happy to show
you around if you would like.

419
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,202
Then you two can go.

420
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:06,402
I should make sure the
Queen accompanies me.

421
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,642
I did not see you
for just one night,

422
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:13,672
but I miss you even as
I am looking at you.

423
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:17,642
You have something here.

424
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:19,712
Gosh, it's my beauty mark.

425
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:25,793
I was thinking something was
different about you today.

426
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:31,222
Then you should come with us.

427
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:33,093
Shall we?

428
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:37,303
Oh, hold on. The two of
you can take your time.

429
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,543
I would like to make sure
all the rooms are tidy.

430
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,212
Please excuse me.

431
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,182
What's with you?

432
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:56,882
No touching. Remember?

433
00:28:56,882 --> 00:29:00,892
The more I think about it, the more
meaningful that phrase becomes.

434
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:03,323
Even if we do not
agree on everything,

435
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,862
we can coexist and
find joy in it.

436
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,362
It is truly
wonderful, is it not?

437
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,233
Accepting each
other's differences...

438
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:14,202
and reaching an understanding by
transcending those differences.

439
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:15,972
Goodness, are you a
philosopher or something?

440
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:18,243
"No touching" took you that far?

441
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:23,142
Oh, right. You're a
politician after all.

442
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:27,152
You saw how delighted your
father was to see us together.

443
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:30,652
I am trying to be a good
son-in-law, so please cooperate.

444
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,253
Gosh.

445
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:54,442
All the servants look
strong and nimble,

446
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:55,942
which is unusual.

447
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:59,083
And they know the layout of the
house like the back of their hands.

448
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,983
- Let us go.
- Sure.

449
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:15,833
I am truly glad that I
asked you to show me around.

450
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:20,503
Of course, you would know
how valuable these are.

451
00:30:20,872 --> 00:30:22,642
Well... Oh, this.

452
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:26,243
This white porcelain
and that folding screen.

453
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,283
I went through hoops to
get my hands on them.

454
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:33,952
May I take a closer look?

455
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:35,583
Yes, of course.

456
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,452
If you see here...

457
00:30:42,462 --> 00:30:45,932
My gosh, you do not need
to see the backside.

458
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:49,632
When it is a good work of art,
even the backside looks exquisite.

459
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,833
Be careful, my Queen.

460
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,872
- What is it?
- Bewitched by your dazzling beauty,

461
00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:00,813
even a bee flew in.

462
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:03,813
- A bee?
- My gosh! Where?

463
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,543
- Where is it?
- Right there. Behind her.

464
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:07,353
- Look carefully.
- There is no bee.

465
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:10,353
- Where? Where is it?
- Gosh.

466
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,353
- Where is it?
- It is gone now.

467
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:18,563
My Queen, what do you think
of this folding screen?

468
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:27,503
Strong brushstrokes. It is a
splendid landscape painting.

469
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,202
It must've been expensive.

470
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,942
You must be worried someone might
steal all these valuable things.

471
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:39,983
But I am sure you have guards
that protect these at night.

472
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:44,753
No, I do not have any guards.

473
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:48,553
In this day and age,
the guards you hire...

474
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:51,462
are actually likely to steal
what they were hired to protect.

475
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:53,263
Then what do you do?

476
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:56,303
I trained some servants whom I
trust and have been working...

477
00:31:56,303 --> 00:31:58,462
for my family since
they were very young,

478
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:00,372
so they also do the
job as my guards.

479
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:03,003
It is cheaper than hiring
professional guards.

480
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:06,912
You are very wise.

481
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:09,283
So how many of your servants
double as your guards?

482
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:16,553
That is confidential
information.

483
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:21,593
Then you do not have to tell me.

484
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:24,823
However, my Queen
is staying here,

485
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:26,733
so I am naturally concerned.

486
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:28,493
"My Queen"?

487
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,972
There are about 26 to 27.

488
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:39,513
There are no secrets
between you and me.

489
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:46,513
You have more than enough men
to protect a nine-room mansion.

490
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:49,013
Hearing about your men does
give me a sense of relief.

491
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:51,753
Anyway, I doubt that
you have old books...

492
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:53,853
that date back to a few
centuries in your library.

493
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:58,823
Money is not the only thing
you need to obtain such items.

494
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,333
You will be quite surprised.

495
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,103
Is that so? I will be?

496
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:11,943
On our way to the library,

497
00:33:11,943 --> 00:33:13,673
you will see an umbrella
pine tree I cherish.

498
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:18,342
The shape of the tree resembles
the shape of a phoenix.

499
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:23,322
To be honest, I heard that
if I planted the tree,

500
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:25,483
there would be a
queen in our family.

501
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,923
The prediction was spot on.

502
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:32,162
We are almost there.
Please follow me.

503
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:34,733
That darn umbrella pine tree.

504
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,762
I'll use that for
firewood this winter.

505
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:41,133
It is nice to hear your rough
and arrogant comments again.

506
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:44,802
When your behavior
changed at first,

507
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,072
I thought you were
abusing your authority.

508
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:49,313
I thought you were trying...

509
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:51,642
to trample upon
me with your clan.

510
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:53,512
It was a misunderstanding.

511
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:55,052
You were just...

512
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:57,182
"Just"?

513
00:33:57,622 --> 00:33:59,523
You were just arrogant.

514
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:04,092
My family is well-off. I
can afford to be arrogant.

515
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,992
But I meant it when I said
I wanted to understand you.

516
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:11,103
I would like to know...

517
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:15,603
how a woman from a noble family
could turn out like you in Joseon.

518
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:18,302
There's no need.

519
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:21,613
A woman like me could
never be from Joseon.

520
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:24,742
"I am the most powerful
one in this world."

521
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,782
You sure are arrogant.

522
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:41,233
That hurts.

523
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:54,912
RESTORATION: ENTHRONING THE
KING AGAIN AFTER DETHRONING HIM

524
00:34:54,912 --> 00:34:56,182
RESTORATION: ENTHRONING THE
KING AGAIN AFTER DETHRONING HIM

525
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:23,603
What is wrong?

526
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:27,943
It is nothing.

527
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:30,412
Gosh.

528
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:34,483
His health must have deteriorated
as he was worried about you.

529
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:37,653
I will get some helpers
to escort you inside.

530
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:39,353
Please look after
him until I do so.

531
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:52,233
What's wrong?

532
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,872
It's like you're seeing
a ghost or something.

533
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,613
This damp smell...

534
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:06,483
Spare me.

535
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:09,853
It is my fault. I am
responsible for the death.

536
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:14,322
In this well...

537
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:28,633
Your Majesty.

538
00:36:59,572 --> 00:37:01,603
Help His Majesty now. Hurry.

539
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:03,972
Royal Noble Consort Eui?

540
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:06,572
What happened?

541
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:08,313
You look pale.

542
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:10,313
Did you...

543
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:15,952
Father, can you escort
His Majesty inside?

544
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:22,822
I think Royal Noble Consort
Eui has come to speak to me.

545
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:25,693
I came here as I was
worried about your health.

546
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,833
But His Majesty seems unwell.

547
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,503
What happened?

548
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:32,133
I could not sleep last night.

549
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:35,302
I only felt dizzy for a second.

550
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,572
Please let me escort
you to the guesthouse.

551
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:38,872
I have called for
a physician too.

552
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,242
I do not need a physician.

553
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,313
I will be fine once
I get some rest.

554
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:47,552
- Hurry. Help His Majesty now.
- Okay.

555
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,383
Be careful.

556
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,532
Be careful.

557
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:14,813
Step outside.

558
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:21,782
Would you like to lie down?

559
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:23,383
No.

560
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:26,853
I can get some
rest sitting down.

561
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:34,233
I heard that you have lost
most of your memories...

562
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:36,432
in Hanyang when you were young.

563
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:41,872
I was very young back then.

564
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:45,773
And I left Hanyang for
an unfortunate incident.

565
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:48,572
So I do not remember much.

566
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:50,043
That is a relief.

567
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:56,052
I only said that because it
is better to let go of...

568
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:57,782
bad memories.

569
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:02,293
I agree too.

570
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:10,463
This nose opened Pandora's box.

571
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,472
You seem fine contrary
to what have heard.

572
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,302
But I still gave you the
benefit of the doubt.

573
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:22,472
Don't worry. I didn't
tell him anything.

574
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:27,213
Isn't that why you rushed here?

575
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:28,782
Then, what do you want?

576
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,583
You must have lured
him here for a reason.

577
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:36,322
I really wanted to
get along with you.

578
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:39,363
Perhaps, you were the source of
my hormones or my last resort.

579
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:41,293
As long as I desired you,

580
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,103
I could've been myself
despite my physical features.

581
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:49,302
But I found out the
truth about you.

582
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:51,572
"The truth"?

583
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:57,642
That you are the
fake Kim So Yong.

584
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:02,153
Did you just call me...

585
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:04,822
fake?

586
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:07,653
I got my memories back.

587
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:10,563
More like your true
colors are exposed now.

588
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:16,363
I'll help you out since you
activated my hormones before.

589
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:18,563
You should come
clean to the King.

590
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:21,003
He'll feel betrayed if he
finds out from someone else.

591
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,173
You are threatening me.

592
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:26,943
I heard you loud and clear.

593
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:33,583
Your Highness, I am here to
serve you the refreshments.

594
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:41,822
Gosh. It's hard to
get through to her.

595
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:44,492
She's holding to a relationship
that's twisted and tangled up.

596
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,032
No wonder why she is so
twisted. That's such a turn-off.

597
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:49,492
Let's go inside.

598
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:03,642
Your Majesty.

599
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:07,782
Are you already
done talking to her?

600
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,952
Leave us alone for a moment.

601
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:15,153
Are you all right?

602
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:17,963
I am sorry for worrying
you when this is nothing.

603
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:24,363
You do not have to be so
formal. It is just us here.

604
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:30,503
Your Majesty, the Queen
has made a full recovery.

605
00:41:30,773 --> 00:41:32,372
Please come back to
the palace with me.

606
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:33,412
I cannot.

607
00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:37,242
I need to look into something.

608
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,512
"Look into something"?

609
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:44,952
May I ask what it is?

610
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:50,762
Goodness.

611
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,133
I apologize for my bad manners.

612
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:57,802
I have set up a nice room.
Let me escort you to the room.

613
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,972
I must get back to the palace.

614
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:07,342
Then, I will wait for
you at the palace.

615
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:08,872
Travel safe.

616
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,353
His grandfather
was Prince Euneon.

617
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:17,094
He was framed for treason,
exiled, and eventually executed.

618
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:19,353
His father was Prince Jeongye.

619
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:21,023
He lived in exile
with his father,

620
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:22,793
got sick, and died.

621
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:25,693
His grandmother and aunt got
killed for getting baptized,

622
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:28,003
and his half-brother,
Lee Won Gyeong,

623
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,503
also got killed for treason.

624
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:32,204
This isn't "Emergency
Escape Number 1".

625
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:37,574
Why did every member of
his family end up dying?

626
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:45,753
Why are you looking
at me like that?

627
00:43:46,414 --> 00:43:48,753
How am I looking at you?

628
00:43:49,623 --> 00:43:51,824
You are looking at me
like I am a pitiful mutt.

629
00:43:53,054 --> 00:43:55,963
Please don't smile. I
already feel bad for you.

630
00:43:56,563 --> 00:44:00,103
This is why they talk about the
harmful effects of early education.

631
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:01,934
I keep remembering
such useless knowledge.

632
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:06,003
You. What do you want from me?

633
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:07,173
Why do you keep sticking
to me like glue?

634
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:10,143
What do I want from you?

635
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:15,244
If the Queen indeed turns
out to be one of our enemies,

636
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,623
I will behead her
with my own two hands.

637
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:26,594
I want you to not be my enemy.

638
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:30,793
You do not have to be
my ally. Just do not...

639
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,233
become one of my enemies.

640
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:38,404
You have a good eye.

641
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:40,643
I may not be very
helpful as an ally,

642
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:42,074
but I can be scary as an enemy.

643
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:43,514
I won't let go until the end.

644
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:46,684
Your Highness!

645
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:54,623
Young Master Kim
Byeong In is here.

646
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,244
I have so many guests today.

647
00:45:14,943 --> 00:45:16,773
It's like I'm a
popular restaurant.

648
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:28,583
Are you feeling okay?

649
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:30,623
The trouble is
that I am too well.

650
00:45:32,154 --> 00:45:33,393
What is the problem?

651
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,293
What is the Department
of Justice doing here?

652
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,693
The King and Queen
are here right now,

653
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:41,034
so it might as
well be the Palace.

654
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,503
Your Highness.

655
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,074
The Department of Justice
will protect you from now on.

656
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:51,114
I have brought the Royal Guards,
so do not worry and leave.

657
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:55,813
Then the Royal Guard will
protect you, Your Majesty,

658
00:45:55,813 --> 00:45:58,554
and the Department of Justice
will protect the Queen.

659
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:00,983
Do you want to waste
manpower for no reason?

660
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:03,454
Then you should have
the Royal Guard leave.

661
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:18,833
You are standing in
the wrong direction.

662
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:21,003
If you are facing outwards,
you are standing guard.

663
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:23,943
If you are facing this
way, you are watching us.

664
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:35,083
I guess my fate is to be
surrounded by those watching me.

665
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:47,634
Who are you?

666
00:47:04,384 --> 00:47:05,514
Are you okay?

667
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:10,824
Wait, this is...

668
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,693
What are you doing here?

669
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,563
Do you know him?

670
00:47:17,994 --> 00:47:20,204
Wake up, Young Master.

671
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,373
Please save me, Byeong In.

672
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:25,974
Byeong In?

673
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,373
Why did he try to
attack the Queen?

674
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:31,744
She could have been in danger.

675
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:34,744
Get lost, you woman.
Get out of this body!

676
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:36,514
- Get lost.
- My Queen.

677
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:47,364
What is that talkative
kid doing here?

678
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,333
What were you thinking?

679
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:55,333
I was so excited
to see her face.

680
00:47:57,873 --> 00:47:59,804
That's right. I am...

681
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:03,474
I am Joseon's...

682
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:05,543
Lady Hong Yeon.

683
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,014
Queen.

684
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:16,224
He is here to see
your court maid.

685
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,693
Is he really unable to recognize
me because I have a beauty mark?

686
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,693
You said the Department of
Justice would protect the Queen,

687
00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:29,204
but I guess you showed how
vulnerable you actually are.

688
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:32,134
Why are you so dissatisfied
with the protection of...

689
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:33,704
the Department of Justice?

690
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:36,173
Are you planning
on doing something?

691
00:48:36,643 --> 00:48:38,673
What could I be
planning on doing?

692
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:45,154
So many storehouses in the
capital are robbed these days.

693
00:48:45,253 --> 00:48:48,523
- So?
- So we must increase the security.

694
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,293
But if you are preventing
us from doing so...

695
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:56,764
I am wondering if you have
been making pocket money.

696
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:01,034
My gosh, Regardless of his
past, he is still the king.

697
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:09,603
I will have it out
with you today.

698
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:11,844
That is exactly what I wanted.

699
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:27,423
I am quite skilled
at martial arts,

700
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:31,233
so I am fine as I avoided his
kick with my fast instincts.

701
00:49:31,463 --> 00:49:34,333
But there is something I would
like to find out from you...

702
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:36,304
which is why I asked
you to meet me.

703
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:39,534
Oh, I see.

704
00:49:40,574 --> 00:49:43,474
I have another request.

705
00:49:44,173 --> 00:49:46,414
I am not sure if I can ask
you for such a request.

706
00:49:49,244 --> 00:49:50,654
What is it?

707
00:49:52,184 --> 00:49:55,483
Can you blow on my bruise?

708
00:50:05,193 --> 00:50:07,704
Even your breath smells so good.

709
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:14,304
I do not know what kind of
feelings I am feeling...

710
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:15,543
at this moment.

711
00:50:16,943 --> 00:50:19,943
There is only one way to find
out what those feelings are.

712
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:22,813
Excuse me.

713
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,384
I must find out.

714
00:50:36,664 --> 00:50:37,864
Why are you over here?

715
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,304
I felt bad for not recognizing
such an important person.

716
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:44,873
Why are you looking
at me like that?

717
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,904
It's a smile with hopes
that you forgive me.

718
00:50:47,273 --> 00:50:50,574
It's a smile that is
better than my good breath.

719
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:14,134
You drink pretty well.

720
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:27,943
I see that you can hold your
liquor quite well yourself.

721
00:51:29,443 --> 00:51:30,713
Of course, I am a king.

722
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,713
They've already gone
through this much liquor?

723
00:52:06,483 --> 00:52:08,023
Finally, it's that time again.

724
00:52:08,384 --> 00:52:10,793
- TDW.
- "TDW"?

725
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,623
The time of dogs and wolves.

726
00:52:14,623 --> 00:52:16,523
It's when those who seemed...

727
00:52:16,963 --> 00:52:19,264
perfectly normal during the
day turn into dogs and wolves.

728
00:52:43,454 --> 00:52:46,123
Let me ask you a
question, man to man.

729
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,063
I hope you do not...

730
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:54,804
have feelings for
the Queen, do you?

731
00:52:55,764 --> 00:52:58,034
That is the only...

732
00:52:58,034 --> 00:53:00,273
plausible explanation as to why
you would have it out for me.

733
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:04,873
In life, you come across complete
losers from time to time.

734
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:09,114
Those who cannot stand
someone else giving love...

735
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:14,384
to the person who
they do not love.

736
00:53:19,423 --> 00:53:24,664
Are you calling me
a possessive loser?

737
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:35,173
You do not even realize...

738
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:36,873
that you have the most
wonderful woman in the world.

739
00:53:39,744 --> 00:53:41,614
So yes, I would call
you a loser and a fool.

740
00:53:44,313 --> 00:53:46,114
Gosh, what are you guys doing?

741
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:48,284
I'm not interested
in either of you.

742
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,893
Wrong.

743
00:53:53,224 --> 00:53:54,623
I know you like me.

744
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,094
Look at my eyes.

745
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:05,434
Hey.

746
00:54:15,943 --> 00:54:19,054
A sage king ought to
have a magnanimous heart,

747
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:21,724
but I won...

748
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:25,724
Goodness.

749
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:30,534
It is time you earned your keep.

750
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,503
I ended up running into you.

751
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:13,173
I was trying to
keep my distance...

752
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:15,043
for I did not want
to bother you.

753
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:17,344
Please, Queen Dowager.
You are not bothering me.

754
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,213
I have a gift for you.

755
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:35,594
This is...

756
00:55:35,594 --> 00:55:38,934
You are the one who deserves
to be with the King.

757
00:55:39,594 --> 00:55:43,063
The Queen title suits
you more in every aspect.

758
00:55:52,943 --> 00:55:54,884
What were you looking at?

759
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:02,054
I was admiring the reflection
of the moon on the lake.

760
00:56:02,384 --> 00:56:05,623
Many horror stories are
circulating the palace.

761
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:08,393
Stories about
ghosts, for instance.

762
00:56:09,623 --> 00:56:14,164
One of them is about
how you should never...

763
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:17,733
look into the lake on the
night of the full moon.

764
00:56:19,634 --> 00:56:21,443
When you leave,

765
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:25,543
your reflection on the lake
will start moving on its own.

766
00:56:31,813 --> 00:56:33,014
I feel as though...

767
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:36,753
I have been submerged
in the lake all my life.

768
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:44,733
Now, it is time...

769
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:48,103
for me to come out of the lake.

770
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:41,054
He could have gone after me.

771
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:42,284
He must have had
to go really badly.

772
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:47,764
But the privy is that way.

773
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:28,733
There is something
I have not told you.

774
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:31,873
In fact, I have not told anyone.

775
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:33,804
It is a secret that only
the Queen and I know.

776
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,083
Werewolves morph into wolves
under the moonlight...

777
00:58:44,684 --> 00:58:46,884
when there is a full moon.

778
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:50,853
But we know...

779
00:58:52,454 --> 00:58:56,063
that the full moon is only
an excuse to let out...

780
00:58:56,063 --> 00:59:00,034
the wolf we've been
hiding inside all along.

781
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,404
This is a chamber pot?

782
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:41,744
I can't handle this
delicate design.

783
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:46,534
Tango?

784
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:22,904
You woke up.

785
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:27,884
Take me to the Queen's chamber.

786
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,514
I will guard her myself.

787
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,143
My Queen...

788
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:33,313
How dare he try to
hurt my poor King?

789
01:02:36,284 --> 01:02:38,414
In the name of justice,

790
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:42,284
I will not forgive you!

791
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:53,193
My move wasn't precise enough
because I drank earlier.

792
01:02:54,364 --> 01:02:57,404
Hey, get up. Are you okay?

793
01:03:04,244 --> 01:03:06,614
Why were you standing there?

794
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:10,143
That way!

795
01:03:18,154 --> 01:03:20,324
Forget "no touching" today.

796
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:27,563
Your Highness.

797
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:29,864
Are you all right?

798
01:03:50,983 --> 01:03:52,753
ALL CHARACTERS, FAMILIES,
DYNASTIES, AND INCIDENTS...

799
01:03:52,753 --> 01:03:54,123
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

800
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:55,563
MR. QUEEN

801
01:04:13,143 --> 01:04:14,914
<i>You had to cause this
trouble, didn't you?</i>

802
01:04:14,914 --> 01:04:18,313
<i>I would have been sad had
you not remembered the night.</i>

803
01:04:18,414 --> 01:04:20,284
<i>You can pay to be included in
someone's genealogical record.</i>

804
01:04:20,284 --> 01:04:22,253
<i>Who knows? Maybe
he sneaked in...</i>

805
01:04:22,253 --> 01:04:24,023
<i>using a fake identity
to plan a coup.</i>

806
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:25,824
<i>I am responsible for the death.</i>

807
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:27,963
<i>Because I did not
keep the secret...</i>

808
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:29,264
<i>I shall conduct an
undercover inspection.</i>

809
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:30,963
<i>He is mooching off
the Kim family...</i>

810
01:04:30,963 --> 01:04:32,664
<i>who practically slaughtered
his entire family.</i>

811
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,393
<i>You are out of line.</i>

812
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:37,503
<i>- Who are you?
- I'm...</i>

813
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:39,074
<i>a member of the King's fan club.</i>
