1
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:08,555
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,755
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,234
My gosh.

4
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:21,135
I can't believe the
great Jang Bong Hwan...

5
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:24,905
is relying on something like
this to sustain his life.

6
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,245
Life is so futile, isn't it?

7
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,415
I feel so motivated
all of a sudden.

8
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:36,614
So here, I can be Thomas
Edison and Steve Jobs?

9
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:39,385
No. Is there anyone who
achieved even greater things?

10
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:41,854
A hero who saved mankind.

11
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,195
Inside the Queen's body,

12
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:58,004
I see something that
should not be there.

13
00:00:58,604 --> 00:00:59,805
A wicked soul.

14
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,675
She is possessed
by a wicked soul!

15
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,015
I can't leave you like this.

16
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,485
Go away forever.

17
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,465
Yes, Willis Carrier. The man who
invented the first air conditioner.

18
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:28,364
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

19
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:31,075
Wake up, Your
Highness! Please...

20
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,534
Your Highness.

21
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:41,784
EPISODE 7, MASK

22
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:43,284
- 100 joules is ready.
- Clear.

23
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,855
Inject epinephrine.
150 joules, charge.

24
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,355
- 150 joules is ready.
- Clear.

25
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:59,694
- Hurry up.
- I'm going.

26
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,935
Is she not the court maid
from the Queen's Palace?

27
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,804
And following her is
the royal physician.

28
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,214
- What is wrong?
- Her Highness is...

29
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,124
Your Majesty. It is dangerous!

30
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:30,494
Goodness.

31
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,304
Your Highness.

32
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:40,075
I thought about it, and I nag
you for your own benefit...

33
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,344
Your Highness.

34
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:44,814
Your Highness!

35
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:47,744
What happened?

36
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:50,344
Someone has gone out to
bring the royal physician.

37
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,154
Your Highness.

38
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,124
You must not do this.

39
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,295
You must not die like this.

40
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,695
I will not nag you anymore.

41
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:04,035
So please wake
up, Your Highness.

42
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:08,564
Do something!

43
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,675
Your Highness!

44
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:12,675
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,
NAME: JANG B. HWAN

45
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,274
- 100 joules, charge.
- 100 joules is ready.

46
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,304
Clear.

47
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:19,874
150 joules is ready.

48
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:24,584
- He came back.
- What is this?

49
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,325
Gosh, it's so bright.
What is he doing?

50
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,554
His pulse is normal. What
about his blood pressure?

51
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:31,425
His blood pressure
is normal too.

52
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:34,364
The hospital? Wait, am I back?

53
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,665
I came back. I really did.

54
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,265
Mr. Jang Bong Hwan.
You almost died.

55
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:40,864
I know.

56
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:43,304
I thought my life would end while
being trapped in a woman's body.

57
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,235
How many days has it been?

58
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,105
Right. How may days
have I been laying down?

59
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,705
My body feels so heavy.

60
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,005
It has been a week.

61
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:52,144
The time passed just
like it did in Joseon.

62
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:53,915
First, help me up.

63
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,945
He's been unconscious
for a week,

64
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,285
so he's in a vegetative state.

65
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,885
What do you mean by
vegetative state?

66
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,624
Listen, Dr. Lee. Are
you talking about me?

67
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,725
Why would you say I'm in a
vegetative stage when I'm fine?

68
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:07,864
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,524
- Keep monitoring him.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,535
Where are you going?

71
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,665
Come back! I'm totally fine!

72
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:16,835
I'm totally fine!

73
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:20,235
What's this? Can't
anyone hear me?

74
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,905
I'm right here. I came back.

75
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,614
I, Jang Bong Hwan, am back!

76
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,345
When is the royal
physician getting here?

77
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,415
Queen!

78
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,054
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

79
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,324
My Queen. Please wake up!

80
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:38,025
What on earth happened?

81
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,965
She just stood up
all of a sudden,

82
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,235
and then she became pale
and fainted like that.

83
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,804
How could she faint
like this for no reason?

84
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,105
It must be poison.

85
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,175
She must have been poisoned!

86
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:53,574
What?

87
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,475
There is no way.

88
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,415
Not only do we take care
of all the ingredients...

89
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,145
forbid outsiders from
entering this place,

90
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:04,085
but the Queen has not
eaten anything here.

91
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:06,785
What did the Queen do here?

92
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:08,454
Did she cook?

93
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,485
Yes.

94
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:14,994
Then she could have
consumed poison...

95
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:17,165
while tasting the dish or
ingredients, Your Majesty.

96
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:20,764
I cannot be sure about that.

97
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,204
You jerks.

98
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,704
I was always afraid that...

99
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,304
something like
this might happen.

100
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:30,975
In the end, this has happened!

101
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:34,145
I cannot believe she
has been poisoned!

102
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,085
I will...

103
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:39,215
I will take a look at her.

104
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:40,624
Hurry.

105
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:53,665
This is...

106
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,804
not the pulse of
a living person.

107
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:58,975
What do you mean by that?

108
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:12,014
She is in a vegetative state.

109
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:13,715
A STATE WHERE THEY HAVE A
PULSE BUT IS BARELY BREATHING.

110
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,324
She is in a vegetative state?

111
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:19,395
They call it a vegetative state as
they cannot move like a vegetable.

112
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:23,824
Her blood circulation and qi energy
has gathered to the top of her body,

113
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:27,465
so her spirit has left her body,
and she has stopped breathing.

114
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:30,835
If her qi energy returns,
she will live. But if not...

115
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,905
she will die.

116
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,074
What do you mean she will die?

117
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:42,585
Then...

118
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,054
what must I do to save her?

119
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:50,124
You must pour hwanotang and
sweet flag juice into her mouth.

120
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:51,254
Head Eunuch.

121
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:53,194
Go tell them you need
those medicinal herbs.

122
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:54,295
Yes, Your Majesty.

123
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:56,564
Do you think the Queen
can stay alive until then?

124
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,835
That is the problem.

125
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,934
Do not just stand there and
wait. Do something right now!

126
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:05,434
Please save our queen.

127
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:08,975
In order to do that,
we must move her.

128
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:14,785
Let us go to Daejojeon Hall.

129
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:17,614
Your Highness.

130
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:19,785
Queen Dowager.

131
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:23,725
You must get rid of the evil
spirit in the Queen's body.

132
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,855
You must do it right now.

133
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:29,124
Is there a way?

134
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,994
We must place ominous things
around Daejojeon Hall...

135
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,595
and block the energy.

136
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,535
Then we must chase it
away with an exorcism.

137
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,235
That is dangerous. We cannot
perform an exorcism in the Palace.

138
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,105
If we get caught...

139
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,715
It will be pointless if
it is not in the Palace.

140
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:49,114
It must be done in the
closest place to the Queen...

141
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,085
for it to be effective.

142
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,595
Hurry.

143
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,235
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:08,835
- Are you done?
- Yes, I am done.

145
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,114
What happened?

146
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,054
The patient just went
into cardiac arrest.

147
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,355
Listen. Over here. Look here.

148
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:30,725
Can you hear me?

149
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,564
Is he saying something?

150
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,194
Yes. You hear me,
right? I knew it.

151
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,064
I can see and hear everything, so
how can I be in a vegetative state?

152
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,204
Is that so?

153
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:45,505
Is he really saying something?

154
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,604
He says he's being
falsely accused.

155
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:48,905
Hey, you dumb, little idiot.

156
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,545
- I can hear you, you jerk.
- I'm sure he feels that way.

157
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,415
He's stuck in the middle of Mr. Han
and the prime minister's fight...

158
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:55,844
and is about to
take all the blame.

159
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:56,944
What is going on?

160
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,615
This was all Mr. Han,
that jerk's doing?

161
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,395
Start treating her.

162
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,365
The more I look into him,
the crazier he seems,

163
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,734
but he's not the type to
be victimized like this.

164
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:22,104
What can he do? It's a situation
where he will always end up losing.

165
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,675
It could be better for him
to be laying here like this.

166
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:26,515
Are you being serious right now?

167
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,515
If you were in my situation, would
you lay here and suffer like me?

168
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,785
Is that something that
detectives should say?

169
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:35,724
Then...

170
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,495
I will put my life on the
line and apply acupuncture.

171
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,645
I won't leave him alone.

172
00:09:57,104 --> 00:10:00,474
That evil jerk, Mr. Han.

173
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,255
My goodness.

174
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,824
I'm going to chew him up.

175
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,425
Why are you here?

176
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,035
My Queen!

177
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:22,204
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

178
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:23,604
Your Highness!

179
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:27,275
You ate everything without being
cautious, and you even took poison.

180
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,775
What else do you want to chew?

181
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:41,454
We have overcome
the biggest crisis.

182
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,155
But why is she
still unconscious?

183
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:47,255
She has started breathing again,

184
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:50,594
but she is not
back to normal yet.

185
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,395
She could fall back into
a critical condition,

186
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:55,834
so we must keep an eye on her.

187
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,234
Are you saying that
she is still in danger?

188
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,635
Tonight...

189
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:02,675
is the pivotal moment.

190
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,184
The king has gone
into Daejojeon Hall.

191
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,324
Why?

192
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,495
The Queen has collapsed,

193
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,594
and he wants to stay by her side
all night and nurse her himself.

194
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,204
I understand.

195
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,375
You must change your...

196
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:34,204
I told you I understand.

197
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:08,574
Be sure to keep quiet.

198
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:12,115
If this gets known, you
will not be safe either.

199
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:14,814
Of course. I know it well.

200
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,724
I cannot believe that child is
working for the Queen's court lady.

201
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:28,594
How can everything fall
into place like this?

202
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:33,334
I knew it. The
spirit is helping us.

203
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,104
Queen Dowager, are you inside?

204
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,545
There will be a big prayer soon.

205
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:52,015
I am preparing for it.

206
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,454
It is not a big deal,
so please have a seat.

207
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,285
I have something to tell you.

208
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,224
I heard.

209
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:05,665
You asked your father
to withdraw the appeal.

210
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,005
Last time, you told me...

211
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:11,804
that I do not have to
do anything myself.

212
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,204
- I did.
- What if...

213
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,344
I want to do something myself?

214
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:20,515
Does that mean...

215
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:24,615
I can overcome the
Queen for sure?

216
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:52,474
I will stay here all
night, so you may leave.

217
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,814
It is late, and I am
afraid you may end up...

218
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:58,255
getting sick as well.

219
00:13:58,885 --> 00:13:59,954
It is okay.

220
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,755
Head Eunuch, you may leave.

221
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:04,525
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:20,434
There's not even one day I felt
comfortable after coming here.

223
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,944
My husband who sleeps under the same
blanket with me tries to kill me.

224
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,175
If you feel as though your
tongue is becoming stiff,

225
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,084
do not hesitate
and move your hand.

226
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,184
"Get lost"?

227
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:32,615
I gathered my
courage to apologize,

228
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,554
and that is the only
thing you can say?

229
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,724
Hey. If it's up to a person
who apologizes and...

230
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,395
not a person who
is apologized to,

231
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,454
is it an apology?

232
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,395
It's too late. Your
understanding means nothing now.

233
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,604
I had hoped that...

234
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,505
it wasn't too late
to understand you.

235
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:03,285
This is premium fabric.

236
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,954
If I had made clothes
with this material,

237
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:08,584
there is no way I
would not remember.

238
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:10,084
Are you sure?

239
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,724
In order to make silk
flowers for the banquet,

240
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,395
you had some silk delivered.

241
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:17,795
Yes, sir.

242
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:21,094
But was it not an excessive amount
of silk to make some flowers?

243
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,704
The thing is...

244
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:27,704
the advisor to the
Royal Cuisine Office,

245
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:30,145
Lord Kim Mun Geun, took it.

246
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:39,584
Did Lord Kim Mun Geun
take this silk as well?

247
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:42,354
This is...

248
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,275
He seemed to be
burning something rare,

249
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:07,045
so I found him suspicious
and took a close look at it.

250
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:08,645
I am sure of it.

251
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,214
Prince Yeongpyeong?

252
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,395
Could the King have
been behind it?

253
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:24,464
What?

254
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:26,165
The Queen Dowager and
Royal Noble Consort Eui...

255
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,604
have joined hands to perform
a ritual in the palace?

256
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,064
Yes.

257
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,934
I thought Royal Noble
Consort Eui was clever,

258
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:36,375
but it seems she is no better
than the Queen Dowager.

259
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,074
That is good news.

260
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,515
I will be able to teach those
two foolish women a lesson.

261
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,214
Reprimanding them about
the ritual and talismans...

262
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:46,314
will make good
fodder for gossip.

263
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,184
But that will not end them.

264
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:51,525
You are right.

265
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:55,224
I wish I could do more than
just teaching them a lesson.

266
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:01,035
This is the Head Eunuch.
I come with urgent news.

267
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,035
Come in.

268
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,274
What is this about?

269
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,875
The Queen has stopped breathing
and fallen into a vegetative state.

270
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:17,115
She stopped breathing?

271
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:20,415
She started breathing again
with the physician's treatment.

272
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,825
But she needs to be nursed
throughout the night.

273
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,825
How did that happen?

274
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,165
It is suspected that she
might have consumed...

275
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:30,595
poison when she was tasting
food at the royal kitchen.

276
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,575
KIM SO YONG

277
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:47,214
KIM SO YONG

278
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,645
If you truly want to fight...

279
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:23,784
and if you truly
want to defeat her,

280
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:28,925
from now on, you must not
keep any secrets from me.

281
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,325
Will you agree to that?

282
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:39,395
Yes. I will.

283
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,234
So tell me. Is it
safe to say that...

284
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,675
what we see is what we
get with His Majesty?

285
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,615
The King has...

286
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:02,754
the same dream.

287
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:19,734
Is she breathing?

288
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:27,415
She is.

289
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,714
If she is sleeping,

290
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:32,214
she cannot be this quiet.

291
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,954
What is wrong? Are you hurt?

292
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,855
Why...

293
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,925
You always wanted a daughter.

294
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,194
Are you happy now?

295
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:51,835
Now that you are sick
and having a hard time,

296
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:55,145
you must miss your
mother even more.

297
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:18,964
You can beat this.

298
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,964
Shake it off and return to yourself
with full of vim and vigor.

299
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:27,605
You must keep your promise to
follow the no-touching rule.

300
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:32,274
I will forgive you for your
strange way of speaking...

301
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:34,744
and your arrogant attitude.

302
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,284
Please wake up.

303
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,274
I am glad that you
are still here.

304
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:04,815
What is wrong?

305
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,444
The Queen has fallen
into a vegetative state.

306
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:10,684
Are you telling me that
she stopped breathing?

307
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,115
Luckily, she started
breathing again.

308
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:17,484
I want you to lead your
department to Seonwonjeon Hall.

309
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,254
Did someone try to
harm Her Highness?

310
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:25,135
We will point at the Queen Dowager
and Royal Noble Consort Eui.

311
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:35,744
Go away, you evil spirit!

312
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:39,774
I ask the deity to
accept my prayer.

313
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:44,484
Back off!

314
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,254
What do you think you are doing?

315
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,835
How dare you barge in here?
Do you not know where you are?

316
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:00,794
Do you think you can
get away with this?

317
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,504
I will ask you the same question.
Do you think you can get away...

318
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,315
with harming the
Queen of this empire?

319
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:17,544
- What are you doing? My gosh.
- Step back.

320
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,844
- What are you doing?
- Search the entire place!

321
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:23,584
My goodness. What are you doing?

322
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,554
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

323
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:31,453
I was just praying to
bring peace to the court.

324
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:41,673
I found this hideous thing
around Daejojeon Hall.

325
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:44,804
I had nothing to do with that.

326
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,544
Then, did the shaman
act on her own?

327
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:54,584
I guess your deity did not
tell you when you would die.

328
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:59,223
You will die today.

329
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:05,324
Spare me, Your Highness.

330
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:09,693
I just did what the Queen
Dowager has asked me to do.

331
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,294
Shut your mouth.

332
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:17,274
I will perform a ritual
that will break the curse.

333
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:20,374
You will perform a ritual
to break the ritual?

334
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,183
You serve the deity
instead of the king.

335
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,443
So you must think
this place is a joke.

336
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:28,584
That is a misunderstanding.

337
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:30,354
It is too late.

338
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,453
The Queen's life is
already in danger.

339
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:35,753
That cannot be.

340
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:37,824
You are the one who
perform the ritual.

341
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:40,263
And yet, you do not believe
that it was effective?

342
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:43,334
You were foolishly
deceived by a con artist.

343
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,864
And now, look at
what you have done.

344
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:48,304
You have ruined the reputation
of the Internal Court.

345
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,433
And you tried to
murder the Queen.

346
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,703
And you have committed
a grave crime...

347
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:52,943
of putting the
empire in confusion.

348
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:56,473
How will you pay for
all of your crimes?

349
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:01,884
May I ask how the
Queen is doing?

350
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:06,753
Are you going to pretend you
do not know the answer to that?

351
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:09,124
If so, I will tell
you how she is now.

352
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:11,094
She was poisoned.

353
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:15,594
We found arsenic from
the ingredients she used.

354
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:19,503
Arsenic.

355
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,733
I believe you are quite
familiar with arsenic.

356
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:35,084
I believe...

357
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:39,683
you probably know more
about arsenic than I do.

358
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:43,894
You keep saying that.

359
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:48,394
Blaming me for the late
King's death in a delusion.

360
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:55,604
Humans are foolish. They quickly
forget the past like this.

361
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,874
Not knowing how
precious your life is,

362
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,374
which was saved at the cost
of your own child's life.

363
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,844
At that time, you definitely...

364
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:09,814
asked me first.

365
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:13,024
Instead of investigating
the late King's death...

366
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:14,384
related to arsenic,

367
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,953
you asked me to save your life.

368
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:21,223
But what is this?

369
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,294
You lured Royal Noble Consort
Eui who knows nothing...

370
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:24,963
into putting a curse
and using poison.

371
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:28,473
Are you not shamed in
front of the late King?

372
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,943
Well, I am not surprised.
If you knew shame,

373
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:34,173
you would have died with
the late King at that time.

374
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:38,713
Saying I am wronged
would be useless.

375
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,013
You already know
that I am wronged...

376
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:45,923
more than anyone.

377
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,453
If you keep claiming
that, there is no choice.

378
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:49,653
Hear me out.

379
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:53,794
Dismember the shaman
and Court Lady Han!

380
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:55,064
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

381
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:59,604
Please forgive me,
Grand Queen Dowager!

382
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:02,503
Please forgive me,
Grand Queen Dowager!

383
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:05,304
Let go of me!

384
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:08,344
And Queen Dowager.

385
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:11,344
Please spare...

386
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:15,013
my life.

387
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:19,524
Please spare me,
Grand Queen Dowager!

388
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:22,253
Begging again will not work.

389
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:23,993
Until when should I pity you...

390
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,163
and tolerate you?

391
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:28,933
I will never turn a
blind eye this time!

392
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:30,763
It was a mistake.

393
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:34,564
Please give me an opportunity...

394
00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:36,233
to redeem my mistake.

395
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:39,973
How can you redeem
such a grave sin?

396
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:46,144
You must be confident...

397
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,884
that you are completely...

398
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:53,223
in control of the King.

399
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:56,993
You were that confident
about the late King as well.

400
00:26:57,054 --> 00:27:00,163
And you ended your regency.

401
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:02,233
Did you forget it?

402
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:14,703
Does what Queen Dowager
said bother you?

403
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:22,854
I will check it for you.

404
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:26,024
What kind of person the King is.

405
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,463
What on earth are you doing?

406
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:41,503
Your Majesty!

407
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:51,243
What is the noise I hear?

408
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,144
I will escort the Queen.

409
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:56,114
Escort?

410
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:58,314
To where?

411
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:00,723
I cannot tell you.

412
00:28:13,304 --> 00:28:16,203
You cannot tell me
where the Queen will go?

413
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:22,013
Did something happen?

414
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,274
A fake face.

415
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:28,344
A curse against the Queen was
performed at Seonwonjeon Hall...

416
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,153
by Queen Dowager...

417
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,784
and Royal Noble Consort Eui.

418
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:37,824
Royal Noble Consort Eui
would never do that.

419
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:41,824
Are you trying to claim the curse is
the cause of the Queen's sickness?

420
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:45,463
Arsenic was found at
the royal kitchen.

421
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:53,544
The Department of Justice will
start the investigation from now on.

422
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:56,614
There are questions to be
asked to you regarding that.

423
00:28:58,274 --> 00:29:00,183
Where and what did you and
Prince Yeongpyeong do...

424
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:04,213
the next night of
the royal wedding?

425
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:08,794
What are you doing?

426
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:11,554
Show me your true face.

427
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:13,864
I guess you cannot remember it.

428
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:18,163
If so, I have to officially
investigate Prince Yeongpyeong.

429
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:24,703
Stop right there!

430
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:30,013
Your Majesty.

431
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:43,354
Please do not move anymore.

432
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:48,024
Before your military
disrespectfully harm your body.

433
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:06,943
Stop.

434
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:09,614
It is a royal command.

435
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:15,923
She is my woman.

436
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:21,294
If you touch her even with
the tip of your finger,

437
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:24,463
this sword will cut your throat.

438
00:30:32,304 --> 00:30:35,814
I did not know how
dearly you care for her.

439
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,544
You do not know many things.

440
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:41,983
Let me teach you myself.

441
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,394
Can you see me?

442
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:06,203
I am the king of this country!

443
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,544
Whose soldiers are you?

444
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:14,943
You are my soldiers.

445
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:18,384
Step back.

446
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,834
Your Majesty.

447
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,943
What kind of disloyalty is this?

448
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:41,703
Withdraw them right now.

449
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:45,114
If you do not want to see blood
in the sacred Daejojeon Hall.

450
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:48,614
If it is your command,
Prince Yeongpyeong...

451
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:51,713
will gladly let blood
stain his hands.

452
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:55,253
I had questions to ask.

453
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:57,624
You came at the right moment.

454
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:03,634
I did not order
the investigation.

455
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:09,874
Whose order is Department
of Justice obeying now?

456
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,913
I will examine the
incident first.

457
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:23,114
So you will not be able to
frame the innocent again.

458
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:26,024
The most innocent
is always the Queen!

459
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:28,824
I told you.

460
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:32,693
If you make her miserable, you
will live in misery as well.

461
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:39,134
I said it was not a threat,
but I have to change my words.

462
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:40,433
How dare you!

463
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:54,713
That woman is not
your cousin anymore.

464
00:32:56,284 --> 00:32:57,913
The person who is in charge...

465
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,554
of her happiness and misery
as well as her safety...

466
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:04,723
is not you, the head of
the Department of Justice,

467
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:06,923
but me.

468
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,363
The Queen will be moved
to her family's house.

469
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:19,644
Bring the royal palanquin.

470
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:21,544
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

471
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:34,553
Let us go.

472
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:47,133
I was late.

473
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:48,433
It is the side you
have been trying...

474
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:51,533
to hide.

475
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:15,524
Escort her carefully.

476
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,133
Yes, Your Majesty.

477
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:19,464
I am sorry that I let
you go by yourself.

478
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:35,814
Do not lower your
guard until you arrive.

479
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:38,714
Keep guard through the
night after arriving.

480
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:39,984
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

481
00:34:55,703 --> 00:34:59,473
I bet everyone but me will be
able to relax at the palace.

482
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:03,243
Why am I humming
and in a good mood?

483
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,553
By the way, Kim Hwan should
have been here by now.

484
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:13,383
Speak of the devil.

485
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:18,723
I was worried that I might
not be able to see you...

486
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:20,194
before I leave...

487
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:23,194
Who is this?

488
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:27,763
I made a good friend today.

489
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:31,404
His name is Lee Saeng Bang.

490
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:34,174
I met him when I was looking for
my other friend, Lee Saeng Mang.

491
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:36,973
We are meant to be friends.

492
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:38,743
We are meant to be friends.

493
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:41,444
I wanted to grab a
drink with you...

494
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:43,754
and play some cards.

495
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:46,683
Do you think this is a bar?

496
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:50,254
You want to drink and play
cards here? What a mess.

497
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:53,424
What? But that is
what we do here.

498
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,933
It was only allowed for you.

499
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:58,263
Only for you, Kim Hwan.

500
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,203
- Only for you.
- What?

501
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,973
I did not know you
were that easy.

502
00:36:06,504 --> 00:36:09,473
Do you easily make good friends and
have more friends than you want?

503
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:12,174
I guess I was one of
your easy friends...

504
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:15,183
and one of your many friends.

505
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:51,683
So did you ditch your little
friend, Lee Saeng Bang?

506
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:53,024
You are wanted in
the palace now.

507
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:55,323
What?

508
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,033
How come no one is here today?

509
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:08,303
Did everyone leave to see
something exciting without me?

510
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:13,843
Why do I feel so
alienated lately?

511
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:26,624
You! Lee Saeng Bang!
Have you been well?

512
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,553
We met at last!

513
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:36,633
I was mistaken. I mistook
you for my friend.

514
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:38,694
I am sorry.

515
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:43,874
I am not your friend.

516
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,904
But I have something great.

517
00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:58,754
What are these
strange-looking things?

518
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:00,124
They are...

519
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:05,254
The curfew has not
been lifted yet.

520
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,564
- Why are you out on the street?
- Hide them.

521
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,194
You are...

522
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:15,363
You were spanked last
time for what you did.

523
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,803
Are you here to sell
erotic books again?

524
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:18,834
"Erotic"?

525
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,613
This man was trying
to sell it to me.

526
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,383
You are charged for
corrupting the public morals.

527
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:28,944
Take them to the
government office.

528
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:30,053
- Yes.
- Yes.

529
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:33,024
- Wait. I...
- My gosh. Let go of me.

530
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:34,754
- Wait.
- Hold on.

531
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,624
- Please go easy on me.
- That jerk...

532
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:38,624
Please go easy on
me. I am scared.

533
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:41,794
He specifically asked me about
the night after my wedding.

534
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:44,464
So the Queen has told him.

535
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:47,803
I did find it odd that she
kept it a secret that long.

536
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:50,334
If he knew that I
tried to kill her,

537
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:52,743
he would not have stopped
at interrogating me.

538
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:56,444
On the day of his appointment,
he recited an idiom.

539
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:58,674
"After rescuing an
empire from a crisis,"

540
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,383
"the authority brings
fear to the king."

541
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,913
That arrogant jerk.

542
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:05,314
He is threatening that
he will dethrone you.

543
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:09,254
If he is willing to go that far,
you should have bitten your tongue.

544
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:10,493
Then,

545
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:12,624
he would have pressed His Majesty
for his whereabouts that night.

546
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:15,493
He set up a trap that would have
exposed His Majesty no matter what.

547
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:16,663
He is a smart guy.

548
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:20,104
He must have found something.

549
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:22,904
I will find out
how much he knows.

550
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:27,874
For the time being, we must
hope that the Queen wakes up.

551
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:32,113
That is the most important
thing for everyone.

552
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:33,444
What about the training?

553
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:35,413
Kim Byeong In is out to get us.

554
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,584
We must push ourselves even
more at times like this.

555
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:40,624
That means we do not
have much time left.

556
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:43,053
Gosh.

557
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:45,124
Hold up your lantern.

558
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,404
How far is she?

559
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:58,904
She is on her way.

560
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:01,004
Are you sure she is not
in critical condition?

561
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:03,774
Fortunately, she is not.

562
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:04,874
Gosh.

563
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:07,413
How could this happen?

564
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:10,683
Poisoned? How could
she be poisoned?

565
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:14,624
I have already called the
best physicians in Joseon.

566
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:16,754
Goodness.

567
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:19,894
I must especially try to
stay calm at times like this.

568
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:25,093
I must calm down and
think objectively.

569
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:27,763
Gosh.

570
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:30,404
My goodness.

571
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:34,573
Goodness.

572
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:36,743
How cruel.

573
00:40:37,174 --> 00:40:39,214
The Queen Dowager lost
her husband to poison.

574
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:40,613
How could she frame the Queen
Dowager for poising the Queen?

575
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,314
As things are not going well,

576
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,254
Hwa Jin, you must keep your
distance from the Queen Dowager.

577
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:47,553
It happened on the day
when I visited her.

578
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:49,424
I have given them an excuse.

579
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:50,823
Do not beat yourself up for it.

580
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:53,263
They would have
done that anyway.

581
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:55,223
But...

582
00:40:56,464 --> 00:40:59,234
why did you move the
Queen back to her home?

583
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:01,533
She must have been
lonely at the palace.

584
00:41:01,964 --> 00:41:03,933
She asked for her mother
when she was asleep.

585
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:08,473
The Queen wanted it.

586
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:10,814
What is it?

587
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:12,814
Is there a problem?

588
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:18,413
- No.
- Do not worry.

589
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,683
I will send my brother as
soon as things get sorted out.

590
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:29,294
Your Majesty.

591
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,004
Please.

592
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:40,604
Will you go against
the King's order?

593
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:48,183
Please do not get hurt.

594
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:51,984
Okay.

595
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,033
Now that you are here,

596
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:12,504
it feels like we have
traveled back in time.

597
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,413
Byeong In.

598
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:23,854
You are the only person who comes
to look for me when I am hiding.

599
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:26,584
I will not let go of you.

600
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:30,694
I will not forget you.

601
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:36,593
If only I could go
back to that day...

602
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:44,774
She is my woman.

603
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,144
You should have been mine.

604
00:42:56,154 --> 00:42:58,013
And I, yours.

605
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:47,863
Do you know who I am?

606
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:51,133
My name is Kim Hwan who
will soon be a member of...

607
00:43:51,703 --> 00:43:52,973
the Department of Justice.

608
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:54,803
Getting an advance on your
grains was not enough for you.

609
00:43:54,803 --> 00:43:56,343
Are you taking an advance
on your future appointment?

610
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,413
An advance?

611
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,113
I am an upright scholar.

612
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,883
Can you not see that I am
righteous as I am only a scholar...

613
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:05,783
at Royal Confucian Academy
despite my looks and talent?

614
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:09,593
I do not put up with any
kinds of injustices...

615
00:44:09,593 --> 00:44:10,754
Be quiet.

616
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:13,593
We have a talkative one today.

617
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:16,533
How dare you? If you let
me get out of here now,

618
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,734
I will give you
five silver coins.

619
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:20,263
Can you...

620
00:44:23,004 --> 00:44:24,274
give it to me instead?

621
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:28,843
I will give you an
important lesson, then.

622
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:39,883
Once you listen to
what I have to say,

623
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:45,694
you will no longer be the
same person you used to be.

624
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:50,663
You will become a true adult.

625
00:45:06,444 --> 00:45:09,584
- Are you entering the Palace?
- Yes. Are you just getting home?

626
00:45:10,013 --> 00:45:12,283
I heard what happened between
you and the King yesterday.

627
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:14,424
Oh, I see.

628
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:16,794
Even if he is not
that great of a man,

629
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:19,794
if you keep pressing him,
he will act like one.

630
00:45:20,124 --> 00:45:22,223
Why did you do something
I did not tell you to do?

631
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:23,493
That is because...

632
00:45:24,493 --> 00:45:25,763
Those eyes.

633
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:29,834
The eyes of a man who is
keeping his desires hidden.

634
00:45:33,303 --> 00:45:36,473
I did not want the Grand
Queen Dowager to worry,

635
00:45:37,243 --> 00:45:38,714
so I must have been
overly ambitious.

636
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:42,084
Be careful.

637
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,084
Father.

638
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:51,723
Are you not curious as
to how the Queen is?

639
00:45:52,754 --> 00:45:55,163
I heard that she is no
longer in critical condition.

640
00:45:55,163 --> 00:45:57,564
She has yet to regain
her consciousness.

641
00:45:58,163 --> 00:46:00,604
She will overcome it soon.

642
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:03,834
Is there anything else
you would like to say?

643
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,743
I heard that the
Grand Queen Dowager...

644
00:46:06,743 --> 00:46:08,444
has mentioned the
Queen's dethronement.

645
00:46:08,444 --> 00:46:10,714
She just said that out of anger.

646
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,274
It is not how she truly feels.

647
00:46:12,274 --> 00:46:14,183
You are worrying for no reason.

648
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:18,953
I am well aware of how much
you care for the Queen.

649
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,624
It might not be as much as you,

650
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:23,624
but I care for the Queen as well,
so you do not need to worry.

651
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:26,053
Yes.

652
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:27,924
I will see you in the Palace.

653
00:46:48,314 --> 00:46:51,783
The King's father-in-law
has sent us gifts again.

654
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:54,924
How is the Queen?

655
00:46:55,754 --> 00:46:57,593
She is no longer in
critical condition,

656
00:46:57,593 --> 00:47:00,024
but she seems to need rest,
so she has returned home.

657
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:02,294
She continuously gets sick.

658
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:05,064
After her accident, she has
not been completely well.

659
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:06,363
How should I put it?

660
00:47:07,064 --> 00:47:08,604
It seems like she is broken.

661
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:11,904
I am trying to make
do by fixing her,

662
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:15,203
but she is suddenly in a
vegetative state. She is so weak.

663
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:18,874
What if the Royal Noble Consort
Eui ends up having a prince first?

664
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:20,913
Then the Queen Dowager
will act up again.

665
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:22,243
Do not worry.

666
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:24,913
I am preparing an alternative.

667
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:26,584
An alternative?

668
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:29,453
I have made sure that the other
two candidates to become Queen...

669
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:31,854
did not marry anyone else.

670
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,723
I knew it. You are such
a reliable brother.

671
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:40,803
I heard that Byeong In
accused the King harshly.

672
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,803
Everyone acted strangely
regarding the King yesterday.

673
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:49,814
It was as if the King
was hiding something.

674
00:47:52,743 --> 00:47:54,843
The King is different
from the late king.

675
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:57,453
Makes sense. You were
the one who chose him.

676
00:47:57,453 --> 00:48:00,754
There is only one reason as to why
I put the King in that position.

677
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:04,654
It is so that you do not need
to make a painful decision...

678
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,593
like you did with the late king.

679
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:08,064
That is true.

680
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:11,433
It was quite painful.

681
00:48:11,993 --> 00:48:14,334
I protected this country by getting
the blood of my grandchild...

682
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,763
on my hands.

683
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:18,174
That is why if someone
tries to ruin it,

684
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:21,144
I cannot forgive them even more.

685
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:27,513
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

686
00:49:15,394 --> 00:49:17,433
- You should have some first.
- No, you should have some first.

687
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:20,133
You should have some first.

688
00:49:49,564 --> 00:49:50,863
Where am I?

689
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:54,303
Am I in Joseon or Korea?

690
00:50:01,044 --> 00:50:02,274
I'm in Joseon.

691
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:07,214
I can't say that I'm glad
as I'm upset it's missing,

692
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:10,113
but I can't say I'm upset as
I'm glad I can move to check.

693
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:14,723
Why is it so bright in here?

694
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,243
The empire of gold.

695
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:38,144
Inca?

696
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:42,944
Your Highness!

697
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:48,484
I thought I time slipped
into some other place.

698
00:50:49,854 --> 00:50:52,223
You have finally woken up!

699
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,723
This is like deja vu.

700
00:50:54,723 --> 00:50:56,564
Let's not repeat that fuss.

701
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:01,004
However, you almost died.

702
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:03,203
You had completely
stopped breathing.

703
00:51:05,073 --> 00:51:06,404
Stop crying.

704
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:08,843
I stopped breathing?

705
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:11,613
According to the Royal Physician,
you were in a vegetative state.

706
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,683
It was as if you were dead.

707
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:16,783
I was also in a
vegetative state here.

708
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:19,113
But where am I?

709
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:22,383
You are at home.

710
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:24,854
That means...

711
00:51:24,854 --> 00:51:26,763
I can no longer avoid...

712
00:51:26,763 --> 00:51:28,894
the one person I have
been trying to avoid.

713
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:31,663
- Pardon?
- Nothing is hard for me,

714
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:34,033
but there is one person I
am uncomfortable around.

715
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,203
The person who is like
my natural enemy is...

716
00:51:38,703 --> 00:51:40,203
the fathers of women.

717
00:51:40,803 --> 00:51:41,874
Your Highness.

718
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:45,413
- Goodness, Your Highness.
- Oh, my.

719
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:49,783
Goodness, Your Highness. Are
you okay? Can you breath?

720
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:52,383
What do you need? Shall I
call the Royal Physician?

721
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:54,754
You look like you're
about to pass out.

722
00:51:55,283 --> 00:51:57,794
Here. Drink up.

723
00:51:57,794 --> 00:51:58,924
Okay.

724
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:02,624
That is medicinal herbs
to replenish yin energy.

725
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:03,794
Good job.

726
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:06,904
Why are you sweating so much?

727
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:11,073
Goodness.

728
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:14,073
I was so worried.

729
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:16,843
I could not sleep
at all last night.

730
00:52:17,174 --> 00:52:18,444
I did not have an appetite,

731
00:52:18,444 --> 00:52:20,613
so I have not eaten
since two nights ago.

732
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:23,814
Every time I stand up after
sitting, I feel dizzy too.

733
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:25,984
- You must have been shocked.
- Yes.

734
00:52:26,823 --> 00:52:29,283
The root of illnesses
is worries and woes,

735
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:31,093
so you should get some
rest and calm down.

736
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:33,763
Yes, of course. I will do that.

737
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:36,424
I hope you feel better soon.
Then I'll get going now.

738
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:38,334
Goodness, Your Highness.

739
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:39,533
Where are you going?

740
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:41,703
Goodness.

741
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:44,404
I should not do this.
I must be respectful.

742
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:46,104
Your Highness.

743
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:48,944
Oh, my. What are you doing? You're
making me feel more uncomfortable.

744
00:52:48,944 --> 00:52:50,374
No, do not feel that way.

745
00:52:50,613 --> 00:52:52,613
Please receive my
bow, Your Highness.

746
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:56,084
No!

747
00:52:58,754 --> 00:52:59,814
Gosh.

748
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:01,223
Goodness.

749
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:04,723
Please let me bow
to you once again.

750
00:53:05,154 --> 00:53:06,294
Father.

751
00:53:06,723 --> 00:53:09,263
Everyone in Joseon is uncomfortable
around me as I am the Queen.

752
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:11,133
Please allow me to
be your daughter,

753
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:14,933
So Yong, while I am here.

754
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:21,544
The more honorable the
position, the lonelier you feel.

755
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:23,913
Okay.

756
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:26,544
While you are here,

757
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:28,714
I will treat you as I did...

758
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:31,513
so that you will
feel comfortable.

759
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:33,984
Okay. Have a seat.

760
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:37,053
Yes. Thank you.

761
00:53:38,394 --> 00:53:39,823
Goodness.

762
00:53:46,964 --> 00:53:50,433
No matter how much I decorated
the room, it still felt empty.

763
00:53:51,203 --> 00:53:55,203
Now that you are in here,
the room is lighting up.

764
00:53:57,243 --> 00:53:58,274
Right.

765
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:02,683
The room is so lit up that
it's blinding my eyes.

766
00:54:03,984 --> 00:54:05,383
I love it.

767
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,723
I took special care, so it does
not tarnish your reputation.

768
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:14,394
I prepared everything
else as well.

769
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:17,633
As always, I got the
best of everything.

770
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:58,194
The next doctor please.

771
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:01,763
I couldn't see a
single doctor there,

772
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:03,263
but now they are swarming here?

773
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,174
Is there anyone else
supposed to come?

774
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:16,044
- Why is it a feast table?
- It is breakfast.

775
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:21,683
To help you regain your vigor,

776
00:55:21,683 --> 00:55:23,953
Lord Kim prepared terrapin soup.

777
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:25,323
Here.

778
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:29,993
A terrapin as soon
as I open my eyes?

779
00:55:32,964 --> 00:55:34,303
Watch your step.

780
00:55:37,174 --> 00:55:39,504
Why? What is it?

781
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:41,874
Ta-da.

782
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:52,883
It is an honor to serve
you, Your Highness.

783
00:55:58,694 --> 00:56:01,524
She is the best on-site
beautician in the country.

784
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:04,633
I'm a natural beauty. I don't
need artificial treatment.

785
00:56:07,234 --> 00:56:08,433
Please come.

786
00:56:18,874 --> 00:56:21,044
An appeal for
dethronement and poison.

787
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,754
They are doing everything
to take Her Highness down.

788
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:26,383
Do not worry.

789
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:29,953
As bigger as the tyranny
to harm Her Highness gets,

790
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:32,723
I will try to gain more power.

791
00:56:34,663 --> 00:56:38,763
Having a cousin like you, there
is nothing for her to worry about.

792
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,104
Do you remember this item?

793
00:56:49,343 --> 00:56:51,174
It is a regular silk.

794
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,984
Is there anything
special about it?

795
00:56:55,444 --> 00:56:58,683
Did you gift the gown
made with this to someone?

796
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,484
After Her Highness
became the Queen,

797
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:06,323
I was the one receiving
gifts, not the other way.

798
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:10,633
The only person I offer
gifts is Grand Queen Dowager.

799
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:12,533
I see.

800
00:57:14,303 --> 00:57:15,834
But maybe...

801
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:19,674
The storehouse was
robbed twice recently.

802
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:24,243
This silk could be there.

803
00:57:24,243 --> 00:57:26,774
Your house was attacked?

804
00:57:26,774 --> 00:57:28,183
No, no.

805
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:32,013
If you put all your property
in one place, it is dangerous.

806
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:34,683
You have to keep it
in different places.

807
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:36,323
I have many storehouses.

808
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:42,624
But they only chose the ones
with the most valuable items.

809
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,303
Thinking about it, my
neck becomes stiff.

810
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:53,234
My precious babies.

811
00:57:54,473 --> 00:57:56,973
Is there a way to check...

812
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,573
if this silk is one
of the items stolen?

813
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,913
There are too many of them.

814
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:04,953
It was also dangerous to keep
the record of the property.

815
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:08,084
Now that I said this...

816
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:13,024
Please do not talk to
others about the storehouse.

817
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,823
It is not good if the
public knows about this.

818
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:17,694
I understand.

819
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:23,874
By the way, did you hear something
strange from your father?

820
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:27,004
Did something happen?

821
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:33,413
After Her Highness saved His
Majesty and Consort Eui...

822
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:37,314
and got on the wrong side of Grand
Queen Dowager, it kept bothering me.

823
00:58:38,354 --> 00:58:41,553
I keep having nightmares
where she is dethroned.

824
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:44,993
Dethroned? Why do you
think about such thing?

825
00:58:46,593 --> 00:58:48,993
The rumor says that a secret
message was delivered to a family...

826
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:51,863
whose daughter was eliminated
from the selection of a queen.

827
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:55,703
I am wondering if she is thinking
about selecting a new queen.

828
00:58:57,004 --> 00:59:00,674
I eat immoderately these
days as I worry too much.

829
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:05,413
They will not give up a
person like Her Highness.

830
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:08,214
Right?

831
00:59:09,084 --> 00:59:14,383
I should work harder and bring
Grand Queen Dowagers more gifts.

832
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:17,924
How are you feeling?

833
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,223
What?

834
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:22,294
It is nothing. I can quickly...

835
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,234
No, maybe not that quick.

836
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:28,633
How did you get
into such accident?

837
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:33,774
I forgot about my age
and moved carelessly.

838
00:59:38,613 --> 00:59:41,644
I do not have time
to laugh like this.

839
00:59:54,464 --> 00:59:55,723
How do you feel?

840
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:57,394
I feel like I became
a Barbie doll.

841
00:59:57,763 --> 00:59:58,834
That is great!

842
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:02,734
It means you like it, right?

843
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:32,394
This musty smell of a book.

844
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,633
It smells like a test-taker.

845
01:00:36,404 --> 01:00:38,104
If you were a man,

846
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:40,573
you must have entered the palace as
you passed the state examination.

847
01:00:40,573 --> 01:00:42,544
You enjoyed studying so much.

848
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,413
Who enjoys studying?

849
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:48,484
I did my best just
to please my father.

850
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,814
I was born in exchange
of my mom's life.

851
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:55,024
I thought I should have
worth without realizing it.

852
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:57,854
That is probably why
you studied all night...

853
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,723
until you have a nosebleed
on your birthdays.

854
01:01:11,973 --> 01:01:13,073
So Yong.

855
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,073
Happy birthday.

856
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:29,624
Because my birthday is
my mother's memorial day.

857
01:01:31,953 --> 01:01:33,654
I always felt bad.

858
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:37,993
Where did that come from?

859
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:39,694
Your Highness.

860
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:43,863
Your memories are finally back!

861
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:48,843
What? What are these memories that
seem like mine but not really?

862
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,424
KIM CHANG HYUP

863
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:04,823
- Get out of my way!
- No!

864
01:02:05,424 --> 01:02:06,453
Hey!

865
01:02:06,453 --> 01:02:09,223
Kim Chang Hyup, the
current Minister of War.

866
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,834
The driving force of the indictment
of the military, who levied...

867
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:13,964
unreasonably high military
tax and embezzled it.

868
01:02:16,464 --> 01:02:19,004
Kim Seok Geun. The current
Left State Councilor.

869
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:20,803
In charge of the
Finance Department,

870
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,374
the driving force of the
indictment of grain exchange,

871
01:02:22,374 --> 01:02:23,904
who pocketed the
gifts for the King.

872
01:02:25,144 --> 01:02:27,214
Kim Byung Hak, the current
Chief State Councillor.

873
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:29,413
The driving force of the
indictment of land tax system,

874
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,354
who colluded with
local governors...

875
01:02:31,854 --> 01:02:33,383
and imposed taxes on empty
lands that are not used.

876
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:38,694
Kim Mun Geun.

877
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,064
The father of the Queen.

878
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,823
That is what I am talking about.

879
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:50,234
The father of the Queen,

880
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:51,604
The inspector of
Royal Cuisine Office.

881
01:02:51,803 --> 01:02:53,473
Great Loard Drapery,

882
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:56,203
who deals with everything from
rice loan to military tax system.

883
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:02,084
Kim Jwa Geun.

884
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,913
The current Training Commander.

885
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,163
The one standing at the
height of his power,

886
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:24,064
the foundation of
