ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:13,763
It was you.

4
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:16,334
You were that person.

5
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:26,513
I will not forgive you.

6
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:49,403
I will take your life.

EPISODE 12, DANCING
ON TOP OF A SWORD

8
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,840
EPISODE 12

9
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:58,714
Do you now understand who
the owner of this palace is?

10
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,024
I almost shot you. I
mistook you as prey.

11
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:11,293
Are you sure that you didn't
accidentally miss the mark?

12
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,464
That is a misunderstanding.

13
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:23,473
Remember your place.

14
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,684
I should get changed.

15
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:33,753
Yes, Your Majesty.

16
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:58,374
There is something that the
Department of Justice must do.

17
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,293
Did you have to do that to O Wol?

18
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,824
What did I do?

19
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,363
Did you have to and kill her?

20
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:22,264
Did you have to throw her into
the well after you killed her?

21
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:24,274
Did you have to do that...

22
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,433
to that innocent girl
just to threaten me?

23
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:28,774
I killed her?

24
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:30,913
Why would you have such
a misunderstanding?

25
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,514
I refuse to kill any living thing...

26
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,483
unless it's for cooking.

27
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,913
Finding her body in the well is
either an awful coincidence...

28
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,524
or someone is trying
to come between us.

29
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:47,623
Continue denying until
I get even more furious.

30
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:51,134
My gosh, this is driving me
crazy. I really didn't do it.

31
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:53,464
Why do you have such a
negative opinion of me?

32
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:54,933
Because that is who you are.

33
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:58,834
The Kim So Yong that I know
is someone who would do that.

34
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:01,204
How do you know me so well
when I don't know myself?

35
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:05,444
A liar is best at
lying to themselves.

36
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:08,514
You are fooling yourself which is
why you do not know who you are.

37
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,423
I think you and I have crossed a
line that we can't return from.

38
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:21,163
I won't pay any mind to whatever
misunderstandings you have about me.

39
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:23,464
So do as you please.

40
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:32,774
RABBIT

41
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,154
Who caught her?

42
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:49,384
We worked so hard to go
after her, so who dared to...

43
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,394
Looks like we have a winner.
We should start heading back.

44
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,134
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

45
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:18,683
That's blood.

46
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,524
Darn it.

47
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,754
Are you insane? That
hurts like crazy.

48
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:29,123
I apologize. My hand slipped.

49
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:31,964
- Why you little...
- Are you okay, Your Highness?

50
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:34,334
Even if it is made of
cotton, it must still hurt.

51
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,834
Your Highness. What
on earth are you...

52
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,144
I'll get back at you.

53
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,014
You're dead meat.

54
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,754
Seriously?

55
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:59,623
I'll let it go today for the
sake of my dear consorts!

56
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,563
- Because I'm her superior.
- Of course, Your Highness.

57
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:11,973
Go to Huijeongjeon Hall.

58
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,074
I will help you get changed...

59
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:16,173
There is someone who is trying
to interfere with the banquet,

60
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,813
so I will go alone.

61
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,113
All these people who have
gathered here today...

62
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:58,584
will regard the King
as someone with power.

63
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,913
Everything that has been
said about the King...

64
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,683
and his nickname, the Woodcutter
Prince of Ganghwa Island,

65
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:05,094
will become nothing
more than false rumors.

66
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,094
The King was so adamant
about holding a banquet.

67
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,464
He must have chosen it
as the day to appear...

68
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:12,793
in front of the Royal
Court with a new image.

69
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,834
What on earth were you doing...

70
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,933
while he was preparing himself?

71
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:23,543
I apologize.

72
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:25,274
However,

73
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:29,214
I have also prepared something
in advance for the King,

74
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,084
so keep an eye out for it.

75
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:37,284
I hope you prepared it properly.

76
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,333
Consort Hong.

77
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,203
One point.

78
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,534
Royal Noble Consort Eui. Two points.

79
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:56,774
Consort Min.

80
00:08:58,374 --> 00:08:59,673
Four points.

81
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,114
Consort Yoon. She
also has four points.

82
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,183
The Queen.

83
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:12,323
10 points.

84
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:14,224
Oh, my.

85
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,203
As a result, the
winner is the Queen.

86
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:24,264
The Queen Dowager will
present the award.

87
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:38,713
You said you would
just enjoy the process.

88
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,754
Did you practice in secret?

89
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,224
As I'm a natural-born performer,

90
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,994
I'm better in the real game.

91
00:09:50,494 --> 00:09:53,034
Congratulations, Your Highness.

92
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,663
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

93
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,203
How cunning of her.

94
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:06,073
We must go to the Royal
Palace for the banquet.

95
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,583
We still have time before
the banquet starts,

96
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,083
so you may all get some rest.

97
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,114
I am sure you must be tired
after the hunting game.

98
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:15,724
- Yes, Queen Dowager.
- Yes, Queen Dowager.

99
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:24,764
Did it hurt a lot?

100
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,134
Oh, this?

101
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:30,604
I can see why Eunuch Kim
was so afraid of this event.

102
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,173
Your Highness. You should
return to Daejojeon Hall...

103
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,173
and change into an
outfit for the banquet.

104
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,244
Right. I should get some
rest while we're there.

105
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:40,274
- Of course.
- The back of my head still hurts.

106
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,384
My goodness.

107
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,224
We must hurry. There is not much
time left until the banquet.

108
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,764
Why did she do that?

109
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,604
I am certain that someone is
trying to come between us.

110
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,404
Who?

111
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:11,843
Someone who knows about the bad
relationship regarding the well.

112
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:16,683
Within the Palace, there are three
types of history that continue.

113
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,913
The veiled enmity between women,

114
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,224
the fight for power
in the Royal Court,

115
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:24,994
and death by poison.

116
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,793
Is that why you're always
talking about poison?

117
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:32,963
I have lived in the
Palace for decades,

118
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:36,234
and I saw many people die
from various types of poisons.

119
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,404
Deadly poisons that
kill after one sip.

120
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,104
Hidden poisons...

121
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:44,144
that slowly poison you and
appear as death from illness.

122
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:46,573
They were not revealed,

123
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,744
but I am sure that there
were many deaths...

124
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,484
that were caused by poison.

125
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,553
Right. The Palace is a
very dangerous place.

126
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:00,823
Come to think of it, the man
that looked like Mr. Han...

127
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,264
Right. That guy.

128
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:07,433
Hold on.

129
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:11,904
So she turned around...

130
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,904
Did she see my face? I
do not think she did.

131
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:16,343
That is why I ran away.

132
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:18,274
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

133
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,673
I caught you.

134
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,813
Court Lady Choi.

135
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,953
Go and find out who that guy is.
The guy who was talking to...

136
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:30,984
the Head Inspector just now.

137
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,254
I bet my dragon balls
which I don't have now,

138
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,563
that his last name is Han.

139
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,793
The banquet will start soon.

140
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,134
It can't start.

141
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,803
As long as that guy
is roaming around.

142
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,234
Pardon?

143
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,034
Then what will happen
to the Royal Chef?

144
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,774
That jerk.

145
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:55,413
Why is everything the same
as what I went through?

146
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:59,284
And Cheoljong doesn't
even know what's going on.

147
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:05,293
A person must live as they
look to have no regrets.

148
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,854
I'll be myself and ignore it.

149
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,734
But I'm sure that guy put
something in the water.

150
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:16,904
Was it poison?

151
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,974
Gosh, no way.

152
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,974
Even if the Palace
is a brutal place,

153
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:25,614
would he really commit a mass
poisoning to ruin the banquet?

154
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:27,274
No way.

155
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,784
See? Anxiety and
fear are contagious.

156
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,284
Darn it.

157
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:35,683
Where are you going?

158
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:38,494
I'm going to the scene of
the crime to get evidence.

159
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,124
If you go that way,
it's Daejojeon Hall.

160
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,923
My mind is going back and forth
and so is my sense of direction.

161
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,593
Wait for me, Your Highness!

162
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,553
It smells a bit like grass.

163
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:14,254
What did he put in here?

164
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,124
You must not, Your Highness.

165
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:17,894
Right?

166
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,734
We are in trouble.

167
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:22,933
Your Majesty.

168
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,073
I prepared as much as I could.

169
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,404
The banquet will start soon, but
the ingredients have not arrived.

170
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:32,974
Even if it is late, the
ingredients will come.

171
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,784
Trust me and do not give up.

172
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:42,154
I will try to come up
with something as well.

173
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,504
Just give up.

174
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,874
You will feel better if
you give up, you fool.

175
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:02,604
My Queen.

176
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,713
You already know that
this won't work out.

177
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:07,813
Even if you do your best,

178
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:10,144
you'll only end up hurting
yourself and the people around you.

179
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:15,524
Then should I stay still like a
corpse and suffer in their hands?

180
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,553
I cannot do that.

181
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:24,933
I will do my best to
go as far as I can.

182
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,063
If that hurts you,

183
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:30,963
just ignore me.

184
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,244
Oh, right. We're not
supposed to touch each other.

185
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,004
Okay. I get it.

186
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:48,453
Your Highness. Why would you say
something you do not even mean?

187
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,284
What do you mean?

188
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:53,654
Even when I'm talking nonsense,
I do it with my whole heart.

189
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,624
I never say anything I don't mean.

190
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:57,823
You are worried about him.

191
00:15:57,894 --> 00:16:00,264
You are afraid that the more he
tries, the more he will get hurt.

192
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:02,404
Why would I?

193
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:05,604
Worrying about celebrities
and the King...

194
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:06,774
is the most meaningless thing to do.

195
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:11,443
Recently, whenever you say
something you do not mean,

196
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,274
you always say something strange.

197
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,333
I knew it. He poisoned the water.

198
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:45,173
Hey. Where's the Royal Chef?

199
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:49,083
He was just here.

200
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,244
No!

201
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,083
Did he run away?

202
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:58,083
He acted like he had
such a great work ethic,

203
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,354
but he ran away to survive.

204
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,224
Then what will happen
to the banquet today?

205
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:04,063
The King worked so hard for it.

206
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,434
There are no ingredients
and the head chef ran away.

207
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,903
It's over.

208
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:13,774
Then should I stay still like a
corpse and suffer in their hands?

209
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,603
I cannot do that.

210
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,143
I will do my best to
go as far as I can.

211
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,414
My gosh.

212
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,383
Hong Yeon. You're going
to have to do some work.

213
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,093
Goodness. Thank you
for your hard work.

214
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:34,924
HAN SHIM ONG

215
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:39,333
Okay. Thank you for your hard work.

216
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,803
What is the name of
the man who just left?

217
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,444
Why are you asking?

218
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:50,643
I am asking for a good reason.

219
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:52,214
I cannot tell you.

220
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,543
Gosh.

221
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:01,083
If I leave my unpredictable
Queen alone at the banquet,

222
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:03,924
she might cause trouble.

223
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,853
My gosh. It has been a while.

224
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,623
I caught a cold.

225
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,764
Let me borrow this. Thank you.

226
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,823
Rice. Rice! There is rice!

227
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,424
- Rice! Wait.
- Rice! There is rice.

228
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:40,623
- Come.
- There is rice.

229
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,623
- Rice!
- Get it.

230
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:46,093
- Take the rice.
- Hurry.

231
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,934
- Hurry.
- Take it.

232
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,264
- What is that?
- What?

233
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:53,274
Rice!

234
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:19,164
My goodness. My loyal customer!

235
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:24,903
As it so happens, I have a
lot of killer items today.

236
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,643
I have no time for this.

237
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:35,784
You got the wrong person.

238
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:38,014
What?

239
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:39,984
That is her.

240
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,674
Why are there so many
temptations today?

241
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,244
However, I, Court Lady
Choi, cannot be tempted.

242
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:27,293
You are a court lady. Do
you need to talk to me?

243
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:57,924
You have kept your ability
a secret from me...

244
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,133
all this time and have not done a
thing to make your skills useful.

245
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,164
It must have been quite torture
to just sit back and watch.

246
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:05,974
I am used to it, so
it does not affect me.

247
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:08,873
I see.

248
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,103
All right. Will this do?

249
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:50,684
Are you sure you are not the
man in this kaleidoscope?

250
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,254
Gosh. I told you it
is not me in there.

251
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:56,184
I will be honest with you.
I could tell at a glance...

252
00:21:56,184 --> 00:22:00,454
that he has a chiseled
body just like I do.

253
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:02,664
Unfortunately, that
is not me in there.

254
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:06,333
It is a great honor to
have engraved a name...

255
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,534
of the man with his resemblance.

256
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,333
My gosh. That was
nothing. By the way,

257
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:15,403
is he that popular among
court ladies nowadays?

258
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,014
I do not think "popular" is
the right word to describe it.

259
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:21,843
It is like a fever
among court ladies.

260
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,914
My gosh. I did not know
that I was that handsome.

261
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,553
Gosh.

262
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,053
So your name is...

263
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:35,893
Shim Ong of the Han clan.

264
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:38,863
In full, your name is Han Shim Ong.

265
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,160
CONFIDENTIAL

266
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,129
Do not forget.

267
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,299
When the banquet is at its peak...

268
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,399
and when the King is at his peak,

269
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,869
it is your cue to
bring out the ledger.

270
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:59,539
CONFIDENTIAL

271
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:19,389
Hey, you.

272
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,660
I have a favor to ask you.

273
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,200
Can you give this to that
person over there for me?

274
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,670
Who?

275
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,139
Over there.

276
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,250
I see. Okay.

277
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:50,660
My lord.

278
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
That young master asked
me to give this to you.

279
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,069
There is something I must
tell you in my clan's honor.

280
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:08,780
I will wait for you at the pavilion.

281
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,049
That cannot be.

282
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,020
Are they onto us?

283
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,329
You are here.

284
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:38,639
I have something to tell you.

285
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,270
I know this is rude of
me, but I asked you here.

286
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,149
My clan is as precious
as my own life.

287
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
However,

288
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:56,190
after spending countless nights
in deliberation, I have decided.

289
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,960
I decided to choose something that
is more important than my clan.

290
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,829
If my clan does not allow it,

291
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:05,470
I will...

292
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,369
leave my clan.

293
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,339
Now, I want to be the one and
only handsome man in your eyes.

294
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,780
Are you pulling a prank on me? I
already have a busy day as it is!

295
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,720
It was delivered to
the wrong person.

296
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,399
What have I done?

297
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,910
- My stomach.
- My goodness.

298
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,349
- Stick out your tongue.
- I think I am dying here.

299
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:02,119
Stick it out more.

300
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:04,920
My stomach.

301
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,359
You ate something
with poisonous herbs.

302
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,369
- My stomach.
- Oh, no.

303
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:19,440
I think someone spiked
it with ground knotgrass.

304
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,510
Hey, guys.

305
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,210
- I am dying here.
- What?

306
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,210
What?

307
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:27,750
Goodness. What brings you here?

308
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,049
The Queen has sent me here.

309
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:33,190
Her Highness told me
to look into the water.

310
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,059
Someone added poisonous herbs
that would cause stomachaches.

311
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,789
Darn it. The water was the problem.

312
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,430
How come you are fine?

313
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,599
As you can tell with my
looks, I am quite a sensitive.

314
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,670
So I cannot even drink a drop
of water when I am nervous.

315
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,869
You look like you can doze off...

316
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:53,270
in the field, full of
exploding cannonballs.

317
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,809
You call yourself a royal physician.
You are awful at reading people.

318
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,809
I am a royal physician,
not a physiognomist.

319
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:02,149
I am a skilled physician,

320
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,220
but I do not think they
can fully recover today.

321
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:10,359
With all of them like this, even
if we receive the ingredients...

322
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,889
Who in the world did this?

323
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,299
I have not seen him before.

324
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,510
Are you the one who
poisoned the water?

325
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,289
His Majesty sent me here for
the banquet preparations...

326
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:40,619
as a guest chef.

327
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,359
My name is Lee Saeng Mang.

328
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,460
I have come to your rescue.

329
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:48,829
Here.

330
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,230
Anyone can tell it is
Her Highness the Queen.

331
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,069
Don't you think so?

332
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:58,500
Nonsense! Why are you
calling that man the Queen?

333
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:01,410
Goodness, what is
wrong with your eyes?

334
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,039
The Queen is busy watching the
dance. Why would she be here?

335
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,879
Officially,

336
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:09,520
she is at the banquet
at the moment, you know?

337
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:12,349
Oh. I get it now.

338
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,789
A tomato?

339
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,260
What are you talking about?

340
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,889
This is a persimmon
that only lives a year.

341
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:22,660
Are you from the boondocks
or what? You little punk.

342
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,629
How can a chef not
even know what this is?

343
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,730
Gosh, how dare you call me a punk?

344
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,039
We are both chefs. What is
wrong with calling you a punk?

345
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,039
- Right?
- Yes. You little punk!

346
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,139
Hey, wrong timing.

347
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:36,039
You abandoned the
kitchen and ran off.

348
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,109
Don't call yourself a chef.

349
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:38,280
What are you talking about?

350
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,309
I went to Naenongpo to
find something that can...

351
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:41,710
alleviate their stomachaches.

352
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:43,649
Naenongpo?

353
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,789
Yes, Naenongpo. The Royal Farm.

354
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:46,950
You do not know anything.

355
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,920
Let me see what you brought.

356
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:00,700
Cooking begins with finding
good-quality ingredients.

357
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,740
In the Royal Farm,

358
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
do they raise chickens too?

359
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,480
I think I can try something
if you can get me some eggs.

360
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,059
Your stomach is growling already.

361
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,329
I bet you have not eaten since
yesterday to pig out today.

362
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,399
The fact that you
know that tells me...

363
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:33,369
you have not eaten anything
since yesterday either.

364
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,780
The banquet, which you
insisted on holding today,

365
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,710
will begin shortly.

366
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:48,180
I am looking forward to it.

367
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,670
Every banquet at the
Blue House had a theme...

368
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,210
because it was a political
meeting, never just a meal.

369
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:22,879
What would be good?

370
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,920
What's the goal of this banquet?

371
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,990
What's this?

372
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,359
The menu put together
by the King himself.

373
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,960
And this is the full guest list.

374
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,799
So this is the menu "erection"
you guys were talking about.

375
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,369
I'm going to come up with a new
menu with these ingredients.

376
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,619
How did it go?

377
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,690
I apologize, Your Majesty.

378
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,700
I spoke with the bandits, but they
were not after the ingredients.

379
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:50,940
Finally, the banquet is starting.

380
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,480
You said it would be a
formal royal banquet.

381
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,690
Is this the only dish
that will be served?

382
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,289
This is unfit to be
called a royal meal.

383
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,160
No way. Is this it?

384
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:15,460
I am certain more will follow.

385
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,829
Your Majesty, could you
please explain this?

386
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:21,470
The people starve every
year due to famine.

387
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,069
And many of them starve to death.

388
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,270
To be reminded of their pains,

389
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,609
I prepared a rather humble meal
that the commoners usually eat.

390
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:33,149
I truly admire Your Majesty's
intentions behind this,

391
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:35,849
but "humble" is not the
right word to describe this.

392
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,849
I understand that Your Majesty
wanted to enlighten the ministers,

393
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,349
but we cannot serve
this to the noblemen...

394
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:43,359
who came all the way
here for this banquet.

395
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,490
I agree.

396
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,089
Serving them this when they
were invited as guests...

397
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:49,190
is no better than punishment.

398
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,470
The food may not meet your
expectations, but I hope...

399
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,339
you all see my meaningful
intentions behind it.

400
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,950
30 MINUTES AGO

401
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:14,689
It'll go through the
whole thing like this.

402
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,089
What is this doodle for?

403
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,790
Pass me a potato. I'll
make a sample and show you.

404
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,359
This needle has finally
found its purpose.

405
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,100
Now, heat some oil on the stove.

406
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:01,700
Oil?

407
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,879
How dare you deep-fry
my precious needle?

408
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:12,010
Calm down. I'll
sterilize it for you.

409
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,749
Do you know what that
needle means to me?

410
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:16,879
My master gave it to me.
It was made 50 years ago!

411
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,350
Calm down.

412
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,990
50 years? Then it has done its duty.

413
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,819
No! I want to keep using it!

414
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:24,490
I want to pass it down
to my disciple too!

415
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,919
Don't you dare put it in there!

416
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:34,930
There we go.

417
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:44,680
It looks nice and balanced
with the needle at the center.

418
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,149
And this way, you can cook
even the inside very quickly.

419
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,790
How did you come up with
this brilliant idea?

420
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,890
When you make street food, you
have to fight against time.

421
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,120
It's perfect for an urgent
situation like this.

422
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,030
"Street"?

423
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,859
You don't need to know,
but it's like a war zone.

424
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:05,629
This survived a fierce battle.

425
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:11,370
Here.

426
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,640
Peel the potatoes.

427
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:15,939
Me?

428
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,910
Then who else?

429
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:22,979
I heard you need rice taffy?

430
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:27,149
I was told to check on the progress.

431
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:47,470
Peel it carefully.

432
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,839
Make it as thin as
possible. Thinner than that.

433
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,979
That's it.

434
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:55,109
The tip has to be
sharp. Make it sharper.

435
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,720
We're going to pierce
a potato with it.

436
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,680
Well done.

437
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,419
- The flame over here is too strong.
- Okay.

438
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:04,990
- Make this one stronger.
- Will do.

439
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:08,729
All right. I want you
all to keep this in mind.

440
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,459
What we're making today is
more than just ordinary food.

441
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,799
We're making the President's face.

442
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,549
I mean, think of it
as His Majesty's face.

443
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,760
Is this good enough, Your Highness?

444
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,930
I mean, Chef?

445
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,330
Let's see.

446
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,569
Good job.

447
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,910
I really hope Cheoljong understands
the idea behind all this.

448
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,359
So this is the humble
dish of the common people?

449
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,760
Am I the only one who did not know
what the people eat these days?

450
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,769
YONGSU POTATO

451
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,740
Although my intention may be noble,

452
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:36,049
I still must treat
my guests properly.

453
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,950
So I have used simple ingredients,

454
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:41,350
but I have come up with a new theme.

455
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:46,959
The first dish of the
banquet is a potato dish.

456
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,060
This is a potato?

457
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:53,129
It is not a simple potato dish.

458
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,970
The name of the dish is...

459
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,299
Spring...

460
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:01,769
like a coil?

461
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,040
Yongsu Potato!

462
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:07,580
All right.

463
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,819
It resembles the
whisker of a dragon.

464
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:11,249
It is called Yongsu Potato.

465
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,649
It is a lucky dish for a lucky day.

466
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,359
Nonetheless, it is
still a mere potato.

467
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:19,160
A dragon? That is a bit
of stretch, Your Majesty.

468
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,229
If we did not have potatoes,

469
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:23,459
we would have lost
more lives every day.

470
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,760
Rustic-looking potatoes...

471
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,399
can grow well even in a barren
land and are easy to store.

472
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,200
This becomes the main staple of
the people during the barley hump.

473
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:35,439
This is a sacred ingredient
that saves people's lives.

474
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,010
It is more than "a mere potato".

475
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:40,749
Please try it.

476
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,030
My gosh. This is very delicious.

477
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,269
But this is quite a new mouthfeel.

478
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,540
Right State Councilor,
you must be very hungry.

479
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:19,749
This is a potato?

480
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,229
There are three seasonings in
front of you. As for the green one,

481
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:37,640
this is the pine salt made of...

482
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:40,810
bay salt and pine needles
from Hwaseong Palace...

483
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,209
in the district of
the Namyang Hong clan.

484
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,879
This light red powder
is wild grape sugar.

485
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,549
Sugar? When the common people
do not even have barley?

486
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:52,379
If we can get through the barley
hump with this splendid dish,

487
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:54,419
I would have nothing to
worry about all year round.

488
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,160
This is powder taffy
which the people enjoy.

489
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,660
It is mixed with wild
grapes from Mount Gamak...

490
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
where the Papyeong Yoon
clan has put down roots.

491
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,729
It adds a beautiful color
and fragrance to sugar.

492
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:09,100
The yellow sauce is made of peaches.

493
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:11,700
This is made with
the best peaches...

494
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,169
from Yeoju where the
Yeoheung Min clan resides.

495
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,839
The theme of today's
banquet is harmony.

496
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,049
Politics divide people.

497
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:26,180
But delicious food
brings people together.

498
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,089
I hope you can taste the
harmony of the three clans...

499
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,290
who are here today with us.

500
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,470
I'll dice and stir-fry sweet
potatoes, zucchini, and eggplants.

501
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,370
And I'll make whole tomato
stew by puffing it up...

502
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,870
with broth and the eggs.

503
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,640
This novel idea...

504
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,209
of eating the vessel
would make them go crazy.

505
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,319
You're still not done yet?

506
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:00,120
Not even close.

507
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,689
I got the barley
powder and bean powder.

508
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:05,560
I got all sorts of powder I
can get and am kneading it.

509
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,260
The dish you're making now is
the highlight of the banquet.

510
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Okay.

511
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:16,470
What are you doing? Knead
it vigorously just like me.

512
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:20,769
This is not good for the joints
in our shoulders and wrists.

513
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,339
Come on. You ought to
give it more power. Do it.

514
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,040
Grind your shoulders and
wrists if you need to.

515
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,879
You ought to pound on it.

516
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,519
Chef, it is all ready.

517
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:34,519
Is that so?

518
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:37,890
Okay.

519
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,729
It's a banquet, after all.
It's no banquet without meat.

520
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,089
I will finish the main dish...

521
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:44,830
with vegan hamburger steaks.

522
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:07,120
MAC DUNALDU

523
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,720
This is an edible pouch.

524
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:10,490
This produce is red
throughout the year.

525
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,959
Hence the name, One-year persimmon.

526
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,890
The color of the produce, red,
chases away bad luck on Surit-nal.

527
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,640
How could this be so soft?

528
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:33,350
Is it a short rib patty?

529
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,450
That cannot be. The
meat never arrived...

530
00:42:39,149 --> 00:42:42,649
I meant to say that there are
no meats during the barley hump.

531
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:46,490
There is a proverb
from the Qing Empire.

532
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,229
"In the sky, there are
dragons for the meat."

533
00:42:48,229 --> 00:42:49,899
"On land, there are donkeys."

534
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,930
And we should add, "Beans
for meat in the barley hump".

535
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:58,640
"Mac" for barley. "Du" for bean.
"Nal" for fattening. "Du" for belly.

536
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:01,810
So that makes Mac Dunaldu.

537
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,939
Mac Dunaldu

538
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,140
MAC DUNALDU

539
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,149
Like real meat, it is
delicious and filling.

540
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,149
That makes sense.

541
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,850
How beautiful.

542
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,490
I will add my artistic touches
to the cooled down sweet jelly.

543
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,790
So it will please their eyes.

544
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,030
Desserts should be delicious
and beautiful to look at.

545
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,959
- Gosh.
- Gosh. Look at the color.

546
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,430
On top of that, give
it a wow factor.

547
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:03,700
The perfect finale of the party.

548
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:15,810
FORTUNE JELLY

549
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,249
This is beautiful.

550
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:19,850
But this is just regular jelly.

551
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:24,220
I guess you are out of your tricks.

552
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,930
This stick makes it easier
for you to eat the jelly.

553
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,129
And it also says your fortune.

554
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:32,629
Fortune?

555
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:34,629
This dish embraces spring,

556
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:37,839
so it is called the Fortune Jelly.

557
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,010
It shows my hope that your future
may be fortunate like spring.

558
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,720
How about having your fortune
read as we wrap up the banquet?

559
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,149
How could we do such a
thing at our sacred palace?

560
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:01,790
ONE MORE

561
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:04,299
One more.

562
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:05,359
"One more"?

563
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:09,129
"Try Again Next time."

564
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,939
DUD

565
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,228
My gosh. My back hurts.

566
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:28,038
I am about to pass out.

567
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:34,978
I poured my soul into this
instead of real ingredients.

568
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,248
Gosh, I am going to pass out.

569
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,078
We did it.

570
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:42,919
We did it.

571
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:47,788
Do you know what I'm
thinking about now?

572
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:52,259
I know. That is exactly how I feel.

573
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:56,129
- Fish cakes.
- Pardon?

574
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,328
I'm thinking about fish cakes.

575
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:03,098
The chef that almost died in the
hands of Emperor Qin Shi Huang...

576
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:05,268
created fish cakes the night before.

577
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:07,538
I thought that was
because he was lucky.

578
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:09,379
But that wasn't the case.

579
00:46:09,578 --> 00:46:10,609
I'm sure he came up with it...

580
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:12,649
after trying whatever he
could do to stay alive.

581
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:14,348
Inspiration...

582
00:46:14,348 --> 00:46:16,348
isn't something common
that would come...

583
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:17,888
to a person who has given up.

584
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:20,319
Your Highness.

585
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,419
Your Highness.

586
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:26,799
Goodness. You must be out of breath.

587
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:30,469
Here. Have some water. Drink up.

588
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:37,808
His last name is Han.

589
00:46:38,368 --> 00:46:40,509
Right? His last name
is really Han, right?

590
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,538
Yes.

591
00:46:42,308 --> 00:46:43,649
His name is Shim Ong.

592
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:45,279
His name is Han Shim Ong.

593
00:46:45,308 --> 00:46:47,819
Simon? Why does his
name sound so foreign?

594
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:52,888
Oh, Han Shim Ong.

595
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:54,388
Yes.

596
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:57,429
What is this, by the way?

597
00:46:57,429 --> 00:46:59,688
Goodness. It is
nothing, Your Highness.

598
00:47:01,328 --> 00:47:03,029
While I was outside of the Palace,

599
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,899
I went all the way to Hanseongbu,

600
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:07,169
and I took a look at
their family register.

601
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:12,239
I am sure that it is a fake
family register that was bought.

602
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,078
It is a method that is
fitting Mr. Han's ancestors.

603
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:19,109
Since we didn't include him
because he's a fake noble,

604
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,719
he chose such a dirty way
to win someone's favor?

605
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:24,089
Your Highness. This is not the
time to stand here like this.

606
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:26,049
You will be in trouble if
you are absent for too long.

607
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:27,188
Oh, you're right.

608
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,788
Good job, Court Lady Choi.

609
00:47:28,788 --> 00:47:30,828
- I'm going. Let's go.
- Your Highness.

610
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:32,489
- Your Highness. Hold on.
- Be careful.

611
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:33,529
Your Highness!

612
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,529
Oh, my. Your Highness.

613
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,029
Your Highness!

614
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:42,469
Why? What is wrong?

615
00:47:45,638 --> 00:47:47,239
My stomach...

616
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,549
There's a troop of traveling actors
doing pungmulnori in my stomach.

617
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:53,518
What is going on?

618
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:56,078
The water...

619
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:59,489
Did nobody remove that water?

620
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:01,859
What kind of water...

621
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:04,058
is that?

622
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:06,429
It is water with a
poisonous plant in it.

623
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:08,929
Poison?

624
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:11,498
Poison?

625
00:48:12,328 --> 00:48:13,328
Court Lady Choi!

626
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:16,938
I see that you are here.

627
00:48:18,038 --> 00:48:19,408
Of course, I should be here.

628
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:24,109
It is a banquet to congratulate
the Queen's recovery.

629
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:26,248
Keep an eye on
everything from now on.

630
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,819
Watch what kind of results
your actions will bring.

631
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:44,029
Goodness.

632
00:48:45,098 --> 00:48:48,138
Making a meal is no easy task.

633
00:48:49,538 --> 00:48:52,339
There is not a single part of
my body that is not in pain.

634
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:57,679
Furthermore, that Royal
Chef kept yelling at me.

635
00:48:58,578 --> 00:49:01,478
- That rotten...
- Look here!

636
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:06,449
Do you still have potatoes
that need to be peeled?

637
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:09,018
Please save Court Lady Choi.

638
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,188
Please.

639
00:49:22,598 --> 00:49:23,839
Keep up the good work.

640
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:30,408
I am sorry.

641
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:41,989
He was wearing a goblin mask,

642
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:44,888
and he had an old
scar around his chin.

643
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,029
Excuse me.

644
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:02,239
Oh, my.

645
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:04,509
I apologize.

646
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:29,739
Look here. She is in a lot of pain.

647
00:50:30,138 --> 00:50:32,708
Do some acupuncture and burn
some moxa. Do something.

648
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:34,739
Give her some antitoxins too.

649
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:37,308
Goodness. Stay out of it.

650
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:39,279
I am the captain of this place.

651
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:49,319
This will do.

652
00:50:49,558 --> 00:50:51,489
You were terrible in
the Royal Kitchen,

653
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:53,429
but you are great in
the Royal Infirmary.

654
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,728
Whether it is a person or an object,

655
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:58,998
everything has a
place it belongs to.

656
00:51:00,868 --> 00:51:03,339
But your needles work
better in the Royal Kitchen.

657
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,339
No, it is not!

658
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,538
This needle is perfect
for piercing potatoes.

659
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:07,638
Let me take this to use.

660
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:09,208
How dare you touch it. No.

661
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,978
This would be perfect
for peeling potatoes.

662
00:51:10,978 --> 00:51:13,549
- Let me take this to use.
- No.

663
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:15,279
You cannot do that, Your Highness!

664
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:27,759
The pungmulnori in my
stomach has stopped.

665
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:31,169
I should not be here right now.

666
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,268
- Your Highness.
- Court Lady Choi!

667
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:37,708
There is no way she could
recover that quickly.

668
00:51:41,638 --> 00:51:43,609
She is a strong woman.

669
00:51:55,118 --> 00:51:56,319
She smells like oil.

670
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,489
Why were you absent for so long?

671
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:01,129
Well, the thing is...

672
00:52:01,158 --> 00:52:02,299
I apologize.

673
00:52:03,129 --> 00:52:05,069
My hand slipped,

674
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:07,498
and I shot an arrow at the Queen.

675
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:12,509
Did you get hurt?

676
00:52:12,768 --> 00:52:14,679
No, I am fine.

677
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:17,009
The hunting game was so tiring...

678
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,679
that I fell asleep while
I was getting ready.

679
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:20,919
Darn it.

680
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:37,368
An apron?

681
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:48,938
When will your preparations unfold?

682
00:52:49,038 --> 00:52:50,509
Please wait.

683
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:53,379
The King put so much
effort into this banquet.

684
00:52:53,848 --> 00:52:56,848
The King must stand out for now.

685
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:23,009
To everyone who came here and
set an example as a scholar...

686
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,149
by not eating a lot...

687
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:27,649
to show that you understand
the hunger of the people,

688
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:30,848
I will take this opportunity
to make an announcement.

689
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:35,158
With the start of this banquet,

690
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:37,228
we will start reducing
the dishes in our meals.

691
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:38,788
SETTING AN EXAMPLE TO THE PEOPLE
BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DISHES

692
00:53:38,788 --> 00:53:40,058
Reducing the dishes?

693
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,029
What kind of nonsense
is he speaking of?

694
00:53:43,129 --> 00:53:46,199
When the nation is in
trouble, the king should...

695
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,839
reduce the number of
dishes in his meals...

696
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:50,808
to share the pain of his people.

697
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:55,438
By reducing the number of dishes,
we feel the pain of the nation...

698
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:57,578
so that we can overcome it together.

699
00:53:58,379 --> 00:54:02,078
At a time like this, taking the
grain to save dozens of people...

700
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:04,888
to make a piece of meat
to please our tongues...

701
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:06,518
is a sin.

702
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:10,158
As a result, if anyone
in this Palace...

703
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:13,589
puts a piece of meat on their
tables, they will be punished.

704
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:19,768
I not only forbid meat, but I forbid
you from eating generous meals.

705
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:23,538
Ministers cannot enjoy
drinking, singing, and dancing,

706
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,839
and they must stop
having factional strife.

707
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:28,279
If you violate these terms,

708
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:32,149
I will take it as you are
willing to accept the punishment.

709
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:35,618
Your Majesty.

710
00:54:49,098 --> 00:54:51,299
I, Kim Jwa Geun, apologize...

711
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:54,038
as I have an unfortunate
piece of news.

712
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:28,498
These are criminals who
lied about their status...

713
00:55:28,498 --> 00:55:30,268
and hid in the Royal Guard Division.

714
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,339
In order to guard you by your side,

715
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:35,138
they created a fake identity.

716
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:40,348
It is time to go after the
people who think they are hidden.

717
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:42,478
I am sure he believes that they
are the basis of his power...

718
00:55:42,478 --> 00:55:44,348
that he took good
care of and protected.

719
00:55:44,788 --> 00:55:47,359
We have to pull it out from its
roots and tear it into pieces.

720
00:55:49,288 --> 00:55:51,259
So that he will not be
able to stand again.

721
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,288
Must you ruin this
meaningful day like this?

722
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:20,018
Do you know who they really are?

723
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,589
Some of them are from families
that are guilty of treason.

724
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,188
Some of them were bandits that
targeted scholar-officials,

725
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:28,699
and some are wanted criminals who
openly criticized the monarchy.

726
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:31,929
All of them disapprove
of the royal court,

727
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:33,469
but they have been...

728
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:35,938
guarding Your Majesty in disguise.

729
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:38,169
Their ultimate goal
was to plot a coup.

730
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:40,469
Due to the urgency of this
matter, I had no choice...

731
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:42,408
but to bring it to Your
Majesty's attention immediately.

732
00:56:47,248 --> 00:56:48,319
No, that cannot be.

733
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,518
Someone is falsely
accusing my royal guards...

734
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:55,158
to weaken security and harm me.

735
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:56,888
By "someone",

736
00:56:58,328 --> 00:57:00,658
who exactly are you referring to?

737
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:04,569
You, Training
Commander Kim Jwa Geun.

738
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:12,368
Are you doing this...

739
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:15,708
because you think those
three families got your back?

740
00:57:16,638 --> 00:57:18,949
Do you think such
sugar-coated words...

741
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:21,179
are enough to persuade
them to side with you?

742
00:57:22,848 --> 00:57:24,348
You are foolish.

743
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:27,089
It is time for you to wake
up and see your reality.

744
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,239
How brazen!

745
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,379
How dare you insult
the King like this?

746
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:53,348
This is an act of
disloyalty and treason!

747
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,748
This is very unlike you,
Your Majesty. Calm down!

748
00:57:55,748 --> 00:57:58,118
How dare you give me
orders when I am the King?

749
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:12,629
Your Majesty, it seems like there
is something you are counting on.

750
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,199
Whatever it is, you will
not be able to use it...

751
00:58:15,969 --> 00:58:18,169
if your limbs are cut off.

752
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:23,038
Pay the price for
your own recklessness.

753
00:58:28,879 --> 00:58:31,589
All of you shall be
beheaded for your crimes.

754
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,458
Your Majesty, we will
follow the military laws.

755
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:41,498
They are guilty of
treason, which means...

756
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:43,399
this is out of the Royal
Guard Division's hands.

757
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:45,328
The Department of Justice
will handle this matter!

758
00:58:50,868 --> 00:58:51,868
Your Majesty.

759
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,839
The Royal Guard Division
will take care of this!

760
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,208
- No, Your Majesty!
- No, Your Majesty!

761
00:58:57,649 --> 00:59:01,348
The royal guard commander
knew who they really were!

762
00:59:01,478 --> 00:59:04,518
It is possible that everyone
in the division is a traitor.

763
00:59:04,518 --> 00:59:06,819
We cannot let the Royal Guard
Division handle the corruption...

764
00:59:06,819 --> 00:59:07,919
that took place within it!

765
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,759
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty!
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

766
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:13,188
Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

767
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:26,569
We can disband the
entire division...

768
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:29,339
and prosecute the royal
guard commander as well.

769
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:30,379
However,

770
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:34,879
if you leave these
criminals' punishment to me,

771
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:39,449
I will take it as your promise
to do nothing from now on...

772
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,658
and stop there.

773
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:07,679
Nothing I do...

774
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:11,118
will make any difference.

775
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,089
What would you like
to do, Your Majesty?

776
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:29,739
Fine.

777
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,138
I will leave the matter...

778
01:00:40,308 --> 01:00:41,449
in your hands.

779
01:03:03,688 --> 01:03:06,288
"The Lord of the Land..."

780
01:03:07,429 --> 01:03:10,658
"and the Lord of
Grains, I pray to you."

781
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:14,268
"May your blessings..."

782
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:18,739
"turn the seeds in the
ground into ripe fruits."

783
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:23,109
"May the mercy of the skies..."

784
01:03:27,348 --> 01:03:29,649
"help the people of this land so
they will never have to starve."

785
01:03:38,828 --> 01:03:39,859
Please...

786
01:04:31,149 --> 01:04:33,078
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

787
01:04:49,058 --> 01:04:53,129
MR. QUEEN

788
01:05:08,919 --> 01:05:11,489
<i>The explosion damaged his hearing.</i>

789
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:12,549
<i>Oh, no.</i>

790
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:15,158
<i>- There will be no problems, right?
- Yes, of course.</i>

791
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,589
<i>No one is behind it?</i>

792
01:05:16,589 --> 01:05:18,629
<i>I've decided to survive,</i>

793
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:19,828
<i>so don't die.</i>

794
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:21,328
<i>Recover as if nothing
ever happened...</i>

795
01:05:21,328 --> 01:05:22,598
<i>so I can stab you in the back.</i>

796
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:25,228
<i>The enemy inside is always scarier.</i>

797
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:27,268
<i>Your Highness! His Majesty is...</i>

798
01:05:27,938 --> 01:05:29,399
<i>His Majesty is...</i>

799
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:32,708
<i>I request that you end this regency.</i>

800
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,768
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

801
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:36,879
<i>Everyone in this palace
killed Kim So Yong.</i>
