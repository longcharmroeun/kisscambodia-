1
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:08,505
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,616
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,585
Why were you standing there?

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:17,816
That way!

5
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,896
Forget "no touching" today.

6
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:35,136
Your Highness.

7
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,375
Are you all right?

8
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,956
Who is that?

9
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:13,676
Let us go. Go out.

10
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:17,915
EPISODE 9

11
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:47,245
I let them sleep in separate rooms
so they can rest comfortably,

12
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,576
but I guess I made a mistake.

13
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,646
I heard something
break in the house.

14
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,445
I woke up to that sound as well.

15
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,656
The door was ripped too.

16
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,255
It is suspicious, so
we must take a look.

17
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:05,296
However, we may end
up interrupting them.

18
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,565
It would not be strange if all of
our household goods ended up broken.

19
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:17,875
That is the passion
of newlyweds.

20
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:22,076
We should protect their privacy.

21
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,245
Keep your distance from the
house as you stand guard.

22
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:28,745
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:34,256
I should go to the annex.

24
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,986
Will you keep watch over them?

25
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:39,426
- Yes.
- Take good care of them.

26
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,805
Control yourself, woman.

27
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:32,076
You had to cause this
trouble, didn't you?

28
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,215
Do you want to fight with me?

29
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,226
Who on earth are
you fighting with?

30
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,226
Stay out of it.

31
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:46,256
This is between
Kim So Yong and me.

32
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,796
As long as I'm in here,

33
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,666
I'll move this body as I please.

34
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,136
The soul inside supposed to
be the owner of the body!

35
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,706
You must be still drunk.

36
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,076
You are unable to distinguish
between a dream and reality.

37
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,715
- Thank goodness.
- What are you talking about?

38
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:09,486
Even when I'm drunk, I
always find my way home...

39
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:30,335
No. This isn't a dream.

40
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:34,045
There's no way you would
show up in my dreams.

41
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,715
I am sorry that I appeared...

42
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,386
in your dreams.

43
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,475
Forget about your nightmare.

44
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,670
EPISODE 9, LIGHT AND DARKNESS

45
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,396
That tickles, Hong Yeon.

46
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,095
It is not here. If this is
not the place, where is it?

47
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,266
What is wrong?

48
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,905
He was not flustered
because of the past.

49
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,496
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

50
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,035
I was told we should not
go near the main house.

51
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:27,866
- Why?
- I do not know.

52
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,366
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

53
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:35,006
Honestly, I am worried
about our Queen.

54
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,146
Did you hear anything?

55
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,246
About the Queen.

56
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:39,275
I heard that she runs
around all over the place...

57
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,346
when she wakes up
in the morning.

58
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,586
My gosh. Stop talking nonsense.

59
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,955
I saw her all her life, and
I have never seen her run.

60
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:48,785
- My gosh.
- It is true.

61
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,096
- My gosh. That is strange.
- No, that is what I heard.

62
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:54,825
- No.
- I do not believe you.

63
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:55,925
It is not.

64
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,035
- Oh, my. The chicken!
- Grab it.

65
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:04,876
Stop right there!

66
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,886
He was wearing the robe of
the Department of Justice.

67
00:10:23,886 --> 00:10:25,025
That means...

68
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,775
You will end up
dead. Stop drinking.

69
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,846
I am thirsty.

70
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:47,675
The more I think it is
wrong, the more I want it.

71
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,815
I feel like I will
die of thirst.

72
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:56,425
If you are thirsty, you must
drink water, not liquor.

73
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,195
Over here. Bring us some water.

74
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:04,795
Yes, sir.

75
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:12,075
The more liquor you drink,
the thirstier you get.

76
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,496
I slept so well as if
I got hit and fainted.

77
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,065
I know.

78
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,636
My body feels so light.

79
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,636
You. You.

80
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:51,415
The land this house is on
must be good. I slept so well.

81
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,915
Is it natural for you
to wake up next to me?

82
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,815
Why would this be unnatural?

83
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,525
Unlike in the palace, we do not
need to pick a date to share a room,

84
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,925
so it is more natural to sleep
in the same room at your home.

85
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,496
It makes sense.

86
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,396
He's in enemy territory, so he needs
to sleep next to me as a cover.

87
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,535
Your acting is so good today.

88
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:17,876
Okay. Let's pretend we
had a hot night together.

89
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,775
It was such a hot night
that it's a complete mess...

90
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,146
in here.

91
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:30,045
I guess you remember
it this time.

92
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,915
I would have been sad if
you had not remembered it...

93
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,516
like our first night together.

94
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,285
Is this a side effect of
her memory coming back?

95
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,096
I'm like a calm
baby when I sleep.

96
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,606
I don't have time to waste here.

97
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,945
I need to become an irreplaceable
person to Sunwon soon.

98
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:02,646
So that even if a catastrophe
occurs in the Han family,

99
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:04,185
they will never find me.

100
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:09,086
The man in the mask and
I had the same target.

101
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,055
How much does Kim
Byeong In know?

102
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:15,596
The ledger must not
go into their hands.

103
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:21,866
I will return to the Palace
today no matter what.

104
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:26,305
I will get the ledger
today no matter what.

105
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:38,216
You will get sick like this.

106
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,386
When is the Queen
returning to the Palace?

107
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:45,596
I will send a letter so she
could return with King quickly.

108
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,065
I have never found life in
the Palace to be boring,

109
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:52,236
but with the Queen gone for a
couple of days, it feels so empty.

110
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:56,435
Is the Queen's food
that exceptional?

111
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,876
It is not about her cooking.
I have grown to like her.

112
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,506
Affection can be
quite a scary thing.

113
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,246
I was hungry this morning...

114
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,685
I mean,

115
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:12,716
I missed the Queen dearly
which made me wake up.

116
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,415
Gosh, you have my
sympathy, Your Highness.

117
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:17,126
This is why being tamed
can be a scary thing.

118
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,525
I am under the impression
that I am using others,

119
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:27,096
but at one point, it was
me who had been tamed.

120
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:31,236
That is why you must find other
people who can be of use to you.

121
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:35,846
I will instruct the royal chefs
to learn the Queen's recipes.

122
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:40,346
You have made my life at
the palace very comfortable.

123
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,945
I have no reasons
to leave the palace.

124
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,886
This is why I hold
my current position.

125
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,756
It is to keep the perfect
world you have, Your Highness.

126
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,695
Oh, right.

127
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,766
Tell Byeong In to come and
see me from time to time.

128
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,065
Do you...

129
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,035
need to speak to him?

130
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:06,236
He is your adopted son. I
had been too indifferent.

131
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,545
I can give him some
errands from time to time.

132
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,716
You are getting old now.

133
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,785
You must focus only
on important matters.

134
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:18,016
Everything that concerns
you is important to me.

135
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:57,856
What are you doing?

136
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,866
Starting now, the
Department of Justice...

137
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:07,336
will check the identities
of the royal guards.

138
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:11,065
As royal guards serve to
protect the King by his side,

139
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:14,846
we must be thorough to
check their identities.

140
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,915
Do not allow them to
take a step forward.

141
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,155
All of the royal guards
have been verified...

142
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:33,925
through proper channels.

143
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,636
People can easily buy and sell
genealogy charts nowadays.

144
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:42,305
Who knows?

145
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,535
Some guards might
have entered...

146
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:46,336
the palace to plot treason
with fake identities.

147
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,246
Cooperate with us, so we
can fulfill our duties.

148
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:57,016
If you cannot find any
evidence of your claim,

149
00:16:58,486 --> 00:16:59,616
I will...

150
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,055
use my authority to
the fullest extent.

151
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,826
That is if you can continue
to hold your position.

152
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:10,026
Unless you are involved
in the scheme, step aside.

153
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,776
- Search everywhere.
- Yes, my lord.

154
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,886
Search every corner.

155
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,925
Do not leave any document.

156
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,655
Bring all of them to the
Department of Justice.

157
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:41,995
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

158
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,376
I hope you had a peaceful night.

159
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:03,116
I have brought in
a beautiful bird.

160
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,215
What do you think?

161
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:06,985
The bird has beautiful feathers.

162
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:10,886
I have brought this precious
bird in to celebrate an occasion.

163
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,396
Do you have good news?

164
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,866
The ill-fated relationship
between the Queen...

165
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,306
and the Royal Noble Consort Eui
is stronger than I had thought.

166
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,836
There is something
I have not told you.

167
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,806
In fact, I have not told anyone.

168
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,705
It is a secret that only
the Queen and I know.

169
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:38,215
The Queen believes I have stolen
the King from her because of...

170
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,415
what happened eight years ago.

171
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,296
The poison on our arrow
is growing stronger.

172
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:50,026
It is time for us to
use our second item.

173
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,096
Yes.

174
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,905
It is difficult to
find something similar,

175
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:57,665
so it is taking me some time.

176
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:02,175
But I will bring it to you even
if I have to make it myself.

177
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:16,826
Use this.

178
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:36,245
They will find out about
our royal guards in no time.

179
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,205
Let us find a way.

180
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,576
A man from the Department of
Justice ran into you last night.

181
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,715
He saw your face. Will
that be a problem?

182
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:45,386
I do not think he recognized me.

183
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,526
If we run into each other again,

184
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:51,896
he will realize I was
going after the ledger.

185
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:59,965
But he was wearing a unique
mask. It looked like a goblin.

186
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,566
Did he have a scar on his chin?

187
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:07,705
Yes. It seemed like an old scar.

188
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,975
He is the one who
tortured O Wol.

189
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,876
So this confirms
that Kim Jwa Geun...

190
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:15,985
had made his move
through Kim Byeong In.

191
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,356
Fortunately,

192
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,886
he does not know that the location
of the ledger has changed.

193
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:25,695
Tonight is the last
chance we have.

194
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,995
Your Majesty, I have a
letter from the palace.

195
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:36,705
This is the letter from
Training Commander Kim Jwa Geun.

196
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,276
The head of the Department of
Justice has come to deliver it.

197
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:43,606
Any member of the
Department of Justice...

198
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:44,975
could have easily
brought it to me.

199
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:46,376
But you brought it instead?

200
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:48,846
Do you have that much
time on your hands?

201
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,685
I have brought it personally
as it is very important.

202
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:56,485
Your Majesty and the Queen are asked
to return to the palace right now.

203
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,955
The Training Commander...

204
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:02,096
is demanding me to
return to the palace?

205
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:05,536
He is relaying the message
from the Grand Queen Dowager.

206
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:09,435
I will stay here one more
night for the Queen's health.

207
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,735
- Tell him that.
- But...

208
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:11,975
I am done here.

209
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,646
Do not disturb the
Queen's rest and go back.

210
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:21,175
Gosh.

211
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:28,685
His Majesty seems very concerned
about the Queen's health.

212
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,626
I will relay that to him.

213
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:41,536
I will have breakfast with
the Queen in her room.

214
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:44,205
Bring us your usual breakfast.
Please make it light.

215
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,376
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,106
We will serve you
our usual breakfast.

217
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:53,945
As Royal Noble Consort
Eui's house is nearby,

218
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,915
I will ask about
O Wol and return.

219
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,215
That is a great idea.

220
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,316
I felt bad for turning
her away yesterday.

221
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,725
I will not be at the
palace for one more night.

222
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:04,655
Please look after her.

223
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:06,296
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:18,005
The Queen used to stay here all
day. But now that the Queen is gone,

225
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,876
the royal kitchen
feels so empty.

226
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:29,215
Now, I can breathe again.

227
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:36,286
Hey, you punk. Add
more canola oil.

228
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,556
You punk.

229
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:39,425
You must chop it more finely.

230
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,495
You must cook it quickly
not to mess up the shape.

231
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:54,876
Things here are surely
pleasant and peaceful.

232
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:57,546
I do love being the boss.

233
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:11,356
- Royal Chef!
- Royal Chef!

234
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,096
- Royal Chef!
- Royal Chef!

235
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,396
- Stop it.
- Royal Chef.

236
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,465
- Royal Chef.
- Royal Chef.

237
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,796
- Go back in.
- Yes, my lord.

238
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,405
Excuse me, Court Lady Choi.

239
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:27,576
Court Lady Choi.

240
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:31,306
By the look on your face,

241
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:35,616
I take it that the Queen
has not recovered yet.

242
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:39,755
No. She has made
a full recovery.

243
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,985
Then, why the long face?

244
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:50,826
Lately, Her Highness has
put me through a lot.

245
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,235
So when she is not around,

246
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,705
I thought I would
not have to nag...

247
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:59,136
and I would feel at ease.

248
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,005
And?

249
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:04,046
I think I am getting
even crazier.

250
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:09,445
I am worried to death about how
unruly she would be without me.

251
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,255
Oh, my. They say you care more
about a troublesome child...

252
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:15,356
rather than a good child.

253
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,685
Stop frowning.

254
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,026
Here.

255
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:29,905
Open it.

256
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,076
I picked it up off the
ground on the way here.

257
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:43,745
These days,

258
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:47,215
you seem like mine but not.

259
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:50,386
These days,

260
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,596
you seem like mine but not.

261
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,796
These days, you seem
like mine but not.

262
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,126
Why did he give me the trash
he picked up on the way here?

263
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,896
My goodness.

264
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,836
The more I get to know
him, the weirder he gets.

265
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:06,705
He could just throw it away.
Why would he give it to me?

266
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:08,646
Oh, my.

267
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:13,038
Have you heard from O Wol?

268
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:14,708
Oh, no.

269
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:16,978
Did something bad happen to her?

270
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,778
She did not arrive at the house.

271
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:25,647
I think she went somewhere else
as she feels sorry for you.

272
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:28,718
I have been asking around about
her. Do not worry too much.

273
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,617
I told her about it over
and over but she still...

274
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:34,127
I am looking for the
norigae you handed to her.

275
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:38,728
If she had to go to the other
place, she would have sold it.

276
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:41,298
I am scared...

277
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:43,837
if I lose all my people.

278
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:49,078
When is His Majesty
coming back to the palace?

279
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:50,607
He is going to stay...

280
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:52,778
one more night.

281
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,417
It is not what you are thinking.

282
00:25:58,018 --> 00:25:59,947
I cannot tell you the detail,

283
00:25:59,947 --> 00:26:03,058
but it will be over tonight.

284
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,887
It is probably not
that the King...

285
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,528
does not have time to
care about other things,

286
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:12,667
but his feelings
for me have changed.

287
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:18,597
Probably it is only me who is
hanging onto the childhood memories.

288
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:21,107
I remember when I came
back to Hanyang...

289
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:24,937
and met you with His
Majesty two years ago.

290
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:28,078
Even if that day was the
first time he saw you,

291
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:31,248
he definitely...

292
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,947
would have loved you.

293
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,228
Your words encourage me.

294
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:52,038
So this is the usual breakfast.

295
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,708
I'm the one who needs to convalesce.
Why would you stay one more night?

296
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:58,907
I am staying to take
care of you, My Queen.

297
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,008
You receive treatment from doctors
and get medication from pharmacists.

298
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,548
The King has to take care
of politics, not my health.

299
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:06,847
Do you know how much the
citizens are suffering?

300
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:10,587
What you said is
right, My Queen.

301
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,587
Yes, eat the terrapin
soup quickly...

302
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:13,958
and go act like a king.

303
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,627
Don't waste the sacrifice
of the terrapin.

304
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:20,068
Rather than the sacrifice
of the terrapin, I will...

305
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:23,538
go out in disguise to see what the
people are going through today.

306
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,607
I will come back at a late hour,

307
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,137
which means I have to
stay one more night again.

308
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:34,147
You don't want to be at
the palace too, right?

309
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:37,218
How awful if it's even worse
than your in-laws' house.

310
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:42,958
Yes. It is nice and
comfortable here.

311
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:47,387
What kind of person is
Grand Queen Dowager?

312
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:49,857
She is the older sister
of Lord Kim Jwa Geun.

313
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:53,427
She did not once stop out of the
palace after she entered the palace.

314
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:55,298
If I present specialties
from outside the palace...

315
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,998
to Sunwon who never went
outside the palace...

316
00:27:57,998 --> 00:27:59,068
You know...

317
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,377
They always eat gukbap
in period dramas.

318
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:03,508
What does it taste like?

319
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:06,907
How would I know the taste
of such a lowly food?

320
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:21,927
It is not that great.

321
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:27,498
It's scary how much you can
miss something from the past.

322
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,137
They made broth with beef
brisket and white radish,

323
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:38,137
seasoned it with doenjang and warmed
the rice up by pouring the broth.

324
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,647
It has a lot of meat too. It's
humble but has its own charm.

325
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:44,478
Jeotgal isn't used for the radish
kimchi that accompanies the gukbap,

326
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,318
so it goes well without
overpowering the taste.

327
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,748
They said Heonjong had gukbap every
time he went outside the palace.

328
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:53,988
Darn it.

329
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:57,498
I have to pay taxes for my neighbor
who ran away without paying them.

330
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,367
They are basically thieves.

331
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,828
Watch your tongue.

332
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,867
Do want to be beaten to death?

333
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,137
It is either I die
from biting my tongue,

334
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:07,907
or I run away and join bandits.

335
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:11,177
Watch my tongue? I
have nothing to lose!

336
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,947
They are taking everything. I
wonder what the King is doing.

337
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:17,117
What do you expect?

338
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:19,187
Of course, he is one of those
who are taking everything.

339
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:21,447
He is a puppet king who was given
the throne to turn a blind eye...

340
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:24,058
to these things and approve
anything they ask him to do.

341
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:25,488
Darn it.

342
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,298
Hey, hey.

343
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,697
I was listening behind you.

344
00:29:35,998 --> 00:29:38,498
I see you have been
going through a lot!

345
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:43,907
The people are dying because
of such a foolish king.

346
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:47,447
Take this drink and
forget your worries.

347
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:50,748
From what I see,

348
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,117
you look like a
person of position.

349
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:57,357
I am a fake aristocrat.

350
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:00,187
The genealogical
was so expensive.

351
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:03,427
I am basically a beggar without this
garment and the genealogical record.

352
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,968
I heard some young people are
all looks but no substance...

353
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:10,298
these days and you
are one of them.

354
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,397
How dare you!

355
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:13,937
The country itself is all
looks but no substance.

356
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,877
If people have substances,
it will only be taken away.

357
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:19,847
That is funny.

358
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,617
Oh, my. This fake nobleman...

359
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:25,617
- has an interesting point of view.
- It is funny.

360
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,687
They made a man from the
traitor family a king.

361
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:30,917
It is not only empty
but also rotten!

362
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,927
Does it make sense that a
person from the family...

363
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:36,058
that committed treason throughout
generations from his grandfather,

364
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:38,157
father, and brother
became the King?

365
00:30:38,157 --> 00:30:41,468
And what was the King thinking
when he accepted the throne?

366
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:43,937
He is living at the
mercy of the Kims...

367
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,867
who killed all his family
like a gutless loser!

368
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:48,008
I know.

369
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,637
- Darn it.
- It is true.

370
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:52,677
You've crossed the line.

371
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:57,117
You're free to curse at him,

372
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:02,718
but it's not nice to
talk about his family!

373
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:05,117
There's a line you shouldn't
cross even for malicious comments!

374
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:07,058
Moreover,

375
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,127
do you think being a king is all
about living a comfortable life?

376
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:11,097
Being on the throne, he's living
in danger of getting poisoned...

377
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:12,498
and getting his head chopped
off all the time. It's brutal!

378
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:14,867
Are you from the palace?

379
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,568
Are you a spokesperson
of the King or what?

380
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:19,068
Who on earth are you?

381
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:21,538
Me? I am...

382
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:26,947
I am a member of
the King's fan club.

383
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:29,018
- What?
- What is that?

384
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,078
"Fan club"?

385
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:34,048
Anti-fans are fans too.

386
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:37,988
Anyway, talk about his
family one more time.

387
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:40,788
I will just flip the table!

388
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:44,458
- Got it?
- Okay, okay.

389
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,097
Do not come near me!

390
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:47,228
I am sorry.

391
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,897
The bill, please!

392
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:50,298
Come here.

393
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:52,937
Oh, my.

394
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:55,137
Look at your temper.

395
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:56,708
Let go of me. Let go.

396
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:58,877
I really didn't get upset.

397
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,748
You said you're in disguise.

398
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:04,048
Your identity can't be revealed.

399
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,318
So I got angry for you.

400
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:12,988
Why? What?

401
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,927
You're a flipping
amazing actress.

402
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:19,068
Do you even know
what that means?

403
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:21,228
Is it not something good?

404
00:32:22,268 --> 00:32:24,597
What does "fan club"
mean by the way?

405
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:28,367
I can say they're
honorable people

406
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,677
who wish for
someone's happiness...

407
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:32,008
and success with pure hearts.

408
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:34,847
So it is like a spirit guide.

409
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:38,147
How about "anti-fans"?

410
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:40,847
Well...

411
00:32:41,718 --> 00:32:45,218
Those who are even more interested
in that person than the fan club?

412
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,097
Even more powerful spirit guide.

413
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:53,867
I do not deserve such
feelings you have in me.

414
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:58,337
Whatever. If I get dethroned,

415
00:32:58,337 --> 00:32:59,907
I'll sell gukbap
and make a living.

416
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,837
Do not say such a thing.

417
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:04,538
I will not let that happen.

418
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,447
I am also your anti-fan.

419
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:10,378
Sure. That surely reassures me.

420
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:13,617
We should go our
separate ways now.

421
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,117
You and I have different goals.

422
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:19,828
Let's see if there's a good
restaurant people line up for.

423
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:25,228
"An" must mean
"comfortable". "Ti"...

424
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,427
"Fan"?

425
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:31,297
I thought I had devoted
myself to my studies.

426
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:33,467
I have a long way to go.

427
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:39,507
- Try our sample.
- My goodness.

428
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,047
- There is a lot.
- Oh, my.

429
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:43,078
- You should buy some, my lady.
- Try it.

430
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,748
- I want it.
- Gosh. What are you doing?

431
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:47,547
That looks good.

432
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,838
You startled me.
What are you doing?

433
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,177
If you go into sketchy alleys,
dressed in expensive clothes,

434
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,608
you will easily become a target.

435
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,478
- What target?
- My goodness.

436
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:16,418
May I ask what you rich
people are doing here?

437
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:19,188
This is what I am talking about.

438
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:22,018
Step aside. I do not
want to hurt you.

439
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:24,688
Do you like her?

440
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,427
Gosh, there is no point.

441
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:29,358
And quit dreaming...

442
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,657
that I am the only one here.

443
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:34,228
This is what I always felt.

444
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:37,768
As you are an educated bandit,
your expressions are classy.

445
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,168
- Be classy.
- Yes.

446
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:43,038
Do not worry. I
will protect you.

447
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,478
I am your anti-fan.

448
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:50,617
What is he saying?

449
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,288
That scared me.

450
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,027
Regardless of the
era and where I am,

451
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:04,657
I should always stay
away from shady places.

452
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:07,927
Take care of them
for me, Cheoljong.

453
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:15,308
But if something happens to him,

454
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,478
will history change?

455
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:23,918
Hey! I was in the
Special Forces!

456
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:27,648
He already lost?

457
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:31,657
Cheoljong.

458
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:33,757
Are you dead?

459
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:37,898
I don't know how to get home.

460
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:40,427
My gosh. What brings
a rich lady...

461
00:35:41,228 --> 00:35:43,838
I thought you came back because
you were worried about me.

462
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:46,637
Did you come back here because
you cannot find your back home?

463
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:48,637
What happened to those thugs?

464
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:52,137
They ran after a guy who was
wearing a more expensive robe.

465
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:56,547
Do not worry. I
will protect you.

466
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,117
I am your anti-fan.

467
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:04,588
What is he saying?

468
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:08,328
The era we live in
is not peaceful...

469
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:10,927
that you cannot
show us your back.

470
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:13,067
You must recognize a
crisis when you are in one.

471
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:15,297
My gosh. That was like a poem.

472
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:18,197
Hey. Is that from
the Qing Empire?

473
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,538
It looks nice. If we sell it, we
can feed ourselves for five days.

474
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:21,608
Take it off.

475
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:31,018
You should never show your back.

476
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,317
I did not kill him.

477
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:41,387
But I plan to kill the
next guy that comes at me.

478
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:54,208
By the way, why is
he on the ground?

479
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:56,137
He is drunk.

480
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,978
Anyway, you got so lucky.

481
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:08,288
What's up with your clothes?

482
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:12,117
Come to think of it, I will not
be able to go around unnoticed...

483
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,958
in a nobleman's robe.

484
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:20,027
What are you doing?

485
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:22,027
I need to buy some things.

486
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:24,038
I left in a hurry, so
I couldn't bring money.

487
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,367
- Okay.
- You are robbing a robber.

488
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:29,677
Hey. No.

489
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:33,547
Let me see. It is not fair
to take the whole thing.

490
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:39,418
Have a bowl of gukbap.

491
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:44,088
Here.

492
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:47,788
- Let's go.
- What do you need to buy?

493
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:54,927
Go on.

494
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:59,268
He knew how to fight.

495
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:01,668
Seeing how he was
guarding the room,

496
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:04,177
I am sure the item exists.

497
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:06,808
Will you be able to recognize
him if you were to see him again?

498
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:09,777
Of course. My lord,

499
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:13,088
I need the medicine.

500
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,628
I made myself very clear.

501
00:38:21,157 --> 00:38:23,427
I said if you failed, I will
not give you the medicine.

502
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:25,358
How will you pay me back?

503
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:28,067
Will you give me your hand?

504
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,067
I will repay you.

505
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:33,038
I swear it on my life.

506
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,487
All right. Guess what this is.

507
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:50,487
This is the moon jar
from the Goryeo Dynasty.

508
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:53,387
Really? This is so valuable.

509
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:55,688
- How much is it?
- It is fake.

510
00:38:56,828 --> 00:38:59,157
Buy it if you want to use
it as a protection again.

511
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:02,228
How dare you con me?

512
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,108
Pick one.

513
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,547
I'm all-in.

514
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:20,788
My gosh. My lady, you cannot
gamble that much money.

515
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:22,817
This is a capitalistic
society where money wins.

516
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:24,558
- I'm all-in.
- I am sorry.

517
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:26,018
- Hey, what are you doing?
- My lady.

518
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,128
My lady.

519
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:28,757
- Open it.
- Open it.

520
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:33,967
A trickster like him must have
his gang around the table.

521
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:38,067
I am sure all the spectators
are there to encourage gambling.

522
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:41,737
You were born a king.

523
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:44,507
And yet, you seem to know
the streets inside out.

524
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:47,677
Goodness. But you
denied it so strongly.

525
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,817
That is my weakness.

526
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:00,628
My family has swept away in
a scheme to commit treason.

527
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,058
Prince Ganghwa.

528
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:07,268
My family history is my
weakness that drags me down.

529
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:11,797
Do you have nightmares...

530
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,467
where you get chewed out
in the court or what?

531
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:20,007
A real nightmare is not the
dream I have when I go to sleep.

532
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:23,317
A real nightmare...

533
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,858
Why did you stop midway?

534
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:34,757
I forgot what I
was about to say.

535
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:35,788
Actually,

536
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:39,597
I have been meaning
to ask you a question.

537
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,967
How come you have not told
anyone about that night?

538
00:40:45,597 --> 00:40:47,907
- About what?
- How I tried to harm you.

539
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:52,478
Oh, that? I do not
want to get involved.

540
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:56,148
I just want to skate
over all the hardships.

541
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,958
I wish there would be
peace in our empire soon,

542
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,697
so I could lounge around.

543
00:41:12,828 --> 00:41:15,697
Saving the empire is
totally not my style.

544
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:19,708
Gosh.

545
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,637
I should get up to greet
you, Prince Yeongpyeong.

546
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:25,038
But I slept on a cold mountain,

547
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:26,847
so my whole body aches.

548
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,308
If I had stayed there
for one more night,

549
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:31,078
my handsome lips
would have gone numb.

550
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:33,987
- Are you done?
- What do you mean?

551
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:35,817
Your whining.

552
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:37,588
Including some bragging.

553
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,418
I do have more to go on,

554
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:41,958
but I will stop here as you
seem to have an urgent matter.

555
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:46,328
Gosh. All right.
What is this about?

556
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:14,958
I heard that you
make the best masks.

557
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:18,898
Go pick some over there.

558
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,597
My gosh. The teeth...

559
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,777
I do not want a typical mask.

560
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:34,347
I am thinking about selling
unique masks to civil servants.

561
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,777
"Unique"?

562
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:44,887
These days, you seem
to be mine, but not

563
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:46,117
At the same time

564
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:50,358
Boil the water.

565
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:53,168
- Boil the water.
- My gosh.

566
00:42:53,597 --> 00:42:54,597
Yes, sir.

567
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:57,197
- Royal Chef.
- Yes?

568
00:42:58,438 --> 00:43:01,867
The Grand Queen Dowager would
like a late-night snack,

569
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:06,308
but I am not sure if you
will be able to make it.

570
00:43:07,148 --> 00:43:08,347
Why you...

571
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:11,878
I have worked in the royal
kitchen for 30 years,

572
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:14,088
and it has been 12 years
since I became the Royal Chef.

573
00:43:14,788 --> 00:43:17,717
How can I be worse than the Queen?
If anything, I am better than her.

574
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:27,527
I trust you fully.

575
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:46,487
Darn it. Again.

576
00:43:57,228 --> 00:43:58,257
Again.

577
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:21,648
Hurry up.

578
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:28,588
This is all we have?

579
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:33,828
I milked all the cows
we have in the barn.

580
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:37,268
There is not a single
drop of milk left.

581
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:39,237
Nonsense!

582
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:42,808
What?

583
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:48,608
You incompetent jerk!

584
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:05,628
Your Highness.

585
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,708
I suddenly feel so annoyed,
and everything upsets me.

586
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:15,237
Neither one of
these mixed-up body,

587
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:16,637
and the other body that's
lying like a corpse,

588
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:18,038
feels like me.

589
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:21,407
I don't even know if my name is
Jang So Yong or Kim Bong Hwan now.

590
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,878
Well, your memory came back.

591
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:25,277
so I am sure you feel confused.

592
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:28,817
Do you know what
I hate the most?

593
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:31,418
I'm getting more
accustomed to this body.

594
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:34,027
I feel comfortable
wearing a skirt now.

595
00:45:44,898 --> 00:45:47,567
You must be on your period.
I will bring you a pad.

596
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:48,608
SANITARY PAD

597
00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:53,677
I'm...

598
00:45:54,808 --> 00:45:56,248
on my period?

599
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,128
Court Lady Chun!

600
00:46:13,628 --> 00:46:15,427
Yes, Your Highness.

601
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:18,768
Why has the Queen not
returned to the Palace yet?

602
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:21,467
I will send another
letter right away.

603
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:23,237
It is not like we are at war.

604
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:25,378
Send it as soon as the
sun rises tomorrow.

605
00:46:25,378 --> 00:46:27,007
Yes, Your Highness.

606
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:33,717
Is my brother's word
not as powerful anymore?

607
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,817
It is a sin to get older.

608
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:44,998
I am so hungry.

609
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,347
I still have one left.

610
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:12,657
There is nobody in here.

611
00:47:13,387 --> 00:47:15,088
Special Director Hong.

612
00:47:25,898 --> 00:47:27,567
It is you. Come in.

613
00:47:29,168 --> 00:47:31,277
Were you waiting for my return?

614
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:33,978
How did you know
I just came back?

615
00:47:35,947 --> 00:47:36,947
Goodness.

616
00:47:37,578 --> 00:47:38,648
Hold on.

617
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:43,588
How could you look so
terrible in two days?

618
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:45,317
Special Director Hong.

619
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:48,927
Did you lose all your
money to a swindler?

620
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:50,828
Did you lose the
deed to your home?

621
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,828
That is a mistake I made when
I was 14 years old and naive.

622
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:56,567
It is a bigger problem.

623
00:47:57,137 --> 00:47:58,498
Did you lose the
deed to your land?

624
00:47:58,498 --> 00:48:00,538
That already happened when
I went to get back the...

625
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:05,237
Your family has had a
lot of misfortune too.

626
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:10,277
Should I choose family or love?

627
00:48:11,648 --> 00:48:13,617
That is the question.

628
00:48:19,257 --> 00:48:21,858
Poor thing.

629
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:24,998
Poor thing. Goodness.

630
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:27,567
It really is a big problem.

631
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:40,599
Your Highness. The
Grand Queen Dowager...

632
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:42,570
requests that you come to
Tongmyeongjeon Hall quickly.

633
00:48:56,789 --> 00:48:58,120
Did you call for me?

634
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:01,559
You do not believe that
you are at fault...

635
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:04,189
for the death of the
late king. Am I right?

636
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:09,459
That is why you are doing all
that you can to blame my family.

637
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:11,269
Your Highness.

638
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,300
You may insult me all you want,

639
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,169
but please protect
our late king.

640
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:20,910
You are using my son
as a shield again.

641
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,209
I cannot believe you are impudent
enough to blame someone else...

642
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:25,610
to cover up your guilt.

643
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,050
A human being must
know themselves...

644
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:34,820
to avoid making the
same mistakes twice.

645
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:41,360
Thank you for your lesson.

646
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,169
I am so tired that I
cannot take off my socks.

647
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,720
I would gladly take
them off for you.

648
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,370
It is Surit-nal soon.

649
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,769
That is the expiration
date of my tolerance.

650
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,669
I have returned.

651
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,470
I see.

652
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:58,240
I heard that the Department of
Justice was quite busy today.

653
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,379
I heard you went against
the Royal Guard Division.

654
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,439
Many things were suspicious,

655
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,050
so I wanted to find evidence
before reporting it to you.

656
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,749
There are many suspicious people
in the Royal Guard Division.

657
00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:08,879
There are exactly
seven, I believe.

658
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:11,320
Were you aware of them?

659
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,689
Did you think I left them
alone because I was unaware?

660
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:25,169
If you look into them like that,
what do you think they would do?

661
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:27,740
They will dig themselves a
deeper tunnel and go into hiding.

662
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,169
They'll become more
clever and act in secret.

663
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:34,680
What you can see
cannot pose a threat.

664
00:51:34,939 --> 00:51:39,050
You have to make them believe
that you do not see them.

665
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,450
That way you can go after
and kill them right away...

666
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,720
when they cause a problem.

667
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,349
I was short-sighted.

668
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:49,490
Did you think...

669
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,430
I simply put him in
that position because...

670
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,129
he is not capable of doing
what a king should do?

671
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:59,999
It is because I implanted
fears into his mind myself.

672
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,539
It is easy to handle
those who have fears.

673
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:06,539
If the one sitting on
a higher seat fears me,

674
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:09,140
my power is greater than his.

675
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,180
When it comes to matters related
to the King, I will ask you first.

676
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:20,990
Go in and take a rest.

677
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,510
They will never find
you if you hide in here.

678
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:21,349
I will come and get
you no matter what.

679
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,689
But until then, you should
never, ever come out.

680
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:27,220
What about my brothers?
What about you, Mother?

681
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,860
I am fine as long
as you are alive.

682
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:32,559
You are my only son.

683
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,959
If you die,

684
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,399
I will die anyway.

685
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,129
Hurry up!

686
00:53:58,189 --> 00:53:59,189
Hurry up!

687
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,649
It is all an illusion.

688
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:35,720
It is not real.

689
00:55:37,919 --> 00:55:39,090
I should hurry and
get the ledger.

690
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,329
Was I mistaken?

691
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,430
It is impossible.

692
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,510
I am innocent, Won Beom.

693
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:04,280
I am falsely accused. I
cannot close my eyes, my son.

694
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,079
Won Beom! Won Beom!

695
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:08,349
- I did not do it.
- Won Beom.

696
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:10,950
- Won Beom.
- Won Beom.

697
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,720
- You are the only one who is alive.
- I am resentful.

698
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:16,990
- No, it is a lie.
- If your whole family died...

699
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:19,490
It is just a fear
inside my mind.

700
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:22,200
- No, no.
- I curse you.

701
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,499
- No.
- I curse you.

702
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:50,120
Kim So Yong.

703
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:57,570
What is it? She
looks just like her.

704
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:02,370
Do you think you will be like
the number one Kim So Yong?

705
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,410
There is something they have in
common. They do not have mothers.

706
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,419
"This book is written
by a scholar of Joseon."

707
00:57:15,419 --> 00:57:16,419
DONGMONGSEONSEUP, KIM SO YONG

708
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:18,189
I will discuss the summary
of Five Relationships.

709
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:21,660
Father and son, ruler and
subject, husband and wife,

710
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:23,519
elder brother and younger
brother, and friend and friend.

711
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:25,229
These are Five Relationships.

712
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:28,059
You memorized everything
until the book is ripped.

713
00:57:28,899 --> 00:57:30,360
Why would you recite it again?

714
00:57:31,899 --> 00:57:35,169
Today is my mom's funeral day.

715
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:37,769
It is her book.

716
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:41,910
So that is what you do
when you miss your mom.

717
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,539
DONGMONGSEONSEUP

718
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,309
I cry every day.

719
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,180
Then I found a
way to see my mom.

720
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,050
What is it?

721
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:55,260
If I die, I can see my mom.

722
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,189
You are alive.

723
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,329
Did you also come here to die?

724
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,059
What are you talking about?

725
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,399
I came here to die.

726
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,680
Do you want to live? Because
you are scared of dying?

727
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:54,320
No.

728
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,149
Everyone died except
for me. That is scarier.

729
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,660
Then...

730
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,459
let us go together.

731
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,209
Let us do it on
the count of three.

732
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,140
Yes.

733
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:34,860
The sound is coming from here!

734
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,289
Brother?

735
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,200
Do you know how much
I worried about you?

736
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,999
The whole family was
searching for you.

737
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:47,229
Brother.

738
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:54,939
I will come down.

739
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,979
Just give me a ladder.

740
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:00,649
Fine.

741
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,559
I am sorry. I thought about
it, but I want to live.

742
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,800
You actually want
to live too, right?

743
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:22,269
I will come back.

744
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:30,809
If you want to live,

745
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,519
if you want to live again,
come up to give it back to me.

746
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,229
- Does it reach the ground?
- Yes!

747
01:01:04,649 --> 01:01:05,749
Father.

748
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,479
Please.

749
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:12,349
Lady So Yong, Lady So Yong.

750
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:23,360
Father, please. Please, Father.

751
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,070
Father! Please!

752
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,300
Please, Father!

753
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,640
- Please.
- Put the rock on it.

754
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:36,680
Father, no! Please no!

755
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,410
Father! You cannot do it!

756
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,050
No! Father!

757
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,689
Please no! Father! No!

758
01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:52,129
Please, Father!
You cannot do it!

759
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:55,459
Father, no! Please, Father!

760
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,200
Father!

761
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:07,140
Both Mother and that child...

762
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:10,110
I did not believe
their promises anyway.

763
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,110
It will only stop after I die.

764
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,649
It will not stop until this
well is filled with rainwater.

765
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:19,590
Never.

766
01:02:49,649 --> 01:02:51,490
Save me, save me!

767
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,419
Save me! Save me!

768
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,890
Save me! Please!

769
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,229
I am sorry! Please save me!

770
01:03:01,229 --> 01:03:02,499
It is my fault.

771
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:04,729
I am responsible for his death.

772
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:07,099
Because I did not
keep the secret.

773
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:09,769
Because I told the
maidservant about him.

774
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,740
You heard what the adults said.

775
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,669
His family committed treason.

776
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,379
He did nothing wrong though.

777
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:19,649
You are a good
person, are you not?

778
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:23,379
Please, Brother.

779
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,090
Hurry up and come.

780
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:44,510
My brother is indeed
a good person.

781
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,990
Save me. Save me.

782
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,090
Please. Save me.

783
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:13,030
We should hurry and go.

784
01:04:22,539 --> 01:04:23,939
You really came.

785
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:26,979
You came as you had promised.

786
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,890
DONGMONGSEONSEUP

787
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:20,599
I want to live.

788
01:05:21,669 --> 01:05:22,700
Like you.

789
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,579
KIM SO YONG

790
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,129
People are afraid of darkness.

791
01:05:52,669 --> 01:05:55,240
So they try to chase it away
by lightening it up with light.

792
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:11,849
CONFIDENTIAL

793
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:20,030
But the stronger the light is,

794
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,660
the darker the shadow is.

795
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,580
Hwa Jin.

796
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:07,110
MR. QUEEN

797
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,160
<i>What happened?</i>

798
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,389
<i>I know right. I
almost touched him.</i>

799
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:29,200
<i>It was dangerous.</i>

800
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,099
<i>You might have
come as you wanted.</i>

801
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:33,429
<i>But you cannot go as you want.</i>

802
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:34,570
<i>I am sure it is fabricated.</i>

803
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,269
<i>You are saying it

<i>I will defeat the barbarian
using another barbarian.</i>

805
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:41,240
<i>This is how I become

01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,950
<i>I had a lot of concerns,
but I found a way.</i>
