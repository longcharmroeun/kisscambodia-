3
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:20,845
They say your arrow does not fly
straight when you are troubled.

EPISODE 11

5
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:39,265
I apologize for requesting
a meeting with you so late.

6
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,335
Why would you say such a thing?

7
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:43,095
You are seeking me out
when you are troubled,

8
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:44,564
so I am grateful for that.

9
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:48,735
If only this was a dream.

10
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,574
If only this would all end when
I wake up. That would be so nice.

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,254
I have something to give you.

12
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,764
CONFIDENTIAL

13
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:39,154
Please drag the Queen down into
the nightmare I am living in.

14
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,704
My King.

15
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:58,275
You appeared in my
dreams last night,

16
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:02,514
and such a big power
came into my hands.

THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

18
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:28,405
NO TOUCHING

19
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:34,845
AWESOME, MAGIC HOUR,
ATTENTION SEEKER

20
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:38,345
SHOWDOWN, JASMINE
TEA, ILL-MANNERED

21
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,035
You're so cute.

22
00:02:58,435 --> 00:02:59,465
Your Highness.

23
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:05,144
My, did you lose your voice because
you've been calling me nonstop?

24
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:11,785
Your Highness.

25
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:16,854
Your Highness.

26
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,054
How is the temperature
of the water?

27
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,965
How is the temperature
of the water?

28
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,195
I like it.

29
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,704
What on earth are
you doing here?

30
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:36,604
My Queen.

31
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:40,975
Today,

32
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:44,185
I shall forget "No touching".

33
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,424
Your Highness. Are you awake?

34
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,695
Goodness.

35
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:05,704
How did you end up looking
like an executioner overnight?

36
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,734
How dare he ruin
my sexy bath dream?

37
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,375
Call him in right now!

38
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:12,905
Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:14,975
Call him in...

40
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:18,714
Who shall we call?

41
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,495
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

42
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:33,425
You look like you are in
good spirits, Your Majesty.

43
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,135
I slept the entire
night without waking up.

44
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,635
Start preparing for
the banquet today.

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,935
Okay.

46
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:52,445
EPISODE 11, THE ONE
WHO CANNOT BE FORGIVEN

47
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:54,615
Doctor.

48
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,425
I had a nightmare.

49
00:04:57,855 --> 00:04:59,954
But what's scarier
than the nightmare...

50
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:01,495
is the fact that
I felt disgusted,

51
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,024
but I also liked it
at the same time.

52
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:08,295
I don't know if this is how I feel
or if it's how this body feels.

53
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:12,534
I feel like I've been assembled
by pieces from here and there.

54
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:14,505
That's right.

55
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:18,904
It feels like I've
become a set of Legos.

56
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:22,574
Who on earth am I?

57
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:26,615
But the thing is...

58
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,425
why are you calling me "doctor"?

59
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:33,084
You're making me
break character.

60
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,495
Just listen. It's just
a type of convention.

61
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,164
So what is the
opinion of the expert?

62
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:44,164
After you've been in
a vegetative state,

63
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:47,074
some of the common side effects
are changes to your body.

64
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:49,404
It's common?

65
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:54,714
So this is common.

66
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,485
That is actually
quite comforting.

67
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:03,755
Just hearing that makes me feel
like my anxiety is going away.

68
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:08,224
One who can heal without
performing any acupuncture...

69
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:10,255
is truly a great physician.

70
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,195
It turns out that...

71
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,135
our royal physician's
specialty was in psychology.

72
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:21,175
Then when will my mixed up
and duplicitous state...

73
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:22,534
going to be relieved?

74
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:25,274
Those are all issues
related to your heart.

75
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:28,675
Once you accept it, it will
not trouble you anymore.

76
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:31,815
If it does not trouble you, that
is when you can start living.

77
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:35,584
I have to accept
myself as who I am?

78
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:42,094
It makes sense. The only consistent
thing about me was my inconsistency.

79
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:44,264
Oh, right.

80
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,565
The medicinal herbs you used
for the beauty cover were great.

81
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:50,534
Take that experience...

82
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,735
and make something
to apply on the face.

83
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:55,204
Elasticity, glow
and brightening.

84
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:57,574
Make sure the functions attract
attention as soon as you hear them.

85
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:59,605
She's going to need a new one
every 28 days, so make a bunch.

86
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,175
Why is it every 28 days?

87
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:04,485
That's how long it takes
for your skin to regenerate.

88
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,615
Every time she has dead skin,

89
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:07,985
she will need me.

90
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,214
Your Highness.

91
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:13,454
Great Lord Yeongeun
has come to see you.

92
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,594
Was it really the Royal
Consort's court maid?

93
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,805
That is what she believes.

94
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:27,435
I am hoping that the court
maid who sold the norigae...

95
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,974
was O Wol.

96
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,945
She must be really upset.

97
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,074
I must go visit her.

98
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,344
Your Majesty. The Royal Consort
Eui has come to see you.

99
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:40,514
Tell her to come in.

100
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:45,485
Royal Consort.

101
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,594
Excuse me.

102
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,704
I have drawn a
composite of O Wol.

103
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,605
Because I am the one who
remembers her appearance the most.

104
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,074
I am sure...

105
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,774
that the person who sold
the norigae was O Wol.

106
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,014
There is no way she would end
up like that in the Palace.

107
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,284
You will be able to
know for sure with this.

108
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:19,324
Please excuse me.

109
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,154
Okay.

110
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,164
I just heard.

111
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,465
You must have been so
upset alone last night.

112
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,345
I pulled myself together all
night, so do not worry too much.

113
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,885
I have something to tell you.

114
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:49,684
It is about how you
feel towards the Queen.

115
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:51,684
It is harder to
overcome yourself...

116
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,725
than to overcome another
person. That is why...

117
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:58,564
you should not try to
stop your feelings.

118
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:03,694
What I want from you
is not your apology.

119
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,215
Are you doing okay so far?

120
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,255
It has only been a day since
I have returned to the Palace,

121
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,855
so I am fine.

122
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:29,725
However, I will be busy due to the
investiture of the Royal Concubine.

123
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,564
The investiture of
the Royal Concubine.

124
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:38,904
While you were at home,

125
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:42,135
did anything strange happen?

126
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,674
Anything strange?

127
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,314
I picked up a king while I
was passing by the well but...

128
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,514
No. Is something wrong?

129
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:53,855
Well...

130
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,024
After having the
two of you at home,

131
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,924
the house feels empty
without you there.

132
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,955
I suppose that is the problem.

133
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,024
Why don't you see His
Majesty before you go?

134
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,365
I'm saying the parties involved
should handle it on their own.

135
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:09,465
No, it is okay.

136
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,164
I am sure he is busy
because of the banquet.

137
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:15,375
Your Highness, I have brought the
letter to the house of the fiancee.

138
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:18,245
You should take care of
business. I will get going now.

139
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:28,684
Your Highness.

140
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,154
Even if they fill the
spot of 100 concubines,

141
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:35,095
they cannot dare...

142
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:39,064
to fill the spot of the Queen.

143
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,595
Right. Of course.

144
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:44,705
Please take care of yourself.

145
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:48,904
Goodbye.

146
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:58,745
HAN SI OK

147
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,514
Take out everyone
from the Han family.

148
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,524
We don't want to end up
like "Romeo and Juliet".

149
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,394
What happened with what I asked
for? The Han family registers.

150
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,365
Pyeongsan Han clan.

151
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:14,995
Hanyang Han clan.

152
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:16,764
Anbyeon Han clan.

153
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:19,564
- Yangju Han clan.
- Hold on.

154
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:23,434
Are all of those Han
family registers?

155
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,005
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:28,615
Gosh, this is
getting out of hand.

157
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:34,585
This won't do. I need to
win her favor properly.

158
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,125
DS. I should start doing that.

159
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,455
- DS?
- Door-to-door sales.

160
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:48,095
Is it already time for a meal?

161
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:53,904
It is time for you to
share it with your skin.

162
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:06,514
My gosh, you are
blinding my eyes.

163
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:11,325
This glow must be from
out of this world.

164
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:15,125
Thanks to you, my entire day is
filled with taking care of myself.

165
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:17,865
I have not been paying
attention to the investiture.

166
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,495
I am sure you are doing well.

167
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:23,434
I am doing my best.

168
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:26,404
Of course. If you see one
thing, you have seen it all.

169
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:29,205
You do everything so well,

170
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,975
so I trust you.

171
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,575
There is something that...

172
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:37,485
I prepared especially for
you, Grand Queen Dowager.

173
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,514
If you sprinkle this
magic powder on your hair,

174
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,284
it will make you look
10 years younger.

175
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,054
It's hair powder.

176
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:51,225
You do not need to bother
with putting mulberry juice...

177
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:53,264
on your head every morning.

178
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,835
Oh, my.

179
00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:00,235
Gently. sprinkle the powder.

180
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:01,934
Sprinkle it.

181
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:07,914
It is a completely
different person.

182
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:12,314
Her eyes were a
bit more slanted.

183
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,985
Wait, was her left
eye more slanted?

184
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:17,385
I'm hungry too

185
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,125
Okay.

186
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:29,434
Her face was slim, and
she had chubby cheeks.

187
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:31,505
She had a wide forehead,

188
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:33,264
and her eyes shined.

189
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:34,975
Like this.

190
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,475
Her nose was straight
but round at the end.

191
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:17,914
Your Majesty. The
Royal Chef is here.

192
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,284
I think sweet flag liquor would
be good. What do you think?

193
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:23,814
Pardon?

194
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:27,495
Oh. I was lost in my thoughts,
so I was ahead of myself.

195
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,955
I was thinking about the
liquor to have at the banquet.

196
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:35,995
Your Majesty. I have
prepared something.

197
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:47,005
Punish me with
death, Your Majesty.

198
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,865
You can be at ease.

199
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,294
That way things
will go smoothly.

200
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:09,995
If you say so.

201
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,075
Are you comfortable like
that? Come here then.

202
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:20,644
Hey.

203
00:15:23,014 --> 00:15:25,215
It is a traditional
banquet set-up.

204
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,914
The banquet I have in
mind is a bit different.

205
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:32,054
I want to reduce the number
of dishes and remove...

206
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:34,595
the big, unnecessary
set up in the middle.

207
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:36,894
- I apologize, Your Majesty,
- Okay.

208
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,865
but a royal banquet...

209
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,664
is supposed to be big and fancy.

210
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,434
So as unnecessary
as it may be...

211
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,064
Have you lost your mind?

212
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,904
Starvation is common
for the people.

213
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,075
How can I waste food
just to please our eyes?

214
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:58,585
Then, as for the
food we will prepare,

215
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:02,485
we will bring starving people
outside the palace and feed them.

216
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:08,294
Modest, but not shabby.

217
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,625
Fancy, but not extravagant.

218
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,524
That is the banquet
I have in mind.

219
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:22,835
I will give everything I
have for the next two weeks.

220
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:27,674
Let us work together.

221
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,184
Your Majesty.

222
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,394
How can a man cry
so easily like that?

223
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:52,764
I cannot believe he kept
such a detailed record...

224
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:55,075
of the sources of the bribes.

225
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:59,944
The Queen's father is more
meticulous than I thought.

226
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,345
Royal Noble Consort Eui's enemy is
not the Kim clan. It is the Queen.

227
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,484
That is why she fails
to see the big picture.

228
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:21,194
We must use the ledger
more effectively.

229
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:23,664
We will bring the fall
of the Kim clan...

230
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:27,065
and dethrone the Queen as well.

231
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,414
A ledger?

232
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:38,515
What was he thinking? How could
he keep such a dangerous item?

233
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,684
I should...

234
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,385
Keep it a secret for now.

235
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:46,385
If the clan finds out,
people will be agitated.

236
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:49,154
My goodness. That man...

237
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:51,894
Anyway,

238
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,835
who do you think
has the ledger now?

239
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:57,494
The King stayed at his
house for two whole days...

240
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,664
and ignored the request of
his attendance in the palace.

241
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:00,704
The...

242
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:03,335
The King?

243
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:08,615
He is planning to expose us
at the banquet on Surit-nal.

244
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:10,914
He may have a weapon with him,

245
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:14,885
but we must make him weak,
so he cannot hold his weapon.

246
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:17,754
From Kim Mun Geun's
point of view,

247
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:21,555
I am the only suspect left now.

248
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:24,154
But he cannot question the King
if he had stolen the ledger.

249
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:25,765
He must be in a tight spot.

250
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:29,365
Have we found out the identity
of the man behind the mask?

251
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:30,835
No one from the
Department of Justice...

252
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,704
has a scar on their chin.

253
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,875
Even if we fail to
obtain the ledger,

254
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,375
we must be able to devise a
plot to carry out our plan.

255
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:42,845
Have you looked
into other clans?

256
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:55,325
The law of five seconds.

257
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:58,595
It only takes five
seconds to fall in love.

258
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:03,595
Your Highness, everyone is here.

259
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:05,135
- This is everyone?
- Yes.

260
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:11,504
Nice to meet you.

261
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:14,045
Nice to meet you.

262
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:19,085
Nice to meet you.

263
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,115
Let me see.

264
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,484
Women I felt a spark with...

265
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:32,865
She was nice too.

266
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:41,904
Lady Yoon. I'd love to know
more about your life...

267
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:43,605
because you have
such a nice aura.

268
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:49,714
In my hometown, there is
this beautiful mountain.

269
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:52,015
It is called Mount Gamak.

270
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:54,385
- Mount Gamak?
- Yes, Your Highness.

271
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:58,125
That is amazing.

272
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,224
- "Amazing"?
- "Amazing"?

273
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:02,654
- Your Highness.
- Yes?

274
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:05,595
There is a big
palace in my town.

275
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,765
The palace was built
by King Jeongjo.

276
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,295
Is Hwaseong Palace is the only thing
you can brag about your hometown?

277
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,135
That is all you ever talk about.

278
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:17,075
Now, you may have one more
thing to brag about...

279
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:19,904
if you become a
consort, Lady Hong.

280
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:23,075
Your Highness. Thank you.

281
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:29,184
In the empty lots from my hometown,
there are many peach trees.

282
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:31,385
When the flowers are in bloom,

283
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,754
they are gorgeous.

284
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,625
And my mother dreamed of
peaches when she had me.

285
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,065
I knew it.

286
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:43,234
If a peach were to
be born as a girl,

287
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:46,605
it would look just
like you, Lady Min.

288
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:50,635
Peach.

289
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:54,404
If you can win over
these three clans,

290
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:59,785
you can have a dragon and
two phoenixes on your sides.

291
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:03,214
So you will be riding
on a white tiger's back.

292
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,494
As Hwaseong Palace
guards the gate...

293
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,865
and I adore the
scenery of Mount Gamak,

294
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:21,234
the sweet aroma of
peaches fills my room.

295
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,994
The Papyeong Yoon clan.
The Namyang Hong clan.

296
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:43,795
The Yeoheung Min clan.

297
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:46,065
This is a good
balance of the clans.

298
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:52,065
Innocent, sexy, and cute.

299
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:53,934
How harmonious.

300
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:02,674
Gyeong Ok of the
Papyeong Yoon clan.

301
00:22:03,444 --> 00:22:05,214
Ja Yeon of the
Yeoheung Min clan.

302
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:08,015
Sim Hyang of the
Namyang Hong clan.

303
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:12,184
I assign you the rank of Grade Two
in the Internal Court, consort.

304
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:20,095
The three of these consorts and
their families joined my family.

305
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:23,335
So tell the elders
of your families...

306
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:25,934
to attend the
banquet on Surit-nal.

307
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:29,504
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

308
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,275
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

309
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:39,744
The King started to
build his own allies.

310
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:42,454
But they are bound
to leave him...

311
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:44,625
once they find out he
is weak as a kitten.

312
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:50,625
The King insisted
on having a banquet.

313
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:52,164
Is this what he wanted?

314
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:56,335
- I hope you are getting it ready.
- Do not worry.

315
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:07,244
Yes!

316
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:13,285
Everyone must've been dying to
see what was beyond the walls.

317
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:17,385
They are so good at neolttwigi.

318
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,885
The Queen Dowager is coming.

319
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:26,795
I hope all is well with you.

320
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:31,635
It has been a while,
Royal Noble Consort Eui.

321
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:35,434
- Hello, Your Highness.
- Hello, Your Highness.

322
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:41,105
I will head to the archery
range and practice my archery.

323
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:51,525
It has been quite some time...

324
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,224
you woke up from the
vegetative state now.

325
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,194
But you did not
come to see me once.

326
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,365
I have been busy...

327
00:23:58,365 --> 00:23:59,795
with selecting the royal
concubines after I returned.

328
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:02,464
My apologies.

329
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:06,704
Given that you had a near-death
experience, you seem too well.

330
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:10,305
I am very healthy.

331
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,375
So you must have given
up to hunt on Surit-nal.

332
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,315
Instead of practicing
your archery at the range,

333
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:19,285
you are here,
jumping on the plank.

334
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:21,285
I am sure Royal Noble
Consort Eui will win anyway.

335
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,414
I decided to enjoy the process.

336
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,355
I may be good at the "haunting",

337
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:28,394
but I am not good
at hunting at all.

338
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:30,494
"Haunting"?

339
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:31,964
Do you know why...

340
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:35,035
the young women of the
Internal Court going hunting...

341
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:36,635
on Surit-nal?

342
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:39,964
No, I do not.

343
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:47,644
On Surit-nal, we chase
away evil spirits.

344
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:49,914
People used to chase
away the evil spirits...

345
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,615
with the blood from
their killings.

346
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,484
Now, we are hunting
animals instead.

347
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:08,135
Actually, there was a body
from the well at the palace.

348
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,694
People are saying she was Royal
Noble Consort Eui's court maid.

349
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:12,635
In the well?

350
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:15,904
Gosh. Why?

351
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:18,375
Your Highness.

352
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,204
- Please come.
- Please come.

353
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:21,914
Okay.

354
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:31,115
- My gosh.
- No way.

355
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,954
- She is so good.
- Your Highness.

356
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:38,325
A triple axel.

357
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:54,416
I can't sleep and feel restless.

358
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,095
Should I send a message
to my dear consorts?

359
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,136
What would be good?

360
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:10,136
A simple opening line that isn't too
burdensome but provokes emotions.

361
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:12,476
I got it.

362
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:36,126
Deliver these to them
at the royal villa.

363
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:37,765
Yes, Your Highness.

364
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,396
Oh, right.

365
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,765
Tell them to see if
the King stops by.

366
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:44,535
Yes, Your Highness.

367
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:51,146
One for each consort
at the royal villa.

368
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:52,976
- Check on His Majesty.
- Check on His Majesty.

369
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:54,716
One for each consort
at the royal villa.

370
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:56,146
- Check on His Majesty.
- Check on His Majesty.

371
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,386
Seriously?

372
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,595
After you.

373
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,226
- One for His Majesty.
- One for His Majesty.

374
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,995
- Check on royal consorts.
- Check on royal consorts.

375
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,065
What?

376
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,065
- One for His Majesty.
- Something has changed.

377
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,866
- Check on royal consorts.
- Check on royal consorts.

378
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:22,446
"Are you sleeping?"

379
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:24,305
"Are you sleeping?"

380
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,216
Well...

381
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,055
Are you sleeping?

382
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:39,325
Are you sleeping?

383
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:46,436
Why is she so
curious about this?

384
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:48,936
It is three "Are you sleeping?".

385
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:56,805
The reply was delivered.

386
00:27:57,646 --> 00:28:00,646
I sent 3. Why there's
only one reply?

387
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,646
Is everyone putting
too much effort?

388
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,386
Let's see.

389
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:16,396
What a beautiful handwriting.
She's indeed from a noble family.

390
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,666
I went out on a sleepless night.

391
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:26,075
There is something that shines
on the dark sky at night.

392
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:30,745
I looked up wondering if it was
the moon. But it was my friend.

393
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,916
What a cringey but
emotional text.

394
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,646
If so, I will also...

395
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:04,305
- Hong Yeon.
- Yes, Your Highness.

396
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,876
This is a reply. Send it to
the person who sent the letter.

397
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:11,116
I sometimes think
of other things.

398
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,216
I will be happy drowning to
death in the thought of you.

399
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,926
Please row to me.

400
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:20,995
Oh, I did not let you go.

401
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:24,966
My Queen.

402
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,476
I finally made use of what I learned
for the college entrance exam.

403
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:36,005
Nice. This is how I'll
rediscover my identity.

404
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,216
Okay.

405
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,396
Follow the same recipe,

406
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,736
but instead of
extravagant croaker,

407
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,236
pomfret would be nice.

408
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:35,236
POMFRET IS A KIND
OF BUTTERFISH.

409
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:40,236
Should I get some inspiration
for the poems for my letters?

410
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,045
My Queen.

411
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:43,706
Darn it.

412
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,146
My Queen.

413
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:47,646
You! I said you're not allowed.

414
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,245
But...

415
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:50,745
At the investiture, I was
acting like we were a couple...

416
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:52,656
as it was an official ceremony.

417
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:55,025
It's an important time for
me to rediscover my identity.

418
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,126
Please cooperate.

419
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:57,626
How rude.

420
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:58,656
Darn it.

421
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:02,226
How can she be so different?

422
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:06,736
She is shier than she looks.

423
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,805
The menu list for the
ceremony is completed.

424
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:15,775
Please work on that.

425
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,575
Did you check the offering
list for the Dano ceremony?

426
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:22,486
Here it is.

427
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:24,416
Why do they keep
saying "erection"?

428
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,956
The menu "erection" refers
to the list of foods.

429
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:32,295
Offering "erection" is a record
of items for ritual ceremonies.

430
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:34,156
What is the matter,
Your Highness?

431
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:36,396
Really? Am I the
only trash here?

432
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,295
Your Majesty!

433
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:47,275
You overwork yourself every day.

434
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:49,876
You should go and have
a rest, Your Majesty.

435
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:51,775
No.

436
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,275
We do not have time.
Let us keep going on.

437
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:57,745
I almost felt sorry
for him again.

438
00:31:58,815 --> 00:32:00,916
This is not good. I should send
even more emotional letters today.

439
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:03,025
"Erection" is indeed
a dangerous word.

440
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,156
Unlike what history says, he has
a nosebleed for the other thing.

441
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:11,966
The name I will die calling!

442
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:15,335
It will linger in my mind
as I cannot forget it.

443
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,075
How can she be so
different day and night?

444
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,345
Is she having a hard
time deciding...

445
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,906
whether to forgive me or not?

446
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:35,156
There is no way to forgive
me for the broken heart.

447
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:38,325
Would there be a path
we could walk together?

448
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:50,206
I hope we can walk together
from the beginning next time,

449
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,206
even if it is in dreams.

450
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,225
Practicing sword at night?

451
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,326
Having one crazy
person is enough.

452
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,656
We need to prepare for the
sparring at the Dano ceremony.

453
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,966
Do it with the people from
the Department of Justice.

454
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:22,605
How do you evaluate
your own swordsmanship?

455
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:23,966
I do not know.

456
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,275
I never tried my best
because I am not interested.

457
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,505
That is why I need you.

458
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:32,176
An opponent whose
ability is unknown.

459
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:09,346
SURIT-NAL

460
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:10,946
LONGEVITY AND GOOD FORTUNE

461
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:19,725
DAEJOJEON HALL

462
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,536
The weather is
amazing, Your Highness.

463
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:34,975
Is that so? That's nice.

464
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:37,076
I hate when it
rains on sports day.

465
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:43,116
My father will come. So it
should be more glamorous.

466
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:46,056
It is the first day I will present
myself in front of everyone.

467
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:47,486
Pay extra attention.

468
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:52,926
Yes. I look pretty.

469
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,426
Everyone will be
looking at me, right?

470
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:11,246
Are you planning to
use a metal arrowhead?

471
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:13,545
Today, I have...

472
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:18,886
a big game to catch.

473
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:24,255
All right. This must
be delivered quickly.

474
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,656
Let us hurry.

475
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,426
Hello, my lord.

476
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:33,096
We have the fresh ingredients for
the Surit-nal banquet today...

477
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:34,966
and the royal offerings.

478
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:38,036
We must hurry to the
palace. Please excuse us.

479
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,906
- Do you have a document for them?
- Of course.

480
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:42,846
Here you go.

481
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,815
It is time to dress,
Your Highness.

482
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:22,716
Give me a moment.

483
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:26,056
It is a very important day.

484
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:30,426
I should at least try to
read my fortune with this.

485
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:37,096
Let me see. The card for
the Pungyang Jo clan.

486
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:48,205
TOJANG: A LOW CARD IN TUJEON

487
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,605
The rabbit card.

488
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:59,016
Well, luck is relative.

489
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:04,585
Let me see. And the
card for the King.

490
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:12,435
What?

491
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,935
"Injang". The ninth card.

492
00:37:22,446 --> 00:37:23,746
Will the tables turn?

493
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:29,716
Now, this is for the Queen.

494
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:39,755
Dragon?

495
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:41,496
EOJANG

496
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:43,496
The eighth card. Darn it.

497
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,435
I hate my reading today.

498
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,946
Is the Queen...

499
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:03,145
plotting something again?

500
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,656
The Queen Dowager is here.

501
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:10,326
You could have let me know in
advance that you were visiting.

502
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:13,056
You will not even hide
your dislike toward me.

503
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,096
When I was the Queen, such
actions were unheard of.

504
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:17,665
Regardless of the eras,

505
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:20,636
no daughters-in-law would want to
be ambushed by their mothers-in-law.

506
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:22,935
Look at you, talking back to me.

507
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:29,145
I heard that you are cooking
for the Grand Queen Dowager.

508
00:38:29,746 --> 00:38:33,545
But you have never offered
me a single refreshment.

509
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,516
You must fear...

510
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:38,415
your grandmother-in-law
more than you fear me.

511
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,185
My gosh. No, that is not true.

512
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,426
The Grand Queen Dowager
takes good care of herself,

513
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:45,725
so she seems young.

514
00:38:46,196 --> 00:38:48,395
But she cannot defy time.

515
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,466
You should think more carefully.

516
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:54,996
I will live longer than
the Grand Queen Dowager.

517
00:38:58,665 --> 00:39:00,475
I will serve you my
food some time...

518
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:02,076
I must eat it now.

519
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:06,875
I am curious about your cooking
which I only heard about.

520
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,045
I cannot wait.

521
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:12,815
Right now?

522
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,656
Is this the beginning of
bullying from my mother-in-law?

523
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,375
My gosh. I'm so annoyed.

524
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,415
What is she hiding?

525
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,116
Royal Chef. I need
the grain syrup.

526
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:49,286
What will I do without the fresh
ingredients for the banquet?

527
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:52,625
All the guards around
the wagon died.

528
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,755
What could I do?

529
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:56,196
My goodness. Come on.

530
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,835
- The dried fish.
- What?

531
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:03,165
The dried fish. The dried fish!

532
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:08,076
The Royal Chef is
too busy these days.

533
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,105
I can't boss him around.

534
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:14,576
Where's the grain syrup?

535
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:34,236
I WENT OUT ON A
SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

536
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:36,505
"I went out on a
sleepless night..."

537
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:39,536
Royal Chef. Royal Chef!

538
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,806
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

539
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,005
What is this about?

540
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:46,016
Your Majesty.

541
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:04,426
These are precious ingredients.
They are all rotten!

542
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:06,636
They must have been
stored improperly.

543
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:10,306
Punish me with
death, Your Majesty.

544
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,505
That cannot be.

545
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:16,645
No one would have ruined them
unless their safety was guaranteed.

546
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:20,545
Royal Chef!

547
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:22,516
Your Majesty.

548
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,185
We have a problem.

549
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:26,286
Someone added stones
in the rice jab.

550
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:29,326
- What?
- We cannot serve anything.

551
00:41:31,386 --> 00:41:34,096
Do not worry. Do everything
you can on your end.

552
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:38,525
I will do whatever it takes
to get those ingredients.

553
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:42,036
Yes.

554
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:53,475
Goodness. What are you doing?

555
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:57,216
Royal Chef! Hey!

556
00:41:57,486 --> 00:42:00,986
I should show her how I'm
bringing the food all by myself.

557
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:03,556
That will help her
feel better, right?

558
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:14,466
The mix of sweet grain
syrup and salt makes...

559
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:15,835
the perfect example of
sweet and salty dishes.

560
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:34,516
Over there, I see a
beautiful mountain

561
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:47,736
Secretary Han?

562
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:50,505
You jerk!

563
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:52,505
How dare you?

564
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,886
My popcorn!

565
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:16,125
You!

566
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,136
That scumbag!

567
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,116
Where are the refreshments?

568
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,685
Well...

569
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:54,766
Here.

570
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,676
You can look forward to
your life at the palace.

571
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:11,616
Given the circumstance,

572
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,286
you must get the ingredients...

573
00:44:13,286 --> 00:44:15,415
once you are done with your
demonstration of martial arts.

574
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:16,955
Yes.

575
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:28,696
Thank you for inviting
us to this banquet.

576
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:31,906
You deserve to be here.

577
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:34,835
The consorts are
doing well here.

578
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:37,205
I hope all is well with you.

579
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:38,605
- Yes.
- Yes.

580
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,076
Anyway, have a good day today.

581
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,585
Is the Queen Dowager
not here yet?

582
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,625
I will find out.

583
00:46:05,665 --> 00:46:09,435
TONGMYEONGJEON HALL

584
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,906
I thought you ran away.

585
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,205
Of course not.

586
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:19,415
If anyone has committed a crime,
they must be punished accordingly.

587
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,746
I am glad that you
are aware of it.

588
00:46:23,185 --> 00:46:25,716
The Queen sent me some
snacks in the morning,

589
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,585
and I started getting ready
late because I was tasting them.

590
00:46:29,725 --> 00:46:30,986
The Queen did?

591
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,036
I feel like I'm going to die being
stuck in the middle like this.

592
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:48,605
Is she having another
misunderstanding?

593
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,815
No way.

594
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:31,915
The Royal Guard Division will put
on a martial arts performance.

595
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:51,605
Attention!

596
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:53,705
Round one.

597
00:47:57,846 --> 00:48:01,875
How dare he try to harm
the Queen with that sword?

598
00:48:06,955 --> 00:48:08,085
Spar.

599
00:49:36,446 --> 00:49:40,176
Oh, my. The King has
prepared very well.

600
00:49:56,056 --> 00:50:00,236
Grand Queen Dowager. It
is time to go hunting.

601
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:05,306
Your Highness. You should
change into your hunting attire.

602
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:12,775
I will be back,
Grand Queen Dowager.

603
00:50:14,775 --> 00:50:16,886
I will be back.

604
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:10,536
First line, prepare to shoot.

605
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:15,105
Fire!

606
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:25,446
Fire!

607
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:31,486
Fire!

608
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:47,676
I thought this was all for show.

609
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:14,064
It's all about what
items you have.

610
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,805
I think I look cool right now.

611
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,535
I like it. I look
cool right now.

612
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:31,214
Why does she look so determined?

613
00:52:31,444 --> 00:52:34,155
There are always those who
take sports days so seriously.

614
00:52:35,515 --> 00:52:36,825
What's with that glare?

615
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,495
A bird is worth 1 point, a
rabbit is worth 2 points,

616
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:44,925
a badger is worth 3 points,
a boar is worth 4 points,

617
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:48,095
a deer is worth 5 points,
a wolf is worth 7 points,

618
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:52,205
a bear is worth 9 points, and
a tiger is worth 10 points.

619
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:53,234
WOLF, TIGER, RABBIT, DEER

620
00:52:53,234 --> 00:52:54,975
You will each be
given 10 arrows.

621
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:58,374
For a fair match, your
court lady and court maid...

622
00:52:58,374 --> 00:52:59,675
will not join you.

623
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:02,214
How cruel.

624
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:04,044
This would make people
sign a national petition...

625
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:05,484
if it happens in
the present day.

626
00:53:05,914 --> 00:53:08,655
Then we will get started.

627
00:53:19,064 --> 00:53:21,464
You may now go.

628
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:30,905
I should just waste
some time and come back.

629
00:53:48,095 --> 00:53:51,294
The hunting competition
today is so predictable.

630
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:54,595
It is a competition for
the pride of each family.

631
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:57,805
But the Queen does
not seem interested.

632
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:01,635
I did not know you have enough time
to care about a playful competition.

633
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:05,144
You might see your
son's face today.

634
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,945
It is time to give you my gift.

635
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,584
On the night when the Queen has
fallen into a vegetative state,

636
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:19,555
Royal Noble Consort and the
King were going to share a bed.

637
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:21,954
The Queen woke up...

638
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:24,664
only a day after she fainted.

639
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:28,664
Do you mean she pretended
to lose consciousness...

640
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:31,664
to keep them from sharing a bed?

641
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,974
The Queen put
everything at stake...

642
00:54:35,974 --> 00:54:37,675
to win the King's heart.

643
00:54:38,244 --> 00:54:39,874
Diving into the lake...

644
00:54:39,874 --> 00:54:42,244
throwing herself in front of the
sword pointed at Consort Eui.

645
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:45,814
She even put the last
thing she has at stake now.

646
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:51,885
The Queen abandoned her family.

647
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,635
I was getting bored, and
you told me a funny story.

648
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:09,434
The King insisted on giving
a banquet out of nowhere.

649
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:12,044
And the Queen rushed the
investiture of royal consorts...

650
00:55:12,044 --> 00:55:14,544
to select families in power.

651
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:17,845
As if she chose the ones
who can support the King.

652
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:21,785
The King will reveal
the true side...

653
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,285
he has hidden in front
of the officials today.

654
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:27,095
As a strong ruler.

655
00:55:30,564 --> 00:55:32,494
Can you see it now?

656
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,865
The Queen moves for the King.

657
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:39,505
Are you not afraid of your
future saying such things?

658
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:43,035
You must have believed the
Queen would never betray you.

659
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:46,505
I was actually disappointed.

660
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:49,215
You were bewitched by the
Queen's cheap tricks...

661
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:50,845
and fooled like that.

662
00:55:51,485 --> 00:55:54,215
I guess you are old now.

663
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,385
I will tear those lips off.

664
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:01,655
The Queen pretended to faint.
Then I committed no sin.

665
00:56:01,655 --> 00:56:05,465
So I am not afraid anymore!

666
00:56:10,465 --> 00:56:12,465
Why did you stop playing?

667
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:15,834
You made Grand
Queen Dowager upset.

668
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:31,155
Next,

669
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:35,454
the King will grant
you with Dano fans.

670
00:56:57,385 --> 00:57:00,615
You have worked hard. I am
excited for the banquet.

671
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,354
I also saw you working hard.

672
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:13,264
Grand Queen Dowager has come.

673
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:19,204
You are here.

674
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,474
The royal banquet was so boring.

675
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:26,874
I could not stand it.

676
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:31,514
I was wondering if the
banquet here is any better.

677
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,514
I am sorry that I
could not please you.

678
00:57:36,555 --> 00:57:39,255
I wanted to see the martial arts
demonstration but I was late.

679
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:45,595
Well, it is just as boring
to see the staged event.

680
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:51,104
I would rather have
them spar for real.

681
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,635
I will make the royal guards
compete with each other.

682
00:57:55,535 --> 00:57:57,244
How about doing it yourself?

683
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,584
I heard you chopped
firewood in Ganghwa...

684
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:06,314
and delivered water for living.

685
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,055
With that stamina, it
would not be so hard.

686
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:15,794
Manual work and martial
arts are different.

687
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:19,494
Furthermore, I only have sat on
the throne for the past few years.

688
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:20,894
My body became stiff.

689
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:23,264
You may use a Dano fan
instead of a weapon.

690
00:58:26,805 --> 00:58:29,704
How about competing against the
head of the Department of Justice?

691
00:58:29,704 --> 00:58:31,204
You are around the same age.

692
00:58:34,414 --> 00:58:35,644
The head of the
Department of Justice...

693
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,914
is a warrior who has
professionally trained for years.

694
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,954
I am worried the
King might get hurt.

695
00:58:40,954 --> 00:58:42,354
If you want to watch a
match, I will have others...

696
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:45,224
I have to see how
the King fights.

697
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:52,264
What do you say?

698
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:57,405
Father was wrong.

699
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,934
Please see the King's
true face on Surit-nal.

700
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:15,215
DEER

701
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:24,465
Darn it.

702
00:59:25,624 --> 00:59:26,664
BEAR

703
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,164
Go.

704
00:59:57,164 --> 00:59:59,325
You are not the prey I
have been looking for.

705
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:14,115
Is it the wrong way?

706
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:19,644
I think I saw this tree earlier.

707
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,684
Where should I go?

708
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,525
We will hold a fan in our hands.

709
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:32,724
The person who takes the fan
from the opponent will win.

710
01:00:36,195 --> 01:00:37,535
Be gentle.

711
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,365
What is going on?

712
01:01:10,195 --> 01:01:12,064
I said be gentle.

713
01:01:13,164 --> 01:01:15,735
How will you take responsibility
for hurting the King's body?

714
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:20,314
It is Grand Queen
Dowager's order.

715
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:22,075
I cannot do anything
but do my best.

716
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:30,115
So you have Grand Queen
Dowager behind you.

717
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:37,224
Then I shall teach you
a thing or two again.

718
01:01:37,224 --> 01:01:39,325
Let me show you who
this palace belongs to.

719
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,425
You said he is different
from the late King.

720
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:06,584
He is indeed different.

721
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:12,425
Whatever.

722
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:15,135
I should just take a nap. They
will find me when it's over.

723
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:19,365
My gosh!

724
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:22,235
What are you doing here?

725
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:27,144
What do you think I am
doing? I am hiding to live.

726
01:02:27,715 --> 01:02:30,175
It's not like you'll die for
real. Why are you so scared?

727
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:34,314
I know but the arrow
hurts quite a lot.

728
01:02:34,914 --> 01:02:36,954
I still have bruises
from the last year.

729
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:38,124
You're such a crybaby.

730
01:02:39,785 --> 01:02:41,854
Don't worry. I'm not
interested in hunting.

731
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:45,865
I will get shot by someone
else's arrow anyway.

732
01:02:57,505 --> 01:02:58,874
My gosh.

733
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:01,314
How can you just come
back here like this?

734
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,474
TIGER

735
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:09,954
Like this?

736
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:13,624
Thank you, Your Highness.

737
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:14,894
This is a souvenir.

738
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:17,224
Go.

739
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,965
Already?

740
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:24,604
I did not know the Queen's
archery skills were that great...

741
01:03:24,604 --> 01:03:27,305
to catch a tiger so quickly.

742
01:03:27,305 --> 01:03:29,575
She is an archery master.

743
01:03:29,575 --> 01:03:32,874
I did not see her and only
heard the sound of the wind.

744
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:35,474
Then I got shot just like that.

745
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:36,575
Really?

746
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:16,215
It was you.

747
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:18,914
You were that person.

748
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:24,055
I will not forgive you.

749
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:46,974
I will take your life.

750
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:12,005
MR. QUEEN

751
01:06:27,414 --> 01:06:29,685
<i>I have regretful news.</i>

752
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,055
<i>My hand slipped...</i>

753
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:32,985
<i>and I shot an
arrow to the Queen.</i>

754
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:35,254
<i>The banquet is about to begin, but
the ingredients did not arrive.</i>

755
01:06:35,254 --> 01:06:36,324
<i>Is this all?</i>

756
01:06:36,324 --> 01:06:37,895
<i>Is it you who put the drug?</i>

757
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:39,565
<i>The name is Lee Saeng Mang.</i>

758
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,765
<i>I will make a new menu list
according to the ingredients we got.</i>

759
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,935
<i>How dare you fry
my precious needle?</i>

760
01:06:43,935 --> 01:06:46,404
<i>What we will make today
isn't ordinary food.</i>

761
01:06:46,404 --> 01:06:47,675
<i>It's the face of the president.</i>

762
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,975
<i>How dare you refuse to obey
the orders of your superior?</i>

763
01:06:49,975 --> 01:06:52,404
<i>- Catch them!
- It is not disloyalty but mutiny!</i>

764
01:06:52,404 --> 01:06:55,675
<i>You have to pay the price for
letting your temper control you.</i>
