THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,523
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:23,634
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

4
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,104
How miraculous it is...

5
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,904
that tomorrow comes every day?

6
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,844
It is dangerous. There
may be another explosion.

7
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:38,184
Your Majesty!

8
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:40,813
No. You must not go.

9
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:43,553
Your Majesty!

10
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:45,884
- Your Majesty!
- Protect the King.

11
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,354
Your Majesty!

12
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:52,324
Your Highness. You must go.

13
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:54,494
- Your Majesty!
- Hurry.

14
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,904
No. We need to save him!

15
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:07,044
- Your Highness.
- You must not go.

16
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,443
Do not get involved in this.

17
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,783
What are you talking
about? The King is...

18
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,214
Listen to me!

19
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:16,313
I will give you the details later.

20
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:18,483
For now, you must save yourself.

21
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:20,483
- Your Majesty!
- It is dangerous,

22
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,024
so bring the Queen to
Daejojeon Hall right now.

23
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:26,394
- Your Highness. You must not go.
- Your Highness.

24
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:27,994
- Let go of me!
- Your Highness.

25
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,693
- Your Majesty.
- Your Highness.

26
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,464
Let go of me. Please.

27
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:33,804
Let go. Let go of me!

28
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:34,973
Let go!

29
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,003
Your Majesty!

30
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,043
However,

31
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,744
we do not realize it is a miracle...

32
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,344
until the day when
tomorrow does not come.

33
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:50,054
It is because we are foolish, and
we only realize what is precious...

34
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,684
after we lose it.

35
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:59,424
EPISODE 13, THERE IS NO TOMORROW

36
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:04,334
EPISODE 13

37
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:20,753
Someone dared to attempt to
assassinate the King in the Palace.

38
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,124
If there is anyone suspicious,
capture and question them all.

39
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,154
We will find out...

40
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:29,193
who is behind it.

41
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,323
Is this what you prepared?

42
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:37,334
How will you deal with the
aftermath to plan such a thing?

43
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:38,804
Please calm down.

44
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:41,133
Does it look like I could calm down?

45
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,904
The King's life was endangered
in front of everyone,

46
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,904
and it was in such a garish way.

47
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:50,813
So that they would assume that
I tried to assassinate him.

48
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:55,584
I will take care of it.

49
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:05,024
I beg of you. I beg of you.

50
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:09,494
I desperately beg the
deities of heaven and Earth.

51
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:14,733
Please make sure that the King is safe.

52
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:19,004
I beg of you. I beg of you.

53
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:21,574
I desperately beg of you.

54
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,413
Please make sure that...

55
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:30,723
the King is safe.

56
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,594
I had no idea they would go this far.

57
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:41,764
They enthroned the King themselves,

58
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:44,433
but they want to get rid of him
before he becomes a mistake.

59
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:50,103
What will happen if the King
does not wake up like this?

60
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,774
There is nothing we can do...

61
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:57,514
with the Royal Consort then.

62
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,884
I cannot believe that we got caught...

63
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,423
in the trap we set out for the Queen.

64
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,824
I beg of you. I beg of you.

65
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,123
I beg of you.

66
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:18,204
You should get some rest.

67
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,873
You will end up collapsing like this.

68
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:27,613
If the King does not survive,

69
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,944
I cannot live anyway.

70
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:36,014
Even if I die,

71
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:40,954
I will seek revenge against the one
who did that to the King and die.

72
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:43,723
The Palace...

73
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,394
and those people...

74
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:52,663
made us so spiteful.

75
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:29,973
Your Highness. The head of the
Department of Justice is here.

76
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,644
Is Cheoljong...

77
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,743
Is the King okay?

78
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,514
Prince Yeongpyeong has forbidden...

79
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,553
anyone from entering Huijeongjeon
Hall while he is getting treated.

80
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:47,283
They are not telling
anyone about his state.

81
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,254
I should go and see for myself.

82
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:50,493
Do not go.

83
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:55,793
They will let me in.

84
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,264
I am his wife after all.

85
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:26,123
Do not go.

86
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,964
He tried to kill you himself.

87
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:32,264
You have every right
to kill him yourself.

88
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:41,344
So Yong.

89
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,754
I need to get some rest alone.

90
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:53,044
Are you sure there will
not be any problems?

91
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,044
Of course.

92
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,444
Tell me who was behind this.

93
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,044
We are innocent.

94
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:29,554
We risk our lives to protect the King.

95
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,924
We are his royal guards.

96
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,294
What is your excuse for
your false identities?

97
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:43,393
While you used this as the
pretext to arrest and lock us up,

98
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:46,603
the King ended up like that.

99
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,503
If there is anyone behind this,

100
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,743
it would be the man who found fault
in our identities. Your father,

101
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:53,544
Kim Jwa Geun!

102
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,314
It is Kim Jwa Geun.

103
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:00,714
You're quite clever.

104
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:08,454
I found it.

105
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:17,704
As you said, the incense burner
was not filled with sand,

106
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,603
but gunpowder which is
used as an explosive.

107
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,373
How did you know?

108
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:31,113
What happened?

109
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:33,243
They are not admitting to it easily.

110
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:34,513
I am sure.

111
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,584
Is there anything else?

112
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:38,523
No, not yet.

113
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,353
You must find the culprits to
lay this confusion to rest.

114
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,653
Be sure to find out who is
behind it as soon as possible.

115
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:44,723
Of course.

116
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:52,304
Find the source of the gunpowder.

117
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,304
Move by yourself, quietly.

118
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:56,674
Yes, sir.

119
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:07,753
My Lord.

120
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,914
Please forgive me. Please.

121
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,753
What are you doing right now?
There are a lot of eyes here.

122
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:16,523
Please.

123
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,363
Please hear me out.

124
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:22,194
It will not take long. It
will take only a few seconds.

125
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,834
Please. It will take only a few seconds.

126
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,403
I just...

127
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,473
kept the ledger just in case.

128
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,174
I never thought about using
the ledger in any way.

129
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:41,113
On top of that, the Queen does not
even know that I have a ledger.

130
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:42,983
Where is the ledger now?

131
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,294
Do you not have it in your possession?

132
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,223
Then, the only person
who could have it...

133
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,493
is the King.

134
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,164
Oh, my.

135
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,344
The traces you left backfired
and put our clan in danger.

136
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,743
That itself is enough to punish you.

137
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:09,444
I will do anything you ask.

138
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,944
If you tell me to die, I will do so.

139
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,084
Right here.

140
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:23,424
I will hang myself here.

141
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,863
I will hang myself.

142
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:34,534
My gosh.

143
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:37,733
Please spare me. My lord.

144
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:42,113
Please spare me.

145
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,184
Your Majesty.

146
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,594
Your Majesty, are you awake?

147
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,893
Brother.

148
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,393
Yes. Go ahead.

149
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,503
Why is it so loud here?

150
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,503
It is so loud in here that
it is giving me a headache.

151
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:14,814
I cannot hear a thing.

152
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,944
Please silence the noise.

153
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:37,493
I should have explained it better.

154
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:42,174
I should have told him that the
King wasn't trying to kill me.

155
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:47,174
He tried to kill you himself.

156
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,873
You have every right
to kill him yourself.

157
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:56,853
Pay the price for your own recklessness.

158
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,883
Was the entire Kim clan behind this?

159
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:03,054
Or which clan was it?

160
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:06,464
Your Highness.

161
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:11,064
Your Highness. His Majesty has
regained consciousness now.

162
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,023
I heard he was awake.

163
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,424
He had just fallen asleep.

164
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,034
Why did you wrap the bandage like this?

165
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:55,444
He looks way too sick.

166
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:57,814
I apologize,

167
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:01,554
but he had lost his
hearing due to the bombing.

168
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,184
Don't tell me...

169
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:11,253
he will be deaf for
the rest of his life.

170
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:14,464
Only time can tell us.

171
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,214
Leave us alone.

172
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:33,784
Yes, Your Highness.

173
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:55,773
Will you tell me your clan
was not behind this again?

174
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:58,973
You told me that...

175
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:02,214
I would lose someone that
I hold dearly to my heart.

176
00:16:05,143 --> 00:16:06,643
Now, there is no one...

177
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,284
I hold dearly to my heart.

178
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:15,853
So please.

179
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:18,763
Stop this.

180
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:41,653
Your Majesty, please stop worrying now.

181
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,873
Who...

182
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:11,643
Your Majesty, are you awake?

183
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:14,613
Let me wet your lips.

184
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:27,863
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

185
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:58,024
So you went to see the King.

186
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:07,403
I came here today to comfort you
regarding today's incident...

187
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,103
and to ask a few questions.

188
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:14,943
Your father has lost
a very important item.

189
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:18,284
I believe the King
has secretly taken it.

190
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,883
Do you know anything about that?

191
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,484
- Oh, my. I'll get some help.
- No.

192
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,784
Nobody can know that I am...

193
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:31,024
That I am...

194
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:36,863
So you do know something about it.

195
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,903
Do you remember how I told you...

196
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:41,734
that our clan has no weaknesses?

197
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,974
Because once we spot a
weakness, we will carve it out.

198
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:57,084
Let me ask you one last time.

199
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,724
Is there anything you want to tell me?

200
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,893
When we stayed at my house,

201
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,133
I once saved the King,
passed out in the well.

202
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,663
Perhaps, that was when...

203
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:20,774
A while ago, I made an offer to you.

204
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:23,443
It was on the day when
you fell into the lake.

205
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,683
Let me jog your memory.

206
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:32,584
I asked you to keep an
eye on your husband.

207
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,094
Will you...

208
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:38,764
accept my offer now?

209
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:52,744
Then, what will I get in return?

210
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:54,844
What do you want?

211
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,484
Guarantee my safety.

212
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,403
Your Highness, you must get
back to the royal villa.

213
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:34,213
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

214
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:01,943
I CAME HERE FOR
NOTHING. JANG BONG HWAN

215
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,193
Cheoljong.

216
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:18,254
I'm sorry.

217
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,324
You're going to lose anyway.

218
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:25,433
I take sides with the winner.

219
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:36,413
Kim So Yong, you gave
up your life anyway.

220
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,014
I happened to continue
to live your life so,

221
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:42,984
let me live a good one by myself.

222
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,183
In order to do so, I
need to make it clear.

223
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:49,224
What happened that day.

224
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:52,153
I swear...

225
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,784
you will also lose someone dear to you.

226
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:58,123
You should love me.

227
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,163
Is that an order?

228
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:07,903
There is nothing that is not a lie.

229
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:11,334
You are certainly So Yong.

230
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,784
Did you rise to your position
on your own, Destined Highness?

231
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,853
If you want to die, die in the palace.

232
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,923
You will become the Queen tomorrow.

233
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,403
You will become the Queen tomorrow.

234
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:41,603
From now on,

235
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:45,844
tell me his every movement.

236
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,344
Are you telling me...

237
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:51,244
to spy on the King?

238
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:54,514
It is not to spy on the King. It
is to keep an eye on your husband.

239
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:00,324
I do not want to do it.

240
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:05,893
Is what you want not the
position of the Queen...

241
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,764
and the King?

242
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:11,933
You should do that in
order to have both.

243
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:16,804
It is what you did in the past.

244
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:25,113
Just as you let me know the
King was trapped in the well.

245
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:33,584
If you do not do your part,

246
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:37,224
the King is useless.
When you are useless,

247
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,923
you are abandoned.

248
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:42,963
If you harm His Majesty,

249
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:45,403
I will not stay still.

250
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,663
What are you going to do then?

251
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:50,403
You are badly mistaken.

252
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:54,373
Do you think the Queen holds such power?

253
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:58,044
The Queen is nothing
but the best field...

254
00:24:58,044 --> 00:25:00,413
that produces princes.

255
00:25:02,113 --> 00:25:04,413
Even if you become the Queen,

256
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:06,254
what power do you think you will have...

257
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:10,123
as a mere woman?

258
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:57,534
It's not just because of
what Kim Jwa Geun said.

259
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,774
By staying in the palace for
this short period of time,

260
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:05,683
I've gone through enough
to see my reality.

261
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,883
The entire palace...

262
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,754
killed Kim So Yong.

263
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,027
Your Highness.

264
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,067
Your Highness.

265
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:31,597
Your Highness.

266
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,637
Your Highness, Your Highness!

267
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,577
Your Highness, where did you
go at this late at night?

268
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:46,916
Why are you so wet?

269
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:51,416
Did you perhaps dive
into the lake again?

270
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:55,656
Why do you keep doing this?

271
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:58,897
You should gather yourself
up in a time like this.

272
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:02,597
What is the point of me doing
all sorts of things so far?

273
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:07,367
Why did I go through those
humiliating experiences for?

274
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,236
What did you do that for?

275
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:12,607
You did it in order to accumulate
property to fill your storehouse.

276
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:16,516
You sold your only daughter
to satisfy your greed.

277
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:19,416
- So Yong.
- Why did you always tell me...

278
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,716
to become the Queen and the
pride of the family and you?

279
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:25,117
Why did you tell me that I can do
anything if I become the Queen?

280
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:28,996
To me who was struggling with the
guilt about my mother's death,

281
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:31,996
why did you keep saying your dream?

282
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:37,097
Do you know what I was thinking
when I threw myself into the lake?

283
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:40,736
"The life that I thought
was mine was all lie."

284
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:44,577
"Even the dream I had was not mine."

285
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,807
"I failed at everything."

286
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:52,686
That is why I threw myself away.

287
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:55,956
What?

288
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,156
The day when your dream came true,

289
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,956
I lost the person I cherish the most.

290
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,966
Myself.

291
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:10,597
It is you who pushed me into the lake.

292
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:38,196
Parents are the most convenient
people to blame for children.

293
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,226
I shouldn't have blamed Father.

294
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:56,716
Your Highness.

295
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:08,127
I have something to say.

296
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,466
I know you would do anything for me.

297
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:16,037
No. I got to know.

298
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,537
Because my memories are back.

299
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:26,676
Do not do anything from now on.

300
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:30,746
If you care for me, do not do anything.

301
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,347
That is what helps me.

302
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:36,287
So Yong.

303
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,726
Do not call my name.

304
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:42,196
I am just...

305
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:45,627
the Queen head of the
Department of Justice serves.

306
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:02,746
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

307
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,656
ISSUE, LOTTO, SPECIAL FORCES,
KITCHEN POLICE, MS. BIG BELLY

308
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:18,127
NO TOUCHING.

309
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:29,277
MEANS TO SEEK ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS

310
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,377
SHOWDOWN, JASMINE TEA, ILL-MANNERED

311
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:54,097
I'll be honest since
you can't hear me now.

312
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:58,666
I have to be a coward
to live a long life.

313
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:04,377
I will betray you.

314
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:08,377
I decided to choose a path
that will keep me safe.

315
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:12,147
So you shouldn't die either.

316
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:14,916
Shake it off and get up
like nothing happened.

317
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,387
So I can stab you in the back.

318
00:31:58,527 --> 00:31:59,897
You were right.

319
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:03,097
The King was more
capable than he let on.

320
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:05,397
I am sorry about that.

321
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:07,936
What do you think
about today's incident?

322
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:10,906
We found gunpowder from the scene.

323
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,706
- "Gunpowder"?
- Yes.

324
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:15,347
There are two types of
gunpowders in Joseon.

325
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:17,577
The imported type from the Qing Empire.

326
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,216
And the domestic type
from a gunpowder house.

327
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:22,516
There is a small difference
between both of these elements.

328
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:26,127
The one we found on the
scene was the domestic type.

329
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,357
The gunpowder house
belongs to the armory.

330
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:33,466
And the Minister of War
supervises the armory.

331
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,166
He is my father's right-hand man.

332
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:39,466
That means...

333
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:47,547
My father was the one who
put the King on the throne.

334
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:49,976
Now that the King has
shown his true colors,

335
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:51,946
he must want to eliminate the King
before it becomes his mistake...

336
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:53,087
and frame the royal guards...

337
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,746
who faked their identities
for the bombing.

338
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:56,817
That must be his plan.

339
00:32:56,817 --> 00:33:00,226
When you came to me last time,
you must have wanted something.

340
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:03,726
What is it that you want?

341
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:06,097
I want...

342
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:10,766
the King.

343
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,647
I cannot stop here.

344
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,817
And if that is how you feel,

345
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:27,286
that is all the more reason not to.

346
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:52,237
I came here today to tell you
what the Queen did yesterday.

347
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:57,116
She saved the banquet when it
was set up to be a failure.

348
00:33:57,817 --> 00:34:00,416
Do you think I will believe you?

349
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,056
You must think...

350
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:05,186
I am the one behind the
incident that injured the King.

351
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:07,257
If you look into it, you
will easily have your answer.

352
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:11,127
Just how I found out you
tried to ruin the banquet.

353
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:13,527
Even if the Queen gets deposed...

354
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:15,467
I do not want some title.

355
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:20,007
I just want the Queen to
disappear from the King's sight.

356
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:22,607
That means...

357
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,277
the King fancies the Queen.

358
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:41,487
From the looks of it, it seems you
have had a tough couple of days.

359
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,817
Are you that worried about the King?

360
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:47,357
Gosh.

361
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:50,226
He has become your
son-in-law only recently.

362
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:52,467
You must have grown quite
some attachment to him.

363
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,726
Well,

364
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,237
the truth is...

365
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:01,266
I have done a terrible thing
that disgraced our clan.

366
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:05,476
I kept a record of the assets
our clan acquired improperly.

367
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:08,647
And I have lost it.

368
00:36:09,277 --> 00:36:10,346
What?

369
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:12,147
I figured out where the ledger is now.

370
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:14,717
I just need to find
it and get rid of it.

371
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:18,616
But I ask that you spare the Queen.

372
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,286
What are you bringing her up?

373
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:23,627
The person who has the ledger...

374
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,496
is the King.

375
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:31,337
The Queen has nothing to
do with this incident.

376
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:35,067
The King has deceived the Queen and me.

377
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:40,547
Everyone has been deceived by the King.

378
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:44,016
I will accept any
punishment you give me.

379
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,186
But...

380
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:49,657
show mercy for So Yong.

381
00:36:51,116 --> 00:36:53,027
Please spare the Queen.

382
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,996
I beg of you to spare the Queen. Please.

383
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,127
Father.

384
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:09,536
Have you been sleeping at
the Department of Justice?

385
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:13,147
Yes. It is a huge case.
I have had a lot of work.

386
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:17,447
Everything about this case
points toward me as the culprit.

387
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:20,246
But you have not brought it up.

388
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,317
Do not worry.

389
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,556
The Department of Justice
is investigating now.

390
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:27,226
If you are framed,

391
00:37:27,587 --> 00:37:29,996
I will reveal the real
culprit behind the incident.

392
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:32,027
That reassures me.

393
00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:35,166
A while ago,

394
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:39,206
you told me that you have decided
on the magnitude of your dream.

395
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,007
So how big is your dream?

396
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:46,877
My dream is...

397
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:50,947
to be as half-successful as you.

398
00:37:57,386 --> 00:37:59,587
It is getting late. Get some rest.

399
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:23,976
Do not come.

400
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,047
If you follow me, I will kill myself.

401
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:31,686
So Yong.

402
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:48,467
I know the driving force behind you.

403
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:20,067
My gosh. Where is the
Queen this morning?

404
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:21,837
She is in the royal kitchen.

405
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:23,436
Right now.

406
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:25,607
That is all right.

407
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:29,206
I was going to make her cook
breakfast for me when she woke up.

408
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:32,217
But she is already cooking
for her grandmother. Goodness.

409
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:54,706
You startled me.

410
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,677
It is quite early. May I
ask what you are doing?

411
00:39:57,907 --> 00:40:00,507
I'm so depressed lately. I
can't seem to sleep either.

412
00:40:00,677 --> 00:40:02,647
Like I'm wishing my morning prayer,

413
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,277
I'm making a very annoying dish...

414
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,616
that requires me to grind
and stir billions of times.

415
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:10,116
But the color of the rice
porridge looks a bit off.

416
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,927
This isn't a rice porridge
It's called "potage crecy".

417
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,857
Are you trying to spit?
It is too early for that.

418
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:17,157
It means carrot porridge.

419
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:20,226
Hold on. I should write this down.

420
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:22,936
How do you make it?

421
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:27,266
Cut up carrots and onions and
boil them in water for an hour.

422
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:28,936
Then you grind it up in a millstone.

423
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,237
As if you're grinding up all
your trials and delusions.

424
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:35,476
Then stir it over low heat so that
it doesn't burn or clump together.

425
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,147
With the heart of one who is
cultivating themselves morally.

426
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:40,116
Season it with salt,

427
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:43,987
and add a bit of milk.

428
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:45,416
You even add milk?

429
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:47,027
Is that how you finish it?

430
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:48,326
No.

431
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:52,826
You need to make a broth out of
various vegetables in advance.

432
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:54,596
Take that broth...

433
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:58,536
and add a bit of it to the
porridge to give it a richer taste.

434
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,166
Must you go through all that
trouble just to add a bit of it?

435
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,107
I told you. This is like
an early morning prayer.

436
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:09,147
You are pouring your
heart and soul into it.

437
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:12,746
I am sure that the King will
wake up soon after eating this.

438
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,886
It's not for him.

439
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:20,886
Rather than suffering at their
hands twice, I'll finish it at once.

440
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:23,697
Just because I said
something to her last time,

441
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:27,366
she is making me eat
with my mother-in-law?

442
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:32,096
She dared to use that capricious
mouth to say I am old,

443
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,266
but I need to see her
first thing in the morning?

444
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:42,277
What is this?

445
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:43,846
It is called brunch.

446
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,817
"Brunch"?

447
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:48,147
It means "Women coming together".

448
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:50,556
It is when women get
together for breakfast...

449
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:52,657
and get close to one another.

450
00:41:52,956 --> 00:41:55,757
Everyone knows what brunch is.

451
00:41:55,757 --> 00:41:57,527
It is not like you are from Gojoseon.

452
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:58,697
That wench.

453
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:02,797
It is something I used to
do on occasion back at home.

454
00:42:03,197 --> 00:42:04,467
It has been a while.

455
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:06,636
That wench.

456
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:11,576
It is a porridge made from carrots.

457
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:14,377
It has a lot of ingredients that
help to improve your vision.

458
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:15,447
Is that so?

459
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,817
You should have a lot
of it, Queen Dowager.

460
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:20,186
It seems like you are blind these days.

461
00:42:20,186 --> 00:42:24,217
If that is the case, I believe that
the Queen should have all of it.

462
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,087
What is this? Why are they so combative?

463
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,897
It tastes good.

464
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,737
It is edible.

465
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,706
From now on,

466
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:50,246
I will ensure that we get
together like this more often.

467
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:52,416
- That wench.
- That wench.

468
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:54,487
Then let me excuse myself...

469
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,286
to bring you some beverages.

470
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:11,536
The rumors about the Queen's cooking
skills are a bit exaggerated.

471
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:14,936
Being able to recognize good
food is a part of being classy.

472
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:20,107
Are you forgiving the Queen
just because of this talent?

473
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:23,016
Since you are the source who
told me what the Queen said,

474
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:25,277
I cannot believe it.

475
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:30,757
I am sure you will not be able to
believe what I am about to tell you.

476
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:33,726
I heard that the King and the Queen...

477
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:37,226
have been sending each other
messages every night in secret.

478
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:41,096
I wonder what they are
writing to one another?

479
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:45,866
I will bring in your beverages.

480
00:43:54,777 --> 00:43:56,516
It is a beverage made with wild
grape liquor and various fruits...

481
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:59,686
that are boiled with
star anise and cinnamon.

482
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:02,386
Are you giving us liquor in the morning?

483
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:04,016
All the alcohol has been evaporated,

484
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,857
and all that remains are ingredients
that help maintain your youth.

485
00:44:07,456 --> 00:44:11,027
This is closer to medicine
than it is a beverage.

486
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:21,136
I cannot believe you thought
of boiling wild grape liquor.

487
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:24,507
How did you come up with this idea?

488
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:29,076
Where do you get the
inspiration for your dishes?

489
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:33,386
I do not know if we should call
it inspiration or creation.

490
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:36,456
When I see ingredients, I
automatically think of ways...

491
00:44:36,456 --> 00:44:38,016
to cook it to maintain
its original taste.

492
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:40,886
They were very wary of
the West during this time,

493
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,657
so I can't tell them
it's French cooking.

494
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:49,936
My Lady.

495
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:57,436
Hello, Young Master.

496
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:01,746
I have something to say to
you, so I waited all this time.

497
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:04,746
Pardon? What is it you need to tell me?

498
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,016
After seeing His Majesty's accident,

499
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,547
I have been filled with
complicated thoughts.

500
00:45:11,157 --> 00:45:13,326
You cannot predict what
will happen in life,

501
00:45:13,886 --> 00:45:16,757
and my life may end tomorrow.

502
00:45:16,956 --> 00:45:20,127
If my life ends tomorrow,

503
00:45:21,366 --> 00:45:23,636
what will I regret the most?

504
00:45:23,897 --> 00:45:27,136
That would be my feelings
I could not express...

505
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:29,166
because I hesitated.

506
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:30,877
Rather than a fancy confession,

507
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:33,507
one word of sincerity is more important.

508
00:45:35,706 --> 00:45:36,877
That is why...

509
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:41,317
I want to tell you...

510
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:43,757
that I love you.

511
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:55,067
I do not like you.

512
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:56,536
What?

513
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:58,797
About the gunpowder.

514
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:01,507
The amount of gunpowder being
produced at the manufactory...

515
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:02,766
in the southern area of
Gyeongsang Province...

516
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,737
and the amount that is coming
into the armory is different.

517
00:46:07,177 --> 00:46:08,476
I knew it.

518
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:15,947
Is the King still unconscious?

519
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:17,556
Yes.

520
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:21,326
I heard he lost his hearing. Even if
he wakes up, that will be a problem.

521
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:27,127
About the accident
that the King suffered.

522
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:29,837
For an explosion of that size,

523
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,837
do you think it was perhaps gunpowder?

524
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:34,837
I am not sure.

525
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:38,936
It could have been
sulfur or explosive gas.

526
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:41,576
If it was sulfur, it would have smelled,

527
00:46:41,576 --> 00:46:43,516
so the King would have noticed it.

528
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:45,616
It if was gas, it
would have been hard...

529
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:48,186
to prevent it from leaking and
getting it to explode all at once.

530
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:50,956
The culprits refuse to confess
despite being questioned,

531
00:46:50,956 --> 00:46:52,487
so it is hard to figure
out who is behind this.

532
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,726
When I see ingredients, I
automatically think of ways...

533
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:28,556
to cook it to maintain
its original taste.

534
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:33,226
No way.

535
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,826
Did the culprits that
are guilty of treason...

536
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,897
reveal who was behind this?

537
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:41,967
It seems like the low-ranking
guards who have a problem with...

538
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,936
the current Royal Court
came together to do this.

539
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:45,076
Goodness.

540
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:48,976
Are you saying that there
is nobody behind them?

541
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:52,416
For something as big as the
assassination of the King?

542
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,786
There is no way.

543
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:57,487
Those who have nothing to lose
are the ones we must fear.

544
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,717
They probably thought they would
never get to receive respect,

545
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:01,987
so they decided to turn
the tables in a big way.

546
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:03,697
That is probably why they did that.

547
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:07,797
It makes sense. The act
of treason to enthrone...

548
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:10,897
the King's half-brother, Lee Won Gyeong,

549
00:48:10,897 --> 00:48:13,366
was also committed by
low-ranking guards.

550
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:16,206
Since the King is unconscious,

551
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:18,737
the longer we drag this out, the
more confusion it will bring.

552
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:19,976
That is why...

553
00:48:20,346 --> 00:48:23,246
the seven culprits will take
responsibility for their crimes,

554
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:28,116
and they will be sentenced to death.

555
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,726
For the crime of endangering the
King's life and plotting treason,

556
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:42,967
you will all be sentenced to death.

557
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,536
Do you have any last words?

558
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:53,976
If you sentence them to death,

559
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:57,377
the person behind this
will be hidden forever.

560
00:48:57,877 --> 00:49:00,087
He said that nobody is behind this.

561
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:02,246
It is a rash conclusion...

562
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:05,657
This conclusion was achieved after
investigating through the night.

563
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:09,257
My gosh.

564
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:05,913
Behead him.

565
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:08,842
Hold on.

566
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,652
It is the investigation
conducted by the royal command.

567
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:20,922
Are you going to interrupt it?

568
00:50:21,123 --> 00:50:23,393
Release the innocent immediately.

569
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:27,033
This is the real command.

570
00:50:37,842 --> 00:50:38,973
I apologize for coming in late.

571
00:50:39,672 --> 00:50:40,712
You...

572
00:50:43,783 --> 00:50:47,982
I heard you were sick in bed.

573
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:50,993
I am at a young age full of energy,

574
00:50:51,353 --> 00:50:52,993
so I recovered quickly.

575
00:50:57,232 --> 00:50:59,493
I did not want to waste my time...

576
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:01,533
recovering in bed.

577
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:03,132
So I investigated those...

578
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:05,833
who plotted treason with the
intention of assassinating me.

579
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:10,072
I investigated you first.

580
00:51:10,643 --> 00:51:14,643
Do you mean you inspected us?

581
00:51:15,212 --> 00:51:17,283
Someone attempted treason.

582
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:20,322
Are you saying your privacy
is more important...

583
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:25,453
than the King's life?

584
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:28,493
No, that is not...

585
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:33,163
If you have nothing to hide,
there is nothing to fear.

586
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,333
Do not worry.

587
00:51:39,502 --> 00:51:41,703
I found the mastermind.

588
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:44,572
- What is he talking about?
- What is going on?

589
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:52,513
In the incense burner
used at the Dano ceremony,

590
00:51:53,112 --> 00:51:55,552
a great amount of domestically
produced gunpowder was found.

591
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:58,393
- Gunpowder?
- Gunpowder?

592
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:02,322
A great amount?

593
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:10,632
The incense burner is a huge bomb.

594
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:13,672
- It is too dangerous.
- And it is certain.

595
00:52:14,103 --> 00:52:16,043
Tracking down the
origin of the gunpowder,

596
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:18,313
I obtained the information...

597
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:21,882
that gunpowder is privately
traded at Dongnae Dock.

598
00:52:28,052 --> 00:52:31,252
By the way, what do you need
this much gunpowder for?

599
00:52:31,453 --> 00:52:35,223
It is for attacking Joseon again later.

600
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,132
Thank you.

601
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:42,732
- "Thank you"?
- Thank you.

602
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,732
- "Thank you"?
- Thank you.

603
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:49,873
"Thank you"?

604
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:53,212
Where is the gunpowder from?

605
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:55,413
Gunpowder is produced for
the military purposes only.

606
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:58,183
It is not and cannot be
produced for personal purpose.

607
00:52:58,552 --> 00:53:00,683
As it is dangerous and rare.

608
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:06,293
So I inspected all the
powder mills in Joseon.

609
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:08,723
And I found something strange.

610
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,862
In a powder mill in a certain region,

611
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:14,462
I found that certain
amount of gunpowder...

612
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:17,232
had been pocketed regularly.

613
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,643
The amount of gunpowder pocketed...

614
00:53:21,643 --> 00:53:25,413
that was little at first
gradually increased.

615
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:26,842
Just like...

616
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,043
how dark greed grows.

617
00:53:31,353 --> 00:53:33,283
- What?
- Is that true?

618
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:37,252
Do you know when the embezzlement
of gunpowder started?

619
00:53:38,022 --> 00:53:39,552
Training Commander Kim Jwa Geun.

620
00:53:44,563 --> 00:53:48,232
The very year I ascended to the throne.

621
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:54,103
It is also the year Lord Kim Jwa
Geun became Training Commander.

622
00:53:55,703 --> 00:53:58,043
Your Majesty, it is a false accusation.

623
00:53:58,043 --> 00:53:59,442
Keep your mouth shut!

624
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:03,013
Minister of War, in
charge of powder mills,

625
00:54:03,013 --> 00:54:06,453
is also a traitor who plotted
treason with Kim Jwa Geun!

626
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,052
I am going to use royal guards'
fake identities as bait.

627
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:14,092
Kim Jwa Geun must have heard
about the identity fabrication.

628
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:21,933
You will go through unbearable tortures.

629
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,632
But please endure it.

630
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:27,143
I will save you no matter what it takes.

631
00:54:32,643 --> 00:54:37,252
Please understand it is a
false charge, Your Majesty!

632
00:54:40,953 --> 00:54:43,583
If you say you are falsely
accused in front of me again,

633
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:47,422
I will administer poison
to you immediately.

634
00:54:51,962 --> 00:54:53,962
The gunpowder seller sold gunpowder...

635
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:56,033
to anyone who paid the price.

636
00:54:56,232 --> 00:54:58,973
To bandits, even to Japanese!

637
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:02,243
If it is not to destroy Joseon, what is?

638
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:06,112
Who else here joined them?

639
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:19,252
Training Commander Kim Jwa Geun.

640
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:22,092
And Minister of War Kim Chang Hyup.

641
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:24,692
These two culprits...

642
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:29,063
stole national weapons to
weakened military strength...

643
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:33,772
and planned treason to
assassinate me, the King,

644
00:55:36,502 --> 00:55:37,913
hence, they are culprits
who committed high treason.

645
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:41,882
How should we name the operation?

646
00:55:43,982 --> 00:55:44,982
Phoenix.

647
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:49,283
The name of the operation...

648
00:55:50,422 --> 00:55:52,422
is Phoenix, burning red.

649
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,333
For all these crimes,

650
00:56:00,933 --> 00:56:03,002
the two culprit will be
dismissed from the office...

651
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:06,002
and exiled.

652
00:56:07,973 --> 00:56:09,043
Your Majesty.

653
00:56:13,272 --> 00:56:16,112
- Grand Queen Dowager.
- Grand Queen Dowager.

654
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,513
What are you doing?

655
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:20,723
Why are you making a judgment
based on your emotions?

656
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:23,822
You must have lost your
judgment after the accident.

657
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,052
Do not forget your limit!

658
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:28,922
Is that so?

659
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:32,362
If you are saying so,

660
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:44,313
you must lost your judgement
because of old age.

661
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,552
I can no longer discuss politics
with you in such a state.

662
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:54,922
I request to end your regency.

663
00:56:57,052 --> 00:56:58,393
- What?
- What is he talking about?

664
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:04,862
It is time for me to make my own
decisions for national affairs.

665
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:06,592
Your Majesty!

666
00:57:06,592 --> 00:57:09,703
I should immediately administer
poison to culprit Kim Jwa Geun...

667
00:57:09,703 --> 00:57:11,502
and kill his entire
family and relatives.

668
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:14,272
But because of you and the Queen,

669
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:17,313
I am trying to end this by
dismissing him from his title.

670
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:19,842
Do you not like it?

671
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:24,752
Are you trying to make a deal
with me with my brother's life?

672
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:28,623
You can say it is a deal only
when you have other choices.

673
00:57:32,322 --> 00:57:33,393
Your Majesty.

674
00:57:35,962 --> 00:57:39,092
I, Kim Jwa Geun, is in agony
due to the false accusation,

675
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,732
but I will prove my loyalty...

676
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:43,132
by obeying the royal command.

677
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:44,933
That is a relief.

678
00:57:45,572 --> 00:57:48,772
I worried you might be consumed
by greed due to old age.

679
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:50,842
I do not regret withdrawing
from the office.

680
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:53,342
But please provide me with an
opportunity to be cleared...

681
00:57:53,342 --> 00:57:55,813
from the charge to resign my post
without my reputation tarnished.

682
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:58,612
I request for impeachment to Saheonbu.

683
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:01,083
I will grant the request.

684
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:06,022
But if Saheonbu does not carry
out impeachment by tomorrow,

685
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:09,993
I will immediately remove Training
Commander Kim Jwa Geun from office.

686
00:58:10,563 --> 00:58:13,333
And I will dismiss not only Saheonbu
that avoided the discussion,

687
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:16,732
but also every official here!

688
00:58:17,402 --> 00:58:21,902
- Please forgive me.
- Please forgive me.

689
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,322
You have lost.

690
00:58:40,723 --> 00:58:43,692
You were removed by the King
you gave the throne by yourself!

691
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:47,192
I did not know the King had
plotted his own assassination.

692
00:58:47,802 --> 00:58:50,732
Who did you think set the trap?

693
00:58:52,272 --> 00:58:54,743
I trusted you to take care of the
noblewomen outside the palace.

694
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,572
But you do not have an eye for people.

695
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:03,712
Confucius said one's heart is
more complicated than nature...

696
00:59:03,813 --> 00:59:06,652
and seeing through one's heart is
harder than seeing through the sky.

697
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:08,583
I made mistakes about
the selection of women...

698
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,723
with noble titles both within
and outside the palace.

699
00:59:11,893 --> 00:59:14,763
You also trusted the Queen...

700
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:17,163
to take care of the investiture
of the Royal Concubine.

701
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,433
But she made a choice
that favors the King.

702
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:22,933
And it is the Queen...

703
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:24,402
who saved the feast I ruined.

704
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:29,342
What is scarier is the internal enemy.

705
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:43,123
Your Highness.

706
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:53,092
His Majesty must have
regained consciousness.

707
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:59,103
I can keep an eye on my husband
only after he regains consciousness.

708
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:02,942
If he doesn't wake up,
I'll become useless.

709
01:00:03,502 --> 01:00:06,272
If I become useless, I'll be dethroned.

710
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:08,783
If I'm dethroned, I will have
to forget about the revenge...

711
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:11,252
and will open a gukbap place to
make a living and make a hit.

712
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,583
That's not bad.

713
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:16,052
Your Highness!

714
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:20,322
His Majesty...

715
01:00:23,522 --> 01:00:25,263
He regained consciousness.

716
01:00:25,862 --> 01:00:27,033
Really?

717
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:29,333
Yes. His ears are recovered...

718
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,473
and went to the royal conference.

719
01:00:31,473 --> 01:00:33,672
I was scared.

720
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:35,603
I should go.

721
01:00:37,543 --> 01:00:38,842
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

722
01:00:40,942 --> 01:00:42,212
I don't have time.

723
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:48,783
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

724
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:51,652
I'm relieved.

725
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,462
I'm so relieved.

726
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:03,802
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

727
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:05,802
It is a relief.

728
01:01:05,802 --> 01:01:07,603
Court Lady Choi.

729
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,942
- I will do it.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

730
01:01:19,982 --> 01:01:21,152
Your Majesty.

731
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:27,822
Everything is fine now.

732
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:31,793
Everything is fine as you
woke up and are healthy.

733
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:37,572
I will never lose you again.

734
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:40,572
Royal Noble Consort Eui.

735
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:45,013
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

736
01:01:52,252 --> 01:01:53,353
Your Highness.

737
01:01:53,353 --> 01:01:56,422
You said you will visit His
Majesty. Why are you staying here?

738
01:01:56,982 --> 01:01:58,223
Just one more glass.

739
01:01:58,692 --> 01:02:01,922
It's awkward to see him when I'm sober.

740
01:02:03,022 --> 01:02:07,033
Please stop drinking. You
cannot do this, Your Highness.

741
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:09,663
Get off work, Court Lady Choi. Go home!

742
01:02:13,072 --> 01:02:15,373
I will drink it up.

743
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,942
Court Lady Choi.

744
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:21,283
Court Lady Choi.

745
01:02:25,652 --> 01:02:28,152
We have plenty of alcohol
in the royal kitchen.

746
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,152
Why is it awkward?

747
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:37,592
It's awkward because...

748
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:42,933
You're right. Why would it be awkward?

749
01:02:44,132 --> 01:02:46,402
I'm confident! Let's visit the King.

750
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:48,842
You cannot go with this state.

751
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:50,502
Please go when you are sober.

752
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:52,873
Okay. Let's go tomorrow.

753
01:02:53,212 --> 01:02:54,442
Put off what you don't
want to do until tomorrow.

754
01:02:54,442 --> 01:02:55,643
Just like going on a diet.

755
01:02:55,882 --> 01:02:57,813
We have tomorrow!

756
01:02:58,353 --> 01:03:00,652
Hey, Royal Chef. One more bottle.

757
01:03:01,552 --> 01:03:03,922
Does she think this is
a tavern or something?

758
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:06,793
Quickly.

759
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:45,092
Court Lady Jang.

760
01:03:48,732 --> 01:03:50,902
CONFIDENTIAL

761
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:52,002
Your Highness!

762
01:03:56,502 --> 01:03:57,543
Your Highness.

763
01:04:17,763 --> 01:04:20,232
It is found at Daejojeon Hall.

764
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:23,362
As expected, the King and the Queen
work together for a common end.

765
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:26,373
The Queen is completely broken.

766
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:30,873
You should replace the
broken item with the new one.

767
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:36,212
But you can make the broken one
serve the purpose until the end...

768
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:39,913
and use it as kindling.

769
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:44,353
Should we use real arsenic this time?

770
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,362
The Queen likes food so much.

771
01:04:54,962 --> 01:04:57,462
So let us serve her valuable food.

772
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:01,342
Are you going to let the King be?

773
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:05,513
We should break him to use him
while keeping him on the seat.

774
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:08,583
If it goes wrong as soon as he
offers his heart to the Queen,

775
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,543
he will realize it in misery.

776
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:13,683
That everyone on his side
will become miserable.

777
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,563
How miraculous it is...

778
01:06:04,232 --> 01:06:06,502
that tomorrow comes every day?

779
01:06:13,913 --> 01:06:16,143
Let's go for round two
at Seonjeongjeon Hall.

780
01:06:16,512 --> 01:06:19,982
We should throw a party
for His Majesty's recovery.

781
01:06:19,982 --> 01:06:22,783
Please lower your voice, Your Highness.

782
01:06:22,783 --> 01:06:24,423
Your Majesty!

783
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:26,652
Your Majesty!

784
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:29,722
You cannot call him like that.

785
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:32,663
Open it.

786
01:06:36,362 --> 01:06:37,562
Open it.

787
01:06:44,343 --> 01:06:47,272
YONG SU POTATO

788
01:06:51,482 --> 01:06:55,283
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

789
01:07:15,843 --> 01:07:17,812
I fell asleep without realizing it.

790
01:07:24,043 --> 01:07:26,453
Have you been watching me?

791
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:30,923
Why do you always do that?

792
01:07:32,123 --> 01:07:36,123
Worrying about me,
trying to understand me.

793
01:07:38,033 --> 01:07:41,862
Come to think of it, you're the
first person I saw when I came here.

794
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:48,772
There are so many things I owe you.

795
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:52,942
I kept thinking of you when
I tried to leave this place.

796
01:07:54,543 --> 01:07:56,682
Because I will never see you again.

797
01:08:36,352 --> 01:08:38,222
Hong Yeon.

798
01:09:00,213 --> 01:09:01,642
Are you up?

799
01:09:10,822 --> 01:09:15,663
MR. QUEEN

800
01:09:30,972 --> 01:09:33,142
<i>I'm certain that this woman's
soul took over my body.</i>

801
01:09:33,142 --> 01:09:35,142
<i>Why are you avoiding me so much?</i>

802
01:09:35,142 --> 01:09:37,213
<i>- Hold on.
- What does he want to ask me?</i>

803
01:09:37,213 --> 01:09:38,253
<i>Did you like it?</i>

804
01:09:38,253 --> 01:09:40,152
<i>I told you it was forbidden, didn't I?</i>

805
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:42,222
<i>I told you that hugging me, smiling
at me, and laying next to me...</i>

806
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:43,883
<i>was all forbidden.</i>

807
01:09:44,253 --> 01:09:46,022
<i>I forbid you from
saying it is forbidden.</i>

808
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:47,753
<i>I have prepared the objects.</i>

809
01:09:47,753 --> 01:09:48,862
<i>What do you see?</i>

810
01:09:48,862 --> 01:09:51,262
<i>Someone will die in the Palace today.</i>

811
01:09:51,262 --> 01:09:52,732
<i>I cannot believe they tried
to get rid of the Queen.</i>

812
01:09:52,732 --> 01:09:57,262
