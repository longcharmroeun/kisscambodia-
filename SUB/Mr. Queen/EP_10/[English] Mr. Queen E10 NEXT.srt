1
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:08,492
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:10,761
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:27,882
Hwa Jin.

4
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:29,781
Hwa Jin.

5
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,032
What are you doing down there?

6
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,701
- Oh, my. I'll get some help.
- No.

7
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,441
Nobody can know that I am...

8
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:54,771
That I am...

9
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,182
Hey.

10
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:04,282
EPISODE 10

11
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:08,491
Why would you go into a
place with such bad memories?

12
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,862
Is it okay for me
to not call anyone?

13
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,291
What if he ends up dying?

14
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,461
Are you having
another nightmare?

15
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,032
Hey. Wake up.

16
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:28,342
Hwa Jin.

17
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,911
Fine. Whatever
you want to think.

18
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,392
This won't do. I'll
go get someone.

19
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,032
You're doing this again.

20
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,832
I had a nightmare...

21
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,232
that I died as an
incompetent king.

22
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:57,071
A scary nightmare where...

23
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:01,872
I could not do anything and
died as I was watching...

24
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,911
the world falls apart.

25
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,822
Nobody asked.

26
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:15,651
Let us stay like
this for a moment.

27
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,021
Just for a moment.

28
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:30,271
I'll pretend to be Jo Hwa
Jin for just one minute.

29
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,952
EPISODE 10, LIVING A NIGHTMARE

30
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,521
You have finally
become the Queen.

31
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,121
I knew this would happen.

32
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,551
CONFIDENTIAL

33
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:57,662
I will tell His
Majesty everything.

34
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,262
I will not be swayed
by the past any longer.

35
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,832
Your Highness.

36
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,241
I need to speak to His Majesty.

37
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:16,711
The King has gone
out with the Queen,

38
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,012
and Lord Kim is not home either.

39
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,002
O Wol.

40
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:15,302
I can help the King and
ruin the Queen as well.

41
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:17,802
What should I do?

42
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:04,021
Your Highness.

43
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,591
It is time to wash your face.

44
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:01,711
Good morning.

45
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:07,312
- What happened?
- Good question.

46
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:10,281
I almost touched you...
I mean, I almost died.

47
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,452
You were so heavy.

48
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:16,622
That was dangerous.

49
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,031
The ledger was not in there.

50
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,132
Did you save me...

51
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:25,702
by yourself?

52
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,132
You didn't want
anyone to find out.

53
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,242
I used up all the
strength that I had.

54
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,752
I can do it. Remember the days
when I used to lift 150kg.

55
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,351
Your strength doesn't
come from your muscles.

56
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:48,952
It comes from your
determination.

57
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,062
Why did you go into
the well at that hour?

58
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:04,901
It was dark, so I did not
see the well, and I fell in.

59
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,041
Do you have night blindness?

60
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,841
It's hard to climb
out of a well.

61
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,151
Are you awake?

62
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,512
Hold on.

63
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:21,291
Come over here. Hurry.

64
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:23,622
Wait just a moment.

65
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,961
Yes. Come in.

66
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,741
If I had known you would
stay in the main house,

67
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:48,582
I would have prepared
bigger bedding.

68
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:52,422
Father, no! Please no!

69
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:55,251
Father! You cannot do it!

70
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,721
No! Father!

71
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,991
Father!

72
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,621
I apologize.

73
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,491
There is no need.

74
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:05,062
Because of your efforts,

75
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:06,601
I was comfortable here.

76
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:10,631
I should not bother you anymore,
so I will return to the Palace.

77
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:14,711
What do you mean by "bother"?
Please do not say that.

78
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:18,182
I came in to relay a message...

79
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,641
that the Grand Queen
Dowager has sent.

80
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:29,022
Seeing how the Grand Queen
Dowager asks for you daily,

81
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:31,721
she must really need you.

82
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:35,891
The Palace does not run
properly if I'm not there.

83
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,231
Okay.

84
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:43,101
Even if you are busy and
exhausted, it is a good thing.

85
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:47,841
Do not worry about anything and
focus on your role as a queen.

86
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,611
I may be a father who lacks in
many ways but do not forget...

87
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,381
that I am always
standing behind you.

88
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,552
Okay.

89
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,591
Have a safe trip
back to the Palace.

90
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,961
I know that it is shameless, but
please take good care of the Queen.

91
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:13,631
I will pay more attention to
her so that she is not lonely.

92
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,641
Goodness. I am
grateful and sorry.

93
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,542
Shall we go?

94
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,922
He acts like such a caring dad,

95
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,432
but he's just a greedy person
who uses his child as a tool.

96
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,461
He married his daughter off to
the person he tried to kill.

97
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,202
Is that why he tried
to kill Kim So Yong?

98
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,812
Why do you look like
you've lost your country?

99
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,611
I do not.

100
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:02,351
If you didn't lose your country,
did you lose something else?

101
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,481
Wait? Did you really?

102
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,682
Of course not.

103
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,751
It is a joyous day where you are
returning to the Palace safely.

104
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:14,491
Despite my appearance,
I am very happy.

105
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:17,162
As long as you're happy.

106
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:22,631
Is the bloody revenge
about to start?

107
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:28,442
But it feels like I'm forgetting
about something important.

108
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:32,282
I feel like I had an
important mission...

109
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,851
He is so handsome.

110
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,011
He is so handsome.

111
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,922
He is really handsome.

112
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:49,761
The investiture of
the Royal Concubine.

113
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,062
How could I forget about
such an important thing?

114
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:54,062
I have something important
to take care of, so bye.

115
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,601
Hong Yeon. Let's go. Hurry.

116
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,841
Wait. Why are you running?

117
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,141
I apologize.

118
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,172
Take your time.

119
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:05,042
My goodness. My Queen.

120
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:08,912
Your Majesty.

121
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:19,621
Let us go first.

122
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,542
- Where is the Head Eunuch?
- I made sure he is occupied.

123
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:38,481
Were you unable to find it?

124
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,141
It disappeared into thin air.

125
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:43,682
Do you think your father-in-law
figured it out and moved it?

126
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,351
That is not the case.

127
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,891
There were no changes in his
behavior until the moment I left.

128
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,261
He is not adept at hiding
his feelings for sure.

129
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,192
Do you think it was him?

130
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,562
The masked member of the
Department of Justice.

131
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:58,302
If it was in the
hands of Kim Jwa Geun,

132
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:00,631
the ledger must
not exist anymore.

133
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,631
There is no way he would
know where it was moved to.

134
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,501
It is a problematic item,

135
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,902
so your father-in-law will not be
able to tell anyone he lost it.

136
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,172
He will have to suffer alone.

137
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,881
In return, he will begin
looking for the ledger.

138
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,751
He will search for it himself.

139
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,381
Have someone follow him.

140
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:18,522
Yes, sir.

141
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,991
I think the ledger
is a lost cause.

142
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,452
Give up on it.

143
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,822
If we do not have it, our
plans will go to waste.

144
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,192
I cannot give up so easily.

145
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:33,062
Act as though the Queen
is always here. Be polite.

146
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,932
Hurry up. Let's go.

147
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:37,772
Your Highness!

148
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:39,672
Hello, Court Lady Choi!

149
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,082
Your Highness...

150
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,782
I missed you.

151
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:52,481
Court Lady Choi. Bring in
all the ladies of Joseon.

152
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:55,751
Don't leave out any of the
Han family registers...

153
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,851
and bring them to me.

154
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,891
As of this moment, I will start the
investiture of the Royal Concubine.

155
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:04,861
I'll naturally look into that family
by using the selection as an excuse.

156
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,902
The investiture of the Royal
Concubine is the answer.

157
00:14:09,202 --> 00:14:13,272
Oh, right. I need to say hello
to the Grand Queen Dowager.

158
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:15,672
Just you wait.

159
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,481
The combination of Jang Bong Hwan's
soul and Kim So Yong's memories...

160
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,042
will create the perfect act...

161
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:21,881
as Queen.

162
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,022
Grand Queen Dowager.

163
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:29,721
Have you been well?

164
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,792
What has changed?

165
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:35,231
You seem different
for some reason.

166
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:39,032
I was able to start fresh
after returning home.

167
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,402
That is good news.

168
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,832
I apologize for worrying
you all this time.

169
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:48,111
And I am grateful
that despite it all,

170
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,772
you were so understanding of me.

171
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,241
To make up for
everything in the past,

172
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,251
I will work hard
to do my best...

173
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,322
to fulfill my role as Queen.

174
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:03,121
Then will you start doing what
is most important right now?

175
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,922
I know exactly what that is.

176
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:08,292
I came as soon as
I felt better...

177
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,032
to do just that.

178
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,802
As expected.

179
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:14,731
I was only gone for two days,

180
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:17,772
but I could not stop
thinking about that.

181
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:20,741
How do you feel exactly
the same as I do?

182
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:22,942
- Then...
- Right now...

183
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,211
- As of this moment?
- Shall we?

184
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,211
- Queen.
- Good job!

185
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:34,251
This was not what I had in mind.

186
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:43,432
Your Highness.

187
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:47,062
I am looking forward
to learning from you.

188
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,471
I must be irreplaceable
right now.

189
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:53,971
I can't believe I'm
sharing my recipes.

190
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,211
I'm not ready to
become an educator.

191
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,152
What is this? Step aside.

192
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:06,851
Gosh.

193
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,192
You might have been able to
walk in here as you pleased.

194
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:13,522
But I am afraid you cannot do
the same when you leave here.

195
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,381
Your Highness.

196
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:41,322
His Majesty has
returned to the palace.

197
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:43,091
Is that so?

198
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:44,822
Shall we head over to
Seonjeongjeon Hall now?

199
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,621
No. I will head over
to the royal villa.

200
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,141
Come on. The fire is too small.

201
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,601
At this rate, the ingredients
will become mushy.

202
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,951
Come on. The flames
are everywhere.

203
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,181
I see your eyes in flames too.

204
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,091
My goodness. That cannot be.

205
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:16,822
I am determined
to learn from you,

206
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,492
so my eyes are
full of enthusiasm.

207
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:22,332
By the way, when will
you teach me your recipe?

208
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:25,131
I'm sure you know how things run
in the kitchen. Don't be like that.

209
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,802
When you start working
at a Chinese restaurant,

210
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,631
all you're allowed to do is
peeling onions in the first month.

211
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,832
Keep the fire going.

212
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,341
Even so, I have been working in
the royal kitchen for 30 years.

213
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:35,512
And I have been the royal
chef for 12 years now.

214
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,242
I don't need your
detailed resume.

215
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,441
Why don't you start
counting days then?

216
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:43,752
I don't like your attitude.

217
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,482
Forget about this.

218
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,082
Your Highness.

219
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,552
How is this? Is this better?

220
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,222
Is it better? Like this?

221
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:53,562
Hey, open it.

222
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:57,091
Move.

223
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,772
Did you just glance?

224
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,772
What an industrial spy.

225
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,611
I was wondering if I
adjusted the heat correctly.

226
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,951
You don't get to think.
I'll do all the thinking.

227
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:17,921
Why do you keep
crossing the line?

228
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:34,201
Gukbap is the comfort
food of the common people.

229
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,502
And gomtang is the comfort
food of the upper class.

230
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,441
And I'll add a bit of consomme,
a French-style beef gukbap.

231
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,951
I'll get rid of the gamey
flavor with egg whites.

232
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,391
She is using egg whites
in a revolutionary way.

233
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,822
- Your Highness.
- My gosh.

234
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,562
Will this do?

235
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,191
Nice.

236
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:08,002
May I ask what kind of food
you are trying to make?

237
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,232
Food that will move one's soul.

238
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:13,502
Soul?

239
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:30,851
Great.

240
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:33,222
And then, this is
the finishing touch.

241
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,802
- They are on standby, right?
- Yes, Your Highness.

242
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,972
"If the foam dies,
I will die too."

243
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,972
With that attitude, try to keep
the food safe and be swift.

244
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,911
All right. Go.

245
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:52,282
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,212
Hurry.

247
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:00,151
she'll love it more as she
already knows how it tastes.

248
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:04,861
Your Highness!

249
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,292
Dam Hyang!

250
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:16,332
I was so scared that I might
not be able to see you again.

251
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,671
Seriously. Thank you so much.

252
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,881
I made you worry, Dam Hyang.

253
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:28,851
I ought to be scolded.

254
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,621
My gosh. I'm sorry.

255
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,062
What...

256
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:49,171
Am I seeing this correctly?

257
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,802
Is this rice in the soup?

258
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:55,941
Well, it looks like
rice to me too.

259
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:59,712
Did she serve me
gukbap for my meal?

260
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:03,411
Rice and soup must be
separated for royal meals.

261
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,851
How dare she put rice in the
soup like some peasant food?

262
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:07,951
Should I bring this back?

263
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:09,091
Of course, you should...

264
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,292
but,

265
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,091
the Queen has put a lot of
effort into making this.

266
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,601
I will taste it, at least.

267
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:23,131
Yes, Your Highness.

268
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:42,121
I have counted the
days of my career...

269
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:45,161
in the royal kitchen.

270
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:48,232
And I have lived a proud
life as a royal chef.

271
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:54,871
However, I became a mere servant
who just tends the fire overnight.

272
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,072
This is all because
of the Queen.

273
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:01,671
It is not because
I am a bad chef.

274
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:05,042
It is because the Queen
is strangely too good.

275
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,082
Darn it.

276
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:08,611
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

277
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:15,822
Darn it.

278
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:18,762
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

279
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:29,802
- You too?
- You too?

280
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:37,012
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

281
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,111
Come on! You are
being too harsh!

282
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:41,082
You are still wet
behind your ears!

283
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:42,282
You little...

284
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,552
Darn you. Come on.

285
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:46,421
Do you think I am a joke?

286
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,752
Come on. I am a good chef!

287
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,931
Gosh, that hit the spot.

288
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:03,131
When did you get so
close, Court Lady Choi?

289
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,472
I do not hate her that much.

290
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:09,742
Her Highness has been
on my back lately.

291
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:12,282
I must have gone bad like those
spoiled vegetables in summer.

292
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:15,212
I have been blowing into
the fire all day long.

293
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:21,691
What are you doing?

294
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,492
No. I was not trying to kiss...

295
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,522
- I was trying to explain to you...
- Go away.

296
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,532
- I...
- Go now.

297
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:33,832
Fine.

298
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,931
Excuse me.

299
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:38,242
My gosh.

300
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:45,341
I cannot badmouth
Her Highness...

301
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:47,911
because I might be on
the same level as he is.

302
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,611
But I must get
things off my chest.

303
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:56,121
I was really going to
quit looking at this.

304
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:21,851
Why is his face in there?

305
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:35,931
No. No!

306
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:38,032
No. Please, no.

307
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:42,232
No! No! This cannot
be happening!

308
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,857
Grand Queen Dowager, the Queen
seeks an audience with you.

309
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,258
She may enter.

310
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:00,708
I'm dead meat.

311
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,307
This heartless woman obviously
won't appreciate this soul food.

312
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,748
Your Royal Highness.

313
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:13,547
I must have lost my skills
because I was away...

314
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:16,158
from the royal kitchen
for a little while.

315
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:22,027
It tastes familiar yet
foreign at the same time.

316
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:24,458
Foreign yet familiar.

317
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:27,928
Your outstanding cooking talents
are beginning to scare me.

318
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:31,968
You even brought back old memories
that I had completely forgotten.

319
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:34,138
Here.

320
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:41,008
Good girl, eat up.

321
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:43,978
Mother.

322
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:48,488
Your Royal Highness.

323
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:53,027
- You have rice right here...
- How dare you!

324
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:03,367
But I hear that you are not willing
to share these skills of yours.

325
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:06,508
Do you not think that you
can teach the Royal Chef?

326
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,168
Well...

327
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:11,577
That old fogey does get
on my nerves a little.

328
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:14,478
Then we shall get rid
of him immediately.

329
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,748
There was that arsenic
incident as well.

330
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:19,248
Arsenic?

331
00:26:19,547 --> 00:26:20,988
Did you not know?

332
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:22,758
You fell into a
vegetative state...

333
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:25,127
because you ingested poison
in the royal kitchen.

334
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:26,557
Poison?

335
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,597
Then I wouldn't have
recovered so quickly.

336
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,428
The Royal Chef may be a
close-minded old fogey,

337
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:35,567
but if you dismiss him from
his job suddenly like this...

338
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,097
"His job"? What do you mean?

339
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:40,567
What I meant was,
we will behead him.

340
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,577
I wonder who has the ledger now.

341
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:53,787
More importantly,

342
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:56,488
why did this person take it?

343
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:00,428
Will this bite us in the end?

344
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,827
Or will this help us?

345
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:06,728
Whether he loses
his job or his head,

346
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,398
why do I care?

347
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:12,267
They keep telling me to
share my recipes and skills,

348
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,238
so the talks about my
dethronement weren't a joke.

349
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:17,607
I can't afford to worry
about that old fogey now.

350
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,107
I'm about to lose my head.

351
00:27:21,948 --> 00:27:24,617
Oh, Cheoljong!

352
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:32,127
Your Majesty, the Queen is here.

353
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,307
What are you doing?

354
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:55,748
I heard this is how
royal ladies walk.

355
00:27:56,077 --> 00:27:59,218
I am your perfect
queen, you know.

356
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:01,547
What? Who?

357
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:04,758
That's what Court Lady Choi
told me. Is it not true?

358
00:28:04,758 --> 00:28:05,857
No, what I meant was...

359
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:08,658
Who is my "perfect queen"?

360
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,767
Me, as you can see.

361
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:18,807
You are scaring me.
Just be your usual self.

362
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,607
By the way, what's
Your Majesty's type?

363
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,448
Sexy? Cute? Or innocent?

364
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:29,248
What are you talking about?

365
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:31,847
The Grand Queen
Dowager told me...

366
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,218
to select a few royal
concubines for you.

367
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,488
They're your concubines,

368
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:37,117
so I figured I should ask you
what your preferences are.

369
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:38,827
"Concubines"?

370
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:40,928
Royal concubines...

371
00:28:41,357 --> 00:28:42,928
Look at this punk.

372
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,297
Are you finally showing
your true colors?

373
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:52,438
That is a great idea.

374
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:16,097
My apologies. I was overjoyed.

375
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:17,597
Well...

376
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:19,898
Let me make this one
thing clear to you.

377
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,898
Just because you're a
king doesn't mean...

378
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:24,898
those women belong to you. That's
primitive and old-fashioned.

379
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,567
You don't own them.

380
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:29,638
That is excellent advice.

381
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:31,978
- So you mean...
- They're mine.

382
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,877
- What?
- I own them.

383
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,817
So don't come anywhere
near the royal villa.

384
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,418
You have Royal
Noble Consort Eui.

385
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:41,148
Oh, right.

386
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,057
On one condition though.

387
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:47,988
- Lend me your ears.
- What? Why?

388
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,357
It's okay.

389
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:53,468
I will choose the family.

390
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:55,168
What?

391
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:59,408
No! I care more about their
looks than their backgrounds.

392
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:03,138
Then I shall tell the
Grand Queen Dowager...

393
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,948
that I really do not need
any royal concubines.

394
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:07,347
Okay, fine.

395
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,948
But let's not overstep
each other's boundaries.

396
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,617
I'll evaluate their looks
while you vet their families.

397
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,517
You truly are my anti-fan.

398
00:30:18,188 --> 00:30:21,728
I was very concerned, but I
have figured out a way now.

399
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:27,867
Don't smile.

400
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,198
You're no longer
allowed to smile.

401
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,567
Also, you're not allowed to grab
my hand like you did earlier,

402
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,138
and you can't lie
down on my belly!

403
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,577
What? So I am not
allowed to do anything?

404
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:40,307
That's right. You're not
allowed to do anything.

405
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:41,877
Don't do anything!

406
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,718
I don't have time for this.

407
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,117
Let's go.

408
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:54,488
That is my queen.

409
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:58,498
Would you like to go
speak with His Majesty?

410
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:02,138
No, I will return
to the royal villa.

411
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:08,607
Is this what you're looking for?

412
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:14,347
Did you say a court
maid sold this to you?

413
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:17,218
Yes, she looked young.

414
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,847
She was clad in the
court maid uniform.

415
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:22,188
Do you remember her face?

416
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:25,758
That depends on how much
you're willing to pay me.

417
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:28,958
I will return with a painter.

418
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,097
The clearer your memories are,

419
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:33,168
the higher my offer will be.

420
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:47,408
Hello...

421
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,418
GENERAL STORE

422
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,087
GONE FOR BREAK

423
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:04,827
This is fake. I'm sure of it.

424
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:07,127
You mean, these are
forged identities?

425
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,498
But they didn't create
completely fake identities.

426
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:13,238
They restored the ones that belonged
to the deceased or the missing.

427
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,837
And they sure didn't do
a clumsy job at that.

428
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,807
It must've cost quite a bit.

429
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:28,718
Thank you.

430
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:35,758
He did all this work...

431
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:39,168
just to become a low-ranking
military officer?

432
00:32:57,847 --> 00:33:01,988
Your Majesty, there is something
I must give to you in secret.

433
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:04,718
I will wait for you
where we always meet.

434
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:07,458
Your Highness.

435
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:17,497
Prince Yeongpyeong has
stepped out of the palace.

436
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:24,508
Then I would like you to
deliver this to His Majesty.

437
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,908
Sure, Your Highness.

438
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:32,247
She has something
to give to him?

439
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:36,758
If she could not give it to him as
he seemed content with the Queen,

440
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:40,027
then it must be
something special.

441
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:45,667
The royal conference will commence
in about 15 minutes, right?

442
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:46,997
Yes, Your Highness.

443
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,598
You should take a little break.

444
00:33:49,138 --> 00:33:50,167
Yes, Your Highness.

445
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,908
Royal Noble Consort Eui
wrote Your Majesty a letter.

446
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:35,178
CONFIDENTIAL

447
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:47,988
You must have been very
busy while I was away.

448
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,997
Thanks to you, I have
nothing to do here.

449
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:53,567
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

450
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:56,468
To show you my appreciation
of your hard work,

451
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,868
I would like to hold a
banquet on Surit-nal.

452
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:01,667
As there are many natural disasters
and complaints from the people,

453
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,238
your generosity will
make them think...

454
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:06,448
we are not interested
in keeping order...

455
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:09,178
and we only want to have
extravagant parties.

456
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:12,917
I believe this is not the
way a king ought to behave.

457
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:14,917
However, Yeongjo...

458
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,417
celebrated his recovery after
being sick for several months...

459
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,658
by holding a banquet.

460
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:23,957
The Queen had been exhausted
due to her hard work...

461
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,667
and made a recovery after
falling into a vegetative state.

462
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:27,527
We ought to celebrate it.

463
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:31,238
We are still investigating
the cause of her illness.

464
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,908
So we cannot pinpoint
the cause yet.

465
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:36,777
She has made a full recovery
after resting for two days.

466
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,308
She must have needed some rest.

467
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:40,607
- However...
- The Queen...

468
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:45,348
overcame a serious illness
and made a full recovery.

469
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:49,658
We must hold a small party to
celebrate this good occasion.

470
00:35:50,488 --> 00:35:52,857
I believe this occasion
deserves a celebration.

471
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:54,457
Yes.

472
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:58,258
That is my duty as her
husband and the king as well.

473
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,328
Your Majesty, you
cannot proceed.

474
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,638
An attempt to assassinate the
Queen is a serious offense.

475
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,238
If you rush to clear the
occasion by holding a banquet...

476
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:08,508
Minister of War.

477
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:11,678
Are you not happy that
the Queen has recovered?

478
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:13,448
Do not tell me...

479
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:16,817
you wanted the Queen to
be harmed by someone.

480
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,718
No. I did not.

481
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,788
Is using this occasion...

482
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:25,087
for your political agenda more
important than her health?

483
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,297
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

484
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:38,067
If that is your wish, we will
gladly accept your kindness.

485
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:40,067
Then, look forward to it.

486
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,008
Perhaps, it must be all the rest
you had. You are full of energy.

487
00:36:58,388 --> 00:36:59,558
I will use my enemy's enemy.

488
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:02,227
I will defeat a barbarian
with another barbarian.

489
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:04,227
We must establish...

490
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:05,797
a new clan that will go
against the Kim clan.

491
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,627
- "Establish"?
- We will use...

492
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,497
the selection of the royal
concubine the Queen is in charge of.

493
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:13,868
Royal Chef, please
take a look at this.

494
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:16,207
Okay. Sure. Does
it taste similar?

495
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:17,808
Let me taste it.

496
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,047
- Bring me more seasonings.
- Yes.

497
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,377
I must add more.

498
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:26,788
Hey, that is too
watery. Do it again.

499
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:29,988
Why are you working so hard?

500
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:35,857
Dishes made with milk
will be very popular.

501
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:38,828
We cannot starve the
calves whenever we want.

502
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:43,768
I am sure we can bring out
similar flavors without real milk.

503
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:48,238
Molecular gastronomy
in the Joseon Dynasty?

504
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,948
He's working so hard
especially today.

505
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:56,118
Royal Chef.

506
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,817
I can feel his
sorrow on his face.

507
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:03,618
I bet he has a whole
family to feed.

508
00:38:04,357 --> 00:38:05,488
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:08,687
Make a bigger fire here.

510
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:17,397
Goodness.

511
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:21,667
He's probably shouldering the
burden as the head of the family...

512
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,408
with those small shoulders.

513
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:27,808
Come to think of it, I
don't even know your name.

514
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:28,908
What's your name?

515
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,678
It is Man Bok.

516
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,288
Tell me about your family.

517
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:37,388
I bet you have like 10
family members to support.

518
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:39,457
I am single.

519
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,558
What?

520
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:44,397
I have enjoyed the life of
a bachelor for a long time.

521
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:51,297
But don't you have
a family to support?

522
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:53,138
Think carefully.

523
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:58,578
I do feed stray cats fish
heads from time to time.

524
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:00,808
That's right. See?

525
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,917
Without you, the stray
cats will starve.

526
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:08,187
I won't do it for you. I'm
doing it for those cats.

527
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:12,018
I'll teach you my recipe.

528
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:15,488
Thank you, Your Highness.

529
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:18,058
Gosh. You're creeping me out.

530
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,297
Hey. Bring me some paper.

531
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:35,147
Hong Yeon.

532
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:37,178
Get the food palanquin. Deliver
this to the royal physician.

533
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:38,618
Yes.

534
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:48,687
Recommend me fragrant herbs
that are good for our skin.

535
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:52,258
If your answer doesn't satisfy
me, you'll get a new assignment.

536
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:56,397
"A new assignment"?

537
00:39:56,738 --> 00:39:58,437
There is more on the back.

538
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,508
I need eunuchs who will help
me select a royal concubine.

539
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:08,508
How come she is always looking
for a way to make me a eunuch?

540
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:20,788
Your Majesty.

541
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:24,058
Please slow down. You
might hurt yourself.

542
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:31,297
Where can I find books
on royal banquets?

543
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,908
I will look for them.

544
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:45,618
I would like to read
Yeongjo's royal banquet.

545
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:47,618
Yes. Your Majesty.

546
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:02,297
I went to Seonjeongjeon Hall.

547
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:03,937
I was informed that
you were headed here.

548
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:07,337
To what do I owe this pleasure?

549
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:11,877
I just thought you and I have
not spent any time together.

550
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,678
I wanted to have a talk.

551
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,297
Please.

552
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,948
Is it because you
brewed the tea yourself?

553
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:50,678
It tastes more interesting.

554
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:56,218
When I look at you, I am
reminded of the late king.

555
00:41:56,758 --> 00:42:01,187
That was why I had a hard
time keeping you close.

556
00:42:02,058 --> 00:42:05,297
I am sorry that I did
not realize it sooner.

557
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:10,437
I assumed that I knew a
lot about the late king.

558
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:13,167
Perhaps, the late king,

559
00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:17,078
my son...

560
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:21,277
must have been a greater
king than I thought...

561
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:23,848
seeing how he tried...

562
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:26,747
to restore the sovereign power
by going against the Kim clan.

563
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,788
I regret it very much...

564
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:34,428
that I was not able
to ask my clan...

565
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:37,598
to support the late
king and his agenda.

566
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:42,567
Do not blame yourself.

567
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:46,868
I am sure the late king
would not want that.

568
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:51,238
I was wondering if I
would be able to...

569
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:55,977
correct my mistake against
the late king through you.

570
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:23,107
I fall short of the
late king in many ways.

571
00:43:26,477 --> 00:43:27,977
Is that so?

572
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:32,578
If you come across the
same goal as the late king,

573
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:37,187
please let me lend you a hand.

574
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:42,488
I will not make the
same mistake again.

575
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:45,127
I will keep that in mind.

576
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:52,538
I am happy to have gotten
to know you a bit today.

577
00:43:52,538 --> 00:43:54,567
The pleasure was all mine.

578
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,437
Please rest now.

579
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:11,687
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU
WHERE WE ALWAYS MEET.

580
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:35,607
His Majesty is here.

581
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:45,118
I am sorry. Did I make
you wait for a long time?

582
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:47,357
Wait outside for a moment.

583
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:54,268
I thought you would not come,
so I came right back in.

584
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,538
I read the letter late.

585
00:44:57,098 --> 00:44:58,337
You must have been busy.

586
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,067
So busy you could
not read the letter.

587
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:03,578
To be honest, the Queen
Dowager came to see me,

588
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:05,008
so we had a conversation.

589
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:08,977
What did you talk
about with her?

590
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:10,948
It was just a
friendly conversation.

591
00:45:13,388 --> 00:45:14,618
You seem to have...

592
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:18,857
more things that I
must not know about.

593
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:22,928
Then what did you
discuss with the Queen?

594
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,598
When you were in
front of the lake.

595
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:29,738
- Did you see that?
- Should I not have seen it?

596
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:31,337
No.

597
00:45:31,868 --> 00:45:34,437
We were discussing the investiture
of the Royal Concubine.

598
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:37,038
The Royal Concubine...

599
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:40,578
I am sure you refused.

600
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:43,317
We need to avert the
focus of the Kim clan.

601
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:45,678
If we give them another
power they can fight against,

602
00:45:45,678 --> 00:45:47,687
they will be less
focused on the throne.

603
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:50,718
So did you agree to it?

604
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:53,928
- I did.
- This is the Queen's scheme!

605
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:55,957
Royal Noble Consort.

606
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:58,258
Why are you calling me
Royal Noble Consort?

607
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:01,198
Why are you not calling
me by my name anymore?

608
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:06,768
You used to say that I was the one
who can make you happy and sad.

609
00:46:07,508 --> 00:46:08,908
But now,

610
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:11,977
has it changed to someone else?

611
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:16,518
- Hwa Jin...
- Please tell me how you feel.

612
00:46:17,578 --> 00:46:18,817
Have you...

613
00:46:20,788 --> 00:46:23,158
fallen in love with the Queen?

614
00:46:32,828 --> 00:46:34,828
The foundation of western
food is sauce and dressing.

615
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:37,038
In particular, the dressing
is the flower of western food.

616
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:38,897
Try it.

617
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:43,808
If I use this, can I
make milk out of beans?

618
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:47,047
Why are you single by the way?

619
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:48,707
Pardon?

620
00:46:51,118 --> 00:46:53,618
I missed my chance to get married
as I was so focused on my work.

621
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:55,917
What about your
parents and siblings?

622
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:00,357
In 1839, they killed
all the Catholics.

623
00:47:00,357 --> 00:47:01,687
That is how I ended up alone.

624
00:47:03,928 --> 00:47:06,058
Why did they have to
believe in such a thing?

625
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:09,227
That is why I do not
believe in anything.

626
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:11,738
The Gihae Persecution.

627
00:47:14,437 --> 00:47:15,538
You must be lonely.

628
00:47:16,707 --> 00:47:18,977
I am not the only one
who ended up like this.

629
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:23,647
It is a bit sad to spend
the holidays alone,

630
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:26,178
but the good thing is...

631
00:47:27,618 --> 00:47:31,618
they all died on the same day, so
I only need to hold one memorial.

632
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:41,227
My gosh. What's
wrong with everyone?

633
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,937
How did you know I was weak to
men who gave off a sad smell?

634
00:47:45,437 --> 00:47:47,437
- A sad smell?
- The food smells sad.

635
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,908
When a chef feels sad,
the food becomes sad too.

636
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:53,277
I know.

637
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:55,848
That is why whether it
is happiness or sadness,

638
00:47:55,848 --> 00:47:59,047
I leave all my
emotions at the door...

639
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:00,948
before I enter
the royal kitchen.

640
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:02,917
You always get mad.

641
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:06,527
That is because whenever
you come here, you upset me.

642
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,297
You should blame yourself for lack
of practice. Not someone else.

643
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:13,768
Look at this. Look at this.

644
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:14,997
"Look at this"?

645
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:16,738
Did you call me "this"?

646
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,497
Look at you. Look at you.

647
00:48:19,968 --> 00:48:21,207
That irritates me even more!

648
00:48:21,808 --> 00:48:23,908
I should've just
left you to die.

649
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:27,277
My gosh. I'm so weak-hearted.

650
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,457
It has not been that
long since I had a meal.

651
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:44,758
I am not sure either.

652
00:48:56,437 --> 00:48:59,238
Do not eat it. Share it...

653
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:01,448
with your skin.

654
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:06,388
This is how I become
irreplaceable.

655
00:49:07,288 --> 00:49:09,957
From K-food to K-beauty.

656
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:17,897
It's the perfect
weather to dry seeds.

657
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,178
Your Highness.

658
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,547
I did not see you
all day yesterday.

659
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,118
I hope you did not suffer
too much from your hangover.

660
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:54,667
I apologize for leaving my post.

661
00:49:56,198 --> 00:49:58,198
I have something to ask you.

662
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:02,968
Do you remember the situation before
you ended up in a vegetative state?

663
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:06,607
Was there anything suspicious
or any suspicious behaviors?

664
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:09,207
Regarding suspicious behaviors,

665
00:50:09,377 --> 00:50:11,547
who are you referring to?

666
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:12,977
Whomever.

667
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,718
Well, to be honest,

668
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:18,518
I think that the other world
is connected to my collapse.

669
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:21,288
By "the other world", are you
talking about another power?

670
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:22,488
No.

671
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:28,698
In any case, I mean it was
something that occurred naturally.

672
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:32,198
You may be shocked, but
I will tell you anyway.

673
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,437
I suspect that the King
is connected to it.

674
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:38,207
According to my investigation,

675
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,207
the person who tried to
harm you near Oktajeong...

676
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:43,477
was sent from the King.

677
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:46,448
I knew you would be shocked.

678
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:48,118
How did you figure that out?

679
00:50:48,817 --> 00:50:50,258
I'm the only one who knows that.

680
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:52,957
Were you aware of that?

681
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:55,388
Well, the thing is...

682
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,098
we were both intertwined
in various ways,

683
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,127
so we agreed to let
it go and move on.

684
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:03,067
Did you act that way
despite knowing all along?

685
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:06,768
Does your love remain unchanged
despite what the King has done?

686
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:09,337
What? Love?

687
00:51:09,877 --> 00:51:12,508
Why would you say
something so disgusting?

688
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:16,408
If I want to live well here, I
need to get along with the King.

689
00:51:16,518 --> 00:51:18,618
I'm just getting along with
him as I have no other choice.

690
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:19,888
Then, how could
you do that with...

691
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:20,988
I'm already confused
about my identity.

692
00:51:20,988 --> 00:51:22,488
Why would you talk
about love now?

693
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:26,218
How is the investiture
of Royal Concubine going?

694
00:51:26,558 --> 00:51:27,758
Court Lady Choi!

695
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:29,288
Court Lady Choi!

696
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:39,725
Ladies, I'm here...

697
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,964
Where are the candidates
for Royal Concubine?

698
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,304
They are over here.

699
00:51:58,784 --> 00:51:59,784
What is this?

700
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,915
I endured an exhausting
day while waiting for this.

701
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:06,924
What is all of this?

702
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:28,045
I will not be able to quit
looking at the kaleidoscope.

703
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:39,924
She went that far for
the sake of our family?

704
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:51,105
What is this called again?

705
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:54,235
She said it was a beauty cover.

706
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,775
I was looking for
someone to replace her,

707
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,475
and she gave me
a new technology.

708
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:03,744
Your Highness,

709
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:05,384
I am the head of the Department
of Justice, Kim Byeong In.

710
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:08,585
At this hour?

711
00:53:10,985 --> 00:53:12,125
Come in.

712
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,844
I did mention you to my brother
so he can tell you to visit me,

713
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:33,045
but it is too late.

714
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,375
I never received such a message.

715
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:39,185
I dared to seek an audience
with Your Royal Highness...

716
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:42,185
for I must tell you something
without letting my father know.

717
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:45,654
My father...

718
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:49,194
probably told you that His Majesty
is different from his predecessor.

719
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:53,895
My father was wrong.

720
00:54:10,244 --> 00:54:11,284
What?

721
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,485
No...

722
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:20,924
No, do not follow me.

723
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,534
This is just something little.

724
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:30,335
I brought you some red ginseng.

725
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:33,364
- Here, take it.
- Thank you.

726
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:40,114
By the way, is everything okay?

727
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:41,915
With what?

728
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:45,045
Stop being so cryptic.
Just get to the point.

729
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:46,985
What do you mean?

730
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:50,884
I am just asking you
how everything is going.

731
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:57,464
Anyway, I suppose Byeong
In is still at the palace?

732
00:55:05,565 --> 00:55:07,134
Hello, Lord Kim.

733
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,904
- I am back.
- You came back late today.

734
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:14,375
I never had a chance to spend
some time with my colleagues,

735
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,045
so I had a drink with those
in the Department of Justice.

736
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:17,585
Good.

737
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:20,514
It's getting late. Go
in and get some rest.

738
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:23,685
Okay, I will let you get
back to your conversation.

739
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:27,255
All right. Good night.

740
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:34,235
- You.
- Yes.

741
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:36,494
You seem anxious.

742
00:55:37,904 --> 00:55:41,335
Biting off more than you
can chew can cause anxiety.

743
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:44,404
What... I am not
quite following.

744
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:46,275
Why do you not know
that you can...

745
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:50,114
put yourself as well as the Queen
in danger by being reckless?

746
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:51,944
If I seem anxious,
that is because...

747
00:55:53,114 --> 00:55:55,884
I have not managed to capture the
person who tried to harm the Queen.

748
00:55:57,284 --> 00:56:00,324
- Is that so?
- My gosh, it is getting late.

749
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:01,895
You must be tired.

750
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:05,025
Since I only stopped
by to deliver my gift,

751
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:06,864
I will get going now.

752
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,404
He lost the ledger.

753
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,304
If he was not involved, did
Byeong In do it by himself?

754
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:21,444
If that is not the case...

755
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:23,714
No, that can't be.

756
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,014
I'm thankful that it's not me.

757
00:56:55,815 --> 00:56:58,344
It took a while to
find a corpse...

758
00:56:58,884 --> 00:57:00,855
with a similar physique.

759
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,784
Tell me about this corpse.

760
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,554
The person drowned.

761
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:08,755
The face is not recognizable as
it was submerged for a long time.

762
00:57:13,165 --> 00:57:15,935
Please tell me how
you truly feel.

763
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:19,134
Have you...

764
00:57:21,174 --> 00:57:23,335
fallen in love with the Queen?

765
00:57:29,344 --> 00:57:30,384
I...

766
00:57:32,944 --> 00:57:35,214
must not love the Queen.

767
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:39,424
You are not denying that
you are in love with her.

768
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:42,395
You are just saying that
you must not love her.

769
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,304
Your Highness, Prince
Yeongpyeong is here.

770
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:01,645
Yes, come in.

771
00:58:10,185 --> 00:58:11,924
I apologize for
visiting you so late.

772
00:58:11,924 --> 00:58:13,185
I have news you have
been waiting for.

773
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:15,694
Did you find O Wol?

774
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:29,235
Did you give it to her?

775
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:33,344
Yes, I am sure of it.

776
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,174
A court maid sold it.

777
00:58:39,145 --> 00:58:42,114
That means O Wol is
alive. Thank goodness.

778
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:46,725
Why ask me to get water in
the middle of the night?

779
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:49,554
Should have asked me
to get it earlier.

780
00:58:59,065 --> 00:59:00,304
Did something get stuck?

781
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:05,944
What is that?

782
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:22,295
I hired an artist to draw the
court maid's composite sketch.

783
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,324
Once we see it, we
will know for certain.

784
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:34,505
I actually have figured out
a way to help His Majesty...

785
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:35,534
Your Highness.

786
00:59:37,545 --> 00:59:38,705
In the well...

787
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:42,114
- The well?
- They found a corpse inside it.

788
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:45,545
And it looks like O
Wol, your court maid.

789
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:47,185
O Wol?

790
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:51,355
- What do we do?
- My gosh.

791
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,194
It will be traumatizing for you.

792
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:05,464
- Let me...
- No.

793
01:00:06,304 --> 01:00:08,404
I must check with my own eyes.

794
01:00:44,005 --> 01:00:45,344
- Did you see that?
- My gosh.

795
01:00:47,545 --> 01:00:49,844
Looks like she was left
underwater for a long time.

796
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:54,955
My gosh, it must have been
awfully suffocating and painful.

797
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,074
Please stop.

798
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,545
I am only getting started.

799
01:01:26,944 --> 01:01:27,955
Your Highness.

800
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,985
I wish to be alone.

801
01:02:13,665 --> 01:02:14,864
The one...

802
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:18,165
who makes me happy and sad.

803
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:22,735
Your Majesty, the Grand
Queen Dowager is here.

804
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,014
What brings you by?

805
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:46,395
What were you reading?

806
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:49,935
Just one of the appeals that I
hadn't gotten around to peruse.

807
01:02:49,935 --> 01:02:52,605
You seem much more
enthusiastic than usual,

808
01:02:53,304 --> 01:02:55,335
which makes me curious about
your time outside the palace.

809
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:56,875
Hence, I came to
ask you about it.

810
01:02:57,205 --> 01:02:58,975
It was good to temporarily...

811
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,714
forget about the matters
of the royal court.

812
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:03,244
I am glad to hear that.

813
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:07,485
You see,

814
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:10,985
I want you to be happy.

815
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,625
I am much obliged.

816
01:03:16,355 --> 01:03:19,295
You have been through a lot.

817
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:22,295
Have you already
forgotten all about it?

818
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:26,505
Perhaps fate can be inherited.

819
01:03:27,574 --> 01:03:30,134
If you learn to be grateful for
your situation and do nothing,

820
01:03:30,134 --> 01:03:34,344
both you and all your
loved ones will be safe.

821
01:03:35,514 --> 01:03:38,915
So why is it that you cannot
just sit back and do nothing?

822
01:03:42,255 --> 01:03:45,185
Be good, Your Majesty.

823
01:03:48,255 --> 01:03:50,764
I will, Grand Queen Dowager.

824
01:04:22,295 --> 01:04:23,955
CONFIDENTIAL

825
01:04:51,284 --> 01:04:52,884
Be good,

826
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:54,795
my baby.

827
01:05:37,235 --> 01:05:39,764
Some people live
inside a nightmare.

828
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:07,194
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

829
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:16,435
NO TOUCHING

830
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:25,084
MEANS TO SEEK
ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS

831
01:06:27,315 --> 01:06:31,124
ANTI-FAN: A POWERFUL
SPIRIT GUIDE

832
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:33,525
AWESOME, MAGIC HOUR,
ATTENTION SEEKER

833
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:35,124
SHOWDOWN, JASMINE
TEA, ILL-MANNERED

834
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,895
SPECIAL FORCES, LOTTERY, ISSUE

835
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:41,834
But they often find...

836
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,865
their own ways to
overcome their nightmares.

837
01:07:15,695 --> 01:07:17,905
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

838
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:19,605
Join us.

839
01:07:19,605 --> 01:07:20,735
Please join us.

840
01:07:20,735 --> 01:07:21,874
Come join us now, Your Highness.

841
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,954
But just as you're about to...

842
01:07:38,424 --> 01:07:40,624
have a nice dream for a change
after overcoming your nightmare...

843
01:07:47,065 --> 01:07:49,435
- I want a hug too.
- You do?

844
01:07:49,895 --> 01:07:51,365
All right.

845
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:55,174
- My gosh!
- Your Highness.

846
01:07:58,105 --> 01:08:00,304
Another nightmare...

847
01:08:01,315 --> 01:08:03,514
finds you.

848
01:08:04,344 --> 01:08:05,445
Your Highness.

849
01:08:06,645 --> 01:08:11,254
My, did you lose your voice because
you've been calling me nonstop?

850
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,664
What on earth are
you doing here?

851
01:08:20,164 --> 01:08:21,334
My Queen.

852
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,565
Today,

853
01:08:27,935 --> 01:08:29,905
I shall forget "No touching".

854
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:47,855
MR. QUEEN

855
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:06,204
<i>Is my heart telling me this?
Or is this what my body wants?</i>

856
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:08,674
<i>Secretary Han?</i>

857
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,374
<i>It is all rotten!</i>

858
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:13,285
<i>We will do whatever it takes
to get the ingredients.</i>

859
01:09:13,285 --> 01:09:17,355
<i>His Majesty will want to look like
a strong king at the ceremony.</i>

860
01:09:17,355 --> 01:09:18,525
<i>Fire!</i>

861
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:22,495
<i>There are always those who
take sports days so seriously.</i>

862
01:09:22,495 --> 01:09:23,495
<i>What's with that glare?</i>

863
01:09:23,495 --> 01:09:25,664
<i>Then I shall teach you
a thing or two again.</i>

864
01:09:25,664 --> 01:09:27,164
<i>Let me show you who
this palace belongs to.</i>

865
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:28,834
<i>I will not forgive you.</i>
