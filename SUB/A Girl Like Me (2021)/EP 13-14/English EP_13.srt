<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 13</i>

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,590
The poem you just talked about,

37
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,840
what does it mean?

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,430
It doesn’t

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,560
have any special meanings.

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
Just tell me.

41
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,840
Or I won’t be able to sleep tonight

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,310
if you don’t tell me.

43
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,710
It really means nothing.

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,680
It’s not important.

45
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,710
You don’t need to know.

46
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,430
No, I have to know.

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
I want to know

48
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,520
what can make

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,120
the number one gentleman
of Daye so jealous.

50
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,280
Hua, you know,

51
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,280
there are six rituals to be completed
when a man wants to marry someone.

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,750
In addition to presenting
the wedding gift,

53
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,400
the remaining five rituals
require a living swan goose.

54
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,910
Swan goose is hard to hunt.

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,150
People would substitute it
with other prey.

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
A Jade like Maiden

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,430
describes such a situation.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,870
An antelope is slain,
wrapped in white on the plain.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,910
A maiden for love would long,
tempted by a hunter strong.

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
It’s about a man

61
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,710
who brings prey wrapped in white cloth

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,280
to tempt the woman for love.

63
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,000
Why do you literati think in this way?

64
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,430
So you think

65
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,080
I was tempted by Shi Jin

66
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,310
because I received his prey?

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Not tempted.

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
You are seduced.

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Is there a difference?

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,190
Then you asked me

71
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,870
if I have experienced
the following content of the poem.

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,470
What’s the following content?

73
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,400
The following content...

74
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,520
It’s not important.

75
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,710
Why are you leaving?

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
It’s really not important.

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,680
Tell me.

78
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,400
Your Grace.

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,080
You will know it later.

80
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,470
Later?

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,240
What happened today

82
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,960
let me see myself clearly.

83
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,910
Hua.

84
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,280
I will prepare wedding presents
stretching for ten miles.

85
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Rong Xia,

86
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,920
why are you torturing me like this?

87
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,190
Young Master.

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,190
This is a thank-you gift

89
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,160
from Young Master Ban.

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,510
Open it.

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
It’s Full Moon above the Cold Mountain.

92
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,870
The Ban family has such a treasure.

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Is this painting

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,430
very expensive?

95
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,680
This Full Moon above the Cold Mountain

96
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,720
is the last work of a master
in the previous dynasty.

97
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,190
He was far away from his wife

98
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
and living alone on the cold mountain.

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,750
There are thousands of
mountains between them.

100
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,680
But their love for each other
can’t be said enough.

101
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,830
A lonely crane under the bright moon.

102
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,510
A man is sitting alone in a pavilion.

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,310
This gift from Young Master Ban
is quite strange.

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
Do you really think he sent it?

105
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,240
Could it be Princess Ban?

106
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,360
No, I have to send
this painting back now.

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,510
We should send something.

108
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,950
However,

109
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,310
I’ll send a return present.

110
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Young Master.

111
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,310
Madam wore it during her wedding.

112
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,480
You want to...

113
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
My mother always liked plain jewelry

114
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,950
when I was young.

115
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,240
When I saw this jewelry
for the first time,

116
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,160
it’s blushing like blood
but calm and restrained.

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,510
I can’t help but think

118
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,480
who would deserve

119
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,510
to wear such a set of jewelry.

120
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,070
Young Master, you want...

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
This is a return present from our
Count Cheng’an to Young Master Ban.

122
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,430
Please accept it.

123
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,600
A return present?

124
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,390
What did I send him?

125
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Why would Count Cheng Cheng’an
send me a return present?

126
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,160
You can ask Her Grace.

127
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,950
Mr. Du, thank you.

128
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,800
I have brought the gift here.
I should leave now.

129
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,190
You haven’t told me what I sent him.

130
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,040
This is for you.

131
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,920
For me?

132
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,560
Hua.

133
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,680
You sent him a gift in my name.

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,680
But I don’t like calligraphy.

135
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,680
Why does he

136
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
give me an inkstone?

137
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,600
It means he will urge you to learn.

138
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,870
That’s too cruel.

139
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,870
I like Shi Jin better.

140
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,390
I don’t want this.

141
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,390
Mom, look, is it beautiful?

142
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,270
It’s beautiful.

143
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,190
This is all from Count Cheng’an?

144
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,870
A grown girl can’t be kept at home.

145
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,190
Mom, what are you talking about?

146
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,070
But why does Count Cheng’an

147
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,800
not come to

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
perform the six rituals?

149
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,390
I guess his parents died early

150
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,430
and no one taught he
the rituals of getting married.

151
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,190
No way.

152
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I have to remind him.

153
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
Mom!

154
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,600
I’m not in a hurry.

155
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,560
All right,

156
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,720
I’m going to have a beauty sleep.

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Silly girl.

158
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,510
Your grandmother and I

159
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,630
have prepared your dowry long ago.

160
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,680
All we need is a good man to marry you.

161
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,270
Duke of Zhou.

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Since you can protect Hua by
letting her dream about the future,

163
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,720
please grant her a good marriage.

164
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,200
Your Highness, you asked me out
late at night. What can I do for you?

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,480
I have been pondering.

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,720
I guess Count Cheng’an

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,030
won’t easily give up looking into
what happened back then.

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,840
Looks like

169
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,600
Your Highness wants to tell me

170
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,320
the truth about what happened.

171
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,240
My husband and your father

172
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
both died of the poison, jequirity.

173
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,550
It’s just the way they died
is different.

174
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,240
Your father died in a sudden.

175
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,480
My husband was ill for a long time
before he died.

176
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,480
Then the Ban and Rong family declined.

177
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,790
But the Yan and Xie family
was in full swing in the court.

178
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,790
I venture to ask, do you have
substantial evidence?

179
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,720
If I have substantial evidence,

180
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
how would I tolerate
the Yan and Xie family till this day?

181
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,000
There is one thing I don’t understand.

182
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,790
I don’t know if Your Highness
can tell me the truth.

183
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Today I asked you out,

184
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,390
I will tell you everything
I know without reserve.

185
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,790
With your power,

186
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,720
even without evidence,

187
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,960
it’s still not difficult to avenge
Old General Ban’s death.

188
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,960
But why did you...

189
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
The deceased has gone.

190
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,630
Those who are alive
can only look forward.

191
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,870
I believe the spirit of Old General Ban
in the heaven

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,550
would hope that I can
protect the Ban family.

193
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,360
Your Highness,
you have a family to protect.

194
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,120
But I’m being left

195
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
all alone.

196
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,670
I won’t slaughter
his whole family for revenge.

197
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,600
But I don’t want my parents
and my elder brother

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
to die for nothing.

199
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,270
Count Cheng’an,
the Yan family has collapsed.

200
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,390
Just stop.

201
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,000
If you refuse to stop,

202
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
or you want to turn the Ban family

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,080
into a sword for you to use,

204
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,630
I won’t stand by and do nothing.

205
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,360
Your Highness.

206
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,720
I have no intention of
using the Ban family anymore.

207
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
This is all I can say.

208
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,550
Advance or retreat,

209
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,150
it’s up to you.

210
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,910
Your Highness.

211
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,120
Your Highness.

212
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,480
Are you still worried about
Count Cheng’an?

213
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,870
I dare not

214
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,630
to fail my old friend.

215
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
Unfortunately, Count Cheng’an

216
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,870
can’t understand your efforts.

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,480
It has been hard for you.

218
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,510
When is it not hard for me

219
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,790
during my whole life?

220
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,750
Your Highness.

221
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,030
Your Highness!

222
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,270
Invite Physician Zhang here later.

223
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,550
Your Highness, you forgot.

224
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,240
Physician Zhang is gone.

225
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,790
Your Highness. Physician Zhang once said

226
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,840
this golden elixir can prolong life
but also hurt your body.

227
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,630
It’s quenching thirst
by drinking poison.

228
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,510
You can’t use it until the final end.

229
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,840
How long have you been serving me?

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,270
I have been serving Your Highness
for more than 30 years.

231
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,750
During these years,

232
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,240
you have worked hard.

233
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,670
Your Highness treats me like a family.

234
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
I can’t repay you.

235
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,910
I just want to

236
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,320
serve Your Highness forever.

237
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,030
Your Highness!

238
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,720
Prepare a horse!

239
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,960
I’ll enter the Palace!

240
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,390
Wang De! Summon Minister Shi!

241
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,630
Please, Your Majesty.

242
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,960
I did find it

243
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,840
in the mansion of the Princess Royal.

244
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,000
I entered the Palace and
presented it to Your Majesty

245
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,630
as soon as I got it.

246
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,150
Your Majesty, I dare not to deceive you

247
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,320
even I have ten heads.

248
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,240
You dare not?

249
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
If it weren’t for me to notice
the damaged corner,

250
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,360
are you going to keep lying to me?

251
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,340
<i>Sky-holding Gate</i>

252
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Your Majesty, please calm down.

253
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,870
I beg you

254
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,630
to give me another chance

255
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
to find the real Tiger Tally

256
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,270
and make up for my error.

257
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,240
But there is one thing
I can’t figure out.

258
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,790
Say it!

259
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,720
Why would Princess Royal

260
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,870
have the fake Tiger Tally?

261
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,720
I think

262
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,360
she must also

263
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,480
have the real one.

264
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,910
If the real Tiger Tally is not lost,

265
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,480
and Princess Royal has been having it,

266
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,670
could it be...

267
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,150
Could it be that the Princess Royal

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
is plotting a rebellion?

269
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,440
Princess Royal has arrived!

270
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,720
Aunt.

271
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,630
How do you have time to see me today?

272
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,030
Your Majesty, I’m guilty!

273
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,200
Aunt, please get up.

274
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,720
What happened?

275
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,030
Does Your Majesty and Minister Shi
have important matters to discuss?

276
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,840
I’m here without an invitation.
Would I disturb you?

277
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,630
It’s okay.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,320
Nothing is more important than my aunt.

279
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,360
Come on, bring a seat.

280
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,240
Yes.

281
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,550
Aunt.

282
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,150
Your Majesty.

283
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,670
I lost an extremely important object
in my mansion.

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,600
Extremely important object?

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,910
What is it?

286
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,360
I will ask someone to find it now.

287
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,320
It’s the Tiger Tally.

288
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,150
The Tiger Tally is lost.

289
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,480
The Tiger Tally?

290
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,150
Hasn’t the Tiger Tally
been lost for a long time?

291
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,320
Yeah.

292
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,870
I don’t understand what you said.

293
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,720
Your Majesty.

294
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,150
I lost

295
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,320
the fake Tiger Tally in my mansion.

296
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,200
Fake Tiger Tally?

297
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,200
Your Highness.

298
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,270
Why do you have a fake Tiger Tally?

299
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,750
I’m guilty.

300
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,550
I shouldn’t harbor a fake Tiger Tally.

301
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,400
It’s just when Old General Ban left,

302
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,160
I was alone in my empty house.
I missed him every day.

303
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,350
So I asked someone

304
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,790
to forge the most important item

305
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,350
of Old General Ban when he was alive,

306
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,270
which is the Tiger Tally.

307
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,480
It can remind me of him.

308
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,640
In case of something unforeseen,

309
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
it was specially made of
fragile casting sand.

310
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,920
You will know it’s
real or fake at a glance.

311
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,350
The fake tally is used to
commemorate my husband.

312
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,640
Now I lost it suddenly.

313
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,030
I’m afraid someone would
use this chance to make trouble.

314
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,750
I’m panic.

315
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,790
So I came here to ask for punishment.

316
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,310
Aunt.

317
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,920
Well, in Daye,

318
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,200
who doesn’t know

319
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,440
Her Highness and His Majesty
are as close as mother and son?

320
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,200
Who dares to turn you
against each other?

321
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,440
Right?

322
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,310
Minister Shi is right.

323
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,750
Aunt, since the Tiger Tally is fake,

324
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,110
just let it go.

325
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,590
If you really want it back,

326
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,830
I will ask a good craftsman
to make another one for you.

327
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,720
At that time

328
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,110
you only need to
give me the design of it.

329
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,270
Your Majesty mustn’t do that.

330
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,070
I’m grateful

331
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,510
that Your Majesty doesn’t blame me.

332
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,310
How dare I trouble you?

333
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,830
Besides, time has changed.

334
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,480
I no longer need it
to remember my husband.

335
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,030
I’m here this time

336
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,790
because I’m worried

337
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,590
that someone wants to
blind Your Majesty.

338
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,270
Fortunately, Your Majesty and I

339
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,160
are frank people,
and we have nothing to hide.

340
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,200
Of course.

341
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,720
Yes. Yes.

342
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,110
Your Highness.

343
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,070
Chonghai.

344
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,310
We parted in a hurry
at the birthday banquet last time.

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,200
I didn’t have time to
chat with you about the past.

346
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,310
The view of the Moon Palace
is still beautiful as before.

347
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,830
In a blink of an eye,

348
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,310
our hair has turned white.

349
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,920
Indeed.

350
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,200
Time is merciless.

351
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,750
But

352
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,830
Your Highness’s appearance

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,960
is no less stunning than before.

354
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,400
Really?

355
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,960
Shi Chonghai, it has been
more than 20 years.

356
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,680
Why do you still like

357
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,550
making jokes about me?

358
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,510
I’m telling the truth.

359
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,110
Your appearance back then

360
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,880
is better than Princess Fule.

361
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,310
Do you still remember
my look at that time?

362
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,480
Who dares to forget

363
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,350
your heroic bearing at that time?

364
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,350
If it weren’t for Old General Ban
to marry you first,

365
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I would have...

366
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,030
Please forgive me.

367
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,480
I’m so happy that I
forgot to watch my words.

368
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,110
You didn’t say anything wrong.

369
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,440
I wonder,

370
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,000
do you really think

371
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,550
it’s a pity between us back then?

372
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,350
Yes.

373
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,200
In that case, why don’t you try to
make up for the lost time?

374
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,070
The Ban and Shi family
can also make peace.

375
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,070
If Your Highness is willing to
make this happen,

376
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,070
then the Shi family will
prepare for the six rituals.

377
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,750
Your Highness.

378
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,790
What time is it?

379
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,640
Your Highness, you are not feeling well.

380
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,750
Are you really going to
attend the family meal?

381
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,200
If I don’t go this time,

382
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,750
I’m afraid

383
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,440
I won’t have a chance again.

384
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,640
Besides, there are many
important things to do.

385
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Tell Cui to prepare a carriage.

386
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,720
Yes, Your Highness.

388
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,640
Your Highness.

389
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,590
Put makeup on me,

390
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
so as not to worry my family.

391
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,920
Yes.

392
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,200
Son, I’m here.

393
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,880
Mother, you came early.

394
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,550
Mother, you are here.

395
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,550
Greeting to Mother.

396
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,030
Greeting to Mother.

397
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,550
I have prepared

398
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,350
your favorite dishes today.

399
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,720
Have some tea.

400
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,960
I’ll go get a pot of good wine for you.

401
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,110
-Go ahead.
-You stay here.

402
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,240
I’m going to check the dishes, Mother.

403
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,920
Go ahead, you don’t need to stay here
to take care of me.

404
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,750
Heng greets Grandma.

405
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,640
Hua greets Grandma.

406
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,350
Hua.

407
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,590
Your dress is extraordinary.

408
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,350
It’s really beautiful.

409
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,590
Grandma, if you like it,

410
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,480
I’ll get someone

411
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,400
to customize a set for you.

412
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,030
Grandma, Hua took
many efforts to dress up

413
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,400
for today’s family meal.

414
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,920
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

415
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,790
Mr. Shi has arrived!

416
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,830
Mr. Shi, why are you here?

417
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,480
I invited him here.

418
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,680
Rest assured.

419
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,480
I’ll handle it for you.

420
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,790
Count Cheng’an has arrived!

421
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,070
Greeting to Your Highness.

422
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,510
There’s no need of this.

423
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Today is a family meal.

424
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,640
I didn’t expect
Count Cheng’an to show up.

425
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,880
It’s my honor

426
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,550
to be invited

427
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,720
by the Princess.

428
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,240
And the dishes of the Ban family

429
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,720
suit my appetite well.

430
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,270
There are often new dishes.

431
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,350
I’m excited to taste it.

432
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
I guess Mr. Shi

433
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,550
has never tasted it before.

434
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,240
Count Rong is a regular.

435
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
It’s my first time to be here.

436
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,030
But I will come often in the future.

437
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,110
Count Cheng’an, Mr. Shi,

438
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,510
I’m pleased to have you two

439
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,400
coming to our family meal.

440
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,960
I hope you can make yourself at home

441
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,400
and enjoy yourself.

442
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,750
Your Grace.

443
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,070
This is the new high-quality rouge
from the Western Regions.

444
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,960
There is only one box
in the whole capital.

445
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,240
It’s perfect for you.

446
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,110
Well...

447
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,310
Let’s eat.

448
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,400
What are you waiting for?

449
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,920
Come on, go ahead and eat.

450
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
-Yeah.
-Come on.

451
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,000
Hurry up.

452
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
-Let’s eat.
-Otherwise the dishes will be cold.

453
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,550
Hurry up.

454
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,440
Come on.

455
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,830
Mother, try this.

456
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,440
Here, dear.

457
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,000
Thank you, Master.

458
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Please.

459
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,240
Mr. Shi.

460
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,030
I heard that you are unstoppable

461
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,920
on the battlefield.

462
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Young Master, you overpraised me.

463
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,110
Here.

464
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,270
This time the Yan family
carried the coffin and made troubles.

465
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,200
Mr. Shi, thank you for
stopping them in time.

466
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,750
I’ll drink tea as wine
to express my thanks.

467
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
It’s my duty.

468
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,110
Such a trifling matter
is not worth mentioning.

469
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,510
Mother, there is something
you don’t know.

470
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,790
Count Cheng’an should

471
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,590
take the first credit for it.

472
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,480
On that day, he...

473
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,240
Marquis Ban is overstating it.

474
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,790
Not to mention we both
take positions in the court,

475
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,510
even a normal person would
draw a sword and render help

476
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,350
when running into injustice.

477
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,510
I’ll also thank Count Cheng’an.

478
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,750
Thank you for caring about
the Ban family so much.

479
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,510
For such an intelligent
person like Count,

480
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,030
you must understand my feelings.

481
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,880
I’m grateful for your help.

482
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,960
Please.

483
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,550
Come on, I’ll drink with you.

484
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,590
Don’t say that, Your Highness.

485
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,830
All right, come on.

486
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,440
Hua, they helped you.

487
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,680
You should make a gesture.

488
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,960
Is Grandma picking on me?

489
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,720
Thank you two for helping me.

490
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,240
I will empty it.

491
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,310
Your Grace are heroic. I’m impressed.

492
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,720
I’ll empty it.

493
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,750
Please.

494
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,790
Mother.

495
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,400
Here is for you.

496
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,750
Your Grace lose sleep and appetite

497
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,070
because of Yan Zhen,

498
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,880
and look thinner.

499
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,270
You should drink less.

500
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,720
This dish is nourishing.
You should have more of it.

501
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,640
Here.

502
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,640
Count Rong has a point.

503
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,200
This soup is soothing.

504
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,960
You should drink more of this.

505
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,270
This dish is more nutritious.

506
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,070
Be careful!

507
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,640
I want to drink more.

508
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,270
Be careful!

509
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,790
Let’s drink at another place!

510
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,200
-Master.
-Let’s drink!

511
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,640
-This way.
-Let’s drink!

512
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,830
Count, do you still remember
what I said that day?

513
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,160
Of course I remember.

514
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,350
Since you remember,

515
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,880
why do you ignore my words?

516
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,790
I understand your good intention.

517
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,960
It’s just I don’t agree with
your approach.

518
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
I will find out the truth

519
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,790
about what happened to
my parents and brother.

520
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,160
I will also protect Hua.

521
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,110
If Hua knows why you approached

522
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,480
the Ban family at first,

523
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,550
how do you think she will react?

524
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,380
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

525
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,000
I didn’t know you would be here today.

526
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,310
Sorry for the poor reception.

527
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,790
I’m honored to be
invited by Her Highness.

528
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,550
Besides,

529
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,680
I’m satisfied

530
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,110
to have a chat with you.

531
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,550
Mr. Shi, my grandma...

532
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,200
I know.

533
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,480
Your Grace, don’t worry.

534
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
I understand.

535
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,920
Her Highness intends to fix us up.

536
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,240
But rest assured.

537
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
I won’t force you like Yan Zhen did.

538
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,960
I will use my own way

539
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,310
to let you know my feelings.

540
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,880
No matter when,

541
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,310
I only hope you can be happy.

542
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,640
Mr. Shi.

543
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,310
Right now,

544
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,030
I don’t want to think about marriage.

545
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,920
It’s okay. I can wait.

546
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,640
What if I will never get married?

547
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,240
Then I will keep waiting.

548
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,640
Mr. Shi.

549
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,000
Is it worth it?

550
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
My heart is full of joy

551
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,510
to see your smile.

552
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
What are you looking at?

553
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
He didn’t give me any prey this time.

554
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,790
Hua, do you know

555
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,790
you are the most attractive prey?

556
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,070
Not everyone can hunt

557
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,030
a prey like me.

558
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,880
I just want to be

559
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,550
the only hunter who can have you.

560
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,070
From now on,

561
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,750
you can only see me.

562
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,110
Okay?

563
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,200
Your grandfather wanted to
pick a pomegranate for me.

564
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,830
When he was giving it to me,

565
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,270
the pomegranate suddenly
fell to the ground.

566
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,880
He and I bent down

567
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,510
to pick it up at the same time.

568
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,750
Unexpectedly,

569
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,550
our hands touched.

570
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,070
Then we spent the rest of
our lives together.

571
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,590
It feels like it just
happened yesterday.

572
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,640
Now we parted forever.

573
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,350
Grandma, you must miss
Grandpa a lot.

574
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,790
I never stopped missing him.

575
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
I’m so envious

576
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,400
that you love each other so much.

577
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,310
Hua, don’t be envious.

578
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,790
I believe

579
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,920
there will be someone

580
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,640
who will treat you with all his heart.

581
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,240
Don’t worry, Grandma.

582
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,240
I’ll

583
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,400
find a man

584
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
who will pick pomegranates for me.

585
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,790
It’s winter now.

586
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,920
Where can you find pomegranate?

587
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,510
Grandma, you must take
good care of yourself.

588
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,190
In August next year,

589
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,710
our whole family

590
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,590
will hold a grand pomegranate feast

591
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,550
right under this pomegranate tree.

592
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,230
How is it?

593
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,030
Good.

594
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,320
Good

595
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,960
Make it fast, hurry up!

596
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,150
-Coming.
-Be careful.

597
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,030
<i>Birthday</i>
Hurry up.

598
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,110
Coming.

599
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,940
<i>Birthday</i>

600
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
How do you drive the carriage?

601
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,510
-What’s going on?
-Don’t you have eyes?

602
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,030
Who is this?

603
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,510
I don’t know.

604
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,550
You know,

605
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,280
your nine kinship exterminations
will be beheaded

606
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,230
if you break
His Majesty’s birthday gift!

607
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,880
Yes!

608
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,590
Sorry, sir.

609
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,190
<i>Akeqi, Prince of Aipo</i>
I’m Akeqi, the Prince of Aipo.

610
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,760
I’m here to celebrate His Majesty’s
birthday on behave of my country.

611
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,230
You are a prince.

612
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,480
It’s okay.

613
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,760
Prince, please.

614
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
Greeting to Your Grace.

615
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,230
Congratulations, you got promoted.

616
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,710
Thanks to His Majesty’s appreciation.

617
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,800
Now I’m the Deputy Commander
of the Imperial Guard.

618
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,360
Your clothes are exquisite.

619
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,840
You are tall and upright.

620
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,230
Wearing this armor

621
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,710
makes you really good-looking.

622
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
You overpraised me.

623
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,840
It’s cold outside the hall.

624
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Mr. Shi, you should keep warm.

625
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,670
Beware of catching a cold.

626
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,190
Your Grace are also like
the Goddess of the Moon.

627
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,760
Sorry. Sorry.

628
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,230
Your Grace, this is a careless eunuch
in the Palace.

629
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
He is reckless
and ignorant of etiquette.

630
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,150
I’ll take him back

631
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,440
and punish him hard.

632
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,670
He is still a child.

633
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,630
Come here.

634
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,150
After a closer look,

635
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,510
you look quite cute.

636
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,510
You look like the parrot Yuanyuan

637
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,110
in His Majesty’s bird house.

638
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,280
They do look alike after a closer look.

639
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,880
His face is a little thinner.

640
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,070
Why don’t you

641
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,440
send him to work at the bird house?

642
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,320
This is for you.

643
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,880
Thank you.

644
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,840
Remember to

645
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,000
raise yourself fat
and let me take a look.

646
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,230
I’ll call you Chubby from now on.

647
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,480
Good day, Your Grace!

648
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,670
Is her the No.1 talented woman in Daye?

649
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,070
She indeed deserves her name.

650
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
The appearance of Feixian
really puts others in shadow.

651
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,280
Really?

652
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,320
Why do I think they are looking at Hua?

653
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,030
Where did you get
this set of blood jade jewelry?

654
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,960
Hurry up and tell me now.

655
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,110
It’s a little gesture from someone.

656
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,800
Scholars should have
a sense of proportion.

657
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,960
Even with a beauty in front of you,

658
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,630
you still shouldn’t be so rude.

659
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,670
Let’s go.

660
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,360
It’s him.

661
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,960
Tell me the truth.

662
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,440
Are you and Count Cheng’an
gonna have some good news?

663
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,590
What?

664
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,760
I haven’t enjoyed enough freedom.

665
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,320
Listen to me.

666
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,030
You have to be more difficult.

667
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,880
Then Count Cheng’an will love you more.

668
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,510
Prince of Aipo presents himself!

669
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,670
Aipo wishes Your Majesty longevity!

670
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,630
Good.

671
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,510
This jade carving is exquisite.
I like it.

672
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,880
I will give a big reward.

673
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,920
Tell me what you want.

674
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,110
Your Majesty.

675
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,110
I heard that

676
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,840
there is a stunning woman
in your country.

677
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,630
I’m yearning for her.

678
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,920
Can I marry this woman

679
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
as my Princess Consort?

680
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,710
Which girl are you talking about?

681
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,360
This woman’s surname is Shi.

682
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,280
She is good at poetry and painting,

683
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,590
and known as the No.1
talented woman in Daye.

684
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,110
I...!

685
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,590
Thanks to Prince’s
undeserved appreciation.

686
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,070
It’s just my granddaughter

687
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,480
is too feeble.

688
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,280
She doesn’t deserve such an honor.

689
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,190
Minister Shi, it doesn’t sound like you.

690
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,710
Everyone knows that the Shi family’s
granddaughter is brilliant.

691
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,190
Don’t be so humble.

692
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,320
Today is His Majesty’s birthday.

693
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,920
If His Majesty agrees,

694
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,960
doesn’t it mean she will be
sent to the border land?

695
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,320
It’s improper to
talk about love affairs.

696
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,880
No harm.

697
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,710
I’ll get credit

698
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,000
to match a couple.

699
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,360
There is going to be interesting.

700
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,760
I heard that Daye’s women
don’t like beard.

701
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,550
So I shaved my beard
to show my sincerity.

702
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,360
You are sincere. I like you.

703
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,880
Thank you, Your Majesty!

704
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,110
Well, the Prince of what...

705
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,440
Prince of Aipo.

706
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,960
How dare you

707
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,550
force the beauty of Daye
to marry you in public?

708
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,360
It’s shameless and despicable!

709
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,800
The Second Prince,

710
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,070
are you insulting our country Aipo?

711
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Luo, don’t be rude.

712
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,150
Step down.

713
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,920
Minister Shi, congratulations.

714
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,070
Go away.

715
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,920
Miss Shi, please marry me.

716
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:52,944
