<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 14</i>

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,620
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,660
I heard that

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
there is a stunning woman
in your country.

39
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,300
I’m yearning for her.

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,820
Can I marry this woman

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,300
as my Princess Consort?

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,540
Which girl are you talking about?

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,340
Miss Shi, please marry me.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,340
Prince, I think you
have the wrong person.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,700
The wrong person?

46
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,940
I’m Princess Ban Hua.

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,540
The Shi Feixian you’re looking for

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,780
is over there.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,820
But obviously you are prettier.

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,780
Is the title of No.1
talented woman in Daye

51
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,140
not the classical parlance
of the most beautiful woman in Daye?

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,500
Daye is indeed the Celestial Empire.

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,220
Even the aesthetics here
is so different.

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,500
Looks like there are still
a lot of things

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,460
for me to learn.

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,780
If I may be so bold as to

57
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,940
ask Princess Ban to marry me.

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,500
Well...

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,940
Because

60
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,380
she is the most beautiful
woman in my heart.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,820
Have you heard about it?

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,380
What?

63
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,420
Akeqi asked Princess Ban

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,180
to marry him in front of the Emperor.

65
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,940
Really?

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,020
What do you mean?

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,860
He doesn’t want Shi Feixian anymore?

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,620
That would make Shi Feixian
really embarrassed.

69
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,380
Tell me about it.

70
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,660
Something happened!

71
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,620
What’s going on?

72
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,980
The first lady in Daye has been changed!

73
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,900
Changed?

74
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,060
Right, right, it’s firsthand news.

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,740
Shi Feixian moved down the ranking.

76
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,460
Ban Hua moved up!

77
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,940
Listen to me! Listen to me!

78
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,660
Princess Ban is famous overseas
and well-known in every country!

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,420
She is going to be a consort
of the prince in a foreign country!

80
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,100
It’s true! It’s true!

81
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,460
Your Majesty, this game
is designed by me.

82
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,820
The name is Exciting Hunting.

83
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,620
It helps to digest,
relax sinew and activate circulation

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,700
after a rich feast.

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,580
It’s more suitable for
everyone to compete

86
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,020
and communicate.

87
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,140
This competition is
communication oriented.

88
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,500
One team from Daye,

89
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,260
and the other formed by foreign friends.

90
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,180
Your Majesty, we still lack one person.

91
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,180
No big deal.

92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,820
Prince Akeqi.

93
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,660
You can choose any

94
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,140
men here in Daye.

95
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,780
Thank you, Your Majesty!

96
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,580
I choose Princess Ban!

97
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,820
Well... Well...

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,860
Hua, I didn’t expect
even our foreign friend

99
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,260
not to see you as a woman.

100
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,020
Your Grace is indeed skilled.

101
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,180
I’m right about you.

102
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,820
No problem.

103
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,180
Hua, although you are
the princess of Daye,

104
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,340
since Prince Akeqi chose you,

105
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,140
you should help him
with all your efforts.

106
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,220
Don’t show mercy to Daye team.

107
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,940
Prince, don’t take me wrong.

109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,540
This is His Majesty’s order.

110
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,260
I have to obey.

111
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,780
Your Grace are straightforward.
I like it.

112
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,220
What is this?

113
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,300
Your Majesty,

114
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,140
this is a thumbnail map
of the Imperial Garden.

115
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,940
When the game starts,

116
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,820
everyone can learn
the real-time situation

117
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,260
from the change of

118
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,540
the red and blue pieces on the map.

119
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
This is interesting.

120
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,620
The Exciting Hunting starts now!

121
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,340
Here are the rules of the game.

122
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,500
Each person carries a bow
and arrow coated with dye

123
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,620
and fights with each other.

124
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,540
Those who are hit must leave
the field immediately.

125
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,980
The person who stays in the field
in the end will be the winner.

126
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,860
The first Aipo-Daye Exciting Hunting

127
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,740
is in full swing.

128
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,380
At the beginning of the game,

129
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,420
there was a frantic rain of arrows.

130
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,740
Protect the Crown Prince!

131
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,900
Count, you are the hope of Daye.

132
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,940
You mustn’t lose.

133
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,860
The current formation of Daye
has been broken up.

134
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,300
The situation is not optimistic.

135
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,500
The Second Prince

136
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,980
is running forward tirelessly.

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,820
Akeqi, where are you?

138
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,860
Akeqi!

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,100
Akeqi!

140
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,900
You dared to humiliate Feixian.

141
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,060
Go to hell!

142
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,020
The Second Prince, we can talk.

143
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,900
Let’s not jeopardize our friendship
for a woman.

144
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,500
In my heart,

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,980
Feixian is the most beautiful woman.

146
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,820
She is the dream girl
of all men in the world.

147
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,060
I must avenge her.

148
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,740
Let me see where you are
fleeing this time.

149
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,580
Cousin Luo.

150
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,380
You are in such a hurry to feed me.

151
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,740
The Second Prince
escaped from Akeqi’s attack

152
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,660
with Crane Spreading Wings.

153
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,660
Okay, let’s pass
the Second Prince for now.

154
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,820
and focus on the situation

155
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,140
of Prince Chengqian.

156
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,260
Prince Chengqian...

157
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,580
Prince Chengqian seems to have
separated from his teammates.

158
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,980
Let’s look forward to

159
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,460
the performance of the strongest player,

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,900
Mr. Shi Jin.

161
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,620
Count.

162
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,300
Let’s split up

163
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,180
and find the Crown Prince
as soon as possible.

164
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,580
Mr. Shi, after you find
the Second Prince and the Crown Prince,

165
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,580
please be beware of
the Second Prince’s intentions.

166
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,540
The foreign team

167
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,420
gathers in one place
and hasn’t moved for a long time.

168
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,780
Why is that?

169
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,620
The topography of
the Imperial Garden is complicated.

170
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,660
However,

171
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,220
I’ve been playing here
since I was a kid.

172
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,060
Therefore,

173
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,180
I’m familiar with everything here.

174
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,300
Akeqi,

175
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,380
you lead some people
to feint attack from the front

176
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
and attract their attention.

177
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,900
Then I’ll

178
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,580
take a group of people
to outflank them from the left.

179
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,260
According to the previous offensive,

180
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,540
there must be a strategist
in the foreign team

181
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,580
who is deploying the team.

182
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
Who will this person be?

183
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,540
Is his brain better mine?

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,780
By the way,

185
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,620
if you meet the Second Prince,
don’t shoot him.

186
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,980
Leave him to me.
I’ll finish him by myself.

187
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,620
All right, let’s get it.

188
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,980
Let’s go!

189
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,060
The Crown Prince is alone and helpless.

190
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,900
There are enemies from three sides.

191
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,300
The Daye team

192
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,060
is in danger.

193
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,220
Something bad is gonna happen
to the Daye team.

194
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,700
Your Majesty, what should we do?

195
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,380
Will Zhang get hurt?

196
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,980
As the Crown Prince of Daye,
a little injury is no big deal.

197
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,540
He’d better not to hurt
the prestige of Daye.

198
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,020
Awesome!

199
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,100
His teammates show up.

200
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
The Crown Prince is rescued.

201
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,420
It’s hopeful again!

202
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,500
Come on, Prince Chengqian!

203
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,580
Daye depends on you!

204
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,740
The Second Prince
and the Crown Prince join hands

205
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,100
to win glory for Daye! Come on!

206
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,700
Prince Chengqian has been
away from his team

207
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,740
and gone missing.

208
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
Who has

209
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,420
saved your Prince Chengqian?

210
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,780
If he succeeds in
rescuing the Crown Prince,

211
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,340
Your Majesty must give him a big reward.

212
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,620
Luo?

213
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,140
Seems to be the Second Prince.

214
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,940
The enemies behind the Crown Prince

215
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,100
caught up quickly.

216
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,060
Will the Second Prince come to
the Crown Prince’s aid?

217
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,300
Zhang?

218
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,540
You... You...!

219
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,540
Zhang, don’t run! Zhang!

220
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,020
My God.

221
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,380
At such a critical moment,

222
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,180
the Second Prince is going after
the Crown Prince.

223
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Is the Second Prince

224
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,180
possessed by a demon?

225
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,620
Zhang, don’t run. Zhang.

226
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,900
You will lose anyway.

227
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,380
Zhang, don’t run. Zhang.

228
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,340
The Second Prince hit one enemy.

229
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,020
I want to praise
his extraordinary wisdom.

230
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,700
The Second Prince feigned infighting

231
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,940
and deceived his opponents successfully.

232
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,660
This tactic

233
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,580
will surely go down in history.

234
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,420
Don’t run, Zhang.

235
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,780
Zhang.

236
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,300
Luo.

237
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,940
Luo, what do you want?

238
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,260
Sorry, Zhang.

239
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,180
Cousin Luo!

240
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,700
Finally I got you.

241
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,860
Ban Hua!

242
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,260
Exactly.

243
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,060
This is how the Exciting Hunting works.

244
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,780
Only the winner will survive.

245
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,900
Cousin Hua. Luckily I got you.

246
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,900
Ban Heng.

247
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,660
What’s the situation now?

248
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,580
Your Grace.

249
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,460
Looks like...

250
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,820
Seems that

251
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,620
the Crown Prince was shot by

252
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,140
the Second Prince.

253
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,060
So he was eliminated.

254
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,980
What?

255
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,980
Luo is unreasonable.

256
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,820
He got eliminated and he
dragged down the Crown Prince.

257
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,380
Your Majesty, calm down.

258
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,460
Today is your birthday feast.

259
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,140
Bless me. I must hit him this time.

260
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,780
This is not going well.

261
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,340
The foreign team
launched a fierce attack

262
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,980
after the Daye team lost its leader.

263
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,020
Now there are only two pillars
of civil and military,

264
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,540
Shi Jin and Rong Xia.

265
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,140
Will Mr. Shi and Count Cheng’an

266
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,860
turn the tide

267
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,980
and protect the dignity
of our Daye, the host country?

268
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,740
Let’s keep watching.

269
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,900
I didn’t expect to teach Jiang Luo

270
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,020
a lesson in a game.

271
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,740
It makes me feel so good.

272
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,420
You Grace, if you hate
the Second Prince that much,

273
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,500
I’ll kick his ass

274
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,220
after the game is over.

275
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,460
Don’t.

276
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,180
It’s not good to cause a dispute
between the two countries.

277
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,820
I didn’t expect you to be so sensible.

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,460
It makes me appreciate you more.

279
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,860
Sorry, Prince.

280
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,100
Those whom the Gods love die young.

281
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,340
Unexpectedly, the brave Mr. Shi Jin

282
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,820
also lost.

283
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,860
Thank you for saving me.

284
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,620
That’s what I should do.
We are comrades.

285
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,580
Isn’t there another reason?

286
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,300
You think too much about it.

287
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,420
Your Grace, just in case,

288
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,780
let’s split up.

289
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,700
Be careful.

290
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,380
Now the only players left on the field

291
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,900
are Prince Akeqi,

292
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,380
Princess Fule and Count Cheng’an.

293
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,180
Your Grace.

294
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,700
You...

295
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,020
Why are you blushing?

296
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,500
Maybe...

297
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,860
It’s because of the wind.

298
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,860
Why are you so close to me?

299
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,580
I...

300
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,660
There is no way for me to step back.

301
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,900
I didn’t expect you
to survive to the end.

302
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,620
That’s because I never met you.

303
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,300
I’m lucky to survive until this point.

304
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,380
Now you meet me.

305
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,940
Is it a good luck or bad luck?

306
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,820
I...

307
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,860
You are going to attack me?

308
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,060
How would I bear to attack Hua?

309
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
What’s happening?

310
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,500
Why is there no progress
on the battlefield?

311
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,580
Dear.

312
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,780
Could it be that Hua

313
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,860
doesn’t bear to let Count Cheng’an lose?

314
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,060
When he fights with Ban Hua,

315
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,700
I’m afraid Count Cheng’an
is going to be eliminated.

316
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,540
For the honor of Daye,

317
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,860
I believe Count Cheng’an will win.

318
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
I think

319
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,820
they must be courting

320
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,020
and necking now.

321
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,060
How would they care about the game?

322
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,020
Feixian, don’t listen to her.

323
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,140
Now Prince Akeqi falls for Ban Hua.

324
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,580
I’m afraid she will marry
to the foreign country soon.

325
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,580
Is Hua addicted to Count’s beauty

326
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,660
and can’t help herself again?

327
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,020
What did you call me just now?

328
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,820
Hua.

329
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,020
I want to keep calling you Hua.

330
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,380
May I?

331
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,740
Of course

332
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,060
you can.

333
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,140
It’s just that when you suddenly
called me that,

334
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,380
I’m not used to it.

335
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,740
What does he want?

336
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,700
He suddenly grabbed my hand

337
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,300
and called me Hua.

338
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,700
The game is still on.

339
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,380
Count.

340
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,820
I think we should part here.

341
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,060
Hua.

342
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,980
Don’t blame me for being reckless.

343
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,900
I don’t accept this!

344
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,500
Hua, don’t be angry.

345
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,860
I did this for Daye.

346
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:55,980
Hua.

347
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,420
Akeqi!

348
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,540
You lost.

349
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,580
Hua.

350
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,420
Count, I’m not angry now.

351
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,540
Your Grace, we won!

352
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,180
I lost to my own woman.

353
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,220
I’m willing to accept this result.

354
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,420
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

355
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,780
-Congratulations.

356
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,100
Congratulations to the winner

357
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,620
of the first
Exciting Hunting held by Daye,

358
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,100
Prince Akeqi!

359
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,060
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

360
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,980
This glory is attributed to
Princess Fule of Daye.

361
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,060
Without her fighting with me,

362
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,500
I wouldn’t win.

363
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,900
Therefore, this ultimate glory

364
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,940
is owed to Daye
and all the foreign friends!

365
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,180
Well said.

366
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,420
Come on.

367
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,820
Bring wine to Ban Hua and Prince Akeqi.

368
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,940
And I’ll award each of them
100 taels of gold.

369
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,460
-Thank you for your grace!
-Thank you for your grace!

370
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,460
Without Hua,

371
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,260
the foreign team doesn’t
have a chance to win.

372
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,620
Ban Hua stole the limelight again.

373
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,700
Can it be true that Mr. Shi is

374
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,500
not as good as Ban Hua
in terms of marital arts?

375
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,420
My brother is the best general in Daye.

376
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,340
How can Ban Hua compare to my brother?

377
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,180
She must have played some tricks.

378
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,420
He lost. Accept the fact.

379
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,900
Why do you have so much nonsense to say?

380
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,940
Hua, how are you going to use

381
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,900
your 100 taels of gold?

382
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,380
Do you want it?

383
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,340
Do something for me.

384
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,660
Sir, the thing is ready.

385
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,580
Good.

386
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,380
Send it there

387
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,220
when the banquet is over.

388
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,260
Yes.

389
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,020
Your Grace!

390
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,740
What can I do to change your mind?

391
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,460
For the sake of your frankness,

392
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,860
I will show you a clear way.

393
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,180
Why don’t you consider about

394
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,380
the real Shi Feixian?

395
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,660
No, Your Grace.

396
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,940
I like you, not Shi Feixian.

397
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,540
Okay.

398
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,900
Then I’ll also be frank with you.

399
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,580
I already have someone in my heart.

400
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,860
It’s impossible for us.

401
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,140
You are straightforward. I like it.

402
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,700
Why don’t we

403
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,140
become sworn brother and sister?

404
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,100
Sworn brother and sister?

405
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,620
Sister Hua.

406
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,980
I’ve been carrying this
golden knife for many years.

407
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,860
Take it as the token of our kinship.

408
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,300
But I don’t have anything suitable

409
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,980
to give back to you.

410
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,660
You don’t need to do that.

411
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,500
Just call me Brother Akeqi.
It’s better than silver and gold.

412
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,580
When will Brother Akeqi
go back to your country?

413
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,540
I’m not in a hurry to go back.

414
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,620
I want to travel around Daye.

415
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,820
Perfect.

416
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,460
There is not a place
for entertainment in Daye

417
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,420
that I don’t know.

418
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,820
Brother Akeqi, I can be your guide

419
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
when you have time.

420
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,740
Great!

421
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
Who is so bold

422
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,580
to break Count’s carriage?

423
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,940
Count, what happened to your carriage?

424
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,020
Unfortunately, my carriage is full.

425
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,260
I can’t take you back to your mansion.

426
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,660
Thank you for your concern.

427
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,900
I will ask someone
to fix it immediately.

428
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,300
Can it be fixed?

429
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,020
The sunlight is strong. Don’t faint.

430
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,660
Can the carriage be repaired?

431
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
It can’t be fixed
with these two things missing.

432
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,660
You little brat.

433
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,860
Why did you break his carriage?

434
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,820
Hua asked me to do it.

435
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,260
He used his beauty

436
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,660
to set me up first.

437
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,020
Your Grace.

438
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,780
Do you have any umbrellas to lend to me?

439
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,660
Yes. Hold on.

440
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,580
This is my umbrella.

441
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,700
If you don’t mind,

442
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
just use mine.

443
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,740
Beautiful umbrella with beautiful man.

444
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,860
It’s perfect.

445
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,020
If I can use your umbrella,

446
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,980
I’ll rank first in the capital.

447
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,300
-You are bad.
-Mean girl.

448
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,260
Young Master,
I also brought an umbrella.

449
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,180
Should we change it?

450
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,740
No need. This umbrella is good.

451
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,340
Count Cheng’an,
your umbrella is quite unique.

452
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,300
This is given by Princess Fule.

453
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,260
What a coincidence
to be seen by Mr. Shi.

454
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,900
It’s no coincidence.

455
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,940
This is the only way
to leave the Palace.

456
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,420
It will be a coincidence
if we don’t meet.

457
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,700
Right.

458
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,780
Those who have the same goal will meet.

459
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,980
That’s interesting.

460
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,580
I should leave.

461
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,300
It’s rare for Mr. Shi
to reveal his true feelings.

462
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,700
And it’s because of this umbrella.

463
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,740
Count.

464
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,620
Why don’t we...

465
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,820
Thank you for your kindness.

466
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,900
It’s improper for men and women
to have physical contact,

467
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,900
not to mention sharing
the same carriage.

468
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,500
Miss Shi, please go back.

469
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,140
Your story with the Shi family’s

470
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,140
brother and sister
is indeed complicated.

471
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,940
I’m gentle, virtuous and knowledgeable.

472
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,900
How is Ban Hua better than me?

473
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
You said it’s improper for men and women
to have physical contact.

474
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,740
Then why did you ask her
for the umbrella?

475
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,140
Jin.

476
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,500
Feixian.

477
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,980
Are you all right?

478
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,180
Jin. Tell me.

479
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,380
Does Rong Xia really
fall in love with Ban Hua?

480
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,100
Do I really not deserve Rong Xia?

481
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,620
Rong Xia is unfathomable.

482
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,060
The Rong clan
doesn’t have many people left.

483
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,780
Feixian.

484
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,420
He is not a good match for you.

485
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,540
Who is the good match
for me in your eyes?

486
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,220
Xie Qilin, Xie Chongjin or Yan Zhen?

487
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,380
Jin, do you really think

488
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,780
they are better than Rong Xia?

489
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,580
Fine.

490
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,380
Even we agree you to marry Rong Xiao,

491
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,140
but how does he feel about you?

492
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
What happened at the banquet last time

493
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,500
can’t still make you understand it?

494
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,660
He just didn’t want to start a family.

495
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,780
He was not rejecting me.

496
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,300
Feixian,
you are a highborn lady in Daye.

497
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,380
You have a lot of choices.

498
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,460
Why are you so drawn to Count Cheng’an?

499
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,700
Jin.

500
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,260
There are also a lot of
great women in Daye.

501
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,180
Why are you obsessed with Ban Hua?

502
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,420
Feixian. As for Count Cheng’an,

503
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,140
I will ask Grandfather about it.

504
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,300
Rest early.

505
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,340
Grandpa, Feixian...

506
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,460
I will ask someone

507
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,740
to sound Count Cheng’an out.

508
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,060
But you and Ban Hua...

509
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,460
I’m in no hurry.

510
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,300
It’s no hurry.
But you have to make a move.

511
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,060
Princess Royal

512
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,300
has agreed with your marriage.

513
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,820
Princess Royal agreed with me
and Princess Ban Hua getting married?

514
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,020
If you really like Ban Hua,

515
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,260
you should fight for it.

516
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,380
Princess Royal

517
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,900
is not very satisfied with
Count Cheng’an.

518
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,140
But she is fond of you.

519
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,180
Really?

520
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,740
When did I ever lie to you?

521
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,460
Remember to do your best.

522
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,420
Don’t miss such a good chance,
understand?

523
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,100
I understand.

524
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,540
I’ll keep your words in mind.

525
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,620
If Jin can marry Ban Hua,

526
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,980
it will be much more convenient

527
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,620
to find the Tiger Tally
at the Ban’s family.

528
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,900
His Majesty.

529
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,260
In addition to those sleepless nights,

530
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,020
is there any other discomfort?

531
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,740
I’ve had headaches
from time to time recently.

532
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,340
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

533
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,820
This is a sign of hyperactivity
of fire due to yin deficiency.

534
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,580
I’ll prescribe medicine
and give you acupuncture.

535
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
It will alleviate your pain.

536
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,820
I see.

537
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,300
I’ll leave.

538
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,820
Your Highness.

539
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,140
I can feel that my body

540
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,380
is not as good as before.

541
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,620
Count Rong.

542
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,940
You must assist
the Crown Prince wholeheartedly

543
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,380
and share more national affairs for me.

544
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,580
All right?

545
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

546
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,700
I still have other things to do.

547
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,500
Your Highness should
find someone better qualified.

548
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,460
Count Rong, do you really
want to turn me down?

549
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
Do you know

550
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,980
why Princess Royal

551
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,980
wouldn’t tell you the truth
about what happened?

552
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,460
That’s because the tragedy
of the Rong family

553
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,420
is caused by

554
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,860
Princess Royal.

555
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,660
Young Master,

556
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,180
would it be too risky?

557
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,420
Only in this way

558
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,460
can we burn ourselves
and then reborn from the ash.

559
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,620
Your Majesty.

560
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,020
Because of heavy snow everywhere,

561
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,340
plus the previous food shortage,

562
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,260
the number of victims
seems to be increasing.

563
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,740
Your Master, due to the influence
of the food shortage,

564
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,980
tax goes down a lot everywhere.

565
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,780
If the situation deteriorates,

566
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,260
I’m afraid the expense
in the Palace needs to be cut back.

567
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,660
Father.

568
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,780
I heard that the county under
the jurisdiction of Xie Chongjin

569
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,860
paid more taxes and tributes

570
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,900
than before.

571
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,460
I think

572
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,180
the food shortage does not matter.

573
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,380
What matters is
whether the local officials

574
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,180
have the ability to
solve the food shortage.

575
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,140
Since Xie Chongjin did it,

576
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,860
why can’t others do it?

577
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,780
That’s right. Xie Chongjin
is indeed a talent.

578
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,460
He should play a more important role.

579
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

580
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,900
It’s his duty to work for Your Majesty.

581
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,580
He should try his best
no matter where he is.

582
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,260
He dares not neglect his duty.

583
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,220
Crown Prince, what do you think?

584
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,900
I think

585
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,820
for such a talent like Xie Chongjin,

586
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,980
we should send someone
to ask him for advice.

587
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:29,940
Father.

588
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,060
We should transfer
such a talent back to the capital!

589
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,300
Your Majesty.

590
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,140
I think the priority

591
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,060
is to solve the financial problems
in various places.

592
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,460
It’s better to transfer Xie Chongjin
back to the capital immediately

593
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,780
and let him take an important position.

594
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,060
Count Cheng’an has a point.

595
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,020
Pass my order.

596
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,740
Transfer Xie Chongjin back
to the capital immediately.

597
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,860
I want to hear the way
of his governance in person.

598
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,500
Greetings to Your Highness!

599
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,620
What’s the matter?

600
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,860
Your Highness.

601
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,860
We received your relieve aid

602
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,020
at your birthday banquet.

603
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,980
I thought our village
can survive this winter

604
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,900
thanks to your grace.

605
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,620
Unexpectedly,

606
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,860
the money you donated

607
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
was all looted by Mr. Xie Chongjin.

608
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,900
That’s outrageous.

609
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,420
Now the villagers are starving

610
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,220
and suffering miserably.

611
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,340
There were people who starved
to death a few days ago.

612
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,500
That’s ridiculous.

613
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,300
Why don’t you report it to the court?

614
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,100
There is something you don’t know.

615
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,980
That county magistrate set up numerous
barriers along the road to the capital

616
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,700
to prevent us from telling on him.

617
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,460
The two of us tried hard
to cross the mountain

618
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,260
and make it here.

619
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Your Highness, please save us villagers!

620
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,100
-Save us!
-Save us villagers!

621
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,300
Such a corrupt official deserves death!

622
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,020
Where is this Xie Chongjin from?

623
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,900
He is the eldest son of Count Xie.

624
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,820
Hua, where are you going?

625
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,140
I’m gonna see His Majesty
and tell on Xie Chongjin!

626
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,860
Your… Your Grace.

627
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,940
You...

628
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,340
What’s this?

629
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,740
I bought something for you

630
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,620
in a shop on my way here.

631
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,660
Then I happen to run into you.

632
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,420
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

633
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,900
Madam.

634
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,100
Mr. Shi, hurry up and chase Her Grace.

635
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,020
Where is Her Grace going in a hurry?

636
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,180
Her Highness’s disaster relief fund
donated at her birthday banquet

637
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,540
was embezzled by the eldest son
of the Xie family.

638
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,620
Her Grace went to see His Majesty
to tell on him.

639
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,140
Her Highness worries that she
might be caught in a court battle

640
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,220
and bring danger to herself.

641
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,540
Mr. Shi, please stop Her Grace now.

642
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,060
Where’s Cui? Why didn’t I see him?

643
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,260
Cui just went out.

644
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,220
He said there is an urgency.

645
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,700
My good cousin.

646
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,300
Why do you show up
in the Palace suddenly?

647
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,060
Of course to send a big gift for you.

648
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,700
The weasel pays respect to the hen.

649
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,980
What is your intention?

650
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,620
So you admit that you are a hen?

651
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,460
You...!

652
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,900
Cousin Ban, aren’t you afraid

653
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,500
that your mouth and your head

654
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,620
will be relocated one day?

655
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,580
I’m not afraid.

656
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,660
Those who deceive
the Emperor should be afraid.

657
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,900
Am I right?

658
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,300
Cousin Hua.

659
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,540
What’s your gift for me?

660
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,580
Why are you in a hurry?

661
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,100
Let’s tell His Majesty the fact.

662
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,140
Ban Hua! What do you want?

663
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,100
Well, Cousin Luo.

664
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,180
Have you done something wrong?

665
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,220
Why do you fear so much
that I want to see His Majesty?

666
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Father is busy with
handling national affairs.

667
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,020
It’s not like you can see him
at any time you want.

668
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,980
Go away.

669
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,900
Her Grace lost her courtesy
out of a momentary rush.

670
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,300
Please forgive her.

671
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,740
Your Grace, Princess Royal
has an emergency.

672
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,940
She ordered you to go back immediately.

673
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,500
I’ll report to His Majesty
about the embezzlement.

674
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,500
Why would you do that?

675
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,300
Your Grace, you are smart enough.

676
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,060
Why ask knowingly?

677
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,260
Princess Royal kept
a low profile these years.

678
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,060
She doesn’t want you
to interfere in court affairs.

679
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,780
You should know the reason.

680
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,940
I’m going to interfere in this.

681
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,660
Your Grace! Why can’t you understand

682
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,060
our efforts trying to protect you?

683
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,140
Your Majesty.

684
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,660
Humans are born with desire.

685
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,740
If they can’t satisfy their desires,
they will try everything to make it.

686
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,860
If they still can’t have what they want,
then there will be wars.

687
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,860
If the people live and work
in peace and contentment,

688
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,700
then the court will have no worries.

689
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,420
And a thousand years
of peaceful time will begin.

690
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,380
Well said.

691
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,260
Minister Xie is indeed
talented and strategic.

692
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,900
Luo.

693
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,020
You are insightful about
the recommendation this time.

694
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,340
It’s my duty to share your worries

695
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,700
and recommend talents for Daye.

696
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,300
Your Majesty,

697
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,260
Commander of Imperial Guard,
Shi Jin presents himself.

698
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,220
Let him in.

699
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,740
Your Majesty.

700
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,740
I met refugees on the street
when I was patrolling today.

701
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,100
They complained that the donations
made by the Princess Royal

702
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,220
was embezzled by
a shameless official to pay taxes,

703
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,540
which left the people
starving and suffering.

704
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,900
Who is so bold

705
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,620
to embezzle Princess Royal’s donation?

706
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,780
Your Majesty. People are
the foundation of the country.

707
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,300
This matter is too important.
We must look into it.

708
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,220
Drop the act.

709
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,180
The corrupt official
they are taking about is you,

710
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,900
Xie Chongjin.

711
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,100
Me?

712
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,140
Shi Jin, what do you mean?

713
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,660
Mr. Xie has no grievances with you.

714
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,180
Why do you smear him?

715
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,780
Your Majesty, I swear by my position.

716
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,100
I didn’t tell any lies.

717
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,460
Your Highness, if you don’t believe it,

718
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,460
you can ask the victims.

719
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,860
Well...

720
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,740
How can you do something like this?

721
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,860
Xie Chongjin, I’m really
disappointed at you!

722
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,260
I deserve to die.

723
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,340
I was possessed by demons
and had a momentary lapse.

724
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,620
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

725
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,300
Xie Chongjin, you are shameless!

726
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,100
You just made an eloquent
speech in front of me.

727
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,740
Now you knelt down and begged for mercy.

728
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,940
It won’t assuage popular anger
if I don’t kill you!

729
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,260
Take him out!

730
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,580
Flog him to death!

731
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,460
Your Majesty, please calm down.

732
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,420
We don’t know the truth yet.

733
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,100
Please suspend the punishment.

734
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,420
Let’s find out the fact first.

735
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,100
Count Cheng’an has a point.

736
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,740
Father, please calm down.

737
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,060
Take him to prison

738
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,300
and wait for the sentencing.

739
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,300
Look at Chongjin.

740
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,540
He went to the Palace today.

741
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,620
Tomorrow he will be a minister.

742
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,660
Look at Wanyu.

743
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,060
She’s going to be a concubine
of the Prince.

744
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,940
Look at you.

745
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,860
You’ve been idle all day;

746
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,700
Can’t you learn from Chongjin?

747
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,460
I don’t know how Chongjin thinks.

748
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,940
But I know

749
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,820
Wanyu doesn’t want to marry
the Second Prince at all.

750
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,740
How do you know?

751
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,420
You are unambitious
and you still talk back to me.

752
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,940
I’m unambitious.

753
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,500
That’s why I listen to you
about everything.

754
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,940
It’s your call whether
the Ban family is good or not.

755
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,580
You... Don’t you dare talk back!

756
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,180
You...!

757
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
I’ll hit you!

758
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,980
Father!

759
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,220
Don’t hit me! I was wrong!

760
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,620
Father!

761
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,700
-Don’t you dare run!
-Father!

762
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,540
Stop!

763
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,460
Don’t you dare cry up the Ban family.

764
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,180
I think you should be blind in two eyes!

765
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,180
All you think about is money and status.

766
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,020
You can see nothing
but promotion and wealth!

767
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,820
You are the one who is blind!

768
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,300
How dare you be so rude!

769
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,380
I’ll beat you to death!

770
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,460
Don’t beat him!

771
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,300
Master! Master!

772
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,020
I’m going to kill you!

773
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,780
Mother!

774
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,780
Son, just don’t talk back.

775
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,460
Father, don’t be angry.

776
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,380
Decayed wood cannot be carved.

777
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,860
I’ll thank God

778
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,220
if you have half of Chongjin’s brain!

779
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,060
Master. Master!

780
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,900
Young Master misappropriated donations

781
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,060
and was sent to prison by His Majesty.

782
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,100
What?

783
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,620
-Mother!
-Mother!

784
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,660
Father, I can’t learn
this move from Chongjin.

785
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,380
You...!

786
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,820
How would Chongjin
do such a thing?

787
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,500
He won’t.

788
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,500
Chongjin would never do such a thing.

789
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,380
Someone must have set him up.

790
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,700
It’s said that Mr. Shi told on him.

791
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,740
He met someone at Mansion
of Peace and Longevity first.

792
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,340
Then he entered the Palace
and reported to His Majesty.

793
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,260
What?

794
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,580
It’s the old fox Minister Shi.

795
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,340
He set my son up with the Ban family.

796
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,980
After Minister Yan left,

797
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,180
the Shi family becomes
ever-more powerful.

798
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,900
I wanted to get Xie Chongjin back

799
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,660
to balance the power in the court.

800
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,900
Unexpectedly,

801
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,020
Shi Jin told on him

802
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,820
the second Xie Chongjin
got back to the capital.

803
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,820
Do you think it’s a coincidence

804
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,300
or the Shi family’s calculation?

805
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,060
I dare not speculate about
Minister Shi’s thoughts.

806
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,740
I can’t see through it.

807
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,340
I can only blame Xie Chongjin

808
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,540
for being such a useless person.

809
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,500
Your Majesty, please calm down.

810
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,340
I’ll take care of this
as soon as possible

811
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,780
and find out the fact.

812
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,540
There is one thing

813
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,580
I don’t know whether
I should tell you or not.

814
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,420
Then don’t.

815
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,940
I’m bothered.

816
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,540
Your Majesty.

817
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,580
After second thoughts,
I think I have to say.

818
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,820
It concerns Princess Royal.

819
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,060
To find out the fact,

820
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,780
I must visit Princess Royal.

821
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,020
Princess Royal?

822
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,660
Your Majesty has always wanted to know

823
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,220
whether the Tiger Tally is in Mansion of
Peace and Longevity, right?

824
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,980
Although I have the military power now,

825
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,940
after Old General Ban died,

826
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,340
the soldiers who once followed him
retired and went back their homeland.

827
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,500
They are scattered all over Daye.

828
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,740
There is a large number of them,
and they are extremely loyal.

829
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,100
There is a rule in the army that

830
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,860
seeing the Tiger Tally is just like
seeing the Old General Ban.

831
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,140
I have been worrying

832
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,060
that if the Tiger Tally
falls into the wrong hands

833
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,140
and soldiers will be called on
to put on their amour again.

834
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,020
This force

835
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,740
is really eating me up.

836
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,620
I understand.

837
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,260
Last time at the birthday banquet,

838
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,300
Mansion of Peace and Longevity
was stirred up.

839
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,540
I will be more cautious this time

840
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,460
and find out the whereabouts
of the Tiger Tally for Your Majesty.

841
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,460
Good.

842
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,100
You must search the entire

843
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,820
Mansion of Peace and Longevity for me.

844
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,700
Yes. Your Majesty.
