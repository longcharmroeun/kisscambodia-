<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 15</i>

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,500
I’ve been waiting for you,
Your Highness.

37
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,180
What’s the smell?

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,060
Smells like a hog lot.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,700
Your Highness, if you hadn’t asked me
to come back hurriedly,

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,820
you needn’t have come
to such a dirty place.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,580
You mean

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,180
it’s my fault?

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,660
I don’t dare.

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,620
If Father hadn’t summoned
the Crown Prince secretly,

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,340
I wouldn’t have
called you back in a hurry.

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,780
When you wanted me
to gain recognition from His Majesty,

47
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,180
political achievements would be
most convincing.

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,820
But why did you use
Princess Royal’s money

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,540
for disaster relief,

50
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,940
instead of your own money?

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,060
Do you think everyone is as rich

52
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,860
as the Ban family?

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,140
Time was pressing.

54
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,020
How could I get

55
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,540
such a large sum of money?

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,740
I’ll do anything for you, Your Highness.

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,940
But when I’m stuck here,

58
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,060
I can’t give you any advice.

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,260
All right. All right.

60
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,780
Don’t be anxious.

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,460
I’ll try

62
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,780
to get you out soon.

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,980
I don’t want to come
to such a place again.

64
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Today, Rong Xia defended you.

66
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,140
But I still don’t fully believe

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,540
that he’s working for me.

68
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,180
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,900
I’ve got a plan.

70
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,260
If Rong Xia doesn’t cooperate
with us sincerely,

71
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,500
he’ll also be screwed
in my interlocked stratagems.

72
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,940
I’m leaving.

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,300
Cui?

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,260
Cui.

75
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Madam Chang.

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Why are you in the study?

77
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,700
I... I find too much dust in the study

78
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,860
when it hasn’t been cleaned
for a long time.

79
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,700
I came to clean it.

80
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,690
Okay.

81
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,340
Go to tell Her Highness!

82
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,860
Yes!

83
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,940
Who are you that come
in the middle of night?

84
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,740
<i>Token</i>

85
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,420
<i>Token</i>
Get out of the way.

86
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,860
Yes!

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,300
Your Grace, why are you coming
in the middle of night

88
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,100
with the soldiers?

89
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,340
<i>Token</i>

90
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,420
At the behest of His Majesty,

91
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,580
this mansion has been harassed
by refugees

92
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,900
and things were stolen.

93
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,420
I’m ordered to come with soldiers

94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,940
to protect this mansion.

95
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,620
Well,

96
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,780
Your Grace, please defend the mansion

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,780
by guarding around.

98
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,260
Madam Chang, His Majesty ordered me

99
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,660
to get in and check carefully,

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,660
so that I can make sure
no one is hidden here

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,460
and keep Princess Royal safe.

102
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,060
In this mansion, they are servants

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,500
who have been working
for Her Highness for years.

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,340
No one is suspicious.

105
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,380
You come with so many people.

106
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,980
If you disturb Her Highness,

107
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,980
I’m afraid you can’t explain
to His Majesty.

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,420
Her Highness is a royal lady.

109
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,180
Nothing can go wrong.

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,820
Madam Chang, please step back

111
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,980
so that I can get in for a search

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,940
and relieve His Majesty.

113
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,780
Ridiculous!

114
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,020
How would His Majesty
give such an order?

115
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,940
Unless His Majesty came personally,

116
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,340
none of you

117
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,620
would get in.

118
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,460
It’s indeed an order from His Majesty.

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,820
Madam Chang, if you insist
on stopping us,

120
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,340
sorry for being impolite.

121
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,060
You!

122
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,380
Your Grace, what do you mean?

123
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,700
If you dare to come forward,

124
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,460
you’ll be sorry!

125
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,300
This is an order from His Majesty.

126
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,420
Please make way, Your Grace.

127
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,380
I won’t.

128
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,820
Hua, step back!

129
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,140
Madam Chang.

130
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,540
Take Her Grace to the side hall
for some rest.

131
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,220
Don’t let her out without my permission.

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,180
Yes, Your Highness!

133
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,740
Your Grace, please go.

134
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,700
Go.

135
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,220
Since it’s an order from His Majesty,

136
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,380
Your Grace, come in, please.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

138
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,620
Search!

139
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,580
It doesn’t feel right.

140
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,620
His Majesty knows

141
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,460
Count Cheng’an is friendly with us.

142
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,660
Why did he send Count Cheng’an
to search this place?

143
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,500
What does His Majesty really want?

144
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,220
Why did Count Cheng’an break in,

145
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,100
regardless of our relationship?

146
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,780
I thought you were
only talented in literary.

147
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,900
Unexpectedly, you’re also good

148
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,740
at deploying the soldiers.

149
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,300
It’s wasting your talent

150
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,580
to search my mansion.

151
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,900
Your Highness.

152
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,180
I’m just executing the order.

153
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,860
No offense.

154
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,940
Search!

155
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,820
Yes!

156
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,460
Mother!

157
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
Your Highness.

158
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,820
Why is this bracelet

159
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,780
in your study?

160
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,780
This doesn’t belong to me.

161
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,140
I’ve never seen it before!

162
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,220
You’ve never seen it before?

163
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,540
This is my mother’s bequest.

164
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,340
Your Grace.

165
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,780
You racked your brains to break in

166
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,460
just for this?

167
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,100
It was smart of you.

168
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,180
Without the warrant from His Majesty,

169
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,260
I’m afraid I would never know

170
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,940
you hid my mother’s bequest

171
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,020
in your study!

172
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
How dare you!

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,340
My parents died out of a reason.

174
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
You insisted that you knew nothing.

175
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,940
If you really didn’t know,

176
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,940
why would you have my mother’s bequest?

177
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
Don’t you fear
that my parents would question you

178
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,900
in your dream?

179
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,980
Your Highness, over the years,

180
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,260
how could you sleep soundly?

181
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,420
Madam Chang! Madam Chang!

182
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,500
Something wrong with Her Highness!

183
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,260
Your Grace.

184
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,140
Madam Chang, take me to see Grandmother.

185
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,860
Your Grace, I found nothing.

186
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,260
Neither did I.

187
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,820
Grandmother!

188
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,260
Grandmother, what happened to you?

189
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,500
Your Highness.

190
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,020
I’m fine. I’m fine.

191
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,100
Your Grace.

192
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,220
What did you do to my grandmother?

193
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,420
Your Grace.

194
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,060
I just asked her

195
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,540
a few questions.

196
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
As for the reason why she’s angry...

197
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,060
You’d better ask her personally.

198
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,380
Asked her a few questions?

199
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,140
You’re just like confiscating my family!

200
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,780
Rong Xia.

201
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,860
Explain to me.

202
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,260
What you told me that night...

203
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
Does it still count?

204
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,300
Your Grace, I’ve got a duty to do today.

205
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,620
Let’s not talk
about personal relationship.

206
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,220
Fine. Let’s not talk about it.

207
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Let’s talk about business, then.

208
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,820
His Majesty sent you
to protect my grandmother.

209
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,740
But you annoyed her.

210
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,620
What punishment
do you think you deserve?

211
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,940
You and I know very well

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,060
if Her Highness is well.

213
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,220
Please don’t throw mud at me.

214
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,940
Rong Xia.

215
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,860
Don’t you fear
that I’ll tell His Majesty?

216
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,020
Don’t bother, Your Grace.

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,540
I’ll tell His Majesty

218
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,820
what has happened today.

219
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,260
You!

220
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,060
Hua!

221
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,940
Enough!

222
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,020
His Grace is just following the order.

223
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,300
Don’t be rude.

224
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,940
Somebody!

225
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,740
Here!

226
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,500
Strengthen the vigilance
around this mansion

227
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,260
in case anyone suspicious approaches!

228
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,060
Yes!

229
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,660
Princess Royal was so angry

230
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,740
that she spat blood.

231
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,380
Rong Xia left with the bracelet

232
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,420
and went to report to His Majesty.

233
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,940
Your Highness, wait to see the fun.

234
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,980
Wonderful!

235
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,780
This is wonderful!

236
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,460
Next, the Ban family will perish

237
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,740
and the Crown Prince will be dethroned!

238
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,820
Congratulations, Your Highness.

239
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,340
When the Crown Prince is dethroned,

240
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,260
you’ll be the new Crown Prince.

241
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,500
Congratulations.

242
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,820
Your Highness, Count Cheng’an asked
to see you.

243
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,260
Let him in.

244
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,420
What brings you here?

245
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,580
Shouldn’t you be in the palace

246
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,780
and reporting to His Majesty?

247
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,420
I didn’t go to the palace.

248
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,180
Rong Xia, what do you mean?

249
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,860
Are you betraying me?

250
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,140
Don’t be angry, Your Highness.

251
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,180
Princess Royal shouldn’t be dead now.

252
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,020
We agreed to break down the Ban family.

253
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,340
They won’t be eliminated
before Princess Royal is dead.

254
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,500
Don’t you want to know

255
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,420
where the Tiger Tally is?

256
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,460
Tiger Tally?

257
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,220
If His Majesty doesn’t
dethrone the Crown Prince,

258
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,020
you’ll find it most difficult

259
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,860
to be the new Crown Prince.

260
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,380
But if you have the Tiger Tally first,

261
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,180
things will change.

262
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,340
Are you sure you can get it?

263
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,260
I will get to know where it is

264
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,820
from Princess Royal.

265
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,620
Fine.

266
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,500
Hua, stop guessing.

267
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,820
Hua.

268
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,620
Grandmother, I’m sorry.

269
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
I shouldn’t have trusted a man like him.

270
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,140
It’s not your fault.

271
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,780
Count Cheng’an came
with an imperial order.

272
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,740
We had to bear with it.

273
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,540
But His Majesty always respected you.

274
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,140
Maybe he has nothing to fear

275
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
when he knows I’m dying.

276
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Hua.

277
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,100
Hua.

278
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,860
If I die,

279
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,580
do take good care of our family.

280
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,860
Grandmother, say no more.

281
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,020
I don’t like to hear that.

282
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,380
Why do I feel hungry?

283
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,180
You’re hungry?

284
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,380
Grandmother, would you
like something to eat?

285
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
I’ll ask Madam Chang
to get the food ready.

286
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,140
I’m not hungry.

287
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Why did I suddenly

288
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,340
want some pomegranates?

289
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,380
I’ll go find some for you.

290
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,540
Silly girl.

291
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,500
How can you find any in the cold winter?

292
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,060
Grandmother, just wait for me.

293
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,380
I’ll go get some.

294
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,100
Hua. Hua!

295
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,540
You!

296
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,340
Softy. Softy. Softy.

297
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,500
I’m scared.

298
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
What are you scared of?

299
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Is there...?

300
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,380
Is there really a thief in the kitchen?

301
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,540
When I’m here,

302
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,380
I’ll beat whoever dares to break in!

303
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,940
Go!

304
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,020
Three, two, one.

305
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,900
Catch the thief!

306
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,140
Your Grace?

307
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,060
Your Grace, why are you back
in the middle of night?

308
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,100
Your Grace,
are you searching the kitchen

309
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,180
because you’re hungry?

310
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,620
Why isn’t there any midnight snack
at the Mansion of Peace and Longevity?

311
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,380
Yeah.

312
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,140
I’m not hungry.

313
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
I’m looking for the pomegranate wine.

314
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,620
Someone gave it to me before.
Where is it?

315
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,540
You want to drink it?

316
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
No. Find it out for me.

317
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,060
Your Grace, what do you
want the pomegranate wine for?

318
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,620
Grandmother wants some pomegranates.

319
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,540
But look.

320
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,420
How can I get any in the cold winter?

321
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,980
I must do it some other way.

322
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,220
I see.

323
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,380
You want to make dough pomegranates

324
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,300
and pour the wine on them.

325
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,940
Clever girls!

326
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,660
Awesome! Awesome!

327
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,620
We made it!

328
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,140
What a hard job!

329
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,540
You’d better lie down for some rest.

330
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,860
Get me the pellet.

331
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,300
Your Highness.

332
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,940
If you take more pellets, I’m afraid...

333
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,220
Bring me the pellet!

334
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,340
Yes, Your Highness.

335
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,140
Your Highness.

336
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,860
Grandmother.

337
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,620
-Your Grace.
-Madam Chang.

338
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,100
Grandmother.

339
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,860
Hua.

340
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,780
Guess what I brought.

341
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,020
I found some pomegranates for you.

342
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,860
How did you find any on such a cold day?

343
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,940
Look at you.

344
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You really got me some pomegranates?

345
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,660
Grandmother, what’s wrong?

346
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,980
I didn’t expect

347
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,700
to taste some pomegranates again.

348
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,100
Who looks most like me?

349
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,220
-Who?
-Your Highness.

350
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,420
Who of the younger generation
looks most like me?

351
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,540
Madam?

352
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,980
Hua looks most like me.

353
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,380
Her Grace is fiery.

354
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,740
She looks more like Old General Ban.

355
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,700
When I was young,

356
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,980
everyone held a modest attitude to me.

357
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,140
I dared to love and hate, just like her.

358
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,460
When I see her,

359
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,700
I feel like seeing the young me.

360
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,300
Your Highness.

362
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,420
I was born in the palace.

363
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,220
I should also die there.

364
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,580
Madam Chang, dress me up.

365
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,540
Your Majesty, Princess Royal asked
to meet you.

366
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,420
Get her in.

367
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,660
Your Majesty, it’s been long
since I last visited you.

368
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,460
It’s a fine day.

369
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,700
I come without invitation.

370
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,740
You’ll welcome me, won’t you?

371
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,620
Aunt, you can come whenever you want.

372
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,020
Come and be seated.

373
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:04,900
Get us some tea.

374
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,740
Yes.

375
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,540
Aunt, I was just going to tell you.

376
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,060
Yesterday, I sent more guards

377
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,660
to protect you.

378
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,300
Unexpectedly, Count Cheng’an was so rude

379
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,820
that he made you spit blood.

380
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,460
I’ll punish him.

381
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,700
I certainly know

382
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,780
you cared for me.

383
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,900
Count Cheng’an did nothing wrong.

384
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,300
It’s generous of you, Aunt.

385
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,140
I didn’t know you would come

386
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,260
and I didn’t have
your favorite tea prepared.

387
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,700
When I’m getting old,

388
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,380
I can’t help recalling the past.

389
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,540
It’s now winter.

390
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,660
I recalled the outing

391
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,380
I went to with your father.

392
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,820
You were just three to five years old.

393
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,460
You snapped a branch covered with snow,

394
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,300
thinking it was a caterpillar.

395
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,100
You yelled and ran to me,

396
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,260
giving it to me as a gift.

397
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,500
Yes.

398
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,700
You got all the snow on my head.

399
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Your father scolded you.

400
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,660
Yes. Yes.

401
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,580
I remember.

402
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,940
I had black hair covered with snow.

403
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,020
But now, I have grey hair.

404
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,140
It’s been so many years.

405
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,940
Aunt,

406
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,260
you can even remember that.

407
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,500
That’s because

408
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,220
no matter how much time has passed,

409
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,860
how many difficulties
you’ve gone through,

410
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,220
or who you are,

411
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,020
you’re always the naughty boy

412
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,780
who tricks his own aunt.

413
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,100
My father died at a young age.

414
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Without your help,

415
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,060
I would have been dead in plots.

416
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,980
I can hardly repay you in my life.

417
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,220
I remember another time.

418
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,100
You were like this tall.

419
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,500
You were playing with some crickets

420
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
when they suddenly ran away.

421
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,940
You cried loudly.

422
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,060
Yes.

Grandmother!

427
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,580

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,860
Your Grace, get off the horse!
Your Grace!

432
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,420
Chase after her!

433
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,500
When I was little,

434
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,820
I was indeed timid.

435
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,060
Aunt.

436
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,900
You always have great tea.

437

You even have spring tea in winter.

Aunt, if you like it,

439
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,540
I’ll have some sent to your mansion.

440
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:14,980
Get us more tea.

441
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,860
Are you going to fill me with tea

442
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,060
so that I won’t stay for dinner?

443

445
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,380
Your Grace, please stop!

446
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,460
Your Grace.

447
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,620
Get out of the way!

448
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,940
Are you alright?

449
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,180
I’ll kill whoever stops me!

450
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,660
It’s you?

451
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,980
Let me say it again.
Get out of the way!

452
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,620
Stop!

453
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,900

454

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,420
Go with me.

458
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,220
Your Grace, please leave with me.

Go with me, or it’ll be too late!

461
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,980
Can I trust you again?

462
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I’m not hardhearted.

463
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,380
I will take you to Princess Royal.

464
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,860
Commander Shi,
do we still run after her?

465
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,260
No.

I’ll report to His Majesty.

Come! What are you waiting for?

485
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,980
Check on her. You must save her!

So... Sorry.

487
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,060
Princess Royal’s heart is hurt.

Get me all the Imperial Physicians!
Hurry!

00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,900
Yes, Your Majesty!

492
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,780
Aunt, hold on.

493
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,380
The physicians are coming.

494
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,020

495
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,540
Rui.

496
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,780
I’m here.

497
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,900
I’m already old.

498
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,060
I know I’ll die.

499
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,430
Aunt!

500
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,820
I’ve done enough to my nation.

501
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,940
But...

502
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,860
Hua. Hua. Hua!

503
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,860
Hurry!

504
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,140
Go get Princess Fule
and Marquis Jingting!

505

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,980
I’m too late.

513
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,380
I’m so useless.

514
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,460
Don’t cry, good girl.

515
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,300
Why are you in a red dress?

516
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,660
You’re married?

517
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,140
Who is your husband?

518
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,340
Grandmother.

519
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,380
Grandmother.

520
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,500
Be nice to Hua.

521
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,340
Otherwise,

522
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,740
I won’t let you off.

523
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,620
Don’t worry, Grandmother.

524
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,540
I’ll take good care of her.

525
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,340
Mother!

526
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,290
Mother!

527
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,250
-Mother!
-Grandmother!

528
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,460
-Mother!
-Mother, what happened?

529
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,300
-Mother!
-Grandmother!

530
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,420
Son, here you are.

531
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,100
Yes. Yes. Mother!

532
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,020
-Mother!
-Mother, what happened to you?

533
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,620
-Mother!
-Mother!

534
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,340
Hua’s husband

535
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,740
looks handsome.

536
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,740
Take good care of them.

537
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,020
Aunt,

538
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,820
I will.

539
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,220
I...

540
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,940
I’m going to see my husband.

541
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,980
-Mother!
-Grandmother!

542
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,620
Your Majesty.

543
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,300
Bury me

544
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,140
with...

545
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,660
with my...

546
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,500
my husband.

547
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,380
Mother!

548
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,540
-Grandmother!
-Mother!

549
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,980
-Mother!
-Grandmother!

550
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,740
-Mother!
-Mother!

551
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,500
-Grandmother!
-Mother!

552
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,220
Mother!

553
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,300
-Aunt!
-Grandmother!

554
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,620
My mother is gone! Mother!

555
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,740
Mother!

556
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,660
I saw that in my dream!

557
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,180
Grandmother!

558
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,460
Hua, it’s not your fault.

559
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,460
Grandmother, wake up! Grandmother!

560
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,140
-Mother!
-Grandmother!

561
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,220
Grandmother, wake up!

562
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,820
Your Majesty.

563
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,820
I’ve adored Princess Fule
for a long time.

564
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,700
Please marry her to me.

565
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,860
Why are you saying this at this moment?

566
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,420
Your Majesty.

567
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,740
Princess Royal is dead.

568
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,380
I don’t want to break my promise.

569
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,060
It’s my honor to marry Princess Fule.

570
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,540
Please marry her to me, Your Majesty.

571
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,580
Mother!

572
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,220
Princess Royal Dening

573
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,740
is dead!

574
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,820
Princess Royal has great reputation
and is going to heaven!

575
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:44,620
Princess Royal has great reputation
and is going to heaven!

576
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,940
Princess Royal is dead!

577
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,100
Emperor Yunqing fulfilled her wish

578
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,460
and buried her with Old General Ban.

579
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,540
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>
She was buried in Ban’s Ancestral Hall

580
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,860
and was titled Princess Royal Dening.

581
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,780
Everyone in the nation should mourn
for three months

582
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,420
when there should be no entertainment
or wedding.

583
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,780
The whole nation will be in mourning
with an amnesty.

584
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,900
Sir, we’re not enemies.

585
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,740
I’ll... I’ll give you all this.

586
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,020
Please spare me!

587
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,180
Not enemies?

588
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,140
Madam Chang! Madam Chang, help me!

589
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,820
Cui.

590
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,380
Princess Royal was nice to you.

591
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,540
Why did you betray her?

592
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,260
I was confused! I was mad about money!

593
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,500
Madam Chang, forgive me!

594
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,100
Forgive you?

595
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,780
It’s what Princess Royal should do.

596
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,100
Ask her for forgiveness yourself.

597
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,220
Madam Chang!

598
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,460
Your Highness, thank you for saving me.

599
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,380
Don’t thank me.

600
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,060
If Princess Royal didn’t die
in the palace

601
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,500
and Father granted an amnesty,

602
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,300
I wouldn’t have got you out.

603
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,740
Watch your language, Your Highness.

604
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,180
Xie Chongjin, tell me.

605
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,340
We had planned to make Rong Xia
fight against Princess Royal

606
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,300
so that I could get benefits.

607
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,860
But now why are they

608
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,820
getting closer?

609
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,140
If the Crown Prince has more power,

610
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,020
my plan to be the Crown Prince
will be empty talk.

611
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
Is this your plan?

612
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,460
Princess Royal died unexpectedly.

613
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,900
It was also surprising

614
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,700
when His Majesty married Ban Hua
to Count Cheng’an.

615
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,900
But since Princess Royal is dead,

616
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,500
you don’t need to fear the Ban family.

617
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,740
You’re right.

618
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,300
I can take the chance

619
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,740
to get rid of the Ban family
and Count Cheng’an together.

620
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,700
Your Highness, there’s a bright future.

621
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,020
Why do you choose a worse one?

622
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,220
What do you mean?

623
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,100
Isn’t it the perfect chance

624
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,500
to get rid of the Ban family
or Count Cheng’an?

625
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,940
Your Highness,
have you thought about it?

626
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,740
When you don’t have real power,

627
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,540
even if the Crown Prince has
no supporters,

628
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,820
you can’t be the new Crown Prince.

629
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,300
But when you have the military power,

630
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,500
even if all ministers
support the Crown Prince,

631
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,300
you don’t need to be scared.

632
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,300
You mean…?

633
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,100
Just get to the point.

634
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,220
Count Cheng’an or Ban Hua isn’t the key.

635
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,460
The key is

636
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,460
the Tiger Tally.

637
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
-Greetings, Your Majesty!
-Greetings, Your Majesty!

638
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,900
Your Majesty.

639
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,540
Before Princess Royal Dening died,

640
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,700
she asked you to take care of yourself.

641
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,820
Now, you’re so self-accused

642
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,420
that you don’t investigate
the assassination case.

643
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,020
I’m afraid Princess Royal will
be uneasy in heaven.

644
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,740
Sorry for my wild words, Your Majesty.
Please punish me.

645
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,300
I know

646
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,820
you care for me,

647
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,740
just like my aunt.

648
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,940
What have imperial guards got

649
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,860
for the case?

650
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,820
Your Majesty.

651
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,860
The assassin was disguised
as the tea servant.

652
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,260
He ran away from the study
after the assassination

653
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,660
and was caught by imperial guards
in the northeast.

654
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,980
Then he poisoned himself.

655
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,260
As for who he is

656
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,540
and when he sneaked into the palace,

657
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,020
I’m not sure.

658
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,660
There are so many imperial guards

659
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,380
in such a small palace.

660
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,460
But they can’t figure out
one single assassin.

661
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,460
What do I need you for?

662
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,860
Get out!

663
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,340
Get out!

664
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

665
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,380
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

666
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,300
Commander Shi has great martial arts.

667
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,220
But he isn’t good at investigation.

668
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,740
May I investigate this case

669
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,260
and figure out what happened?

670
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,980
Now,

671
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,580
you’re the only one

672
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,580
who can help me.

673
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,220
You must figure out

674
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,180
who is behind the assassin!

675
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,300
<i>General-in-chief of the State’s Tablet
Princess Royal Dening’s Tablet</i>

676
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,380
What’s wrong, father?

677
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,260
Are you alright, Master?

678
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,900
I’m fine. I’m fine.

679
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,060
On the day
my grandmother was assassinated,

680
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,940
how did you know I went to the palace?

681
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,180
Why did you insist
on searching her mansion?

682
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,700
What did you do to my grandmother

683
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,980
in the study?

684
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,900
Answer me!

685
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,100
Hua.

686
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,220
I...

687
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,500
If you have anything to do
with my grandmother’s death,

688
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,940
I won’t let you go!

689
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,980
Hua.

690
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,620
Your Grace.

691
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,220
My sister said
she didn’t want to talk to you.
