<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 16</i>

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,030
It’s still early in the morning.

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,120
I wondered what was shining.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,680
Turns out my sister is gleaming.

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,310
Sister.

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,000
You know I care for you.

41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,560
The latest news through the grapevine.

42
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,590
In Feixian House,

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,000
there has been a great storyteller.

44
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,840
He’s got a glib tongue.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,030
He tells stores so wonderfully!

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,080
So…

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,800
Go have fun with me?

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,590
You’ve been bullied by me since little.

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,960
It must be hard for you to grow up.

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,710
Go enjoy the storytelling with my money.

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
Thank you, Ban Heng.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,000
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Princess Royal’s funeral has been done.

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,430
Commander Shi takes care
of sealing her mansion.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,750
This is the receipt
from the Imperial Household Department.

56
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,000
Duke Ban and Princess Ban asked
to see His Majesty!

57
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,280
Your Majesty, thank you
for making me Duke.

58
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,240
Long live Your Majesty!

59
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,120
You’re my cousin.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,120
Families don’t need to say thank you.

61
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,800
Your Majesty, I know you care for me.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,750
But I’m extremely afraid

63
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,630
when I’m promoted to Duke Jingting

64
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,400
without making any contributions.

65
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,560
Are you blaming me

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,150
for not protecting Aunt?

67
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,710
Your Majesty.

68
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,080
I don’t mean that.

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,190
My mother regarded you

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,360
as her own son.

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
Since so,

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,360
you should accept my award.

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
Aunt is gone.

74
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,190
I’ll let everyone in this world know

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,920
I’m taking care of the Ban family

76
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,600
and you can reply on me.

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,120
In this way,

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Aunt won’t worry in the heaven.

79
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,270
Hua.

80
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,120
Since Aunt entrusted me
with your marriage

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,630
before she died,

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,800
I will get you engaged...

83
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,000
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,870
Today, I came

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,070
to reject the engagement.

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,630
What?

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
When Grandmother was alive,

88
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,750
I neglected filial duties to her.

89
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,040
I offer to guard by her tablet.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,040
As for my wedding...

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,750
I don’t want to marry Count Cheng’an.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,950
Hua.

93
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,360
Your Majesty, please grant my request.

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,310
Hua, you’ve been living a rich life.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,950
It’s hard to guard by the tablet.

96
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,390
How can you bear with that?

97
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,870
For Grandmother,

98
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,070
I can bear with anything.

99
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,800
Since you have filial piety
for your grandmother,

100
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,190
let’s talk about your wedding

101
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,000
another time.

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,480
Your Majesty, I’ll leave, too.

104
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,920
Wait!

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Your Grace.

106
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,630
Sorry.

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Grandmother! Grandmother!

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Look. I made it myself.

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,240
Grandmother, wish you a long life!

110
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,240
Let me have a look.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,870
So beautiful!

112
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,830
Grandmother! Grandmother!

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,870
She did such a poor embroidery.

114
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,800
Have a look at my gift.

115
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,630
This is an official porcelain
of the former dynasty.

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,390
It cost me totally fifty taels.

117
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,870
No, no!

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,190
He was so stupid that he was deceived.

119
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,070
This isn’t an official porcelain.

120
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,750
Fine. Fine.

121
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,270
This is fake!

122
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,830
-It’s genuine!
-It’s fake!

123
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,000
-Genuine!
-Fake!

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
All right! All right!

125
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,270
Don’t bother if it’s genuine or fake.

126
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,270
You have true heart for me already.

127
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,680
In my eyes, no gifts are better

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,750
than my grandson and granddaughter.

129
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,070
Don’t worry, Grandmother.
I’m doing fine.

130
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,510
You loved it when I smiled.

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
I will keep smiling.

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,030
In such a big capital,

133
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,390
no one can bully our family!

134
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:46,740
<i>Ban’s Ancestral Hall</i>

135
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,420
<i>Ban’s Ancestral Hall</i>

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,150
Ban Hua.

137
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,390
I hear you’ve eaten nothing for days.

138
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,270
You can’t do this.

139
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,910
Even if you’re guarding
at your grandmother’s tablet,

140
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,030
you can’t fall sick.

141
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,720
I don’t want anything to eat.

142
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,630
But you must eat!

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,030
If you keep eating nothing,

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,870
I’ll never go back to Aipo State.

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,910
What does it concern me?

146
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,840
Because I’m worried

147
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,790
that a beautiful girl like you
will be starving to death

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,390
after I leave.

149
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,960
What’s wrong?

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,670
This is my favorite jerky.

151
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,790
It smells bad.

152
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,960
How can I eat it?

153
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
Well, try more.

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
Then you’ll get used to it.

155
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,870
After you marry me in the grasslands,

156
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,270
there’s nothing else to eat.

157
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,670
Who will marry you?

158
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,670
If you don’t want to marry me,

159
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,630
why did you refuse

160
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,670
to marry Count Cheng’an?

161
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,480
None of your business.

162
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,390
Oh, I understand.

163
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,910
Local girls like you are different

164
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,120
from those in our grasslands.

165
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,510
You say no,

166
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,480
but you mean yes.

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,240
This is for you.

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,630
An umbrella?

169
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,750
I made it myself.

170
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,030
It’s a rare gift.

171
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,630
You look rough.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
I didn’t know you could
make such a delicate thing.

173
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,000
You bet.

174
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,630
After I leave,

175
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,480
you can use the umbrella.

176
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,600
On rainy days or sunny days,

177
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,840
you will think of me.

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,270
Thank you.

179
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
If you really want to thank me,

180
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
go back to the grasslands with me

181
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,630
and be my forever love.

182
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,910
Wait, then.

183
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,200
I’ll think about it in my next life.

184
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,600
Fine.

185
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,390
I’ll have a chance in my next life.

186
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,790
Sister.

187
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,960
Sister.

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,510
Father and Mother worried about you.

189
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,600
They sent me to check on you.

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,240
You used to be strong.

191
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,630
But now you’re so weak.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,390
What nonsense are you talking about?

193
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,630
I just woke up

194
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,120
and I felt a bit dizzy.

195
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,150
You should have more rest, then.

196
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,030
I’ll go talk with Grandmother.

197
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,390
Have something to eat.

198
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,510
I’m not hungry.

199
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,910
You eat it.

200
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,240
You’d better have some.

201
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,630
Come on.

202
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,120
All are costly foods.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,360
A feast of delicacies.

204
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,390
I want the porridge.

205
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,270
Fine. Here. Here’s the porridge.

206
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,480
There are wolfberries and longans in it.

207
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,870
Thank you.

208
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,550
You’re welcome.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,360
I didn’t prepare them.

210
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,150
You didn’t?

211
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,550
I prepared this. It’s already cold.

212
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,460
<i>Rong</i>

213
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,910
Why did you stop?

214
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,720
You haven’t had anything for days.

215
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,510
Luckily, you like the porridge.

216
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,670
Have some more.

217
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,080
Since he doesn’t want to be sincere

218
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
or tell me the truth,

219
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,270
why did he give me the food?

220
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,910
I don’t want it anymore.

221
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,360
Young Master.

222
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,030
Why didn’t you

223
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,120
have anything to eat again?

224
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,080
Thank you for your concern, Uncle Rong.

225
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,720
I’m getting old.

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
I don’t understand young men like you.

227
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,150
But if you keep a secret,

228
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,600
why don’t you tell Her Grace?

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
It’ll be better
than being awkward like this.

230
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,960
I certainly know that.

231
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,120
But I keep something from her

232
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,720
just to protect her.

233
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,510
Keeping a secret

234
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,360
doesn’t always mean protection.

235
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,510
People think alike on reasonable things.

236
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,630
Her Grace is a frank girl

237
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,600
and she’s very kind.

238
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,120
I’m afraid

239
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,960
she prefers the truth

240
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,390
to the box of cakes.

241
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,980
<i>General-in-chief of the State’s Tablet
Princess Royal Dening’s Tablet</i>

242
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,860
<i>Princess Royal Dening’s Tablet</i>

243
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,360
Princess Royal,

244
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,870
wish you peace and happiness

245
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,550
in the heaven.

246
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,840
Why do you think
you can worship my grandmother?

247
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,360
Hua, if you want to know the truth,

248
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,550
I will no longer keep it from you.

249
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,200
No matter what reason you have,

250
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,030
I must know everything

251
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,910
about my grandmother’s death.

252
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,120
In fact,

253
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,030
before I was ordered
to break into Princess Royal’s mansion,

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
I had met Her Highness.

255
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,750
Your Highness,

256
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,240
can you tell me the truth now?

257
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,240
I asked to meet you

258
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,150
so that I’ll tell you everything I know.

259
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,840
Xia, you’re reading this letter.

260
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,840
It’s the last thing I want to see.

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,750
You’re finally taking revenge.

262
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,750
I want you to be safe all your life.

263
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,000
But I also don’t want you to forget me.

264
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,550
If you stop reading,

265
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,590
there’s a turning back.

266
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,640
If you finish reading the letter,

267
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,880
you can never regret.

268
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,920
Think carefully about it.

269
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,680
The Ban family and our family
are under such condition

270
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,200
because of the Tiger Tally
of the Ban family.

271
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,030
To generals,

272
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,720
the Tiger Tally represents
Old General Ban.

273
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,000
His Majesty felt threatened,

274
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,550
but he didn’t dare

275
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,350
to ask Old General Ban
to hand in the Tiger Tally.

276
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,400
To get promoted,
Yan Hui had an evil plan.

277
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,960
Since we got on well
with the Ban family,

278
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,110
he forced your father
to get the Tiger Tally.

279
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,960
Unexpectedly,

280
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,720
this was a trap
to kill two birds with one stone.

281
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,830
With the Tiger Tally,
the Ban family would be ruined.

282
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,590
Without it, our family would be ruined.

283
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,510
Overnight,

284
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,030
our family became traitors.

285
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,790
Your father was executed.

286
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Even your elder brother
was assassinated.

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,510
Son, I’m sorry.

288
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,790
To keep you alive,

289
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,200
I had to take a risk,

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,030
exchanging my life for yours.

291
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
I can’t watch you grow up,

292
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
be an official,

293
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,110
get married or have children.

294
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,960
But I want you to live your life

295
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,750
in forever peace.

296
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,640
Your Highness, did you have another plan

297
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,750
or did you do anything evil

298
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,920
so that you didn’t dare

299
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,750
to tell me the truth?

300
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,830
Somebody!

301
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes!

302
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,350
Search the mansion carefully!

303
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
If you find any suspicious man,

304
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,720
take him back for interrogation!

305
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,790
Yes!

306
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,880
After deceiving Cui,

307
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,750
Princess Royal and I
estimated the situation

308
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
and knew something terrible
would happen.

309
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,350
We then used their trick and set a trap.

310
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,400
Unexpectedly,

311
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,160
she sacrificed herself
to protect your family.

312
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Over the past decade,

313
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,550
you’ve been living a hard life,
Your Highness.

314
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,310
I got out of my way

315
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
to send you to the Crown Prince,

316
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,550
because your mother asked me

317
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,350
to keep you alive.

318
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,590
But you must understand.

319
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,000
Yan Hui was the chief plotter.

320
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,110
But I always think

321
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,830
he couldn’t have hurt us

322
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,270
without the permission of His Majesty.

323
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,680
I know.

324
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,000
Since you know,

325
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,200
why do you insist on investigating?

326
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,160
I kept it secret from you

327
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,790
because I was afraid you would
take revenge on the Yan family

328
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,830
and ask His Majesty for justice.

329
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,310
If your mother knew it in heaven,

330
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,480
she would blame me!

331
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,310
But Your Highness,

332
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,400
forgetting the family feud
will be ungrateful.

333
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,160
In such a complicated world,

334
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,240
how can I survive

335
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,070
if I’m ungrateful?

336
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,550
I’m getting old.

337
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,000
I can’t be as sensible as you.

338
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I have trusted Minister Shi for years.

339
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,350
But I still don’t understand him.

340
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,960
He helped me get out of danger.

341
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,030
Now, why is he tricking us

342
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,750
on Hua’s marriage?

343
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,440
This is really thought-provoking.

344
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,350
I’m afraid the Shi family wants more

345
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,480
than we can imagine.

346
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,350
You’re a smart man.

347
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,160
My family is

348
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
amidst enemies.

349
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,510
You must have taken trouble
to mediate in it

350
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,750
and set such a trap.

351
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,030
You flatter me, Your Highness.

352
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,270
I knew

353
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,270
Prince Luo would drive a wedge
between us.

354
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,200
Unexpectedly,

355
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
he found my mother’s bracelet.

356
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,240
No offense, but may I ask?

357
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,480
You’ve hidden your capacities for years.

358
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,110
Have you ever regretted?

359
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
People born in the imperial family

360
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,070
have no right to regret.

361
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,880
Tell me.

362
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,510
Have you ever been scared
of evil enemies?

363
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,920
I’m never scared.

364
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
If I entrust Hua to you,

365
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
will you still not be scared?

366
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,350
If Her Grace likes me in the way I do,

367
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,110
I will never betray her!

368
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Good!

369
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Sounds like your father.

370
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,030
Since my husband died,

371
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,720
I’ve been behaving willfully

372
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,790
and haven’t begged anyone.

373
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,000
But now...

Only in this way

386
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,270
can she protect the Ban family

387

I just want my grandmother back!

Hua.

391
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,590
Princess Royal got His Majesty
to protect you

392
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,880
with her own life

393
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,720
and asked us to get married

394
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,830
so that His Majesty would stop
suspecting us

395

and our families would
get back together.

I hate it most when people deceive me.

In front of my grandmother’s tablet,

400
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,510
let me make it clear.

401
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,880
I’ll only marry a man
who has a true heart for me.

402
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,400
I have a true heart

403

for you.

404
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,790
If you do,

405
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,350
why didn’t you discuss with me?

406
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,400
You hid the plan from me

407
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,680
so that I saw my grandmother die

408
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,830
and would no longer stay with her?

409
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,440
Why did you do this?

410
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,830
Because I must protect you

411
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
and your whole family!

412
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,160
I can’t get you hurt.

413
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,270
Haven’t you got me hurt enough?

414
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
I want nothing, but a true heart.

415
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,920
But you always had plots.

416
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,070
When the plots were against me, fine.

417
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,920
But in the end,

418
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,240
you even got my grandmother killed.

419
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,830
I never had a plot
against Princess Royal.

420
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,920
She was incurably sick

421
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,110
and she was dying.

422
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,720
That’s why I agreed

423
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,680
to set the trap with her,

424
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,070
so that we could protect you
and your family

425

Leave.

my sister is having a cold.

My sister’s marriage

If you can’t forget Count Cheng’an now,

493

Mr. Shi.

496
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,750
It’s not as simple as you imagine.

Please tell me.

499
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,790
The Xie family broke off the engagement.

500
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,550
Xie Qilin was blind.

501

Grandmother died.

I had dreamed of them.

504
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,550
In my dream,
my family was also confiscated,

505
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,590
and we couldn’t protect ourselves
in such trouble.

506
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,110
I don’t want to get others involved.

So, you still love Count Cheng’an?

508
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,640
A mere dream scared you.

509
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,830
It’s not you I used to know.

510
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,880
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

511
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,350
I’m sorry.

512
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,510
Princess Royal said

513
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,510
you looked most like her.

514
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,000
In her life,

515
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,310
she was proud and she also suffered.

516
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,790
She had to keep her feelings secret.

517
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,830
But she only wanted you

518
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,350
to live a carefree and happy life

519
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,110
like she did
in the first half of her life.

520
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,880
Sister, are you alright?

521
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,240
Heng.

522
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
You’re the only son of our family.

523
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,720
You must practice martial arts hard.

524
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,750
I’ve told Softy.

525
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
From today on,

526
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,110
you’ll practice for six hours a day.

527
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,240
If you don’t work hard

528
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,480
and only enjoy the life,

529
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,680
when things in the dream happen,

530
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,030
how can you protect our family

531
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,030
or our parents?

532
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,160
Sister, we have you.

533
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,680
What if I’m gone?

534
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,400
I’m strong.

535
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
But if someday,

536
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,240
I can’t hold on,

537
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,640
we have to rely on you.

538
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,030
Understand?

539
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,750
Yes.

540
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,640
It’s been days only.

541
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,240
Your Grace, why do you look so thin?

542
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,590
Mr. Xie, enjoy the tea, please.

543
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,880
Seems like the rumors are true.

544
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,440
You really keep a simple diet

545
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,840
and live a simple life.

546
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,960
Mr. Xie,

547
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,150
I don’t think you come here

548
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,280
just to confirm the rumors.

549
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,070
With your soldiers, you searched
the Mansion of Peace and Longevity.

550
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,480
Instead of being punished,

551
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
you could marry Princess Ban.

552
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,960
I really admire that.

553
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,880
Mr. Xie, can’t you see
that His Majesty asked me

554
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,510
to marry Princess Ban
for the court condition?

555
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,320
So, it’s what His Majesty wanted?

556
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,920
Prince Luo and I thought

557
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,150
you tricked us.

558
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,760
Princess Ban’s marriage
has caused many conflicts.

559
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,230
His Majesty just didn’t want
more arguments.

560
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,110
You and His Highness

561
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,550
overestimated me.

562
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,550
Well, let me get to the point.

563
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,760
His Highness cares for the Tiger Tally.

564
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,480
Have you got any clue?

565
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,630
No, after searching
the Mansion of Peace and Longevity.

566
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,800
So, I guess

567
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,920
it’s being kept
in Duke Jingting’s Mansion.

568
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,920
Duke Jingting’s Mansion?

569
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,400
Minister Shi was ordered
to look for the Tiger Tally.

570
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,320
He asked Shen Yu
to sneak into the Ban’s Mansion.

571
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,070
It proves that the Tiger Tally is there.

572
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,800
His Highness just needs
to follow the clue

573
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,280
and find it out.

574
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,070
That’s great, then.

575
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,550
After you marry Princess Ban,

576
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,230
you’ll get the Tiger Tally easily.

577
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,070
With your help,

578
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,510
Prince Luo will get great power.

579
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,070
I’m dying.

580
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,400
I had meant to bury it with me.

581
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,920
But such condition

582
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,960
worries me.

583
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,800
Now,

584
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,320
I want you

585
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,880
to keep this for me.

586
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,110
It may protect the Ban family.

587
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,190
What’s this?

588
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,760
It’s what everyone wants!

589
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,880
I give it to you,

590
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,550
so that I’m asking you

591
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,030
to take care of the Ban family.

592
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,840
Can you do that, Your Grace?

593
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I swear

594
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,880
to the heaven

595
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,230
that I won’t let you down!

596
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,150
If I get the Tiger Tally,

597
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,550
I wonder what I can get from Prince Luo.

598
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,360
This is an important thing.

599
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,400
When you get it,

600
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,150
Prince Luo will give you

601
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,280
whatever you want.

602
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,960
Stop!

603
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,230
Young Master, where are you going?

604
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,030
Her Grace ordered you

605
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,800
to practice martial arts for six hours.

606
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,480
Why are you escaping
within even a quarter?

607
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,800
Softy.

608
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
Don’t keep an eye on me
as if I were a thief.

609
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,150
I’m just leaving for some business.

610
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,280
I’ll come back and continue.

611
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,590
What business?

612
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,400
Uh... Uh...

613
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,150
Zhou Changxiao said he got
some information about Prince Luo.

614
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,280
I must go and get confirmation.

615
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,360
Information never waits.

616
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,510
Young Master!

617
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,960
Mr. Yao, what do you want to tell me?

618
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,110
There’s never a secret to you.

619
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,230
I’ll get to the point, then.

620
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,960
Minister Shi has a granddaughter.

621
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,880
Do you know?

622
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,110
Do you mean Miss Shi Feixian?

623
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,150
Precisely.

624
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,400
Miss Shi is beautiful

625
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
and very talented.

626
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,190
She’s good enough for you.

627
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,150
What do you think, Your Grace?

628
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,070
You may not know.

629
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,920
I was engaged not long ago.

630
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,760
In the mourning for Princess Royal,

631
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,280
I shouldn’t make it widely known.

632
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,630
Please keep it secret.

633
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,480
Which lucky girl?

634
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,840
It hasn’t been announced yet.

635
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,150
Please understand.

636
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
I see. I see.

637
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,550
Please enjoy the tea.

638
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,550
Young Master.

639
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:58,574
