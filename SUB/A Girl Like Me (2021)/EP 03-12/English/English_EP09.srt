<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 9</i>

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,910
At this stage,

37
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,800
just tell me the truth, General.

38
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,080
Do you have it or not?

39
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,310
We’ve assisted His Majesty for years

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,550
and we know how tough the situation is.

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,360
He’s new to the throne
with little support.

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,960
If he doesn’t have the Tiger Tally,

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,800
what will he

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,960
and court officials think?

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,990
General, you’ve already retired

46
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,430
and don’t need it anymore.

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,200
Count Rong, the Tally was gone

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,310
when General was attacked.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,240
Our two families
have been close for years.

50
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,640
I’m utterly disappointed

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,800
that you aren’t working

52
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,520
to seize the assassin first.

53
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,240
I’ve told you everything.

54
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,830
You...

55
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,990
should leave.

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,480
His Majesty has sent Count Rong here.

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,680
Princess, the Tally...

58
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,920
Yan Hui and the others must’ve
provoked His Majesty

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,640
into asking the Tally back.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,150
Once it falls into someone else’s hand,

61
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,110
our family will be doomed.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,430
I didn’t expect

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,960
that was the last time I saw Count Rong.

64
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,920
After Father passed away,

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,710
Mother had his death
investigated thoroughly.

66
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,760
Yet in a few days,

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,360
she hung herself in the room

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
following my brother’s mysterious death,

69
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,870
and leaving me all alone

70
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,110
in the palace.

71
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,150
I’m sorry for your family’s tragedy,

72
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,830
but it has nothing to do with the Bans

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,870
or me.

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,550
Your Highness,

75
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,990
the Tiger Tally

76
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,400
led to my father’s tragic death.

77
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,760
How could you deny it?

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,830
How dare you!

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Are you accusing me

80
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,640
of murdering your parents?

81
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,790
I wouldn’t dare.

82
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
But the clues I’ve collected

83
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,270
these years

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
all point to General Ban’s Tiger Tally.

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,910
Please give me an explanation.

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,710
That’s the least I deserve.

87
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,830
I said

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
the Bans have nothing to do with it.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,910
Your Highness,

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Father once said

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,400
the Bans and the Rongs
had been friends for generations.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,670
Please...

93
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,320
Let me be clear.

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,910
Whatever you are up to

95
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,000
is your business.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,270
Our family won’t interfere.

97
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,000
Stay away from Hua,

98
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,350
or as the one watching you grow up,

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,470
I’m sure His Majesty would like to know

100
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,790
what you’ve done behind his back.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,150
I understand.

102
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,120
His Majesty also cares a lot about you

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,230
and he won’t turn a blind eye

104
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,080
to your disease.

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,030
Stop!

106
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,590
I’m already over it.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,470
Be a bigger man, can’t you?

108
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,440
Never mind.

109
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,270
It’s my fault

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,760
that I’m more understanding than others.

111
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,760
Whatever disputes we have,

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
the birthday banquet must go on.

113
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,670
In order to work together,

114
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,270
one must compromise.

115
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,000
So I’ve forgiven you

116
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
regarding the Longjing Cake.

117
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,440
But just so you know,

118
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,960
from now on,

119
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,560
I’ll be in charge of everything

120
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,910
in regard to the banquet.

121
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,520
Say something!

122
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,120
What’s there to say?

123
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,150
Why didn’t you respond

124
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,320
to all that I’ve said?

125
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Aren’t you a role model for scholars?

126
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,670
Where are your manners?

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,910
I apologize for everything.

128
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,710
Please excuse me.

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,760
Good day.

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,400
Rong Xia, what’s wrong with you?

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
What’s that attitude?

132
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,150
Do I owe you anything or my family does?

133
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Why are you laughing?

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
I’m laughing at myself.

135
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I assumed

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,120
you’d be different.

137
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
You’re right.

138
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,030
You don’t owe me anything.

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,710
Neither does your family.

140
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,470
I’m the one to blame

141
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,790
from beginning to end.

142
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,320
I shouldn’t have

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,670
dragged the Bans

144
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,350
or you into this.

145
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,230
I was alone

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,520
and I’ll always be.

147
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,270
I’m used to it.

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Rest assured.

149
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,320
I’ll never bother you again.

150
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,760
What was that?

151
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,030
It’s just some dessert, isn’t it?

152
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,230
What’s the matter with him?

153
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,960
What a grand banquet!

154
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,880
I heard Crown Prince arranged it.

155
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
That’s right.

156
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,000
No wonder it’s above the standard.

157
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,270
Everyone is here.

158
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,270
I know.

159
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,600
-Prince Luo.
-Prince Luo.

160
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,760

Cousin,

162
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,430
I didn’t ask you to copy sutras for me.

163
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,950
Whatever game you’re playing,

164
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,760
I haven’t forgiven you.

165
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,070
Don’t feel so good about yourself.

166
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,430
You’re in bad luck.

167
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,760
I did that to help you.

168
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,600
I...

169
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,310
Are you alright?

<i>Yan Zhen, Eldest Son of the Yans,

ladies of all households have arrived.

173
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,550
They’re waiting for you.

174
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,400
Let’s go.

175
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,190
Yes.

176
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,840
Hua made this tea especially for you.

177
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,600
Please have a taste, Crown Princess.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,190
It’s as good as I thought.

179
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,430
Well,

180
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,480
it’s about time.

181
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,240
Where’s Princess Royal?

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
Grandmother is still dressing herself up

183
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
to look proper when His Majesty arrives.

184
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,360
I’ll go assist her

185
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
so that she won’t be late.

186
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,030
You two take the back door

187
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,400
and get Grandmother’s
physician Zhang here.

188
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,950
Yes.

189
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,270
All rise.

190
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

191
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,120
We’re having a family banquet,
not in court.

192
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,120
Just relax.

193
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
Be seated, everyone.

194
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,910
How’s the preparation?

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,790
Your Majesty,

196
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,950
guards here have been swapped over

197
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,670
to make way for our secret agents

198
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,430
to search for the Tiger Tally.

199
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,670
I see.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,840
Zhang,

201
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,400
the banquet seems different from before.

202
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,670
You must’ve put in a lot of effort.

203
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,030
I’ll reward you handsomely.

204
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,520
Thank you, Father.

205
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,910
It’s just that

206
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,550
Rong Xia drafted the speech.

207
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,070
I don’t think

208
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,000
I should read it.

209
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,950
Zhang!

210
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,120
Huai.

211
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,030
Your Majesty.

212
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,840
Where’s Princess Royal?

213
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,190
I’ve carefully

214
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,400
chosen a gift for her.

215
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,550
If Mother knows

216
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,550
you’ve come with a gift,

217
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,360
she’ll be even more excited.

218
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
I’m sure

219
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,840
she’s tidying up as we speak.

220
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,880
Please have some drinks first

221
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,120
and congratulate her once she arrives.

222
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Alright. Let the banquet begin.

223
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,400
What are you doing here?

224
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,070
Princess.

225
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,190
Madam Chang, what happened?

226
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,480
Grandmother! Is she alright?

227
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,760
She’s been sick for a while
without telling anyone

228
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,240
because she knows once it gets out,

229
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,400
the Xies will have no scruples

230
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,640
about ganging up on your family.

231
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,550
How did you know?

232
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,950
And why are you here?

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Right now, you should focus on

234
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,310
those guests instead of me.

235
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,520
Need you tell me that?

236
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,270
I’ve had maids go get Physician Zhang.

237
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,950
That takes time

238
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,360
which you don’t have,
because His Majesty

239
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,520
is waiting for Princess Royal now.

240
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,310
During Count Rong’s last visit,

241
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,240
I overheard him

242
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,400
arguing with Her Highness.

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,550
We must be careful.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,070
Come on in, Physician Zhang!

245
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Check on my grandmother!

246
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,640
She isn’t in a coma for long.

247
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,550
There’s medicine to wake her up.

248
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,720
Good.

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,640
Dissolve it in warm water
and feed it to her.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,640
Got it.

251
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,550
Her Highness has asked me

252
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,550
to keep her condition secret.

253
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,640
I should leave.

254
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,880
Sure. Take care.

255
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,360
Your help won’t be forgotten.

256
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,310
This is odd.

257
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,360
The medicine is darker than before.

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,310
We’re running out of time.

259
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
<i>General-in-chief of the State’s Tablet
Princess Royal Dening’s Tablet</i>

260
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
What did you do, Count Cheng’an?

261
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,120
Zhang,

262
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
how come

263
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,670
Princess Royal hasn’t shown up yet?

264
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,640
Father,

265
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,950
I have no idea, either.

266
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,720
Really?

267
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,520
Brother,

268
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,270
how could you not know

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,720
as the organizer of the banquet?

270
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,120
Is something wrong?

271
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,190
Princess Ban and Count Rong
aren’t here, either.

272
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,600
Do you also not know where they are?

273
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,000
If Crown Prince

274
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,400
can’t get hold of a few people,

275
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,670
how can he rule the entire state?

276
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,520
Brother,

277
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,240
Great-aunt is yet to be seen.

278
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,520
If she doesn’t receive
birthday congratulations in time

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,120
and her health is affected,

280
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,910
can you

281
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,310
take that responsibility?

282
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,760
Please be patient, Your Majesty.

283
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,880
Let me go check.

284
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,030
Never mind. I’ll do it myself.

285
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,270
Go, go!

286
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,840
Go seize that quack!

287
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,520
-Go!
-Yes.

288
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,070
No need.

289
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,240
Someone else must be

290
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,000
behind the poisoning.

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,360
Don’t alert the culprit,

292
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,760
but follow the lead and catch him.

293
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,150
Fine. But...

294
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,670
Sister, it’s a mess in the front hall.

295
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,360
What are you still doing inside?

296
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,910
What to do? We have no medicine.

297
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,070
I have it.

298
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,950
How come?

299
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,310
Save Her Highness first.

300
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,310
Why are you helping me?

301
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,240
Princess,

302
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,760
ever since we met,

303
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,190
I’ve never intended to harm you,

304
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,880
and I sure won’t this time.

305
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,360
His Majesty has arrived!

306
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,600
Aunt.

307
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,030
Young Master Ban,
is Her Highness inside?

308
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,070
Well,

309
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,240
the door stands as a screen,

310
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,880
separating the inside

311
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,480
from the outside.

312
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,000
So we can only guess

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,030
what’s happening there.

314
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,720
-That’s...
-What are you talking about, Ban Heng?

315
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,550
I’m confused.

316
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,880
Move.

317
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,000
I tried but couldn’t open it.

318
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,670
Great-aunt.

319
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,240
Great-aunt.

320
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,240
Aunt. I came to greet you in person.

321
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,600
I was caught up with affairs.

323
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,760
Thank you for your concern.

324
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,480
Don’t mention it.

325
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,150
That’s what I should do.

326
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Today is your birthday.

327
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,150
Officials are waiting
to congratulate you.

328
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,470
Let’s go to the front hall together.

329
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,470
After you, Your Majesty.

330
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,230
Why are you everywhere? Get lost!

331
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,710
Stop!

332
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,640
Is that how you speak

333
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,510
to a noble prince? Show some respect!

334
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,280
Hey...

335
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Young Master,

336
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
you’re finally out.

337
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,510
Did you tell His Majesty

338
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,710
about Princess Royal’s condition?

339
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
Didn’t get to.

340
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,230
Physician Zhang is sneaky.

341
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Have someone follow him.

342
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,800
Already done.

343
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,430
Something else is strange.

344
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,840
What is it?

345
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,430
A group of secret agents sneaked in

346
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,430
without

347
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,640
alerting the guards on duty.

348
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,080
Seems like they’ve all come.

349
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,560
Keep them under watch

350
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,670
in case they take actions

351
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,950
against the Bans.

352
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,360
Yes.

353
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,150
I wish you boundless fortune

354
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,320
and longevity, Your Highness.

355
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,840
I wish you boundless fortune
and longevity.

356
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,280
Aunt,

357
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,880
hearing that you might feel unwell,

358
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,150
I was worried,

359
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,150
so I went to check on you.

360
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,750
I’m fine.

361
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,150
Don’t be misled

362
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,640
by the ill-intentioned

363
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,990
who are eager to sow discord between us.

364
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,800
I agree.

365
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,230
You’re right.

366
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,400
You and I are family.

367
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,400
May you live long and healthy.

368
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
May you live long and healthy.

369
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,950
Your Majesty, you’ve prepared something
for Grandmother, right?

370
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,360
What is it?

371
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,150
I can’t wait to have a peek.

372
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,750
Bring it in.

373
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
Present the birthday gift.

374
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,710
This is a congratulatory speech

375
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,880
I wrote for Aunt years back.

376
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,910
She helped me

377
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,400
through thick and thin

378
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,800
and protected me wholeheartedly.

379
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,950
I’m forever in debt to her.

380
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,400
This congratulatory speech

381
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,640
is to show all of you

382
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,190
how much I value her and the Bans.

383
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,280
All that we’ve owned

384
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,710
is bestowed by Your Majesty.

385
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,880
We’ve only been

386
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
doing our duty.

387
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,640
Great-aunt,

388
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
I’ve also prepared a gift for you.

389
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,670
It’s not as precious as Father’s,

390
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,400
but it’s quite unique.

391
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,510
Say something nice.

392
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,150
Best wishes to you.

393
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,600
Best wishes to you. Best wishes to you.

394
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,510
How adorable!

395
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,080
Thank you.

396
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,700
I’m glad you like it.

397
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,670
Long live Crown Prince.

398
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,360
Long live Crown Prince.
Long live Crown Prince.

399
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,040
Long live Crown Prince.
Long live Crown Prince.

400
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,120
Long live Crown Prince.
Long live Crown Prince.

401
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,280
Long live Crown Prince.
Long live Crown Prince.

402
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,320
Get rid of it!

403
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,640
I’m sorry, Father.

404
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,640
I... I have no idea about it.

405
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,640
Where did you get that myna?

406
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,710
Father,

407
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,280
it’s... it’s...

408
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,080
it’s a gift from someone else.

409
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
Idiot!

410
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,040
Father,

411
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,400
Brother was too busy
organizing the banquet

412
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,950
to see to everything himself

413
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,710
and had a little lapse.

414
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,670
This banquet is of great significance.

415
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,640
Under this circumstance,

416
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,560
a thorough investigation is needed

417
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,640
in case someone takes this chance

418
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,750
to harm Her Highness.

419
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
Who are you

420
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,990
to make decisions here, blabbermouth?

421
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,400
Just quit your job

422
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,280
and tell stories for a living.

423
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,750
How dare you call me names!

424
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,710
Are you guilty?

425
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,510
Shut your pie hole!

426
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,560
Blabbermouth!

427
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,560
Old fart!

428
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,320
Blabbermouth!

429
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,120
Old fart!

430
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,470
-Blabbermouth!
-Old fart!

431
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,230
Your Majesty, my father is right
despite his foul language.

432
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,510
It’s just a bird, isn’t it?

433
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,710
If you ask me,

434
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,710
your parrot is much better.

435
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,640
Don’t let it ruin your mood.

436
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,990
Crown Prince is a good boy.

437
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,600
He always treats us with filial respect.

438
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,840
I suggest

439
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
we let it slide.

440
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,470
I agree.

441
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,910
All the bickering

442
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,710
on my birthday

443
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,910
is giving me a headache.

444
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,800
I’m going back to rest.

445
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,840
Report!

446
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,080
Bad news, Your Majesty.

447
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,910
We’ve got a situation outside.

448
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,580
They fought for the gold foil

449
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,080
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>
the Bans handed out,

450
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,320
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>

451
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,600
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>
and injured my brother.

452
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>

453
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>
I demand compensation!

454
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,470
They must compensate for it!

455
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,470
That’s right! Yes!

456
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,750
<i>The Bans are corrupted...</i>
Sign it, everyone.

457
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,150
<i>The Bans are corrupted...</i>

458
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,800
<i>The Bans are corrupted...</i>
Sign it.

459
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Expel those troublemakers

460
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,950
to not ruin the banquet.

461
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,040
Yes.

462
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,040
Your Majesty, the Bans are corrupted.

463
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,180
Please bring them to justice!

464
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,830
Your Majesty.

465
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,710
Your Majesty, Mr. Mei is defaming us.

466
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,670
He wouldn’t make such an accusation

467
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,990
without proof, Your Majesty.

468
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
Mr. Mei, present it now if you have any

469
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,880
to His Majesty.

470
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,560
Your Majesty, this is a complaint
signed by the public.

471
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,430
Princess Ban made

472
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,470
an extravagant purchase for the banquet,

473
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
stirring public outrage.

474
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,280
They jointly drafted this.

475
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,430
Please read it, Your Majesty.

476
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,750
Can you be any quicker, Mr. Mei?

477
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,280
They’ve just started a protest outside,

478
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,470
and here you are
with the so-called proof.

479
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,220
That shows I’m diligent

480
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,200
as always.

481
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,240
You rich brats wouldn’t understand.

482
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,670
You...

483
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,510
Would you? You’re dirt-poor.

484
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,800
What do you know about being rich?

485
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,990
Enough!

486
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,400
Your Majesty.

487
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,950
Anger is mounting outside.

488
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
The masses are waiting

489
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
for your response, Your Majesty.

490
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,430
The line must be drawn here

491
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,750
to pacify the irate crowd.

492
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,470
Blabbermouth, stop fanning the flame!

493
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,280
Your Majesty,

494
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
stop covering for the Bans

495
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,470
for your personal bond with them.

496
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,600
Justice must be upheld!

497
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,230
Stay out of it!

498
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,640
I’ll deal with you once we get back.

499
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,710
Count Rong.

500
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,470
Yes.

501
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,280
You assisted in the preparation
for the banquet

502
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,140
and you must know the expense.

503
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,340
What do you think?

504
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,660
Every penny spent

505
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,220
is accounted for.

506
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,740
Here’s the book for you to review.

507
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,420
What a coincidence!

508
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,980
That you happen to bring it
with you to the banquet.

509
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,820
You’re trying too hard
to suck up to the Bans.

510
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,700
Better be careful,

511
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,820
or you may be guilty of deception.

512
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,100
Mr. Mei is doing his job diligently

513
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,700
and so am I.

514
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,460
You...

515
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,060
Every bill

516
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,220
has been checked

517
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
and signed by Crown Prince, me

518
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,460
and the contractor.

519
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,900
It can be double-checked anytime.

520
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,940
Father, as grand as the banquet seems,

521
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,740
it’s within the budget.

522
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,900
Brother,

523
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,500
with that being said,

524
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,060
were the Bans as clean-handed

525
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,420
as they claimed,

526
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,300
what about the crowd outside?

527
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,900
300 taels of silver are left.

528
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,620
Princess took 700 more
from her own pocket

529
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,780
to make it 1,000

530
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,620
for me

531
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,500
to build shelters outside the city

532
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,660
for the homeless.

533
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,660
Maybe

534
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,300
people outside

535
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,260
are to express their gratitude.

536
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,740
Utter nonsense!

537
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,740
Do you know...

538
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,860
Mr. Shi Jin requests an audience.

539
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,500
Your Majesty, it’s been confirmed that

540
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,540
someone incited the riot outside.

541
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,980
Organizers have been arrested,

542
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,220
pending sentence.

543
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,860
How dare they!

544
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,580
Your Majesty, we always
keep a low profile

545
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,220
and help those in need quietly.

546
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,220
Such defamation is outrageous.

547
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,100
Your Majesty, please clear our name.

548
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,060
Aunt, please rise, all of you.

549
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,220
Be careful, Mother.

550
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,940
I know you’re wronged, Hua.

551
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,060
I’m glad

552
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,060
that the Bans are compassionate.

553
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,180
I’ll reward you with 500 taels of gold.

554
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,580
I thank you on behalf of the homeless.

555
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,100
Your Majesty,

556
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,140
someone intended to tarnish

557
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,180
my grandmother’s image on her birthday

558
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,860
and must be punished.

559
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,460
That’s fair.

560
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,740
Guards!

561
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,540
Take Mei Shengguan out,

562
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,540
flog him 100 times
and strip him of his rank.

563
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,420
Your Majesty, I’m innocent!

564
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,780
I’m innocent, Your Majesty!

565
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,100
I’m innocent...!

566
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

567
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Who is it? Stop!

568
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Stop right there!

569
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,300
Your Majesty,
there are fireworks outside.

570
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,740
We can watch them in the garden.

571
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,380
I’m a bit tired.

572
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,340
You youngsters

573
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,620
just go have fun.

574
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,340
Count Rong,

575
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,340
I’m still confused

576
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,420
about what happened earlier.

577
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,180
How come you had the right pill?

578
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,420
I can

579
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,500
let go of the past,

580
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
but today,

581
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,940
you owe me an explanation.

582
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,420
Stay away

583
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,940
from Hua,

584
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,620
or as the one watching you grow up,

585
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,620
I’m sure His Majesty
would like to know

586
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,540
what you’ve done behind his back.

587
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,460
Normally,

588
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,580
I’d slap you

589
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,220
for keeping me

590
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,660
in the dark.

591
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,460
But, somehow,

592
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,300
I could still tolerate you.

593
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,860
Count Rong,

594
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,660
you once said

595
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,100
my parents and I get along so well.

596
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,860
The truth is

597
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,820
a relationship goes both ways.

598
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,580
Only if you’re honest with others

599
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,980
will they trust you.

600
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,220
I do,

601
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,220
so I accepted your pill.

602
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,380
What about you?

603
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,500
Can you do the same to me?

604
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,300
Princess,

605
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,260
please...

606
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,780
excuse me.

607
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,700
I know

608
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,860
deep down inside,

609
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,620
you have tons of secrets.

610
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,300
Still, I hope

611
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,020
one day, you’ll step out of your shell.

612
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,700
At least, when we’re together,

613
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,340
you can put aside your secrets

614
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,580
and burdens.

615
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,540
Princess,

616
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,780
I...

617
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,460
don’t deserve this.

618
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,460
That’s my call.

619
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,060
Few are worth

620
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,180
my attention all over the state

621
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,620
and you’re one of them.

622
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,340
You can’t say no to me

623
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,100
because

624
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,900
I’ve made my decision.

625
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,580
But I...

626
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,540
In my eyes,

627
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,380
you’re who you are

628
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,740
and you mean a lot to me.

629
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,460
What was I thinking?

630
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,540
Why did I say that?

631
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Relax, Your Grace.

632
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,260
What you did to Count Rong

633
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,460
is nothing new.

634
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,140
Your Grace.

635
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,740
Found it!

636
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,100
Count Rong’s gift

637
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,500
is so easy to miss.

638
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,860
I looked everywhere

639
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,940
and found it in the corner.

640
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,340
Forget it.

641
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,980
I don’t want to see it.

642
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
I do.

643
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,060
Let me check.

644
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,580
Come to think of it,

645
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,300
it’s a gift for my grandmother.

646
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,660
I should

647
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,700
open it myself.

648
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,620
Do it now.

649
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,220
What’s this? A box of desserts?

650
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,940
That’s his gift?

651
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,980
Count Rong is cheap.

652
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,060
I... I agree.

653
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,500
That alone proves

654
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,660
he’s not the one in black.

655
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,500
The one in black.

656
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,020
I almost forgot.

657
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,940
Your Grace,

658
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,100
are we going to strip Prince Luo off?

659
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,420
Yes.

660
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,420
Given Jiang Luo’s goings-on,

661
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,940
he must be the one in black.

662
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,180
And he sent those

663
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,140
my brother caught outside.

664
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,700
I believe

665
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,620
that thief Softy said

666
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,540
must be his man, too.

667
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,860
Softy and Rocky.

668
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,580
-Yes.
-Yes.

669
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,460
Gear up.

670
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,420
Let’s teach him a lesson.

671
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,580
Yes. Let’s go.

672
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,380
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>

673
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,900
Gentlemen, it’s nice talking to you.

674
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,140
We can meet again some other day.

675
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,620
See you then, Your Highness.

676
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,900
<i>Mansion of Peace and Longevity</i>

677
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,220
Who did this?

678
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,460
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

679
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,460
Get off me! Back off!

680
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,460
How dare you!

681
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,340
-Let me help you.
-Dry yourself.

682
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,700
Let me see. Dry it. Let me check.

683
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,500
Stay away

684
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,300
from me!

685
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,540
Help!

686
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,580
Your Highness!

687
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,020
He’s even weaker than me.

688
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,500
He needs exercise.

689
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,300
Say no more. Let’s go.

690
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,180
Let’s go.

691
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,940
Your Highness, don’t catch a cold.

692
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
Help!

693
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,140
Bastards!

694
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,500
How dare you do this to me!

695
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,940
Come back!

696
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,260
I’m the second prince of Daye!

697
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,580
Pick up my clothes!

698
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,980
Come back!

699
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,060
Zhen, have you lost your mind?

700
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,060
How dare you

701
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,780
try to speak for
the Bans on that occasion!

702
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,420
Don’t be mad, Father. I...

703
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,060
I don’t think

704
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,540
Princess Ban is as bad as they said.

705
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,260
You fool!

706
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,060
Do bad people bear tags?

707
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,180
Use your brain for once!

708
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,300
You’re still young.

709
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,260
What do you know about politics?

710
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,420
How many times have I told you

711
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,900
to be obedient?
Don’t act rashly.

712
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,900
But what did you do?

713
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,900
Besides,

714
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,340
are you and Ban Hua close?

715
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,740
Since when did you know her?

716
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,900
Why are you blushing?

717
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,500
I see.

718
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,500
The Bans are evil

719
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,700
from top to bottom.

720
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,540
You’re ganging up on me, aren’t you?

721
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,540
Fine. This isn’t over!

722
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

723
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,980
There you are!

724
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,660
Look at the plan you made!

725
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,980
We went to great lengths

726
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,100
to file a complaint together,

727
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,420
but only got dismissed.

728
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,300
The Bans and Crown Prince
got away with it.

729
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,780
Look who’s in trouble!

730
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,660
Me!

731
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,220
His Majesty left with Crown Prince,

732
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,820
but asked you to receive guests.

733
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,420
Don’t you get that?

734
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,780
The banquet Crown Prince put together

735
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,500
has brought you and officials closer.

736
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,100
Who do you think

737
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,100
is the winner?

738
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,620
When you put it like that,

739
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,060
it makes sense.

740
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,940
But Father ignored that bird

741
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,180
and Mei Shengguan’s words.

742
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,580
Why did he give Crown Prince
the cold shoulder?

743
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,180
Long story.

744
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,980
Just take one step at a time.

745
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,220
Your priority is
to win His Majesty over.

746
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,180
Leave the dirty business to me.

747
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,020
Sure. I trust you.

748
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,300
This is probably overdue.

749
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,620
Once I ascend the throne,

750
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,540
your sister will be my empress.

751
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,140
Everything is in preparation.

752
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,820
I hope you’ll keep your promise.

753
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,500
<i>Tablets</i>

754
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,940
I’m here

755
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,540
to apologize

756
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,100
for unabling to find out the truth

757
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,140
and bring the culprit to justice.

758
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,260
Young Master,
wasn’t that pill your leverage

759
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,500
to force Princess Royal
to tell the truth?

760
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,660
Why...?

761
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,900
I don’t think

762
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,220
that’s the right thing to do.

763
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,260
If I used Princess Ban,

764
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,540
who doesn’t know anything,

765
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,620
and disregarded Bans’ kindness to me

766
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,260
all to fulfill my mission,

767
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,460
wouldn’t I be the same

768
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,100
as those who’d do anything

769
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,500
to reach their goals,

770
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,780
including killing my parents?

771
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,660
Father, Mother, Brother,

772
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,180
<i>Tablets</i>
trust me,

773
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,900
<i>Tablets</i>
truth will prevail eventually.

774
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,460
I’ll

775
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,100
bring justice to you

776
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,700
even on my own.

777
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,340
Young Master.

778
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,700
Here you are.

779
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,660
Xie Chongjin, Count Zhongping’s eldest son,
pays respects to you.

780
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,060
Inspector of Pingzhou.

781
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,540
What’re you doing in the capital

782
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,220
and why did you ask
to see me all of a sudden?

783
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,660
I’m here for you, of course.

784
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,780
I have the information you need

785
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,500
and that

786
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,140
you lack.

787
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,500
The Xies have nothing to do
with that case.

788
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,380
The Yans are the ones to blame.

789
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,380
Do you actually expect me

790
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,820
to believe you that easily?

791
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,620
That’s naive.

792
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,460
You’re a wise man, Count.

793
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,460
You know how capable my father is.

794
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,100
Frankly speaking,

795
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,420
he didn’t have the brain

796
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,900
or the guts for the job.

797
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Read it first

798
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,940
before you choose to believe me or not.
