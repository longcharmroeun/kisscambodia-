Come!

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,550
Get off me!

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,400
Wait!

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,600
What’s wrong?

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,240
Now you know your mistakes?

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,240
It’s too late!

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Take it.

43
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,110
Your Majesty!

44

Ban Hua!

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,680
I…

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,960

Are you OK?

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,030
Jiang Luo beat me.

52
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,520
Jiang Luo!

53
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,800
Father, I didn’t!

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,520
You didn’t?

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,240
So Hua threw herself to the ground?

56
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,480
Making trouble right after
being punished.

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,360
You weren’t kneeling enough,

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,760
now you want to kneel outside Marquis…?

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Look at what you are wearing!

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,990
I…

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,480
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,480
I was never beaten since I was little.

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,030
But today,

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,150
Jiang Luo beat me so cruelly.

65
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,430
Look, it’s gonna leave a scar.

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,080
It must be hurt.

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,430
Quick, call the imperial physician!

68
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,150
Ban Hua, you…!

69
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,800
Shut up! This is not over!

70
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,310
Don’t cry.

71
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,640
I’m here.

72
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,150
Yes.

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,640
Prince Luo accidentally injured
Princess Ban.

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,710
Call the imperial physician!

75
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,110
His Highness beat
and injured Princess Ban.

76
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,640
Princess Ban’s arm

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,020
was broken by His Highness!

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,990
Princess Ban was beaten
by His Highness Prince Luo

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,550
and now she’s dying?

82

00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,200
Is… Is Princess Ban still breathing?

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,760

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880

Yes.

It’s all my fault.

90
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,830
Although His Highness

91
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,200
roughly stopped me from leaving,

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,150
laughed at me because nobody wants me,

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,790
and cursed my grandfather
with insulting words,

94
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
I should have suffered in silence.

95
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,710
Ban Hua! You…!

96
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,080
Your Highness, if you are still angry,

97
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,030
you can beat me as much as you want.

98
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,030
You can even take my arm.

99
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,320
It’s all my grandfather’s fault
for passing away too early.

100
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,910
Princess, I have to say something.

101
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,030
As a subject,

102
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,640
how could you
conflict with His Highness?

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,560
His Highness is noble.

104
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,520
Even if…

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,350
even if he beat you first,

106
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,760
you shouldn’t conflict with him.

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,560
I…

108
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,000
Father, Ban Hua is cunning in nature!

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,590
Please believe me! It’s her…!

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,560
You shut up!

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,350
But… It’s really her
who threw herself on the ground!

112
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,150
I didn’t even touch her!

113
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,520
I said shut up!

114
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,200
Ban Hua! Can you stop acting?

115
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,830
Wasn’t it you who initiated this?

116
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,320
Your Majesty.

117
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,520
Yes, it was me who initiated this.

118
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,320
See?

119
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,830
I don’t believe it!

120
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,230
Prince Luo misconducted himself.

121
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,910
Did you forget

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
all the manners you have learnt?

123
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,150
Go back to your study

124
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,470
and copy The Book of Rites
for 500 times.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,230
That’s your punishment!

126
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,270
You are not allowed to
leave the study before you finish.

127
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,030
Father!

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,640
She’s not your daughter,
but I’m your son, Father!

129
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,200
Get out!

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,670
Father! I…

131
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Wang De!

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,270
Your Highness, please.

133
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,590
I won’t let anybody bully you.

134
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Your hairpin.

135
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,670
Thank you for your help today.

136
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,270
Even if I had been there,

137
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,790
I don’t think

138
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,910
you would have been bullied.

139
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,350
I knew you were smart enough

140
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,320
to see through all that.

141
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,470
I’m flattered.

145
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,320
there are many ways
to teach someone a lesson.

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,520
In front of Prince Luo,

147
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,030
maybe you should hold your temper.

148
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,710
Don’t hurt yourself again.

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,470
You mean this? It’s nothing.

151
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,830

I’m too lazy to figure out other ways.

152
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,790

It’s not worth it.

153
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,520
What’s so funny?

154
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,590
I just feel that

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,320
Princess Ban is

156
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,230
pretty lucky.

157
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,080
You have a happy family.

158
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
And you have people to talk to.

159
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,080
Even if there is trouble,

160
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,790
you don’t have to face it alone.

share your trouble with you.

Princess.

167
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,230
It’s just that I grew up alone,

168
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,470
so I’m used to facing everything alone.

169
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,640
But after talked to you last time,

170

I’ve been trying

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,120
to talk with Huahua a little bit.

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
It feels good.

173
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,710
Huahua?

174
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,400
You tried to talk with your cat?

175
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,830
Fine, whenever you
need someone to talk to,

176
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
I’ll be there for you.

177
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,440
Do you still see me

178
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,030
as a man who can be a friend?

179
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,120
As long as

180
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,350
you don’t fool me again,

181
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,230
I’m pretty generous.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,120
Thank you in advance then.

183
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,960
If anything I do
offends you in the future,

184
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
please tell me directly.

185
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,640
All right.

186
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,320
You are still young.

187
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,960
There’s a lot of time for you to learn.

188
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,900
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,840
Ban Hua! This is not over!

190
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,480
I’ll let you pay for this!

191
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,910
As a prince of Daye,

192
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,070
how could you

193
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,270
say something like that?

194
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,360
Mother, I’m glad you are here.

195
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,520
Please go talk to Father.

196
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,120
I’m really framed up by Ban Hua!

197
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,640
I…

198
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,190
Luo,

199
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,600
do you know why
your father punished you?

200
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,950
What happened during the autumn hunting

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,310
was already a major disgrace
for the royal family.

202
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,400
Now Princess Royal’s
birthday banquet is around the corner,

203
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,030
why did you have to give Ban Hua

204
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,190
a hard time at this moment?

205
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,840
What Princess Royal?

206
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,910
Just a dying old woman,

207
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,190
and her time is running up.

208
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,910
Shut up!

209
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,430
You are so spoiled!

210
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,640
How could you say something like that?

211
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,150
Your father was right.

212
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,070
You do need to be grounded
for several days.

213
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,910
Copying those nice books

214
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,270
can refine your character.

215
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,310
Please believe me, Mother!

216
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,270
I was really framed up! Mother!

217
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,600
Your Highness, please calm down.

218
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,310
Her Majesty loves you so much.

219
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
After some days,

220
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,430
she’ll figure out a way to set you free.

221
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,640
Ban Hua! When I’m out of here,

222
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,720
I’ll make you pay for this!

223
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,070
Your Highness, please listen to me.

224
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,120
Although you have
Her Majesty to rely on,

225
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,550
now the royal court
is full of Crown Prince’s people.

226
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
The Ban Family works for him too.

227
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
They all look down upon you.

228
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
You don’t need to do everything
with your own hands.

229
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,400
You just need someone

230
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
who can root out your barriers for you.

231
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,070
The Crown Prince has Shi Family,

232
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,070
but I also have Xie Family.

233
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,360
Yes.

234
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,060
<i>Xie’s Mansion</i>

235
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,310
<i>Xie’s Mansion</i>
Oh, Eunuch Zhang!

236
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,120
Eunuch Zhang, so nice to see you.

237
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,310
Congratulations, Your Grace.

238
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,430
Her Majesty sent me to tell you that

239
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,150
the Imperial Board of Astronomy
has done a divination

240
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,190
for Prince Luo and your daughter.

241
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,400
It’s auspicious.

242
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,520
Great! Great!

243
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,400
Did they pick the big day?

244
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,950
They picked several

245
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,790
and His Majesty has the final say.

246
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,790
Your Grace, you can start
preparing for it now.

247
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,270
Thank you so much, Eunuch Zhang.

248
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,550
Thank you so much.

249
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,310
Somebody, come here.

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
Go and fetch the
black wooden box from my study.

251
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,150
Yes.

252
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,120
Eunuch Zhang, if this goes well,

253
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,720
my daughter might
need your help in the future.

254
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,640
We are old friends already.

255
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,000
Here, Eunuch Zhang,

256
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,240
A little something for you,
please take it.

257
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,910
Young Master, here’s a letter from home.

258
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,480
Master has been worrying
for the marriage of Her Ladyship.

259
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,480
Tell Father not to worry.

260
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,310
In the whole Daye,

261
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,950
other than my sister,

262
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,840
Prince Luo has no other choice.

263
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,480
Yes.

264
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,700
<i>What should we prepare</i>

265
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,940
<i>What should we prepare for the wedding?
Figure out a plan.</i>

266
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,360
It’s all natural.

267
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,240
Looks like Prince Luo
has figured it out.

268
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,120
What are you doing?

269
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,600
Oh my dear daughter,

270
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,520
how many more times

271
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,120
should I talk to you about this?

272
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,430
You are going to marry a prince,

273
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,640
but you prefer to be a cook.

274
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,360
Are you a fool?

275
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,310
What happened?

276
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,670
Qilin,

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,950
my meat balls are ruined.

278
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,760
I don’t understand.

279
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,670
Why can Ban Hua
do whatever she wants to

280
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,360
without minding others’ opinions?

281
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,030
In spite of several failed engagements,

282
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,720
she’s still free and easy.

283
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,720
But look at me.

284
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,910
I’m taking every necessary precaution,

285
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,400
but I have no freedom at all.

286
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,640
I can’t even make some meat balls!

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,070
Being in a noble family,

288
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,400
there are some things we can’t control.

289
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,670
Our marriages

290
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,910
are just business.

291
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,790
I chose to break off
my engagement back then,

292
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,880
but what happened?

293
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,760
I lost one eye,

294
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,520
and they made a mess of our home.

295
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Sometimes I would think,

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,120
if I had not chosen
to break off the engagement,

297
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,150
would the result have been different?

298
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,310
Your life would be so miserable.

299
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,430
Marrying a wild woman like Ban Hua,

300
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,640
you would not be leading a good life.

301
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,950
You think so?

302
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,910
Maybe it’s my fault for

303
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,480
falling for her at first.

304
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,030
You, anyway,

305
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,600
should look at the bright side.

306
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,310
Not everyone has the chance
to marry a prince.

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,720
At least,

308
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,000
Xie Family would have someone
to rely on in the imperial palace.

309
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,360
Right?

310
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,600
I understand.

311
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,620
The only benefit of marrying a prince

312
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,180
is a higher status than Ban Hua.

313
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,420
I would never be bullied by her again.

314
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,780
So are you envious of Ban Hua
or jealous of her?

315
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,420
All girls from noble families
dislike her,

316
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,300
I’m no exception.

317
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,260
But maybe she’s not that bad

318
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,220
like what they say.

319
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,420
You are having
this kind of misunderstanding

320
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,580
because you don’t know her so well.

321
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,740
Believe me.

322
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,180
You can find a better girl.

323
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,780
I’m one-eyed now.

324
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,660
Who would like me?

325
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,660
Your Grace, I don’t believe it.

326
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,340
You’ve been practicing
martial arts for a long time,

327
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,140
how could you lose to Prince Luo?

328
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,220
Great now.

329
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,620
You failed to take off his clothes.

330
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,900
We’ll never know if he’s
the man in black.

331
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,260
He’s too cunning!

332
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,220
He wore two jackets.

333
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,740
Only if Count Cheng’an
had come a little later,

334
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,940
just a little bit late.

335
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,140
What does it have to do with him?

336
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,060
He stopped you?

337
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,940
No.

338
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,060
She didn’t want to ruin her image.

339
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,060
She has disgraced herself
for so many times.

340
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,940
Why not this time?

341
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,500
It must not be because of that.

342
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,340
She disgraced herself
in front of other people.

343
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,860
But this time Count Cheng’an was there.

344
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,540
Of course that’s different.
Are you stupid or what?

345
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,060
I hear your every word.

346
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,780
All right. All right.

347
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,020
It was just not a good time.

348
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,420
It’s not that complicated.

349
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,900
The birthday banquet is coming.

350
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,460
Should he cover himself with a quilt,

351
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,420
I would tear that for sure.

352
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,860
But Your Grace, if you really do that,

353
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,780
the grudge between you
and Prince Luo will be so deep.

354
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,420
If he’s really the man in black,

355
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,660
what should you do then?

356
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,740
What’s to be afraid of?

357
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,220
If the man in black is really
as stupid as Jiang Luo,

358
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,780
you think he can plot anything?

359
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,820
I’ll stifle that in the cradle.

360
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,460
Miss, how about this plate?

361
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,420
Too plain.

362
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,660
Take it away.

363
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,620
How about this one?

364
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,500
Too gaudy.

365
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,300
Next.

366
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,420
This one?

367
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,740
Too old mannish.

368
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,860
Miss.

369
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,980
These are the best stuff at our store.

370
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,420
You don’t like them at all?

371
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,660
Sir, can I have a look at those?

372
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,020
Yeah, you can take a look.

373
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,100
Miss, it’s already been reserved.

374
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,980
It’s gorgeous.

375
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,100
Sir,

376
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
how about this?

377
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
I can double whatever price
they offered you.

378
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,460
Just sell this to me.

379
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,420
You can replenish your stock then.

380
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,660
Miss, I can’t do that.

381
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
This buyer is someone
I wouldn’t dare to offend.

382
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,380
Sir, do you know who I am?

383
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,180
No.

384
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,340
Do you know Count Zhongping’s Mansion?

385
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,900
You are Count Xie’s daughter?

386
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,940
The one who’s marrying a prince?

387
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,940
So would you dare to offend

388
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
our Xie Family?

389
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,700
Miss Xie, please don’t
make this hard for me.

390
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,660
Mr. Guo,

391
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,780
is the thing I ordered here?

392
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,020
Ban Heng?

393
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,540
I don’t believe it!

394
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,060
Am I really so unlucky?

395
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,180
I actually met a Ban
while buying a plate!

396
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,020
What could I have done...

397
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,860
Wait a minute, Miss Xie.

398
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,740
to Ban Family in my last life?

399
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,300
What?

400
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,020
Please listen to me.

401
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,460
I just told Young Master Ban

402
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,180
that you were trying to buy the plate.

403
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,500
He refused to let me take it, right?

404
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,220
No, he is willing to.

405
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,780
How is that possible?
I don’t believe it.

406
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,660
Why not?

407
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,660
I have been taught that

408
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,900
a gentleman should be nice to ladies.

409
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
Moreover,

410
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,460
why should I take something away

411
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
from a little girl?

412
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,260
You… are really that nice?

413
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,620
Of course.

414
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,300
It’s rare to meet someone
who has a similar taste as me.

415
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
It means you have a good taste, too.

416
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Miss Xie, it’s OK if you don’t want to

417
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,580
take it.

418
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,460
A lot of people

419
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,420
are trying to buy it.

420
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,140
No way!

421
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,100
Now that Young Master Ban
is willing to let me take it,

422
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,980
then I should

423
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
thank you for that.

424
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,100
If you are willing to pay 200 tales,

425
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,820
you can take this nice plate

426
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,100
with you right now.

427
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,180
Deal!

428
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,580
Deliver it to Xie’s Mansion for me!

429
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,540
All right!

430
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,700
Thank you again, Young Master Ban.
See you around.

431
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,300
It looks like not all Bans are bad.

432
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,900
Your Grace. Please.

433
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,740
There are so many.

434
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,740
Your Grace.

435
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,180
These are all our best ones.

436
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,220
Please take a look.

437
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,780
Not bad.

438
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,900
This one is nice with the peach,
the crane and the old man.

439
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,980
It’s moral is good.

440
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,660
Good.

441
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,100
Your Grace, I have to say

442
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,620
that this one is already reserved.

443
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
The one who picked it

444
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,220
is a scholar who loves paintings.

445
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,700
Your Grace, please pick another one.

446
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,380
What?

447
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,820
I’m pretty good.

448
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,380
I have the taste of a scholar now!

449
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,580
Of course. Of course.

450
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,300
That’s a shame. A real shame.

451
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,820
Now that it’s for
Her Highness’s birthday,

452
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,060
I think I can give it up.

453
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,900
Count Cheng’an?

454
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,700
Now that you picked it first,

455
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,420
no, I can’t take it from you.

456
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,740
Not at all, Your Grace.

457
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,140
Just see it as my respect

458
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,780
to Her Highness.

459
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,180
Count Cheng’an
is truly a fine young man.

460
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,180
OK. I’ll take it then.

461
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,500
But I can’t just take it for granted.

462
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,180
How about this?

463
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,660
I’ll treat you to a drink

464
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
at the best restaurant in the capital.

465
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,100
Well…

466
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,900
I wouldn’t dare
to reject this invitation.

467
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,500
Please.

468
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,300
That’s the spirit I like.

469
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,260
Let’s go!

470
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,460
Send the painting to my mansion.

471
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,020
Your Highness.

472
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,620
His Majesty sent an imperial physician

473
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,900
to feel your pulse.

474
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,860
Your Highness.

475
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,180
I’ll just

476
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,620
send him away.

477
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,660
I know him

478
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,100
the best.

479
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,060
He’ll never give up

480
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,980
before he gets what he wants.

481
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,620
Please.

482
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,020
Your Highness,

483
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,460
after knowing that
you are under the weather lately,

484
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,940
His Majesty is so worried,

485
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,660
so he sent me here to take a look.

486
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,540
Now that it’s His Majesty’s edict,

487
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,740
please do what you should do.

488
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

489
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,980
I’ll feel your pulse now.

490
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,700
Grandma!

491
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,820
Hua.

492
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,860
Physician Wang, is Grandma all right?

493
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,220
Her Highness’s pulse
is smooth and steady.

494
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
She’s fine.

495
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,380
Maybe because of
the cool autumn weather,

496
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,780
she’s not so spirited.

497
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,540
I’ll make some prescriptions

498
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,780
that can help with that.

499
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,980
Tell His Majesty that

500
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,140
I’m all fine.

501
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,820
He’s so busy with state affairs,
don’t worry about me.

502
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
Yes.

503
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,380
It’s my duty.

504
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,980
Physician Wang, I’ll show you out.

505
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,620
Grandma.

506
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,340
Hua.

507
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Your birthday is coming.

508
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,060
What gift do you want?

509
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,140
I just want you

510
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,940
to visit me more often.

511
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,540
That’ll make me very happy.

512
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,140
That’s easy.

513
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,380
Grandma, I’m preparing
for the banquet lately.

514
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,860
Maybe I should move
to your mansion for a while,

515
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,940
so I can make the preparation better.

516
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,380
Hua, your grandmother
doesn’t feel well lately.

517
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,060
You should let her rest well.

518
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,540
The imperial physician just said

519
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,020
that Grandma was all right.

520
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,020
Mother, why don’t our whole family

521
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,500
move here for a while?

522
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,580
All right?

523
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,340
Can we?

524
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,060
OK, of course.

525
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,780
Of course.

526
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,380
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

527
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
Stick. Stick. Tiger!

528
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,900
I lost.

529
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,220
Father!

530
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,300
You are drunk again?

531
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,500
Don’t let Mother see you.

532
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,420
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

533
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
I drank… a little.

534
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,620
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

535
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,700
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
Don’t be mad, Princess.

536
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,500
You are drunk too?

537
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,060
Several hours have passed,

538
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,700
and Princess is still so smart!

539
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,140
She’s my daughter.

540
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,740
I had a pleasant talk with Uncle Ban.

541
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,700
Yeah, pleasant.

542
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,620
That’s why we drank a couple of cups.

543
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,220
Wait, Uncle Ban?

544
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,920
When did you become so familiar?

545
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,340
-Of course.
-Just tonight.

546
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,540
I learnt after a couple of drinks that

547
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,460
Marquis Jingting and my father

548
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,220
were childhood friends!

549
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,020
We were old acquaintances.

550
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,140
We have missed so many chances

551
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,180
to drink and have fun together.

552
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,100
Yeah, that’s right.

553
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,820
OK. OK.

554
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,220
Alright. You’ll have the chance.

555
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,020
Come on.

556
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,100
Come on. Drink with me in my mansion.

557
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,940
Uncle Ban, I feel so good
to drink with you.

558
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,020
Me too.

559
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,900
I don’t want to part with you tonight!

560
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,900
Me neither.

561
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,620
Princess,

562
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,540
aren’t you joining us?

563
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,700
It’s a firm no.

564
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,500
Listen to me, Count Cheng’an.

565
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,940
You can’t drink again.

566
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,860
Otherwise…

567
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,020
Otherwise, what will you do to me?

568
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,300
I’ll beat you to death!

569
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,340
Xia.

570
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,420
Xia.

571
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,980
Where is my daughter?

572
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,860
She’s gone? It’s even better.

573
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,900
Come on, let’s drink in my mansion.

574
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,060
Come on.

575
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,420
Young Master,

576
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,620
after you went to Ban’s Mansion,

577
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,540
I found this
in Princess Royal’s Mansion.

578
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,780
It looks like Her Highness is badly ill.

579
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,780
I don’t think she has much time left.

580
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,140
In this case,

581
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,260
she went through
the imperial physician’s check-up

582
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,820
with the help of this drug.

583
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,940
But Her Highness has been ill

584
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,140
for a long time.

585
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,700
Why did His Majesty suddenly
send an imperial physician today?

586
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,940
His Majesty’s thoughts

587
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,380
are beyond our guess.

588
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,820
Her Highness’s condition

589
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,340
must be very serious,

590
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,300
or she wouldn’t have used this drug

591
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,380
to go through the check-up.

592
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,940
Young Master, should we do something?

593
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,300
Of course.

594
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,020
You know what?

595
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,940
The Princess Royal

596
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,020
is Uncle Ban’s mother,

597
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,780
and Princess Ban’s grandma.

598
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,820
And Princess Ban’s grandma

599
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,140
is also my…

600
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,740
my grandma.

601
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,860
Here.

602
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,580
Grandma.

603
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,580
Drink!

604
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,940
Young Master,

605
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,180
the Tiger Tally is missing now.

606
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,180
Because of Shi Family’s negligence,

607
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,500
His Majesty is giving them
the cold shoulder.

608
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,780
Maybe we should release this message out

609
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,940
and let Ban Family and Shi Family
go against each other,

610
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,740
so we can benefit from the chaos.

611
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,900
We might even catch the
Princess’s mansion off guard

612
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,780
and find the Tiger Tally.

613
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,100
No.

614
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,780
We are not sure if the tally is really

615
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,620
in the Princess’s mansion.

616
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,700
If you ask me,

617
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,260
we should tell His Majesty about this

618
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,900
to win his trust.

619
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,540
I think

620
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,780
this problem

621
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,900
has another solution.

622
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,900
Should we take what he says
seriously now?

623
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,860
You two,

624
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,020
stop whispering in front of me.

625
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,540
Try this.

626
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,460
Open up.

627
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,100
Sweet, huh?

628
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,060
Today,

629
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,860
I drank with Marquis Jingting.

630
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,180
And he told me

631
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,740
that one day

632
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,340
Princess Ban went out
to have fun in the suburb

633
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,260
when she was little,

634
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,620
she saved

635
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,900
a homeless old lady

636
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,700
who was trying to commit suicide.

637
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,740
A homeless old lady? What does he mean?

638
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,180
I think

639
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,220
he’s implying us that

640
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,180
we dress up as homeless old ladies,

641
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,620
and get into Ban’s Mansion
by winning their sympathy.

642
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,740
I never noticed that

643
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,500
you have this kind of hobby.

644
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,220
You…

645
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,020
Wild guesses are a disgrace.

646
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,580
Here, give it to me.

647
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,140
Here.

648
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,820
Princess, look at this.

649
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,200
This cannot do.

650
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,100
Princess, how about this?

651
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,820
Not good.

652
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,740
-Let me see.
-How about this?

653
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,610
Be careful.

654
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,380
No way.

655
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,380
Your…

656
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,140
Quickly.

657
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,860
-Pass.
-Give it to me.

658
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,980
Count, look at this.

659
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,740
No!

660
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,780
Use some heavier material.

661
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,460
We need the best fine gauze,

662
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,380
as thin as possible. No heavy ones.

663
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,460
What? You have different opinions?

664
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,700
No.

665
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,940
But please think twice.

666
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,420
Fine gauze is not elegant enough.

667
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,620
Then…

668
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,140
brocade!

669
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,540
Luxuriant and very stylish now!

670
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,900
Popular things can’t last long.

671
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,180
And I think brocade
is still not elegant enough.

672
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,020
Neither fine gauze nor brocade.

673
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,380
What should we use then?

674
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,540
How about the velvet fabric?

675
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,220
This is too plain.

676
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,580
How is this going to draw attention?

677
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,380
If you ask me, none of these will work.

678
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,460
We’ll make a new fabric.

679
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,940
We’ll use gold threads

680
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,820
to embroider those auspicious words.

681
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,860
We’ll make sure it sparkles!

682
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,180
That’s a good idea.

683
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,620
But think about it,

684
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,860
I don’t think
we have enough time for that.

685
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,700
His Majesty said that the standard

686
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,060
should be equal to that of
Empress Dowager’s birthday.

687
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,060
What’s wrong
with spending a little money?

688
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,940
Princess, the government
advocates thriftiness.

689
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,140
Even if it should be equal to
empress dowager’s birthday,

690
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,420
we should not seek for overspending,

691
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,420
or it might be controversial.

692
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,460
Thriftiness huh?

693
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,380
OK, if the budget isn’t enough,

694
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,860
our Ban Family will cover it, alright?

695
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,380
Yes,

696
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,660
and no.

697
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,740
His Majesty issued an edict, saying that

698
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,780
the expenses of this banquet

699
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,060
would all be covered by the
Imperial Household Department.

700
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,140
Princess, are you
going against the imperial edict?

701
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Rong Xia!

702
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,020
You are making trouble, right?

703
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,420
I’m just doing my job.

704
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,860
Please don’t misunderstand it.

705
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,460
Tell me, who should we listen to?

706
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,020
Well…

707
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,340
You are the assistant minister
of Ministry of Rites,

708
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,940
I’d like to hear your opinions.

709
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,100
Well…

710
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,620
Please do tell.

711
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,140
Princess, Count,

712
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,100
in front of you two,

713
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,580
there’s no place for me
to make the decision.

714
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,260
I’m very busy here.

715
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,060
If you still can’t make the decision,

716
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,260
maybe you should continue looking.

717
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,820
Director.

718
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,980
Princess, Count.

719
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,900
I don’t care about the other pastries.

720
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,540
Add some Longjing Cake here.

721
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,460
What is Longjing Cake?

722
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,940
Count,

723
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,060
Longjing Cake needs
fresh tea leaves as a material.

724
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,020
The tea leaves
can’t be older than three days.

725
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,100
The water it uses is rain water from
24 specific days throughout the year.

726
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,140
And it uses flour
made of the core of malts

727
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,780
and the essence
of all kinds of glazed fruits.

728
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,020
It’s just a pastry,

729
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,620
yet it costs the essence of four seasons

730
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,820
all over the world.

731
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,660
That’s too extravagant.

732
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,060
Rong Xia!

733
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,380
You can simplify anything.
Velvet is fine too.

734
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,020
You can make the decision
for those things.

735
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,420
But Longjing Cake must be added.

736
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,420
No way.

737
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,860
Her Highness’s birthday banquet

738
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,180
is not a family affair,

739
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,460
but a state affair.

740
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,860
Every detail of it

741
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,020
represents the royal family.

742
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,940
Please do not insist.

743
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,060
I understand your feeling,

744
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,340
it’s just that…

745
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,100
You know nothing!

746
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,620
Count, please don’t mind.

747
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,020
Although Longjing Cake is precious,

748
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,140
there’s a story behind it.

749
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,100
Back then, the Longjing Cake

750
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,700
was Old General Ban
and the Princess Royal’s

751
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,020
token of love.

752
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,380
That must be why

753
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,220
Princess Ban insisted on having it

754
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,860
I don’t want to go to

755
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,100
Ban Family’s banquet at all!

756
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,260
So what if I’m grounded?

757
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,460
Your Highness.

758
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,060
Director Wang said that

759
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,300
somebody has copied the book
for 500 times for you.

760
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,260
Who’s that?

761
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
I think…

762
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,980
I think it’s Princess Ban.

763
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,620
Send this letter
to Rites Director’s Office,

764
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,300
How could I not contribute

765
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,420
to Ban Family’s banquet?

766
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,740
Yes, I’ll go right now.

767
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,860
Wait!

768
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,140
Send those gifts to Xie Family

769
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,700
and tell them
I carefully picked them myself

770
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,100
for Xie Wanyu.

771
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,740
Yes, I understand.

772
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,780
Sister, let me see yours.

773
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,100
Your flowers are like real ones.

774
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,180
They are gorgeous!

775
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,460
Look at mine, they are ugly.

776
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,900
Don’t say that.

777
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,700
You are just having a quick temper

778
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,180
and are always distracted
by the beautiful flowers.

779
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,380
By the way, do you know that

780
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,780
Count Rong

781
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,220
was ordered to arrange
Princess Royal’s banquet?

782
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,660
Ban Hua and Count Rong
are together every day.

783
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,820
The whole capital is talking about that,

784
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,140
how could I not know?

785
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,820
Princess Ban is so free and easy.

786
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,420
Although unmarried,

787
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,140
she can be together with a man
day in and day out.

788
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,460
That’s really courageous.

789
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,060
Courageous.

790
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,100
Compared with Ban Hua,

791
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,220
we do lack some courage.

792
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
We don’t dare tell the people we like
about our feelings.

793
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,460
What’s wrong with you today?

794
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,340
You are praising Ban Hua?

795
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,140
Well…

796
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,780
Miss Xie,

797
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Prince Luo sent me

798
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,100
to bring you some gifts.

799
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,140
Isn’t he unwilling to marry me?

800
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,580
What are the gifts for?

801
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,500
You misunderstood, Miss.

802
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,700
His Highness

803
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,660
is absolutely sincere to you.

804
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,460
It’s Princess Royal’s birthday.

805
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,620
His Highness worries that

806
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,780
the gifts Xie’s Mansion prepared
would not be magnificent enough,

807
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,300
so he wants to help with it.

808
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,980
However poor our Xie Family is,

809
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,340
we don’t need his subsidy.

810
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,260
Go back and tell him that

811
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,740
we can’t take

812
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,060
his generous gifts!

813
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,780
But…

814
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,820
It looks like Prince Luo
is really unreliable.

815
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,100
Softy, Rocky.

816
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,300
Whenever I need you,

817
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,340
you are not around.

818
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,620
Hello?

819
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,340
Where is this place?

820
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,980
Who’s mourning hall is this?

821
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
<i>Ban Family’s Ancestors’ Tablet</i>

822
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,060
<i>General-in-chief of the State’s Tablet</i>

823
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,940
<i>Princess Royal Dening’s Tablet</i>

824
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,060
Grandma!

825
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,180
Princess!

826
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,980
Why are you here?

827
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,540
Grandma.

828
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,900
I can’t fall asleep alone.

829
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,500
I want to sleep with you.

830
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,820
OK.

831
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,100
OK. All right.

832
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

833
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,500
His Majesty ordered me to arrange
Your Highness’s birthday banquet.

834
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,100
I have something
to discuss with Your Highness.

835
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,900
Daye is full of young talents.

836
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,220
Why did His Majesty

837
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,060
pick you over everybody?

838
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:56,980
Your Highness,

839
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,860
I’m just lucky
for being favored by His Majesty

840
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,780
for doing everything cautiously.

841
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,300
Everybody in the
imperial court is cautious.

842
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,980
Are you being lucky

843
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,660
or holding other intentions?

844
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Excuse me, Your Highness,

845
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,460
I don’t know what you mean.

846
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,860
When Xie Family broke off
the engagement,

847
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,460
although you were not
related to Ban Family,

848
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,780
you stepped up and saved Heng.

849
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,060
The thing about Hua whipping Shen Yu.

850
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,100
It was also you who helped Ban Family

851
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,820
in the imperial court.

852
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,100
For those things,

853
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,140
I just did what

854
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,220
a righteous man should do.

855
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,060
I admire you for your righteous doings.

856
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,380
But rumors are going around
in the capital

857
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,580
saying that you and Hua are having
a really pleasant cooperation.

858
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,100
And that’s also why His Majesty

859
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,540
appointed you to help
arrange the banquet.

860
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,980
What do you think

861
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,300
His Majesty’s intention is?

862
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,940
I wouldn’t dare to guess
His Majesty’s intentions.

863
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,500
But I think you are pretty bold!

864
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,220
I’ve been with three emperors,

865
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,620
and seen a lot of people.

866
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,500
You are deliberately
approaching Ban Family.

867
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,300
What’s your purpose?

868
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,060
Over ten years ago,

869
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,540
after Old General Ban passed away,

870
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,460
the Bans lost power overnight.

871
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,180
And Your Highness,

872
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,740
you voluntarily stepped down
from a high position.

873
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,620
Why was that?

874
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,060
Please allow me

875
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,740
to ask you something, Your Highness.

876
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,660
Do you still remember

877
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,900
what happened then?

878
00:40:55,364 --> 00:41:14,364
