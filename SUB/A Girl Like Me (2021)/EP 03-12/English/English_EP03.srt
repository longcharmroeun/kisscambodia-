Count Xie is right.

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,350
Young Master Xie, take your time.

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,790
This matters a couple of people’s
reputation and innocence.

46
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,950

It was on the day your eye got hurt

when Miss Shi gave you the book.

54

Aren’t you afraid of

I don’t think

65
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,180
you come here just to return

However,

if it’s proved that your Xie family
framed Ban Heng,

72

I’m afraid your private meeting

will also be revealed.

On that day in the backyard,

80
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,580
I tripped over my own feet

81
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,390
and got my eye pricked by
the branches on the ground.

how serious the crime is
to deceive His Majesty?

Xie Qilin

91
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,350
committed a crime of lying to me.

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,820
But now he is blind.

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,270
I think

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,670
I’ll give him 20 floggings

95
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,030
and forbid him
to come to court for life.

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
What do you think?

97
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,030
Your Majesty,
I understand your generosity.

98
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,790
All right.

99
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,030
Xie Qilin committed a felony
of deceiving me.

100
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,060
But considering your family’s
contribution to the country,

101
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,550
I will give you a milder punishment

102
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,270
of 20 floggings and you can never
come to the court.

103
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

104

105

Thank you for your help in the court.

106
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,470
It’s just...

107
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,300
You didn’t say anything

108
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,420
in the court.

109
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,980
Is it because of your sister?

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,860
Nothing can escape from your eyes.

111
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,470
I am entrusted by His Majesty.
But I covered up for my family.

112
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,790
I had left Xie’s Mansion

113
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,980
when Young Master Xie
was injured that day.

114
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,380
What’s more,

115
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,620
if others know
that I met him in private,

116
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,710
that will hurt
our Shi family’s reputation.

117
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,940
I feel ashamed.

118
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,470
Don’t blame yourself.

119
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,470
You are an upright person.

120
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,060
But people are not sages.

121
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,860
Nobody can be totally unselfish.

122
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,060
Not to mention

123
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
it concerns your sister.

124
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,940
I can understand it.

125
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,420
Duke of Zhou, thank you for
hearing our prayers.

126
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,860
Fortunately, Xie Qilin’s blindness

127
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,940
has nothing to do with our Ban family.

128
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,420
I also hope

129
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,740
you can give us guidance

130
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,060
when there is a real crisis next time.

131

Duke of Zhou.

132
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,150

with money to spend for generations.

134
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,710
Don’t confiscate our mansion.

135
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,740
In a few days,

136
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,620
there will be a cockfighting.

137
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,420
Duke of Zhou, you must
show up in my dream

138
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,230
and tell me which cock can win.

139
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,820
Please show up in my dream.

140

141
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,420

142

get involved with the Xie family again.

143

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,420

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,180
You may rise.

146
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,470
Thank you, Your Majesty!

147
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,860
Bad news.

148
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,910
There is news from the Palace

149
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,790
that His Majesty believes
your family hides private possession.

150
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,940
He ordered to confiscate your mansion,

151
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,620
including everything under your name.

152
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,590
Why did I have such a weird dream?

153
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,500
Duke of Zhou, please tell me.

154
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,620
See? I told you.

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,350
The dream of Xie Qilin’s blindness
came true as well.

156
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,740
Will there be

157

any new emperor enthroned

158
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,230
to confiscate our mansion?

159
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,110
By that time,

160
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,500
I won’t be a young master,

161
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,740
and you won’t be a baroness anymore.

162
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,740
Yes, dear.

163
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,590
Does it mean

164
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,270
we will become commoners?

165
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,910
What else can we do?

166
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,590
If it comes true,

167
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,790
we have to learn to live a hard life.

168
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,620
No way.

169
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,500
We should think about
how to save ourselves.

170
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,180
Who do you think

171
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,670
this new emperor will be?

172
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,340
Will it be the Crown Prince?

173
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,460
The Crown Prince is gentle and kind.

174
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,580
Even if he takes the throne,

175
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,550
he won’t be that ruthless to us for
the sake of our previous relationship.

176
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,630
Then it must be the Second Prince.

177
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,100
He is treacherous and malicious.
It must be him.

178
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,100
It’s hard to say.

179
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,150
Will it be an important minister
around His Majesty?

180
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,340
Forget it.

181
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,460
Stop the wild guess.

182
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,060
We can’t stop what should come.

183
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Isn’t there a saying?

184
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,300
Enjoy while we can

185
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,870
and leave the worries till tomorrow.

186
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,100
Being worried can’t change anything.

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,630
Exactly.

188
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,390
It’s better

189
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,510
to be happy every day

190
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,580
and live a more comfortable life

191
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,820
with no regret!

192
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,910
That’s right!

193
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,750
-Come on!
-Come on!

194
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,580
-Cheers!
-That’s right.

195
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,910
Hua, you do have a point.

196
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,990
Come on, pour it up for me.

197
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,510
-Hua.
-All right.

198
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,790
I think our top priority

199
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,820
should be

200
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,510
listing all the things
we haven’t bought yet

201
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,180
and starting purchasing
one by one tomorrow.

202
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,750
Yes, my son is right.

203
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,180
By the way, dear.

204
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,940
Can you buy me the antique fan

205
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,460
I wanted to buy last time?

206
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,180
Do you want to buy it?

207
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,060
Of course.

208
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,990
Then buy it.

209
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,220
That’s great!

210
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,180
Let’s eat and drink well,

211
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,270
and live our life extravagantly
while we still can.

212
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Yeah.

213
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,030
Listen to me.

214
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,300
I have come up with ways
to cope with it.

215
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,670
First,

216
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,940
find a place

217
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,550
to bury our treasure

218
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,750
in case when we need it.

219
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,340
That’s a good method.

220
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,220
Second,

221
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,220
look for the candidate
for the new emperor.

222
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,990
Turn to him and establish
a good relationship with him

223
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,150
Turn to him and establish
a good relationship with him

224
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,870
before he takes the throne.

225
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,060
My wife is so wise.

226
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,700
Third and the most important,

227
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,300
there is no limit on consumption
from now on.

228
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,630
Let’s live a happy life every day

229
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,390
and spend our life as three lifetimes!

230
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,030
Great!

231
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,300
Come on!

232
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,460
Cheers!

233
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,060
That’s great!

234
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,750
Mother, go ahead and eat.

235
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,700
No!

236
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,340
Baroness, how about this one?

237
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Baroness, how about this one?

238
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,220
It’s too vulgar.

239
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,940
Pretentious scholar

240
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,220
like Count Cheng’an

241
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,460
won’t fancy this kind of stuff

242
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,750
like me.

243
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,700
Baroness, I think you should give him

244
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,910
a stone lock for exercise.

245
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,700
He is too weak.

246
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,030
He is the sage-life type.

247
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,390
Just like Shi Feixian. Keep thinking.

248
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,510
Then send him
some calligraphy and painting

249
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,270
based on his hobby.

250
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,550
Yeah.

251
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,910
That’s not a bad idea.

252
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,100
Then I’ll send him the best one.

253
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,100
I got it.

254
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,990
I heard from my father that

255
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,940
the more inside, the more precious.

256
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,180
Baroness, can we do it tomorrow?

257
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,670
Strike while the iron is hot. Hurry up.

258
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,220
Young Master.

259
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,510
This is a thank-you gift
from Baroness Ban.

260
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,510
This is

261
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,180
A Panorama of Rivers and Mountains.

262
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,790
A Panorama of Rivers and Mountains?

263
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,700
Isn’t it the long-lost painting

264
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,420
of the previous dynasty?

265
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,340
Exactly.

266
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,990
It is said that there are
many secrets in this painting.

267
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,580
Many people suspect

268
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,270
that it is relevant
to a batch of missing treasures

269
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,220
of the previous dynasty.

270
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,150
The Tiger Tally commanding
Daye’s three armies also disappeared

271
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,270
with this painting back that time.

272
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,910
Tiger Tally?

273
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,670
Young Master, the Ban family
has this painting.

274
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,940
Do you think
the Tiger Tally is also there?

275
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,340
Not necessarily.

276
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,510
But there is one thing I’m sure.

277
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,990
Baroness Ban doesn’t know
how precious this painting is.

278
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,670
Young Master, should we
accept this painting?

279
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,820
Of course, we’ll take it.

280
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,790
After all those investigations,

281
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,030
what happened that year
is closely related to the Tiger Tally.

282
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,030
Maybe we are close to the truth.

283
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,580
Young Master, could it be

284
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,940
that the Ban family has been

285
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,270
playing dumb all these years,

286
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,420
and actually, they are unfathomable?

287
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,270
We will know whether they are
playing dumb after we test them.

288
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,820
Make some arrangements.

289
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,550
Gather everyone.
We will have a secret meeting.

290
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,990
Don’t leak the news and alarm the court.

291
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,060
It’s so heavy.

292
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,940
You should ask Softy to carry it.

293
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,630
Why do you let me carry it?

294
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,420
Softy can pick this up

295
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,390
with two fingers.

296
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,270
Why are you so weak as a man?

297
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,820
You eat a lot.

298
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,870
Where did the food go?

299
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,940
Where else could it go?

300
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,460
The outhouse.

301
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,550
I won’t bicker with you.

302
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,340
This seems to be a good place.

303
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,220
Let’s bury it now.

304
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,990
Here.

305
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,790
This is our life-saving money.

306
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,150
It can’t be found out.

307
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,390
Of course.

308
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,340
What are you doing?

309
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,460
Count Cheng’an?

310
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,300
Why are you here?

311
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,670
Baroness Ban,
Young Master Ban, you are...

312
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,820
We are here to bury the treasure.

313
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,580
It’s a game my brother and I

314
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,870
have been playing since our childhood.

315
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,940
We bury the treasure first,

316
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,420
then we will come back
to look for it in the future.

317
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,820
Baroness Ban, Young Master Ban?

318
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,180
Did you find the cat?

319
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,390
I’ve looked everywhere,
but I didn’t find it.

320
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,030
Wang Qu is checking the right side.

321
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,990
My stomach hurts!

322
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
You were just fine.
What’s wrong with you?

323
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,420
I can’t hold it.

324
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,340
I need to find a place to solve it.

325
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,550
Your Grace, it’s late now.

326
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,910
Can I bother you to send Hua home?

327
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,670
What are you talking about?

328
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,940
Let me say something to Du Jiu

329
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,670
before I send Baroness Ban back,
is it okay?

330
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,510
Thank you, Your Grace.

331
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,990
Hua, it’s dark now.

332
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,390
Enjoy your time together.

333
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,820
Find out if they buried treasure here.

334
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,270
If not,

335
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,270
get rid of both of them.

336
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,220
Your Grace, you can leave me here.

337
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,990
There is only one way.
I won’t get lost.

338
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,550
I promised Young Master Ban,

339
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,510
not to mention it’s dangerous at night.

340
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,940
How can I let you go back alone?

341
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,910
It’s thoughtful of you.

342
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,750
But I’m very curious

343
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,300
about your lost cat.

344
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,150
It’s not an easy trip

345
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,030
from your mansion to this place.

346
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,460
Yeah.

347
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,220
My cat

348
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,390
is kind of like you.

349
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,180
It likes to come to
the middle of nowhere

350
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,270
at night to look for treasures.

351
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,150
I’m not here to look for treasure.

352
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,750
I’m here to bury treasure.

353
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,180
However,

354
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,300
you are not here to find your cat.

355
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,060
I’m afraid you are
hiding something from me.

356
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,030
What do you think I’m doing here?

357
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,580
You scholars are really troublesome.

358
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,060
Can’t you just say it?

359
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,510
You have to make people guess.

360
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,550
Boring.

361
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,220
All right, you can leave me here.

362
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,270
There is a sound in the forest.

363
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,790
Could it be your cat?

364
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,100
Baroness.

365
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,750
I left in a rush

366
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,270
and might lose my jade pendant.

367
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,940
You lost your jade pendant
in a perfect time.

368
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,300
Otherwise, if I go down the mountain,

369
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,150
you’ll have to look for it by yourself.

370
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,220
Why do you have to
find a cat here at night?

371
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,510
Why is it over there?

372
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,510
Don’t worry, I’ll pick it up.

373
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,580
It’s windy in the forest.

374
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,630
Don’t catch a cold.

375
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,340
You are just a weak scholar.

376
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,900
But the strength of your hands

377
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,270
is almost like someone
who practices martial arts.

378
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,380
It’s late now.

379
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,030
Let me send you back home.

380
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,750
What about your jade pendant?

381
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,140
That’s okay.

382
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,300
It’s dark now.

383
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,790
It’s dangerous in the deep forest.

384
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,380
A little jade pendant

385
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,470
is not as important as your safety.

386
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:40,820
Baroness.

387
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,510
Please.

388
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,190
Count Cheng’an said,

389
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,430
if there is no signal,

390
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,750
we should kill that woman.

391
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,820
Baroness.

392
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,140
Actually, there is one thing
I want to tell you.

393
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,300
I really like the gift

394
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,860
you sent me last time.

395
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,710
It’s nothing. Not a problem.

396
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,140
Hold on.

397
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,230
That’s A Panorama
of Rivers and Mountains.

398
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,340
Do you really not know
the meaning of it?

399
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,950
Did you just meet me?

400
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,580
I don’t care

401
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,790
what kind of panorama it is.

402
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,230
However, why do you, a scholar,

403
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,790
dress like this today?

404
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,820
Let’s say goodbye now.

405
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,190
Hurry up, send the signal.

406
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,750
Oh, no!

407
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,060
It’s really strange today.

408
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,750
There are people setting off fireworks

409
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,140
on the mountain
in the middle of the night.

410
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,860
You like fireworks?

411
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,470
It’s like shimmering stars in the sky.

412
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,100
Don’t you like it?

413
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,620
The fireworks go by in a flash.

414
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,950
What’s interesting about it?

415
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,060
They are actually setting off money.
It’s the most impractical thing.

416
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,140
You have a point.

417
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,710
It’s late now.

418
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,550
Let me send you back.

419
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,790
Baroness, please.

420
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,300
I’ll reluctantly accept your kindness.

421
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,430
Young Master, we...

422
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,060
Du Jiu.

423
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,790
Drive the carriage
and send Baroness Ban back now.

424
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,580
Yes.

425
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,270
His carriage also can’t be judged
by appearance.

426
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,580
Baroness, please go back.

427
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,990
There is a cool breeze at night.

428
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,430
You should drink some ginger soup.

429
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,270
You keep looking at me.

430
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,710
Is there anything else?

431
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,430
I didn’t expect

432
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,230
your shabby carriage

433
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,470
to be quite comfortable to sit inside.

434
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,060
No way.

435
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,860
That’s the only carriage
in Rong’s Mansion.

436
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,140
He needs to take it to court every day.

437
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,790
I understand.

438
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,100
I will ask someone

439
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,790
to write down the specifications
of the carriage

440
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,860
and send it to your mansion tomorrow.

441
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,190
Is that okay for you?

442
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,300
You are really good-hearted.

443
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,190
You overpraised me.

444
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I’m sleepy.

445
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,790
Your Grace, go home and rest earlier.

446
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,140
Forget it.

447
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,510
Beauty sleep is more important.

448
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,330
<i>Moonlight through the Cloud</i>

449
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,430
<i>Moonlight through the Cloud</i>
Young Master, I have checked it.

450
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,030
Our secret meeting in the forest
wasn’t exposed.

451
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,470
I have found out the stuff

452
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,300
that Ban Hua and Ban Heng buried.

453
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,550
They came there to bury the treasure.

454
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,710
Open it.

455
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,990
It’s nothing but money.

456
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,580
Ban Hua and Ban Heng

457
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,140
have no serious things to do.

458
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,230
Young Master.

459
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,510
What to do with the treasure?

460
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,950
Let me

461
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,790
keep it for Baroness Ban.

462
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,660
Those who have a chance
are at their own advantage.

463
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,100
Then I’ll take it as my chance.

464
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,140
Young Master, should I get
some secret guards

465
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,790
to see if there is anything missing?

466
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,270
No need.

467
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,790
It’s a good thing for us

468
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,340
that the Ban family
hold deep feelings for each other.

469
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,750
Getting close to any of them

470
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,660
is favorable for us to approach

471
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,470
Princess Royal.

472
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,750
Young Master, I’m thinking,

473
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,030
will Baroness Ban suspect it?

474
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,430
If she suspects it,

475
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,100
will she ruin our plan?

476
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,900
You worry too much.

477
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,900
These details won’t bother Baroness Ban.

478
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,530
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

479
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,710
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
Exquisite workmanship and materials.

480
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,860
Count Cheng’an has a good taste.

481
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,190
Good enough for you to marry him.

482
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,340
Father, this is serious.

483
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,230
Can you take it seriously?

484
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,300
Isn’t this just an ordinary black coat?

485
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,470
I can buy ten same coats

486
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,990
when I go out with my bird.

487
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,060
How can you be sure

488
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,470
that Count Cheng’an

489
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,230
is the new emperor in your dream
who will usurp the throne?

490
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,510
Hua, I think you are
at the age for marriage.

491
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,860
That’s why you dreamed
about the talented

492
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,190
and handsome Count Cheng’an
at that quiet night.

493
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,380
And you might accidentally

494
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,140
confuse your dreams.

495
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,340
Just shut up.

496
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,140
What Hua said is
not entirely unreasonable.

497
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,750
Ushering the throne is not for fun.

498
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,820
How can an ordinary person
be capable of doing it?

499
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,950
Didn’t Hua say

500
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,380
that in her dream, the new emperor

501
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,230
is outstanding in appearance?

502
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,100
In terms of appearance,

503
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Hua, Rong Xia is better than you.

504
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,340
I’ll warn you one more time.

505
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,300
Shut up.

506
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,030
Count Cheng’an is an upright person.

507
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Besides, His Majesty brought him up.

508
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,550
No matter who
has the intention of rebellion,

509
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,710
he won’t be that one.

510
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,950
Let’s forget whether he will do it.

511
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,030
Right now,

512
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,060
we have set the countermeasures.

513
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,860
It’s always right to build a good
relationship with Rong Xia, right?

514
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,900
My girl.

515
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,230
I’ll leave this to you.

516
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,950
Since Rong Xia is
a model for all scholars,

517
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,950
try all the things
that a scholar would fancy,

518
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,190
like the zither, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

519
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,060
There will be one thing
that can win him over.

520
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,380
Why is it me again?

521
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,230
Give me one.

522
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,820
Do you think

523
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,950
I will entrust our whole family

524
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,030
to these two people?

525
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,710
I’ll do it.

526
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,270
However,

527
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,620
Rong Xia seems to be unworldly,

528
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,230
but if he really attempts to
usurp the throne,

529
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,750
you still have to be careful about him.

530
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,230
Don’t worry, Mother.

531
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,060
No hypocrite

532
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,620
can lie in front of me.

533
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,710
<i>Announcement</i>
High price for the private information

534
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,660
<i>Announcement</i>
of Count Cheng’an.

535
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,950
The price is fair.

536
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,340
<i>Yuzhen Restaurant</i>
Young Master.

537
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,950
<i>Yuzhen Restaurant</i>
Don’t you think

538
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,230
<i>Yuzhen Restaurant</i>
the way we did it is too ostentatious?

539
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,580
<i>Yuzhen Restaurant</i>
That’s your ignorance.

540
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,580
This is the most low-key way

541
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,990
for our Ban family to handle it.

542
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,950
What kind of person

543
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,270
is this Count Cheng’an?

544
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,100
Go back and bring
two more boxes of silver.

545
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,820
This time, we must buy
all the information

546
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,710
about Count Cheng’an,

547
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,750
catching him off guard
and making him hard to resist.

548
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,950
How is it?

549
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,710
Am I just like

550
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,820
Shi Feixian now?

551
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,380
Baroness, why do I feel it weird?

552
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,510
What’s weird?

553
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,470
My hair, clothes, makeup

554
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,510
and the hand pose,

555
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,190
I did all of these to imitate her.

556
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,790
Baroness, this is called
a blooming garlic trying to

557
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,190
pretend to be a narcissus.

558
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,270
I think

559
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,470
you should change it back.

560
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,860
It looks scary.

561
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,950
I’m catering to his pleasure.

562
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,860
Didn’t they say that all scholars

563
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,510
love women like Shi Feixian?

564
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,900
If Count Cheng’an likes Shi Feixian,

565
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,550
there will be no chance left for you.

566
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,820
You go too far.

567
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,990
Come on, Baroness.

568
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,990
This is the collection of
poems you want.

569
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,990
I searched the whole mansion
and couldn’t find one.

570
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,580
<i>Poetry Collection of Mountain and Moon</i>
I bought it this morning.

571
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,900
Yeah.

572
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,430
From today, we should

573
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,900
prepare more elegant stuff
in our mansion.

574
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,190
I got it.

575
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,300
From now on, whatever Miss Shi buys,

576
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,230
we will buy two of them.

577
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,230
But the characters in this book
are too small.

578
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,430
It might blur my vision
if I read it for too long.

579
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,620
Baroness, why do you do something
you don’t want to do?

580
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,580
You are Ban Hua.

581
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,710
Just use your own way

582
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,620
to win him over.

583
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,550
Exactly.

584
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,430
I think

585
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,710
we should tie Count Cheng’an up

586
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,270
and ask him whatever you want.

587
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,580
It’ll make you comfortable

588
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,580
and make us happy!

589
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,950
This is good.

590
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,710
Got it.

591
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,100
What? Do you really want to tie him up?

592
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,030
Am I that brainless?

593
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,900
Are you having a meal?

594
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,710
As you can see,

595
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,990
if you have any business,

596
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,100
can you wait until I finish my lunch?

597
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,710
It’s the perfect time.

598
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,230
Your Grace, there is something
you don’t know.

599
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,100
Baroness spent a lot of money

600
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,710
for this meal.

601
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,860
She ordered special food boxes

602
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,710
and sent them here at top speed

603
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,820
to keep the dishes from cooling down.

604
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,270
I haven’t seen Baroness

605
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,030
treat anybody so attentively.

606
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,580
You are busy with business.

607
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,340
You can’t have a sloppy meal.

608
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,430
Come on, have a taste.

609
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,660
See if you like them.

610
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,300
In fact,

611
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,140
if you need anything,

612
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,550
you can just tell me.

613
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,790
Nothing.

614
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,380
It’s just

615
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,820
that I miss you.

616
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,190
I want to care about you.

617
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,430
I’m all sincere.

618
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,550
Good-looking and good-tempered.

619
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,140
The most important thing

620
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,790
is that she cares about
our young master.

621
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,660
I have to write this down.

622
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,820
Bass once, bacon twice!

623
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,470
Lotus root once!

624
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,750
Tendon

625
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,820
was not touched!

626
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,380
No this dish next time.

627
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,380
By the way, Sir.

628
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,950
You know him the best.

629
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,750
What is his favorite dish?

630
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,470
Baroness.

631
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,900
It’s the dish in the middle.

632
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,950
That’s what he likes to eat.

633
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,430
He misses the taste of it
if he doesn’t eat it for a few days.

634
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,860
Really?

635
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,100
Let me try it.

636
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,900
What is this?

637
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
Mustard fish.

638
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,060
He liked it when he was young.

639
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,230
Really?

640
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,550
Baroness also liked it
when she was young.

641
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,380
But from your expression,

642
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,790
looks like it doesn’t suit your taste.

643
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,750
How could it be?

644
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,470
I really like it.

645
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,140
That’s great.

646
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,430
You got me all these delicacies.

647
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,820
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

648
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,580
Let me pay you back.

649
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,750
Thank you.

650
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,610
<i>Yuzhen Restaurant</i>

651
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,710
<i>Yuzhen Restaurant</i>
It’s true.

652
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,860
<i>Yuzhen Building</i>
Count Cheng’an likes

653
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,340
to use his left little finger
to pick his nose.

654
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,790
I saw it with my own eyes.

655
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,620
There is a witness.

656
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,820
I didn’t know that Rong Xia
would actually pick his nose.

657
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,190
Hua will definitely like the news.

658
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,300
Reward him.

659
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,380
Why are there so many people?

660
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,710
Does the restaurant

661
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,100
launch any new snacks?

662
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,550
There is something you don’t know.

663
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,230
We are all here

664
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,750
to get rewards from Young Master Ban.

665
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,030
That idiot from the Ban family.

666
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,660
He is indeed rich but stupid.

667
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,430
Young Master.

668
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,100
Here is your favorite scallion chicken.

669
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,300
You may leave now.

670
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,470
I need to eat chicken now.

671
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,470
You can come back this afternoon.

672
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,950
I didn’t expect such a tasteless person

673
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,430
to enjoy the same food like me.

674
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,620
Why do you have time to visit me today?

675
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,990
I have some news

676
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,300
that I have to tell you.

677
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,550
What happened?

678
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,710
Now the Ban family

679
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,060
is inquiring about

680
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,100
Count Cheng’an’s preferences
in the city.

681
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,230
Feixian,

682
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,430
it must be Ban Hua
making a move to Rong Xia.

683
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,620
That’s Ban Hua’s business.

684
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,580
What does it have
anything to do with me?

685
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,140
The whole capital knows

686
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,950
that Count Cheng’an and you
are a couple.

687
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,230
Now Ban Hua stepped between you.

688
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,190
What does that mean?

689
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,990
You must teach her a lesson.

690
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,750
Why are you being
so tactless and indiscreet?

691
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,710
Everyone knows

692
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,190
that Count Cheng’an is
a model for all scholars.

693
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,100
Every woman wants to marry him.

694
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,060
You mustn’t talk nonsense.

695
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,660
Feixian, it’s not the time

696
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,060
to be modest.

697
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,430
If you don’t make any move now,

698
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,660
do you want to watch

699
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,380
Ban Hua take Rong Xia away?

700
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,710
But marriage is up to

701
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,300
the matchmaker and our parents.

702
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,340
What can I do?

703
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,710
We can’t just let Ban Hua have him.

704
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,030
We have to do something to stop her.

705
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,510
Do you have any idea?

706
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,030
Let me think.

707
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,620
How about we get someone

708
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,270
to scare Ban Hua

709
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,510
and warn her to never
approach Count Cheng’an?

710
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,310
How is it?

711
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,740
Isn’t it a good idea?

712
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,030
For a woman like Ban Hua,

713
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,990
what do you think

714
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,430
can scare her?

715
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,930
<i>Jiang Luo, The Second Prince of Daye</i>

716
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,140
Greetings, Your Highness.

717
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,180
Long time no see.

718
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,390
You have become more beautiful.

719
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,550
You overpraised me.

720
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,390
Don’t feel uptight.

721
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,580
You are the Crown Princess’ sister.

722
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,310
It means you are my sister.

723
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,660
According to the rules of Daye,

724
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,180
this is given to you by me,

725
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,310
the handsome and unparalleled prince.

726
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,910
Don’t get too excited. Just take it.

727
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,950
That’s very generous of you.

728
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,870
But my family rule is strict.

729
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,510
I’m afraid it doesn’t
conform to the etiquette.

730
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,060
Don’t be so conventional.

731
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,220
Come on, have a seat.

732
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,550
Take it, come on.

733
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,260
Feixian.

734
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,550
Sister.

735
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,430
<i>Shi Suyue,
Granddaughter of Prime Minister</i>

736
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,650
<i>Crown Princess</i>
Why are you here?

737
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

738
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,990
I just came from Mother.

739
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,470
She asked why you haven’t
gone to greet her.

740
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,390
It turns out that you are stalled here.

741
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,740
I’m going now.

742
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,830
Don’t be bothered.

743
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,430
Have a seat.

744
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,430
Feixian, there is something
you don’t know.

745
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,700
The Empress always favors
the Second Prince.

746
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,910
That’s how he developed
this licentious personality.

747
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,060
Sorry you had to go through that.

748
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,620
Luckily, you showed up in time.

749
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,990
Otherwise, I really don’t know
what to do.

750
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,910
Don’t get close to the Second Prince.

751
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,430
You must be careful.

752
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,030
What is this?

753
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,100
Count Cheng’an’s preferences
are all here.

754
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,870
Your Grace, good morning!

755
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,780
It’s not time for meal.
Why is she here now?

756
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,180
Morning, Baroness.

757
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,700
There is heavy dew in the morning.

758
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,950
Your Grace, your body is weak.

759
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,260
Don’t get sick.

760
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,660
You sent food and clothes.

761
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,060
What’s your intention?

762
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,180
Please just tell us.

763
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,580
Du Jiu.

764
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,550
Baroness, I’ll take the clothes.

765
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,660
That’s more like it.

766
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,550
Okay, let me get this straight.

767
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,910
From now on,

768
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,350
you can go to rest.

769
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,470
I’ll escort him

770
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,060
to court and to home from today.

771
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,180
No way.

772
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,430
Why not?

773
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,830
Beauty with fancy carriage.

774
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,830
Only such a carriage can match him.

775
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,740
As long as I am here,

776
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,660
he won’t get on your carriage.

777
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,830
Your Grace, try this.

778
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,140
This is the most famous snack
of Vegan Restaurant.

779
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,180
Feixian!

780
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,210
Wanyu?

781
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,260
You also entered the Palace today.

782
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,350
I came here to see my sister.

783
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,350
Why are you here?

784
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,990
I don’t know why, either.

785
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,990
There was a summon today

786
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,140
that the Empress wanted
to see me in the Palace.

787
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,220
It just took the time of a cup of tea.

788
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,430
We chatted a little bit.

789
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,510
I have something to tell you.

790
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,430
About the set

791
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,260
of Plain Kingfisher Plate

792
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,990
you asked me to find for you,

793
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,350
I heard that Ban Heng has it.

794
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,550
The Ban family again?

795
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,990
Why does the Ban family
have all the good stuff?

796
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,740
Don’t worry.

797
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,310
I have an idea.

798
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,780
Count Cheng’an once told me
some of his preferences.

799
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,430
I can tell it to you,

800
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,060
and you can trade it
with Ban Heng for the plate.

801
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,780
No.

802
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,780
Wouldn’t it let Ban Hua
take advantage of it?

803
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,030
We’re like sisters.
We can share everything.

804
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,100
Then I’ll do it.

805
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,700
I owe you this time.

806
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,620
Feixian, please go ahead.

807
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,660
I heard that Count Cheng’an
liked skating when he was young.

808
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,580
Skating?

809
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,700
Great.

810
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,950
I know how to tell Foppery Ban.

811
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,430
I’ll tell him that Count Cheng’an
likes swimming best,

812
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,620
and hates skating the most.

813
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,910
I’m afraid this is improper.

814
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,470
Why not?

815
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,620
It’s autumn now.

816
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,780
If Ban Hua really asks him
to go swimming,

817
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,950
I am worried that the water is too cold

818
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,260
and it will hurt his health.

819
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,620
Besides, there is no ice field now.

820
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,140
I think

821
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,390
the Ban family will be troubled
with finding an ice field

822
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,220
and just give up.

823
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Then they will
stop bothering Count Cheng’an.

824
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,430
Then we can have it both ways, don’t we?

825
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,870
Feixian, you are really
kind and beautiful.

826
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,780
By the way,

827
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,580
why don’t you take my carriage with me?

828
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,310
I got some rare playthings recently.

829
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,390
I can show them to you.

830
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,620
Okay.

831
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,220
Be careful.

832
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,430
You...

833
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,060
You have done all these things for days.

834
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,550
Is anyone else in your family in jail?

835
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,140
Your family is in jail!

836
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,100
I mean,

837
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,910
I need to care more about my family,

838
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,510
just like the way I care about you.

839
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,830
It’s purely out of good intentions.
There is nothing else.

840
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,830
Baroness.

841
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,030
I’m used to the plain carriage.

842
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,950
I don’t think I can enjoy

843
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,470
your thoughtful arrangement.

844
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,740
From today...

845
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,660
Right, you are right.

846
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,310
I will keep it in mind from now on.

847
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,180
I mean...

848
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,350
Okay, let’s not talk about it.
I have something else to do.

849
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,220
I’m leaving.

850
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,310
Reward him.

851
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,510
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

852
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,390
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

853
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,660
Young Master Ban, Count Cheng’an
loves cat the most.

854
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,100
Reward her.

855
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,990
My first-hand news is too good for him.

856
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,470
What if Ban Heng is
too petty to believe me?

857
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,180
What if he deliberately picks on me?

858
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,990
No way.

859
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,700
I heard you are inquiring about
Count Cheng’an’s preferences.

860
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,470
What? Did Ban Hua cause trouble again?

861
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,350
This won’t work.

862
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,700
Do you want me to die of anxiety,

863
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,180
so you can inherit my legacy?

864
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,350
It’s not like that.

865
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,180
You are sneaky today.

866
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,950
What tricks do you want to play?

867
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,700
Listen,

868
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,870
show me some respect.

869
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,030
Otherwise, I won’t tell you

870
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,430
that Count Cheng’an
loves skating the most!

871
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,470
Is Miss Xie a fool?

872
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,950
He likes skating?

873
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,550
You...!

874
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,430
Stop.

875
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,910
What else do you want?

876
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,830
I’ll buy it.

877
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,390
I bought your information.

878
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,780
Young Master, you work hard

879
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,990
but you haven’t had anything today.

880
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,100
I had a few snacks
in Baroness Ban’s carriage

881
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,260
this morning.

882
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,310
I wish Baroness Ban was here.

883
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,180
When Baroness Ban was here,

884
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,700
you would eat more than usual.

885
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,470
Your future wife

886
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,580
should be like her.

887
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Uncle Rong, you may leave.

888
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,350
I will eat it.

889
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,660
You have grown up now.
I can’t talk you into doing anything.
