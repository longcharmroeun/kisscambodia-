Rong Xia has few hobbies

112
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,800
expect that he loves skating.

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,160
He’s been keen on it for 18 years.

114

about Baroness Ban’s mischief

and lose our manner?

124

Don’t get me mad, or I…

170
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,750
You what?

171
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,270
Don’t try to scare me.
I’ll come another day.

172
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,000
I’ll leave the gift here.

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
Stop.

174
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
Baroness asked me

175
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,190
to let you deliver this to Count Rong.

176
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,800
She’s going to give a banquet
in the suburbs.

177
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,070
She wants His Grace to come.

178
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,750
Don’t be smug. I’ll deal with you later.

179
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,870
What’s the big deal?

180
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,920
That Baroness Ban

181
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,270
found such a remote place.

182
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,160
God knows what she’s up to.

183
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,630
Young Master, we’d better leave.

184
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,560
Maybe she wants to revenge

185
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,950
for what happened last night.

186
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
She can be wilful sometimes,

187
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
but she’s a decent person after all.

188
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,840
She won’t mess around.

189
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,390
Young Master, I’ll go
decline her invitation.

190
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,790
No.

191
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,630
Since I agreed to come,

192
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,360
I should keep my word.

193
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
But Young Master,

194
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,030
people in our mansion all know that
you don’t skate.

195
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,030
Even the winter ice in the yard

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,080
must be broken.

197
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,720
Why do you have to suffer from this?

198
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,600
I decided to be friendly with the Bans.

199
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,790
How can I break my promise?

200
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,080
Well…

201
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,000
Here they are.

202
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,910
He did show up.

203
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Xie Wanyu didn’t lie to me.

204
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,960
Count Rong, I didn’t think you’d come.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
With your great hospitality,

206
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,000
how can I not come?

207
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,440
Please be seated.

208
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,320
My mother told me

209
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,510
this headwear was left by your mother.

210
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,840
Thanks a lot. I love it.

211
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,870
Young Master, I just randomly picked it.

212
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,480
I didn’t expect this.

213
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,080
The scenery in the mountains is good.

214
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,440
And autumn is a good season to go out.

215
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,390
Now, the elaborate arrangements
from Baroness Ban

216
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,790
only makes here poetic.

217
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
Just like

218
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,000
those spectacular scenes
described in the poems.

219
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,790
I know little about poems,

220
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,510
but I’m good at having fun.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
Now you are here,

222
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,910
I guarantee that

223
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,670
you’ll have a lot of fun skating.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Come with me!

225
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,240
I won’t.

226
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,080
Skating is easy.

227
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,510
I’ll teach you.

228
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,440
I said I won’t.

229
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,670
Come on. Hurry.

230
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,870
No, I won’t!

231
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,960
Come on!

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,080
I won’t go without Mom and Dad.

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,150
Fine, Rong Xia.

234
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,200
Let’s go skating together.

235
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,390
Count.

236
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,080
Count Rong?

237
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,600
Baroness, skating is fun,

238
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,630
but I caught a cold recently.

239
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
It’s no big deal.

240
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,790
Your body will get warm during skating,

241
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,120
and the cold will be gone.

242
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,120
Besides,

243
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
I have a physician here
who specializes in traumatic injuries.

244
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,360
You can just have fun

245
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,240
without any concerns.

246
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,960
You seldom come out to play.

247
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,630
So, just enjoy yourself today.

248
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,120
Don’t be shy. Enjoy skating.

249
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
My sister is excellent

250
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,840
at almost everything except poetry.

251
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,440
Count,

252
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,790
don’t be shy, and enjoy yourself.

253
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,000
Come on.

254
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Young Master!

255
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
See? He’s fine.

256
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,910
Let’s sit back down.

257
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,550
Hold my hand.

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,720
Count?

259
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,030
Don’t worry.

260
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,000
This whole rink

261
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,630
was specially designed
by Ban Heng and me.

262
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,720
I can guarantee your safety.

263
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,790
See? It’s really fun.

264
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,030
Help yourself, Baroness.
I’ll keep up with you later.

265
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,320
Young Master, please don’t!

266
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,080
Don’t worry.

267
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,750
What’re you doing?

268
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,510
Don’t worry. He’ll be fine.

269
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,790
Skating backwards? Impressive.

270
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,630
He’s doing good, isn’t he?

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Come. Sit back down.

272
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,720
It seems I underestimated you.

273
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,790
I didn’t know you’re so good at it.

274
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,150
How about having a match with me?

275
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,670
I always skate alone.

276
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,200
I dare not compete with you.

277
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,240
Skating alone would be boring.

278
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,440
It’s a pity

279
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,790
that winter hasn’t come.

280
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,960
Or it would be

281
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,670
more fun to have a snowball fight
while skating.

282
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,960
I scored a point.

283
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,360
Two points, Count!

284
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,600
Catch up with me!

285
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Baroness, watch out!

286
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,000
Please forgive me, Baroness.

287
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,000
Never mind.

288
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,390
Thanks for your help.

289
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,000
Count.

290
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,440
It looks that

291
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,390
you’re not really good at skating.

292
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,790
It’s my fault

293
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,720
that I mistook you.

294
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,480
Don’t blame yourself.

295
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,360
I do like skating.

296
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,790
However, that’s when I was a kid.

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,080
I haven’t done this for long.
I’m a little rusty.

298
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,200
I see.

299
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,680
Count, you’re knowledgeable

300
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,830
but

301
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,480
when it comes to playing,

302
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,440
I’m better than you.

303
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
How about

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
letting me teach you to skate?

305
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,880
I’m afraid it’s hard for me

306
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,110
and it would take much time.

307
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,350
It’s not hard at all. I’ll teach you.

308
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,440
Then…

309
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,960
I should say thank…

310
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,480
Count Cheng’an,

311
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,790
you should watch the way
you stand on the ice.

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,920
See?

313
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,310
Get the skates into the ice
and you won’t fall.

314
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,510
Thank you, Baroness.

315
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,030
Give me your hands.

316
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,790
I’ll lead you.

317
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,720
Wait, Baroness.

318
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,790
Don’t worry. I’m here with you.

319
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,680

-It’ll be fun.
-Brother!

338
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,070
Brother, I can’t.

339
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,400
I’m scared.

340
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,310
Don’t worry. I’ll be with you.

341
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,670
Come on, give me your hands.

342
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,790
Come. Slowly.

343
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,270
You can skate, see?

344
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,110
Count.

345
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,000
You’re actually gifted.

346
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,000
Then… It’s on your own.

347
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,480
Go.

348
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,750
Believe in yourself.

349
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,640
You can do it.

350
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,960
You look even better when you smile.

351
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,160
Baroness, please don’t mind it.

352
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,920
Now we are tied.

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,590
You are a fast learner.

354
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,720
But Count Cheng’an,

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,350
you’ll have a long way to go to beat me.

356
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,590
Don’t worry about him.

357
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,440
He’s good at skating.

358
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,030
The ice is thin there.
Be careful, Count.

359
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,400
Count Xie’s daughter, Xie Wanyu,

360
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,030
is the perfect match for you.

361
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,480
The marriage invitation has been sent.

362
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,270
It’s settled then.

363
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,480
Father, I won’t marry

364
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,640
any woman in Daye

365
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,960
but Shi Feixian.

366
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,640
When is it your turn

367
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,790
to decide on the royal marriage?

368
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,790
I have the final say
in any royal marriages!

369
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,240
If I can’t marry Miss Shi,

370
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,680
I’d rather spend
the rest of my life alone!

371
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,160
Ridiculous!

372
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,720
The imperial edict has been issued.

373
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,720
No more discussion.

374
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
Since you don’t want to discuss anymore,

375
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,310
I have nothing else to say, Father.

376
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,550
Please forgive me

377
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,590
for not attending the wedding.

378
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,750
You unfilial son!

379
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,110
Guards!

380
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,480
Yes!

381
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,590
Put him under house arrest.

382
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,160
Without my decree,

383
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,720
he mustn’t go out.

384
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,400
Yes!

385
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,070
Your Majesty.

386
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,030
How could he not understand?

387
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,070
The eldest daughter of Shi Jin
has married the Crown Prince.

388
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,070
If her sister married the Second Prince,

389
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,790
the Shi family will become too powerful

390
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,110
and be a threat to me.

391
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,920
Have you heard

392
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,400
the latest news
from the imperial palace?

393
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,110
Because the Second Prince

394
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,110
didn’t agree to marry Xie Wanyu…

395
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,640
Have a taste.

396
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,920
…His Majesty gave him a slap.

397
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,550
Really?

398
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Don’t tell anyone about it.

399
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I won’t.

400
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,750
I promise with my cabbage.

401
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,680
I won’t tell anyone.

402
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,270
Okay.

403
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,750
Have you heard that

404
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,790
His Majesty wanted the Second Prince
to marry Xie Wanyu,

405
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,590
but the two of them got into a fight?

406
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,350
Really?

407
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,240
Don’t tell anyone about it.

408
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,880
If you do that,
you may be sentenced to death.

409
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,790
Rest assured. I promise with my tofu.

410
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,880
I won’t tell anyone.

411
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,030
Big news!

412
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,480
The Second Prince hit His Majesty
just because he didn’t want to

413
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,350
marry Xie Wanyu.

414
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,200
Are you serious?

415
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,960
Don’t tell anyone about…

416
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,590
Oh my goodness, there’s a revolt!

417
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,480
The Second Prince refused to
marry Xie Wanyu

418
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,830
and knocked His Majesty unconscious!

419
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,830
Who told you that?

420
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,720
It’s her!

421
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,790
It’s her!

422
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,830
No! It’s her!

423
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,270
-Who on earth is it?
-It’s her!

424
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,790
How could you say that out?

425
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,680
That’s about His Majesty!

426
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,510
Don’t go!

427
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,350
It’s her!

428
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,400
Young Master!

429
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,960
Bodhisattva, please bless that
Young Master is safe.

430
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,480
Du Jiu,

431
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,030
I heard that if a drowned person

432
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,480
falls into a coma,

433
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,550
oxygen will be needed to save him.

434
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,240
Thank you, Bodhisattva,

435
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,790
for bringing Young Master back to life.

436
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,400
Don’t thank Bodhisattva.

437
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,590
The one who saved him is her.

438
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,200
If it wasn’t for her,

439
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,720
Young Master wouldn’t even
be in the water.

440
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,240
Thank…

441
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,790
Thank you for saving me, Baroness.

442
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,830
As long as you’re fine.

443
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,270
Young Master.

444
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,400
I’m okay.

445
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,590
Du Jiu.

446
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,680
Young Master.

447
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,640
Bring my…

448
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,070
my overcoat.

449
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,720
Okay.

450
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,030
Young Master.

451
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,000
Young Master?

452
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Count Cheng’an, you should put it on.

453
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,720
I can’t repay you for saving me…

454
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,830
But I can stop you from catching a cold.

455
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
Thank you then, Count.

456
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,440
This bookworm

457
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,440
is not as boring as I thought.

458
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,400
What?

459
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,920
How come?

460
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,960
Miss,

461
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,750
though Count Cheng’an
isn’t good at skating,

462
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,310
under Baroness Ban’s patient guidance,

463
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,030
the two of them had a really good time

464
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,070
on the ice.

465
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,550
I see. You may leave.

466
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,030
Yes.

467
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,160
It’s so hot!

468
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,400
Hold it, dear.

469
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
Once the chill is pushed out
of your body,

470
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
you’ll be all right.

471
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,350
Yeah, that’s right.

472
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,590
Why are you all staring at me?

473
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,070
How is it

474
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,590
going

475
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,110
between Count Cheng’an and you?

476
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,790
What’re you talking about?

477
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,070
According to my plan,

478
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,720
you’re his savior right now.

479
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,640
And according to the script,

480
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,000
he’s going to marry you to repay you.

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,440
Was the accident set by you?

482
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,030
What if he died?

483
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,680
Wait a minute.

484
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,510
I only set the skating activity.

485
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,240
The accident has nothing to do with me.

486
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
Don’t blame me.

487
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
After all,

488
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,200
you saved his life.

489
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,880
He owes you now.

490
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,920
Young Master, please dry yourself.

491
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,960
Or you might catch a cold.

492
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,440
I’m okay.

493
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,750
His Majesty has arranged

494
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,790
the marriage between the Second Prince
and Miss Xie.

495
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,240
Have you got

496
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,110
any clues to my mother’s bracelet?

497
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,200
Everything’s ready.

498
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,270
When the time is right,
we’ll sneak into Xie’s Mansion.

499
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,960
Do it early.

500
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,550
Young Master.

501
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,590
What’s the number, Young Master?

502
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,960
Young Master? Young Master.

503
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,720
Look here.

504
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Why have I never seen

505
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,590
this assistant before?

506
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,030
You have a good eye, Young Master.

507
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,960
This guy

508
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,030
was entrusted to me by
my senior in the east of the city.

509
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,440
He’s new in the business.

510
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,880
I have a lot to teach him.

511
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,240
Why do you cover your face?

512
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,720
For fear of infection.

513
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,000
I’m blind,

514
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,270
but I didn’t catch a plague!

515
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,790
Please calm down.

516
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
I caught a cold,

517
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,200
and I fear you might get infected.

518
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,480
Physician.

519
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,160
Tell me,

520
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,070
is there any hope for my recovery?

521
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,110
Forget it. You don’t need to answer me.

522
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,830
Don’t be sad.

523
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,350
Look on the bright side.

524
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,790
For example,

525
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,510
if you go hunting,

526
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,680
you’ll be better than others for sure.

527
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,030
You don’t even need to
close your left eye.

528
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,350
How handy that is!

529
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,030
What are you laughing about?

530
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

531
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,400
Please don’t be angry, Young Master.

532
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,720
He’s just young and garrulous.

533
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,110
He didn’t mean it.

534
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,920
Please forgive him.

535
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,350
Hurry! Apologize! Apologize!

536
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,110
I’m sorry.

537
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,960
Get lost!

538
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,720
Yes, I will.

539
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,440
-I will get lost.
-Go. Just go.

540
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,070
I’m so pissed off.

541
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,830
Please don’t be. Please don’t be.

542
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,720
Young Master.

543
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,830
What’s going on outside?

544
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,750
People from the Ban family are here.

545
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Baroness Ban is here?

546
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,960
Don’t let her in.

547
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,680
Why?

548
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,680
Baroness Ban is here to see you.

549
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,550
No.

550
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,640
Uncle Rong,

551
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,790
if she asks the reason,

552
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,480
just tell her that I’m sick

553
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,680
and it’s not convenient to see her.

554
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,240
You don’t want to see her, Young Master?

555
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,000
Not that.

556
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,720
So, you want to see her.

557
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,070
Uncle Rong.

558
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,750
I can’t see her.

559
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,350
Can’t see her?

560
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,160
He wants to see her but can’t see her.

561
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,270
What’s wrong with him?

562
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,680
I knew this pair of stone lions
would look perfect.

563
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,500
<i>Rong’s Mansion</i>

564
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,720
I named them “Zhen Jing”,

565
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,960
which means to suppress fright.

566
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,200
I want to suppress the fright
for Count Cheng’an.

567
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,660
Thank…

568
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,240
Don’t thank me.

569
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,920
They should be here in the first place.

570
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,440
But… where’s he?

571
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,310
He caught a cold
and is inconvenient to see visitors.

572
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,750
Caught a cold?

573
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,400
My elder sister is fine.

574
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,640
How come he caught a cold?

575
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,750
He really has poor health.

576
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,400
Alright then,

577
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,750
let’s go shopping.

578
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,310
Goodbye, Baroness.

579
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,240
Hua, Count Cheng’an has caught a cold.

580
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,960
Why didn’t you visit him
and show your concern?

581
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,750
I wouldn’t like to see him

582
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,240
in a bad condition.

583
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,680
Or that

584
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,550
would influence his good image
in my mind.

585
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,440
I can visit him when he gets better.

586
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,000
That makes sense.

587
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,160
And I don’t want to get infected.

588
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,640
By the way,

589
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
arrange more people

590
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,030
beside Count Cheng’an.

591
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,270
When he gets better, let me be informed.

592
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,200
You can do it yourself.

593
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,440
My time should be spent

594
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,640
on my beauty.

595
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,240
Get out!

596
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
<i>Mingyue Inn</i>
Don’t be so rude!

597
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,880
<i>Mingyue Inn</i>
Get out! Get out!

598
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,160
How dare you offend other customers!

599
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,000
Get lost!

600
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,350
There’s a misunderstanding.

601
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,310
It’s those customers who talked bad

602
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,510
behind others

603
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,240
and insulted the reputation
of Baroness Ban.

604
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,110
I just reasoned with them.
I did nothing wrong.

605
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,640
That’s right.

606
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,350
Everyone in the capital

607
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,110
knows that Ban Hua
was rejected from marriage.

608
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Who would listen to your argument,
you poor scholar?

609
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,440
I… I…

610
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,830
A poor scholar like you wants to
take the imperial examination?

611
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,960
Who do you think you are?

612
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,550
What’s wrong with being poor?

613
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,720
Don’t look down upon me!

614
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,180
<i>Shen Yu, Scholar of Humble Birth</i>
I, Shen Yu,

615
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,830
<i>Shen Yu, Scholar of Humble Birth</i>
will make achievements one day!

616
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,680
Yes!

617
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,590
Throw them away!

618
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,920
No, no, no.

619
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,640
No, no, no.

620
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,880
Don’t throw them!

621
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,640
You’ve gone too far!

622
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,070
Get lost now!

623
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,680
How could you do this?

624
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,590
How could you throw away my books?

625
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,440
The books are dirty now.

626
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,200
May I ask what happened to you?

627
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,580
<i>Mingyue Inn</i>

628
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,750
<i>Mingyue Inn</i>
Thanks for your concern, Miss.

629
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,720
It’s just that I pissed off
their customers

630
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,280
and got driven out.

631
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,710
You look frail,
but you have a bad temper.

632
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,280
You didn’t hear

633
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,400
what they were talking about.

634
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,800
They not only mocked up
the Second Prince

635
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
for rejecting the marriage
with Xie Wanyu,

636
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,710
but also insulted Baroness Ban

637
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,280
for being rejected because of

638
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,440
being a jinx.

639
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,670
Those words were terribly bad.

640
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
As an educated man,

641
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,920
how could I stand that?

642
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,190
I had to reason with them.

643
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,070
That means

644
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,760
you were trying to help Xie Wanyu

645
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,150
and Baroness Ban?

646
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,070
Of course.

647
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,230
But my strength is limited.

648
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,800
I’d better give up.

649
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,880
Is that so?

650
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,440
Follow me.

651
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,020
<i>Mingyue Inn</i>

652
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,630
Hey, come on in.

653
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,760
Today, you’ve met a savior.

654
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,190
That person can save you
from being poor.

655
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,360
Who is she?

656
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,920
What’re you doing?

657
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,480
Don’t go in!

658
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,320
Let’s go inside to take a look.

659
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,400
You were talking bad behind my back?

660
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,110
We were just being drunk.

661
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,960
We wouldn’t dare to do that.

662
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,030
She’s Baroness Ban?

663
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,840
Let me ask you.

664
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,800
If no one marries me, I will be doomed?

665
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,760
No, no, no.

666
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,800
We just got drunk and lost our minds.

667
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,630
Baroness, don’t take that seriously.

668
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,110
Yeah, we just got drunk.

669
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,960
That’s right.

670
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,800
Must a woman marry a man

671
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,670
in order to survive?

672
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,230
I hate bullying people the most.

673
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,590
How can you bully someone
just because he’s poor?

674
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,510
In order to make more money,

675
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,320
you help the rich to bully the poor.

676
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,030
I mean, sir,

677
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,230
don’t you fear that they may revenge

678
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,480
when they become rich?

679
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,550
Apologize to him.

680
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,880
You’re right, Baroness.

681
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,110
It’s all my fault.

682
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,800
I apologize to you, Sir.

683
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,880
I, Shen Yu, am diligent and honest.

684
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,630
Thanks to the help from Baroness.

685
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,760
I accept your apology.

686
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,960
Nice to meet you, Baroness.

687
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,590
You are really a courageous
and righteous person.

688
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,360
Just like a beautiful and clean jade.

689
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,920
He is

690
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,440
not as good-looking as Count Cheng’an.

691
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,030
But he talks sweet,

692
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,510
even sweeter than that guy.

693
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,670
From now on,

694
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,840
this place is only available
for poor scholars.

695
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,320
All of their expenses

696
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,360
before the imperial examinations

697
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,760
will be covered by the Ban family.

698
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,800
Covered by the Ban family?

699
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,480
How generous!

700
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,760
Okay. No problem.

701
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,440
As for other customers,
please find other places.

702
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,150
Let’s go. Hurry.

703
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,550
Come one. Let’s go.

704
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,150
Well…

705
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,760
Baroness, you don’t have to do this.

706
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,150
We are satisfied enough

707
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,510
to just have a place to stay.

708
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,440
People can be short of money,

709
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,230
but not the aspirations.

710
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
It’s OK to be looked down upon,

711
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,920
but you can’t look down upon yourself.

712
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,960
Goodbye, Baroness.

713
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,580
<i>Mingyue Inn</i>

714
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,440
Baroness

715
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,550
is not that arrogant and willful
like they say.

716
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,480
She’s really merciful.

717
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,920
Forget about her.

718
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,440
She’s far out of your league.

719
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,150
Someday, I’ll impress you.

720
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,320
Young Master.

721
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,360
Young Master?

722
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,440
Why are there a pair of stone lions?

723
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,480
They look familiar.

724
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,920
How is the investigation going?

725
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,840
I’ve checked the library
in Xie’s Mansion thoroughly,

726
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,230
but I didn’t find that bracelet.

727
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,320
Seems that someone is misleading us
on purpose.

728
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,880
Back then,

729
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,360
the Xie family must’ve been involved.

730
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,480
But Count Xie doesn’t seem that wise.

731
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,230
I’m afraid there’s someone else
behind this.

732
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,480
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
Hua is really wise to open an academy.

733
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,760
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>

734
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,840
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
If the scholars here

735
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,150
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
make achievements in the future,

736
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,480
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
it would also be beneficial

737
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
to our family.

738
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,070
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
That’s right.

739
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,880
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
You got the point.

740
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,150
-And that would be an honor for us.
-Can this be called an academy?

741
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,800
As long as there are books here.

742
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,280
Only the places with teachers there

743
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
can be called an academy.

744
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,960
Whatever. Get in.

745
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,030
-Hello, Young Master.
-Hello, Young Master.

746
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
Hello, Baroness.

747
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,590
Baroness Ban really opened an academy.

748
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,960
She’s really rich and generous.

749
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,510
And you can see her good taste
by looking at the details.

750
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,000
Look at that!

751
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,320
-Young Master.
-Hello, Young Master.

752
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,760
Hello, Young Master.

753
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,960
Baroness.

754
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,800
I haven’t seen you for days.

755
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,030
Today, I specially came here to…

756
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,110
To see this place? No problem.

757
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,230
Just look around.

758
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,550
And you can take anything you like.

759
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,920
Okay.

760
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,590
Baroness,

761
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,030
in fact, I specially came here to

762
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,150
show my admiration to you. I…

763
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,030
Thank you, Marquis.

764
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,110
Don’t mention it.

765
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,070
Good to have you here.

766
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,150
Thank you, Marquis.

767
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,070
We’ve learned a lot here.

768
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,880
You’re welcome.

769
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,320
We’ve learned a lot here.

770
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,070
Good to have you here. Thank you.

771
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,960
Goodbye.

772
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,800
Okay, okay.

773
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,230
Thank you, Marquis.

774
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,070
It’s my pleasure.

775
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,590
I shall leave.

776
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,280
Thank you, Young Master.

777
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,800
-Thank you, Young Master.
-Be careful on the way.

778
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,480
Thank you, Marquis.

779
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,030
They all left.

780
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,190
Why are you still here?

781
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,480
I, Shen Yu,

782
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,030
want to marry Baroness Ban.

783
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,760
What?

784
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,360
What…?

785
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,880
Well…

786
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,940
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>

787
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,280
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
Young Master, I’m really sincere.

788
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,630
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
Give me a chance.

789
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
Marry my sister?

790
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,110
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
In your dreams.

791
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,230
Go find another girl.

792
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,150
Don’t ever set foot
in our mansion again.

793
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,670
Insane.

794
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,580
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>

795
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,340
<i>Ban’s Academy</i>
Marquis! Madam!

796
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,440
Marquis! Madam!

797
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,190
I really love Baroness Ban!

798
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,670
Give me a chance!

799
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,550
Totally insane.

800
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,360
I…!

801
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,800
Education is vital
to the stability of a country.

802
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,590
Marquis Jingting, you’re being generous
to help the poor scholars out.

803
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,320
You’re really

804
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,000
making great contributions
to the whole country.

805
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,110
I feel flattered, Your Majesty.

806
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,230
I didn’t spend much money.
So, I’m not that generous.

807
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,190
After all,

808
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,320
your deed is good for
both the country and the people.

809
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,630
Your Majesty, in fact,

810
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,550
this whole idea is from Hua.

811
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,440
That makes me more impressed.

812
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,440
Please don’t say that, Your Majesty.

813
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,440
However…

814
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,550
What?

815
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,000
Any problems?

816
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,800
Your Majesty.

817
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,920
There’s a stupid scholar

818
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,670
being infatuated with my daughter.

819
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,400
He stays at the entrance of my mansion,

820
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,800
and every time he sees her,
he would ask her to marry him.

821
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,590
Every morning,

822
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,110
when the day just begins in a mist,

823
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,030
I open the gate and come out…

824
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,920
Marquis!

825
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,400
There would be a shadow
standing in the mist.

826
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,150
Marquis!

827
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,280
Marquis!

828
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,880
Get away!

829
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,550
My love for Hua is witnessed
by the sun and the moon!

830
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,280
Get away!

831
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,440
Marquis!

832
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,070
The sun and the moon…!

833
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,800
-Get away!
-Marquis!

834
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,840
I’m really scared of him.

835
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,030
How ridiculous.

836
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,510
Yeah.

837
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,480
Your Majesty.

838
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,150
That’s why I can’t eat

839
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,030
or sleep well lately.

840
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,480
Look, even my belly got smaller.

841
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,190
Count Cheng’an asks to see Your Majesty.

842
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,190
Grant.

843
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,670
Your Majesty.

844
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,000
You came at the right time.

845
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,550
Have you heard of
what happened to Baroness Ban?

846
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,800
Yes, kind of.

847
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,190
Baroness Ban was born in a rich family

848
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,440
yet she can understand the bitterness
of the poor scholars

849
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,190
and have faith in their future.

850
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,480
I admire her for that.

851
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,630
And I can understand the guy
who’s infatuated with her.

852
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,840
But as for the way out,

853
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,440
I’m afraid only Baroness Ban
can figure out.

854
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,510
Isn’t he sick?

855
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,800
But he doesn’t look like that.

856
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,030
Count Cheng’an is right.

857
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,110
The love affair

858
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,110
is out of my power.

859
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,960
Let her figure it out by herself.

860
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,760
Ban Huai.

861
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

862
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,920
I shouldn’t have brought this up.

863
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,760
What? He’s not sick?

864
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,070
I was talking with His Majesty.

865
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,880
Then he came in.

866
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,280
He doesn’t seem sick at all.

867
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,070
Count Cheng’an, how dare you

868
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,320
trick me!

869
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,510
That bookworm wants to

870
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,670
suffer more from me?

871
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,840
Ban Hua, there’s one waiting outside.

872
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,110
He’s still there?

873
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,030
How about giving him a chance?

874
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,840
He wants to force you to marry him.
That’s ridiculous!

875
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,960
Drive him away!

876
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,920
Hold it.

877
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,230
Easy, dear. Let him wait.

878
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,320
Let’s see how many days
he can wait there.

879
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,880
My beauty is to blame.
