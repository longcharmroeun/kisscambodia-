<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 10</i>

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,830
Grandmother,

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,510
why did you keep your condition secret?

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,480
Those senior officials

39
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,350
wouldn’t dare touch the Bans

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,280
as long as I’m around.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,880
But once they found out I’m sick,

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,630
they’d sure come at us.

43
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,200
Understand?

44
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,390
I’m confused about one thing.

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,830
You had helped Physician Zhang a lot.

46
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,790
Why did he try to poison you?

47
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,040
He’s timid by nature,

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,910
and must’ve acted under coercion.

49
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,630
That’s not an excuse.

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,630
Hadn’t it been for Count Cheng’an,

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,440
there would’ve been dire consequences.

52
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Hua,

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,320
that man is secretive.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,630
You must watch out for him.

55
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,110
Are you warning me

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,160
against someone who helped us?

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,630
Gentlemen put principles
before themselves,

58
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,510
while the snobs are the opposite.

59
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,000
Physician Zhang meant
to protect himself,

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,600
but Count Cheng’an

61
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,040
is a mystery even to me.

62
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,830
Grandmother, you’re worrying too much.

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,110
I can’t read his mind, either,

64
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,670
but I’m sure

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,910
he won’t harm us.

66
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,950
If one day,

67
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,510
he dares to do that,

68
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,280
I would

69
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,040
beat him to a pulp.

70
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,910
When can you act like a lady?

71
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,070
Madam.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,760
Princess.

73
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,600
Grandmother said
Physician Zhang was under threat,

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
but by whom?

75
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,200
Who would dare touch our people?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,710
Prince Luo did it?

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,070
All that about
the Tiger Tally is a secret.

78
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,630
Few have access to it

79
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,070
other than His Majesty
and some senior officials.

80
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,030
Clearly, he was
plotting against Crown Prince.

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,440
The rest of us

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,560
were only his pawns.

83
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,390
Now that Her Highness is safe,

84
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,000
the mastermind

85
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,800
will pay the price eventually.

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,200
Don’t bother yourself with it.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Grandmother’s safety is at risk.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
I must get to the bottom of it.

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,510
Your Grace, Your Grace,

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
I’ve tracked Physician Zhang down.

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,920
He’s hiding outside the city. Let’s go.

92
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,800
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,760
Who is it?

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
It’s me, Princess.

95
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
I was about to bring Her Highness

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,630
freshly made desserts.

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
This is it, Your Grace.

98
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,070
The open door

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,240
must be a sham.

100
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,590
I won’t take it.

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,950
Let’s go.

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Count Cheng’an!

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,830
What are you doing here?

104
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,950
I said I’d find out the truth for you.

105
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,830
Thank you.

106
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,560
Who’s the culprit?

107
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,680
Don’t know yet.

108
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,030
Someone is there.

109
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,320
I’ll take the back door.

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,950
You take the back door.

111
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,360
Come.

112
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,000
Clear.

113
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,440
He’s gone.
You must seize him, Your Grace.

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,470
Relax.

115
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,590
Count Cheng’an

116
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,240
is waiting to catch him in the back.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,510
We got company.

118
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,880
Go help Count Cheng’an.

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,920
I got this.

120
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
We cannot lose that physician again.

121
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,030
Bring it on.

122
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,200
Spare me, please!

123
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,680
Go, Young Master!

124
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,630
Let’s go!

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,440
I didn’t expect you’d save me, Count.

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,440
Physician Zhang,

127
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,630
why did Prince Luo
want Princess Royal dead?

128
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,710
What’s he up to?

129
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,120
Here’s the thing.

130
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,880
That day, I overheard him saying...

131
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,030
Silencing a witness!

132
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,470
Good to see you again, Count Cheng’an.

133
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,710
Have you

134
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,390
considered my offer?

135
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,880
I never work with people

136
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,880
I don’t know.

137
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,470
You’re the wisest man in the country.

138
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,520
I gave you that letter

139
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,200
for a reason.

140
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,560
I hope

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
you can enlighten me.

142
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,230
No one dares to

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,750
reopen the case of the Rongs’ deaths.

144
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,830
Prince Luo is your only hope

145
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,560
to get justice.

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,950
Don’t you agree?

147
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
He appreciates men of talent.

148
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,470
A fine fowl like you
should perch on a fine tree.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,920
He...

150
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,440
He...

151
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,990
Who killed him?

152
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,280
Physician Zhang,

153
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,640
Luo...

154
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,640
Luo...

155
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,870
Prince Luo, Jiang Luo!

156
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,110
He did it.

157
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Don’t jump to conclusions.

158
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,750
I should’ve known that

159
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,640
only he would’ve gone so low.

160
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,990
Bastard!

161
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,920
How dare he!

162
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,280
Princess.

163
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,200
Thanks for your help. Good day.

164
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,870
Hua,

165
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,950
who told you

166
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,200
Prince Luo tried to
harm your grandmother?

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,200
He’s going to meet his doom

168
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,160
by hurting her.

169
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,520
Calm down.

170
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,400
He’s too dumb

171
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,830
to cause too much damage.

172
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,280
Because of him, Grandmother almost...

173
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,950
Anyway, he’s a pest.

174
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,110
Hua has a point.

175
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,160
Did you... Dream about something else?

176
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,230
No.

177
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,350
Think about it.

178
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,640
What he said and did

179
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,320
at the banquet

180
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
showed he was ill-intentioned.

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,230
Things happened lately

182
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,110
can’t all be coincidences.

183
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,750
You’re paranoid.

184
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,070
Everything is fine, isn’t it?

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,070
What do you know?

186
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,040
Without Count Cheng’an,

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,470
we’d be in grave danger.

188
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,110
You’d better

189
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,750
prepare gifts

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,800
to thank him.

191
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Heng is right.

192
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,590
That’s our top priority.

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Bad news, Young Master!

194
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,110
How many times

195
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,070
have I told you

196
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,160
to stay calm at all...

197
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,440
times?

198
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,470
May I ask...

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,800
I’m here to see Huahua.

200
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,470
That’s too kind of you

201
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,750
to come with so many gifts.

202
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,560
I like the cat.

203
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,230
They’re all for Huahua.

204
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,070
Ban Heng.

205
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,710
Coming.

206
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,350
Let’s go. Come.

207
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,470
Hurry!

208
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,470
Huahua,

209
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,350
it must be tough

210
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,870
living with

211
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,520
such a quiet handler.

212
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
You think so, too?

213
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,590
She’s even making a move on a cat.

214
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
My sister came for you.

215
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,920
Stop pretending.

216
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,800
My cat seems to like you.

217
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,070
Generally speaking,

218
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,400
both humans and cats

219
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,680
find me likable.

220
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,200
Those

221
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,400
who’re dull,

222
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,640
seemingly aloof

223
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,560
and scheming

224
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,470
are the only exceptions.

225
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,750
Count Cheng’an,

226
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
which category are you in?

227
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,830
I always appreciate

228
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,470
an honest free spirit like you.

229
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,470
So do you like me or not?

230
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,710
You’re making me confused.

231
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,640
You’re such a straight shooter.

232
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,400
Let’s go.

233
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,750
For good judges of character,

234
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,520
it’s impossible to not like you.

235
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,680
Don’t sweet-talk me.

236
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,750
Someday, I’ll crack you.

237
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,280
Eat up.

238
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,230
Don’t be

239
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,830
like those bony nerds.

240
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,350
What’s wrong with them?

241
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,750
They’re quiet and considerate

242
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,040
without showing others their claws.

243
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,160
So much better

244
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,520
than a violent-tempered

245
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,320
and untamed kitty, isn’t it?

246
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,830
So what if it’s loud

247
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,040
and has a temper?

248
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,710
Must everyone

249
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,400
be a mute fox?

250
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,950
A nerd

251
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,200
or a mute fox,

252
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,560
you should know what Huahua thinks

253
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,870
even if he doesn’t tell you, right?

254
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,280
How could I? I’m not a mind-reader!

255
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
I’m not a cat.

256
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,350
It can’t be me, either.

257
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,160
Ban Heng! Ban Heng!

258
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,070
Ban Heng! Ban...

259
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,750
Here.

260
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,160
There’s a crowd outside your mansion.

261
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,640
What are they doing there?

262
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,350
To propose marriage to your sister.

263
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,040
This is

264
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,800
the Yans’ family heirloom for 100 years.

265
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,440
It’s too generous of them

266
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,680
to offer this simply for proposal.

267
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,870
Mrs. Yan loves his son dearly.

268
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,160
I’ve long heard

269
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,070
about that.

270
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,350
The bracelet is to welcome Princess

271
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,750
into Prime Minister’s family.

272
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,830
It’s good.

273
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,950
Their son isn’t too bad.

274
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,320
But his mother is a problem.

275
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,470
Rocky, give it back.

276
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,470
Show her out.

277
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,470
Please.

278
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,800
Count, why are you out with me?

279
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,920
I don’t

280
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,750
want you to feel bored.

281
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Would you like to hear a story?

282
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,110
Go ahead. I’m listening.

283
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,160
Once upon a time,

284
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,950
a bird fairy nested in the mountain,

285
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,350
while a bird hunter

286
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,750
lived at the foot.

287
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,070
He...

288
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,520
That bird fell in love with him

289
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,440
but got caught eventually.

290
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,160
That’s cliché.

291
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,520
Why don’t you tell me

292
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
about your story?

293
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,470
My story?

294
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,680
You’re the most renowned gentleman.

295
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,870
Have you had any crush on girls?

296
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,750
Never.

297
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,230
Bonehead!

298
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,640
Count Cheng’an,

299
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,640
if you must marry someone

300
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,750
among Shi Feixian,
Xie Wanyu and Li Xiaoru,

301
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,560
which one will you choose?

302
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,800
Young Master Ban,

303
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,830
girls’ marriage

304
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,040
isn’t something to joke about.

305
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,590
And what you asked

306
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,990
would only annoy Princess.

307
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Choose.

308
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,870
Well,

309
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Miss Xie is tender and caring

310
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,830
and she’ll be a good wife and mother.

311
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,040
Miss Li is elegant and graceful

312
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,680
who owns tons of suitors.

313
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,230
As for Miss Shi,

314
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,560
other than being virtuous,

315
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,990
she’s more talented than others.

316
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,110
But marriage

317
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,590
calls for mutual love.

318
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,520
It can’t be forced.

319
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,870
I thought you had better taste.

320
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,520
I’ve decided to
go on a date with Yan Zhen.

321
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,320
Princess,

322
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,200
wouldn’t you only meet with him?

323
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
Change of plan.

324
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,110
I can’t wait

325
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,400
to experience mutual love.

326
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,400
Marriage is no small matter.

327
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,640
You’d better think carefully.

328
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,320
Aren’t you fond of those three?

329
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,200
Why do you care about my marriage?

330
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,750
I didn’t mean I like them.

331
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,320
I just...

332
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,070
Calm down.

333
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,870
My sister would never be with Yan Zhen.

334
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
He has a reputation.

335
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,590
Everyone knows it.

336
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,320
If you marry him...

337
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,990
Darling.

338
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,350
Do you like this scent?

339
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,880
What’s that?

340
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,750
My mother said

341
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,920
it’d bring us good fortune.

342
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,640
Alright.

343
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,950
And the dates, too.

344
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,230
My mother said that’d be perfect.

345
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,400
Are you going to bed or not?

346
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Stop, stop, stop!

347
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,750
My mother said
to stop making babies

348
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,120
once the incense burns out.

349
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,230
Or it’d be bad for my health.

350
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,030
Can’t you burn another one?

351
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,990
Mother.

352
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,680
May I burn another one?

353
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,309
<i>Madam Yan</i>

354
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,080
Time is over for today.

355
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,750
Try again tomorrow.

356
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,750
He’s fussy

357
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,920
other than being a mama’s boy.

358
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,230
You can’t stand him.

359
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,200
So

360
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,920
whoever marries him will suffer.

361
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,230
My mother said it doesn’t suit you.

362
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,270
Not that one, either, she said.

363
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,270
What should I wear?

364
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,120
She said

365
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,990
a lady must dress properly.

366
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,360
I look just like your mother!

367
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,470
No, no, no!

368
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,840
Please divorce me.

369
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,270
Mother, my wife is asking for a divorce.

370
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,200
Divorce?

371
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,270
I won’t allow it!

372
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,710
Is he really like that?

373
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,790
You don’t believe me?

374
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,920
Ask him.

375
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,510
Leave now.

376
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,790
Get out. Out.

377
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,680
I’ve made it clear

378
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,440
and rejected this marriage.

379
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,550
Marrying Prime Minister’s son

380
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,600
is sheer bliss.

381
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,710
You should be honored and grateful.

382
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,230
How could you turn it down?

383
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,750
Excuse me?

384
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Watch your tone.

385
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,840
Is that a proposal or a threat?

386
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,640
I’m sorry.

387
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,120
Please forgive me, Princess.

388
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,640
This is a gift

389
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,160
from Mrs. Yan.

390
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,920
Please take it.

391
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,750
What should I do about it?

392
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,120
Tell the exact words to Yan Zhen

393
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,600
that I, Ban Hua,

394
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,440
will only marry someone I love

395
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,310
who also loves me back.

396
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,400
Princess...

397
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,900
<i>Memorial to the Throne</i>

398
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,540
<i>The plot enraged His Majesty.
The Rongs will be gone by tomorrow.</i>

399
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,500
<i>The plot enraged His Majesty.
The Rongs will be gone by tomorrow.</i>

400
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Is that

401
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,640
Prime Minister’s handwriting?

402
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,230
Young Master Xie,

403
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,710
how can you prove Minister Yan wrote it?

404
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,510
You have easy access

405
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,400
to Yan Hui’s handwriting.

406
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,230
Compare them yourself.

407
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,300
They’re identical.

408
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,080
<i>The Rongs will be gone by tomorrow.</i>
They’re identical.

409
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,440
It’s been so long.

410
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,360
A letter alone isn’t...

411
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,380
<i>Memorial to the Throne Yan</i>

412
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,990
<i>Yan</i>
Yan?

413
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,620
<i>Yan</i>

414
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,270
Yan Hui?

415
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,710
Princess Ban has arrived.

416
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,030
Why is she here?

417
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,790
Is what she’s wearing

418
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,360
a hairpin

419
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,750
or some headwear?

420
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,920
Don’t know.

421
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,120
It looks cute, though.

422
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,030
Have some tea, Princess.

423
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,680
No, thanks.

424
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,840
Welcome, Princess.

425
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,880
Feel free

426
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,230
to enjoy all the food and drinks here.

427
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,880
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

428
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,550
Count, care to drink with me?

429
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,230
Thanks for asking,

430
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,470
but I’d rather
not embarrass myself again.

431
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,840
I prefer seeing you drunk.

432
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,680
You mean to

433
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,310
give me a hard time, don’t you?

434
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,470
Will you drink or not?

435
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,550
Crown Prince and Princess have arrived.

436
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,030
Greetings.

437
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
I hope I didn’t interrupt you.

438
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,270
Crown Prince, Sister.

439
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,600
I didn’t expect you’d come home.

440
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,710
Crown Prince knew I was homesick,

441
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,230
and asked Father

442
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,710
to come back with me especially.

443
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,510
It’s all set. Don’t worry.

444
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,400
Sister.

445
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,120
Count Cheng’an, would you join me

446
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,270
for tea?

447
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,880
Tea? Sure.

448
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,880
What you got, cousin?

449
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,080
I...

450
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,310
My brother would like
to have a word with you.

451
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,600
Mr. Shi?

452
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,710
What’s up?

453
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,230
I...

454
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,440
We can have tea together

455
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,950
after you finish.

456
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,550
Prin... Princess,

457
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,750
I can give you a tour around here.

458
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
But I’m not interested.

459
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,880
Take my brother instead.

460
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
He hasn’t been here before.

461
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,270
I...

462
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,950
It’s my pleasure

463
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,470
to have finally met you, Princess.

464
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,120
I’m Yan Zhen.

465
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,990
It’s you!

466
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,360
So...

467
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,400
would you like a tour
around the house?

468
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,440
Count Cheng’an,
you’re old enough to marry.

469
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,510
Don’t wait too long.

470
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,950
Thank you for your concern.

471
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,310
I’ve devoted myself to His Majesty

472
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,230
with no time for a relationship.

473
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,470
Rong Xia, we studied together for long.

474
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,600
I know you the best.

475
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,600
If you ask me,

476
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,680
your perfect match

477
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,470
is right here.

478
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,840
What’s here?

479
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
Hua, you...

480
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,270
Why are you having tea without me?

481
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,440
I’m sorry.

482
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,510
My bad.

483
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,510
Something is going on behind my back.

484
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,120
Go on.

485
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,310
Continue with what you were doing.

486
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,360
I’ll sip at my tea.

487
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,510
Pretend I’m not here.

488
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,360
Alright. The more the merrier.

489
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,200
Please, Crown Prince.

490
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,710
Sure.

491
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,400
Count Cheng’an

492
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,200
is erudite and pure

493
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,880
as the melted snow water

494
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,270
from Snow Mountain.

495
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,750
He sounds unnatural.

496
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,400
What are the odds!

497
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,270
My sister is also into literature.

498
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,640
She’s unworldly

499
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,360
as the newly sprouted leaves.

500
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,440
Really?

501
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,120
Not that I know of.

502
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,360
Count, look, the tea leaves

503
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,680
endured changes of seasons

504
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,790
while the water flowed through
ranges of mountains

505
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,270
to have finally gathered here.

506
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,270
That’s sheer serendipity, isn’t it?

507
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,310
What’s going on?

508
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,920
I can’t agree more.

509
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,990
Fate has brought us together.

510
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,790
Count Cheng’an,

511
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,470
stop pretending.

512
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
I know my sister

513
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,230
better than others.

514
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Sister.

515
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,990
Feixian,

516
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,510
why don’t you tell him how you feel?

517
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,840
Your Highness, you must be joking.

518
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,120
Miss Shi is still single.

519
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,400
Her reputation shouldn’t be damaged.

520
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,080
Do you mean

521
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,550
my sister isn’t good enough for you?

522
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,160
Miss Shi is virtuous

523
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
and more talented than others.

524
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,680
I...

525
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,550
Why do I

526
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,990
find that familiar?

527
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,160
As for Miss Shi,
other than being virtuous,

528
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,510
she’s more talented than others.

529
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,950
So you’re setting them up, aren’t you?

530
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,550
Why go to such great lengths?

531
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,710
I can save you the trouble, cousin.

532
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,880
Princess,

533
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,680
don’t be rude.

534
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,120
Shi Feixian, tell me,

535
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
will you marry Count Cheng’an?

536
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,400
I...

537
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,230
A knot is waiting to be tied.

538
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,750
Stop there.

539
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,200
Don’t understand a word.

540
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,270
Count Cheng’an,

541
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,270
will you marry Shi Feixian?

542
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Count Cheng’an!

543
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,790
I’m asking you.

544
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,640
Will you marry her?

545
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,840
I...

546
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,200
I put the state

547
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,550
before my marriage.

548
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,270
See?

549
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,750
That’s a no.

550
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,550
Cousin, stop wasting your time.

551
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,200
What a shame!

552
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,360
As the most talented ones

553
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,080
in the state,

554
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,600
you two could’ve made a perfect couple.

555
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,600
Too bad!

556
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,030
Bland.

557
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,440
What’s this?

558
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
This one looks good.

559
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,360
I got it first. Let go.

560
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,950
Why?

561
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,880
Don’t, Sister.

562
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,230
Prince Luo.

563
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,230
Who are you to steal food from me?

564
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,120
Be a man!

565
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,160
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?

566
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,510
Food concerns no gender.

567
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,920
Let him have it. I’m good.

568
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
I’ve had enough. Take this.

569
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,360
Is that a handout?

570
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,310
Get rid of it.

571
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,990
I’ll ask the kitchen to make you some.

572
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,510
Young Master Ban is indeed a foodie.

573
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,680
Don’t you like that headwear?

574
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,680
I can ask him about it.

575
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,470
Excuse me, Young Master Ban,

576
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,710
where did your sister

577
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,790
get that headwear on her?

578
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,790
It was made

579
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,880
according to her design.

580
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,160
She designed it?

581
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,990
Why? Are you jealous?

582
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,080
Why would I?

583
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,510
It looks strange.

584
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,880
Let’s go.

585
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,080
Come on. Let’s go.

586
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,200
Don’t you

587
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,510
like it?

588
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,310
I think her design is still at home.

589
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,880
Hang on.

590
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,230
May I have a look?

591
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,550
You can,

592
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,200
but it’s not free.

593
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,840
I don’t need money or...

594
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,920
I can make you desserts.

595
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,030
Deal.

596
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,950
Princess, may I speak to you in private?

597
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,470
About what? Just say it here.

598
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,360
Will you marry me?

599
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,470
You... You’re straight.

600
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,310
Princess,

601
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,510
when I saw you

602
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,360
at Princess Royal’s banquet,

603
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,710
it was love at first sight.

604
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,310
Then you kept giving me signals.

605
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,710
My heart

606
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,400
is racing for you day and night.

607
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,510
I can’t stop thinking of you.

608
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,160
Are you alright?

609
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,030
Is that so?

610
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,200
You’re lucky, Princess.

611
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,230
I’m touched

612
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,270
by Young Master Yan’s confession.

613
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,990
Young Master Yan is straightforward.

614
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
You two are alike.

615
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,230
Princess, what do you think?

616
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,230
None of your business.
I know what to do.

617
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,550
I didn’t share your feelings,

618
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,030
so I can’t accept them.

619
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,950
And I don’t remember

620
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,790
all that you’ve said.

621
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
You’ve probably mistaken it.

622
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,230
How come?

623
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,120
How could Mr. Yan’s heartfelt feelings

624
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,510
be mistakes?

625
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,750
That’s quite hurtful.

626
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,510
What a shame!

627
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,880
Prime Minister’s son and Princess

628
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,710
would be a perfect match.

629
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,920
True love is rare to come by.

630
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,550
I wish

631
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,790
someone would love me like this.

632
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,790
If you’re envious,

633
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,640
why don’t you marry him?

634
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,990
I said

635
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,550
marriage calls for mutual love.

636
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,310
I have no feelings for you.

637
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,400
Please go back.

638
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,470
I... I love you wholeheartedly.

639
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,840
Princess, you’re lying, aren’t you?

640
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,600
Don’t conceal your feelings.

641
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,600
If you’re shy

642
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,230
to admit in public,

643
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,750
we can talk alone.

644
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,880
She’s made clear as it is.

645
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,310
You should leave.

646
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,440
This is between me and Princess.

647
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,160
Please behave yourself.

648
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,640
Count is right.

649
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,710
Young Master Yan,

650
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,920
don’t embarrass yourself in public.

651
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,440
Please leave, Young Master Yan.

652
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,950
I apologize, Your Highness.

653
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,400
I’ll show myself out.

654
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,750
Princess, have you... Come around?

655
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,470
I’m sorry that I was rude just now.

656
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,160
Please forgive me.

657
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,440
If you marry me,

658
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,990
I’ll protect you with my life.

659
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,230
Young Master Yan,

660
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,950
if you’re in love with a girl,

661
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,790
what will you do?

662
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,880
I’ll marry her.

663
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,950
I’ll forever love her

664
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,120
and never betray her.

665
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,990
What if she’s free-spirited

666
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,310
and independent

667
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,470
who only does things of her own will?

668
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,600
What will you do then?

669
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,750
I’ll support her regardless.

670
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,230
What if your mother forbids you?

671
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,360
I...

672
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,640
For example,

673
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,160
what if

674
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,120
she doesn’t want kids?

675
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,840
I’m fine with it.

676
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,230
What if your mother disagrees?

677
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,790
Then...

678
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,160
Then...

679
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,310
I’ll discuss it with my wife.

680
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,120
I thought you’d say,

681
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
“I’ll be on her side.

682
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,870
No one can force her to do anything”.

683
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,830
But that way,

684
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,750
my mother would be upset.

685
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,230
Young Master Yan, to love someone

686
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,910
isn’t only to marry her.

687
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,870
Why would a girl marry you

688
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,710
if you didn’t think for her?

689
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,600
So we aren’t meant to be.

690
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,390
I hope you’ll soon find someone

691
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,790
who obeys your mother.

692
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,430
Good day.

693
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,750
Princess,

694
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,350
why are you different from most girls?

695
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,830
Meet a girl like me.

696
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,960
Sister.

697
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,600
Don’t be upset.

698
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,120
Count Cheng’an didn’t turn you down.

699
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,310
We can think up a new plan.

700
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,310
Thank you, Sister.

701
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,000
Count,

702
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,390
why don’t you stay for dinner?

703
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,960
Thank you, Miss Shi.

704
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,270
It’s getting dark.

705
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,080
I need to take Princess Ban back.

706
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,270
Take her back?

707
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,750
Thanks for your hospitality. Goodbye.

708
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,520
You know,

709
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,000
you could stay for dinner.

710
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,710
I don’t have dinner

711
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,040
with anyone.

712
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,200
Crown Prince and Princess

713
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,600
are so sweet together.

714
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,480
I wish I could find my other half.

715
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,870
I’m sure you will.

716
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,520
They say Prince Luo

717
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,350
likes tender and well-mannered girls.

718
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,080
It’s not too late to change yourself.

719
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,430
What did you say?

720
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,350
Stop.

721
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Or Prince Luo will never like you.

722
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,830
Shut up!

723
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:48,830
You...

724
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,040
What are you doing?

725
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,480
Stay away from me.

726
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,200
You...

727
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,350
Wait! I’m still here!

728
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,430
Wait for me!

729
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,200
Stop there!

730
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,750
Ban Heng?

731
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,310
Take me with you!

732
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,310
See you.

733
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:03,910
You...

734
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,350
So inside it’s just...

735
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,160
Count, I have a question.

736
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,960
If Shi Feixian is as good as they say,

737
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,000
why do you keep pushing her away?

738
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,200
Come to think of it,

739
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,120
she’s educated,

740
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,480
talented and knowledgeable.

741
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,960
That’s quite attractive.

742
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,160
Get off now.

743
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,640
Fine.

744
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,430
The carriage is still moving.

745
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,600
Wait. Wait for me.

746
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,790
Stop the carriage.

747
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,200
How could you leave without me, Hua?

748
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,160
Count Cheng’an!

749
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,350
Young Master Ban.

750
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,230
What are you doing here?

751
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,270
I see. I’ll leave.

752
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Come back!

753
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,430
Did you poke the bear?

754
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
While I was filling myself up,

755
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,600
someone’s proposal got rejected.

756
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,960
Whose was it?

757
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,000
You each

758
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,160
have your own admirer.

759
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,600
That’s a tie.

760
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,680
No one has lost.

761
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,230
I’ve turned Yan Zhen down.

762
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,560
There’s nothing between us.

763
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hua, don’t you know

764
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,120
how stubborn he is?

765
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
It’s too soon to relax.

766
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,480
This could be just a start.

767
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,160
What to do?

768
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,830
I have an idea,

769
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,960
but it requires help from someone.

770
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,230
Who is it?

771
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,200
Count Cheng’an.

772
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,040
Me?

773
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,480
What can I do?

774
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,790
Have a fake marriage.

775
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,080
-Have a fake marriage?
-Have a fake marriage?

776
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,830
Once you two pretend to marry,

777
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,430
others

778
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:33,960
with the right mind

779
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
won’t bother you again.

780
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,270
I’ll kick you out!

781
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,160
Don’t, Hua.

782
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,430
Go away.

783
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,560
I’m sorry, Count.

784
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,750
He doesn’t know what he’s saying.

785
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,200
I mean...

786
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,910
marriage is just a routine.

787
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,520
Why take it so seriously?

788
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,640
We can’t risk a girl’s reputation.

789
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,600
That’s inappropriate.

790
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,680
If things don’t work out,

791
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,600
you can divorce her.

792
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,120
I’ll divorce him first.

793
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,390
Young Master Ban,

794
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,960
marriage concerns lifetime happiness.

795
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,080
It must be treated with caution.

796
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Other than getting married,

797
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,040
what about a fake engagement?

798
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,960
Okay. I’m out.

799
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,000
Fake engagement?

800
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,000
I’m glad to see

801
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,040
Rong Xia and Ban Hua together.

802
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,230
My years of wish has been fulfilled.

803
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,870
In this case,

804
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,640
I’ll pick a wedding day for you.

805
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,430
No.

806
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,200
Why did you say no?

807
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,430
No to what exactly?

808
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:30,454
