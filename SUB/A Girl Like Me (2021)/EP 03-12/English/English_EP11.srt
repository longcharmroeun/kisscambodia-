<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 11</i>

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,090
What were you thinking just now?

37
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,730
I didn’t think of anything.

38
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,420
Countess,
what were you thinking just now?

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,050
I… I…

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,980
I thought of nothing.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,450
But your face…

42
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,210
Then what are you blushing for?

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,820
-I feel hot!
-I feel hot!

44
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,860
Have you made your decision?

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,260
-No!
-No!

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
No?

47
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,770
Then you think of a better way.

48
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,660
Way…

49
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,580
There will be a way.

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,490
I have such a good idea, but you
don’t use it.

51
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,930
And you can’t think of a better one.

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,540
How about you two

53
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,610
make a bet?

54
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,700
Bet?

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,610
Bet on who can deal with Yan Zhen

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,420
without hurting anyone and reporting

57
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,420
to His Majesty.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,980
Then, how much do we bet?

59
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,100
My family is not short of money.

60
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,450
It’s of no point to bet money.

61
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,170
Let’s make a big bet.

62
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,380
The one who loses

63
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,100
will owe the other one a wish.

64
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,260
If you both lose,

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,330
then each of you owes me a wish.

66
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,540
-Wish?
-Wish?

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,100
I’m a man.

68
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,380
Of course I’m not afraid of a bet.

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,610
No one is afraid.

70
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,380
Your Grace, you’ll definitely lose.

71
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,100
Don’t be so sure.

72
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,610
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
Minister Yan’s son loves Your Highness.

73
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,330
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
So his mother came for the proposal.

74
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,820
Such a perfect match is rare.

75
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,210
Marquis Jingting’s Mansion,
please open the door.

76
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,100
Mrs. Yan is here for a visit!

77
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,610
Mrs. Yan?

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,540
Serve the betrothal presents!

79
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,860
It’s a perfect a match
between the Bans and the Yans.

80
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,010
Please open the door.

81
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,170
No! No! Bad news!

82
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,170
Your Grace! Your Grace!

83
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,820
Bad news! Bad news!

84
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,610
What’s wrong?

85
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,220
Your Grace,
why aren’t you anxious at all?

86
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,980
They are about to break the door!

87
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,490
As one of my family,

88
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,340
remember,

89
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,100
don’t make a fuss at any time.

90
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,370
Fool of love, crazy for love!

91
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,300
Crazy for love!

92
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,130
Remember?

93
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,050
Open the door.

94
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,100
After all these difficulties,

95
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,130
finally you open the door!

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,540
Mrs. Yan, sorry for bothering you.

97
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,690
Here is our big gift for you!

98
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,860
My Lady! My Lady!

99
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,930
Do you know what to yell?

100
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,810
Yes, of course.

101
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,570
Start now.

102
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,250
Oh, no!

103
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,300
Mrs. Yan passed out!

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,050
Do you know what to yell?

105
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,980
Oh, no! Mrs. Yan passed out!

106
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
Mrs. Yan passed out?

107
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,780
What to do now?

108
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,220
After all, she is
Prime Minister’s wife.

109
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,420
She dares to block our door.

110
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,900
I don’t care who she is.

111
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,220
That’s right to say. But

112
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,730
Prime Minister is hard to deal with.

113
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,020
Open the door!

114
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,460
There will be a trouble if you don’t
open the door!

115
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,170
If Mrs. Yan dies at our gate,

116
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,540
I… How should I explain to His Majesty?

117
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,860
Let her in.

118
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,050
As Grandpa’s Book of War says,

119
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,300
“Lure the enemies in deep
and then destroy them.”

120
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,570
It’s really hard to get in

121
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,020
my daughter-in-law’s house.

122
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,130
She’s not your daughter-in-law!

123
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,810
Mr. Marquis, please calm down.

124
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,900
Let’s have a little talk.

125
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,730
Don’t bother!

126
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,810
Let me make it clear to you.

127
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,780
I won’t marry your son.

128
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,130
Softy, see them out.

129
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,490
Leave! Go now!

130
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,300
What do you mean?

131
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,780
Princess, take it easy.

132
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,980
Let’s have some tea together

133
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,730
and you can think about it.

134
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,300
Mrs. Yan, please forgive us,

135
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,020
we don’t have tea today.

136
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,050
No, there is no water in our house.

137
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,170
Mr. Marquis, are you shutting

138
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,730
the Prime Minister’s people out?

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,690
Princess Royal is here!

140
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,930
Your Highness!

141
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,810
So elegant and gorgeous!

142
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,020
-She is still in good health.
-Yeah.

143
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,460
Still in fine fettle!

144
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,190
Mom.

145
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,870
-Mother.
-Grandma.

146
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,720
-Welcome.
-Grandma.

147
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,340
Mrs. Yan, are you here today
to make a proposal

148
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,130
or propose a marriage by force?

149
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,930
I’m here to propose for my son.

150
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,660
Do you think I’m

151
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,020
old, weak, and easy to bully?

152
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,170
I don’t dare to.

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,810
Or, you think Yan Hui has great power

154
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,810
and no one can suppress you?

155
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,020
I never dare to think so.

156
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,020
But my son is lovesick now.

157
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,540
As his mother, I really feel sorry.

158
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,130
So I acted rashly. Please forgive me.

159
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,610
But if Princess Ban can marry
into our family,

160
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,900
we will never treat her unfairly.

161
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,690
Let me tell you clearly today.

162
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,220
My granddaughter

163
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,130
will never marry your son.

164
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,900
Your Highness,

165
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,220
my son’s life is at stake.

166
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,930
If Your Highness don’t agree,

167
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,220
I can only go with my husband

168
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,540
and all my families

169
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,340
to beg His Majesty for the marriage.

170
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,170
How dare you threaten my grandma!

171
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,220
I don’t dare.

172
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,730
But I think you will do His Majesty
this favor.

173
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,900
Except my father and His Majesty,

174
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,420
no one can influence my choice.

175
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,460
Whether your son will live or die,

176
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,730
it has nothing to do with the Bans.

177
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,930
If you know what I mean,

178
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,860
get out of my face right now!

179
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,250
I don’t know what I did wrong

180
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,370
that I got targeted by your son.

181
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,130
After the mess you made here,

182
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,130
my grandma got mad.

183
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,690
Now let me be clear here.

184
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,690
Even if there is only Yan Zhen
in this world,

185
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,330
I’d rather become a nun

186
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,780
than marry your son!

187
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,660
Princess, you’re still young.

188
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,620
I won’t blame you for being rude.

189
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,090
But the marriage is not up to you.

190
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,090
The Yans and the Bans are both
favored by His Majesty.

191
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,420
I think His Majesty will

192
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,300
definitely agree to the marriage
between us.

193
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,900
As long as he allows,

194
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,260
there’ll be no place for you to escape.

195
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,020
Don’t scare me with His Majesty.

196
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,810
We’re both not sure whom

197
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,690
His Majesty will listen to.

198
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,140
Your family

199
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,930
is just good at acting shamelessly.

200
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,740
These stupid ways can’t

201
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,330
influence His Majesty’s decision.

202
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,210
Mrs. Yan, that’s totally right.

203
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,300
To deal with your family,

204
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,900
these stupid ways are enough.

205
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,050
But if you like,

206
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,850
I’m willing to play it with you.

207
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,300
So, take care.

208
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,570
Your grandma is Her Highness, so what?

209
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,300
After you marry my son,

210
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,420
I have plenty of ways to deal with you.

211
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,690
Your Majesty.

212
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,170
Your Majesty,

213
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
my wife strived for the marriage,

214
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,850
so she offended Her Highness.

215
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,810
Please forgive us.

216
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,300
Since she offended Princess Royal,

217
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,330
you should go to beg her
for forgiveness.

218
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,260
I’m afraid Her Highness is still mad

219
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,570
and doesn’t want to see me.

220
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,620
Her Highness is Your Majesty’s aunt,

221
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,540
as long as you talk to her,

222
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,170
I think she will cool down.

223
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,050
Of course she is my aunt.

224
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,450
But this is all about your son.

225
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,810
If you want my aunt to forgive you,

226
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,810
you’d better go to her yourself.

227
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,500
Your Majesty, I asked

228
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,780
my wife to go for the proposal

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,020
just for the situation of the court.

230
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,740
For situation of the court?

231
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,780
That’s right.

232
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,810
I wonder if Your Majesty have ever
thought about it.

233
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,620
When the Prince succeeds to the throne,

234
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,970
the Shis

235
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,050
will take the lead in the court.

236
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,020
I’m afraid I will be

237
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,500
too weak to contain them alone.

238
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,970
If they can keep their duty,

239
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,420
that’ll be great for the country.

240
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,850
But what if they have any bad idea?

241
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,450
That’ll be a big problem.

242
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,330
So, if we can unite with the Bans
by marriage,

243
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,930
the Shis will be somewhat restrained.

244
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,850
That makes sense.

245
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,300
But,

246
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,900
it’s your son

247
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,420
who is wooing Her Highness’s
granddaughter.

248
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,690
It’s not a state affair.

249
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,020
It’s not proper for me to intervene.

250
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,260
No matter how,

251
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,020
it’s for my aunt to decide.

252
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,900
Right?

253
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,300
Since that,

254
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,780
thanks for your consideration,
Your Majesty.

255
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,300
What an old fox.

256
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,620
You want to drag me into this?

257
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,930
Your Grace, I don’t know why.

258
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,620
The matter that Mrs. Yan got
Her Highness mad is no longer

259
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,620
mentioned after only two days.

260
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,620
Your Grace, I found it out.

261
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,090
Mrs. Yan spent hundreds of taels

262
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,210
to change the gossip.

263
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,170
What does she change it to?

264
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,380
It’s said that Mr. Yan

265
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,170
is crazy for love with no eating.

266
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,810
He just wants to marry you.

267
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,740
How shameful! Again?

268
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
She failed in the proposal,

269
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,260
so she used such a cheap shot.

270
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,740
What else did she say?

271
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,810
She also said that

272
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,780
if one day Childe Yan dies,

273
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,260
it’s not for hunger

274
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,810
but for his love for you!

275
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,740
What?

276
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,380
She is both seeking for sympathy

277
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,210
and slandering you

278
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,620
and forcing you to surrender!

279
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,540
That’s right!

280
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,850
Your Grace, any idea?

281
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,780
Of course.

282
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,570
Pay back in kind.

283
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,900
Sweetheart,

284
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,090
what’s the matter for me?

285
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,170
Dad,

286
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,020
do you have any close

287
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,690
and reliable friends in the court?

288
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,620
Do those paid ones count?

289
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,570
Count Cheng’an, read it for me.

290
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,300
Yes.

291
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,850
The rumor in the streets said

292
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,420
Childe Yan Zhen

293
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,090
is having fast for love, which
touches the whole world.

294
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,970
The Bans are haughty with the trust
of His Majesty.

295
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,570
Princess Ban is even harder
to get along with.

296
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,170
She is totally…

297
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,970
She is totally a coquette.

298
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,050
Don’t care about the gossip.

299
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,210
Go on.

300
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,660
It’s said that

301
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,050
Princess Ban

302
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,330
will lose a lot if she refuses
the proposal of the Yans.

303
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
There are three reasons.

304
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,500
The first is…

305
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,210
Go on.

306
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,020
It’s full of nonsense.

307
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,900
Your Majesty, you don’t need to
waste your time on it.

308
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,140
What nonsense?

309
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
I’m curious.

310
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,020
Just keep on reading.

311
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,300
I don’t dare to.

312
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,540
Just do as I tell you!

313
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,140
The first is

314
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,660
that the country can’t keep running
without the court,

315
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,970
and the court can’t leave
Prime Minister Yan.

316
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,300
The rise and fall of the country

317
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,420
rely on the Yans.

318
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,050
Please don’t take the gossip seriously.

319
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,140
The only one the country relies on
is Your Majesty!

320
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,500
How darned!

321
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,500
Give my order!

322
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,850
Catch those who spread this rumor!

323
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,260
Yes.

324
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,970
Mr. Du, why are you here?

325
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,140
It’s beautiful here.
I’m here for a stroll.

326
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,690
It’s just an alley.
Where is beautiful?

327
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,210
I just like the scenery in this alley.

328
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,660
Then, enjoy your time. See you.

329
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,420
See you.

330
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,850
Mr. Du,

331
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,900
I have spread the gossip that

332
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,050
the country can’t live without
the Yans.

333
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,020
Please pay me now.

334
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,930
Miss Softy,

335
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,380
I have settled down the matter about
the “coquette”.

336
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,570
Please pay me the rest of the money.

337
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,780
-It’s you who are spreading the rumor!
-It’s you who are spreading the rumor!

338
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,850
Your Majesty.

339
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,900
You’re still bothered by that gossip?

340
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,930
The rumor is no big deal.

341
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,330
But the physicians

342
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,020
I sent to Auntie days ago

343
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,780
all got kicked out.

344
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,210
Looks like Auntie is really angry.

345
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,540
The Yans are really rude to force
the marriage this time.

346
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,740
It’s reasonable for Her Highness
to be unpleased.

347
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,740
How could the Yans have such a

348
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,210
stubborn son?

349
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,690
It’s all because of Hua’s charms.

350
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,570
The childe of the Yans

351
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,780
does have good eyes.

352
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,090
Your Majesty,

353
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,090
I can’t agree with you.

354
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,660
What’s your opinion?

355
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,540
Childe Yan is unkind to threaten
with his death.

356
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,900
He is also unfilial to force his mother
to beg others for times.

357
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,780
Princess Ban is charming.

358
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,170
But this also troubles her.

359
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,900
So the one to be blamed is Childe Yan,

360
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,930
not Princess Ban.

361
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,900
That makes sense.

362
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,930
If every man uses this trick

363
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,210
to force a girl to marry him,

364
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,260
the society will lose the morality

365
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,500
and be in a bad social mood.

366
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,660
You like Ban Hua?

367
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,540
Your Majesty,

368
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,460
Princess Ban is noble
and beyond my reach.

369
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,300
Then I got it wrong.

370
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,330
You helped the Bans every time

371
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,500
when they were in troubles.

372
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,180
I thought you fell in love with Hua.

373
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,220
I like to be alone quietly.

374
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,300
I really can’t get along well with
Princess Ban.

375
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,410
I helped them

376
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,650
just to reconcile the court disputes

377
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,020
and share your worries.

378
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,220
That’s all.

379
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,410
Look at you.

380
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,130
You are not interested in both
power and women.

381
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,570
You live the life of an ascetic monk.

382
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,180
You’re not related to me,

383
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,180
but you’re like my son.

384
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,540
I will get you a perfect marriage
by myself.

385
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

386
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,130
Hua,

387
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,610
you will be married one day.

388
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,570
But now you have met

389
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,370
many problems about marriage.

390
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,810
It even becomes an excuse for
court disputes.

391
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,410
If one day

392
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,980
I’m not alive…

393
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,410
Grandma,

394
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,260
you promised me that

395
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,260
you would never say this again.

396
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,500
Your Highness, everything is ready.

397
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,020
We can go back at any time.

398
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,130
Hua,

399
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,180
Count Cheng’an helped you many times.

400
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,500
But he is a henchman of His Majesty.

401
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,890
You’d better keep a distance from him.

402
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,220
Grandma,

403
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,740
but His Majesty always treats you as…

404
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,890
Being with the King is like
living with a tiger.

405
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,020
The one who can get along with a tiger

406
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,330
can’t be a kind one.

407
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,850
Never relax your vigilance.

408
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,300
-Listen to me…
-I will be careful.

409
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,410
But

410
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,850
Count Cheng’an must be holding
some secrets,

411
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,090
but, Grandma, he is definitely
not a bad guy.

412
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,880
About this,

413
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,180
-I understand…
-Your Grace!

414
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,400
-But he…
-The paste is ready!

415
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,160
Come on!

416
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,810
-Coming!
-Listen to me.

417
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,610
Grandma, I have something to do.

418
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,410
I gotta go.

419
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,020
Your Highness, I think we can

420
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,260
find some more suitable young childes

421
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,130
for her to choose.

422
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,570
Maybe she will like one of them

423
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,540
and you can be relieved.

424
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,740
But my granddaughter

425
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,850
is more even demanding than me.

426
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,520
<i>Notice: Do not get close.
Or you’ll suffer.</i>

427
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,410
<i>Notice: Do not get close…</i>
I think it’s still not enough.

428
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,500
It should be scarier.

429
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,460
I don’t know why you post this notice.

430
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,370
I don’t understand either.

431
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,940
Of course you don’t.

432
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,180
After we post this notice,

433
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,050
the Yans will feel embarrassed

434
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,130
and won’t dare to come over again,

435
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,090
let alone proposing the marriage.

436
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,940
After all, you just want to win
Count Cheng’an.

437
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,940
Your Grace,

438
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,050
what did you bet with Count Cheng’an?

439
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,740
Well… Nothing.

440
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,650
They bet a wish.

441
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,410
Wish?

442
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,980
Then she can buy anything he wants
if she wins!

443
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,500
No way!

444
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,090
Is there anything

445
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,180
our family can’t afford?

446
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,740
If she wins,

447
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,180
she must want something

448
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,740
that can’t be bought.

449
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,810
I see!

450
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,850
To let Count Cheng’an

451
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,650
marry our princess!

452
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,610
Dear.

453
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,050
Dear.

454
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,090
What are you thinking?

455
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,540
Nothing special.

456
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,740
Just something interesting in the city.

457
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,050
Yan Zhen fasts
in order to marry Ban Hua.

458
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,260
I wonder how His Majesty
will deal with it.

459
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,300
Yan Zhen acted recklessly at the party
last time.

460
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,610
How could such a hothead
trick the Bans?

461
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,090
Why do you care so much about
Ban Hua’s marriage?

462
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,980
I’m just curious.

463
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,130
I thought you’re worried that

464
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,700
there may be affection between
Ban Hua and Count Cheng’an.

465
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,370
Silly,

466
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,850
you’re always so smart.

467
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,780
Why can’t you see it clearly this time?

468
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,220
Didn’t you read the brochure
I gave you last time?

469
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,940
None of Count Cheng’an’s preferences

470
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,850
matches with Ban Hua’s.

471
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,940
How could Count Cheng’an like her?

472
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,130
Are you still afraid

473
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,650
that Ban Hua will steal your man?

474
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,050
Don’t say that.

475
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,020
Alright. I’m just kidding.

476
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,650
But I have good news

477
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,370
for you today.

478
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,570
What is it?

479
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,540
I head from the eunuchs that

480
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,330
His Majesty asked Count Cheng’an

481
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,940
if he was in love with Ban Hua.

482
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,300
What did Count Cheng’an say?

483
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,370
He said she was beyond his reach

484
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,740
and denied it.

485
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,050
Count Cheng’an did say that?

486
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,650
How could I lie to you?

487
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,050
Why did he say that?

488
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,300
Ban Hua has no manners.

489
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,810
She doesn’t deserve Count Cheng’an.

490
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,370
This one. This. And this one.

491
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,370
I want them all.

492
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,650
Miss Shi, you always picked one or two.

493
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,780
Why do you pick so many this time?

494
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,850
I’m happy today.

495
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,500
I want these two as well.

496
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,050
Miss Shi, you made a right choice.

497
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,850
These two rouges are new arrivals.

498
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,370
New arrivals? Why don’t you tell me?

499
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,850
No wonder a magpie kept chirping at
my gate today.

500
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,300
Here comes our Princess Ban!

501
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,330
Please have a seat!

502
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,370
Princess.

503
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,090
You must have met some happy events.

504
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,980
You look to be in high spirits.

505
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,810
That’s so rare

506
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,610
for me to meet Miss Shi.

507
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,180
I thought you were more interested

508
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,370
in reading than dressing up.

509
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,540
Princess, I’m flattered.

510
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Congratulations on your marriage
to be settled.

511
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,410
That’s weird.

512
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
Your Grace, what’s weird?

513
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,610
It’s not a special day today.

514
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,050
Why did I receive a Greek gift?

515
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,610
Yeah, that’s weird.

516
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,700
Princess, what do you mean by that?

517
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,540
I mean what you think I mean.

518
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,890
There is a saying that…

519
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,890
It’s impolite not to reciprocate.

520
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,180
Yeah. Since Miss Shi congratulated me,

521
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,780
I also may all your wishes

522
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,810
come true soon and

523
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,260
marry the pretty swan, Count Cheng’an.

524
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,050
You…

525
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,940
Swan!

526
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,300
It’s OK for you to make fun of me
in the past.

527
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,850
I’m still waiting to my Mr. Right.

528
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,020
How could you ruin my reputation
with such a nonsense?

529
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,410
So you didn’t have a crush on him

530
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,940
after the party in Shi’s Mansion?

531
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,500
She didn’t have a crush.

532
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,540
She didn’t.

533
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,090
-That’s really a pity.
-Such a pity.

534
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,370
A beauty and a handsome.

535
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,500
But Miss Shi looks healthy and ruddy.

536
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,980
She doesn’t need rouge.

537
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,610
Boss, I want the two new ones.

538
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,370
Both of them!

539
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,050
This…

540
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,940
I picked them first.

541
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,540
I chose the ones Miss Shi wants?

542
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,780
Sorry. Sorry.

543
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,650
Princess Ban,

544
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,780
don’t you know you should be served
in order of arrival?

545
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,220
Who are you?

546
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,330
Why are you so rude?

547
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,220
It’s OK.

548
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,940
This is weird again.

549
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,300
The things others want always

550
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,570
come to me.

551
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,810
Your Grace, do you mean Count Cheng’an?

552
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,850
Don’t talk nonsense.

553
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,300
Since today

554
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,220
Miss Shi picked the two rouges,

555
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,180
I will leave them to you.

556
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,090
After all,

557
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,410
there are little things that
I can leave to you, right?

558
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,090
The rouges can’t refuse you either.

559
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,780
Princess, you’re right.

560
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,570
The rouges can’t refuse you,

561
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,300
but human can.

562
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,050
Princess, you are so noble

563
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,300
that not everyone can reach you.

564
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,700
You…

565
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,700
How rude!

566
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,260
Count Cheng’an did say that?

567
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,330
That’s too much!

568
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,570
Maybe he is afraid of Hua’s
bad reputation

569
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,460
after being broken off
three engagements.

570
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,330
No. In my opinion,

571
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,330
that is just his subterfuge.

572
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,500
He must think my sister is unscholarly.

573
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,330
Why?

574
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,220
Look at you and your sister.

575
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,540
You are handsome

576
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,500
and she is also

577
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,980
fine-looking.

578
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,740
But then again,

579
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,780
think about it.

580
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,300
Count Cheng’an helped us many times.

581
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,540
Why did he do that if it’s not

582
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,540
for Hua?

583
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,300
My Lady, you’re right.

584
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,330
The most precious one in our family

585
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,610
is Hua.

586
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,180
Count Cheng’an must think

587
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,850
he doesn’t deserve Hua.

588
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,650
That’s right.

589
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,410
Look, he is the greatest gentleman.

590
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,890
If he gets refused,

591
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,330
that will be a shame.

592
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,610
So he thought about it

593
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,330
and said he couldn’t reach Hua.

594
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,850
Ban Heng is right.

595
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,330
Hua, don’t worry about it.

596
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,300
You’re so careless.

597
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,850
It’s such a critical time now.

598
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,370
You’re still discussing about
Count Cheng’an?

599
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,740
The most important thing now is to
deal with the Yans.

600
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,090
We treated Mrs. Yan like that.

601
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,540
She will definitely fight back.

602
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,540
Don’t be afraid.

603
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,810
With your grandma here,

604
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,460
she dares not to act wildly.

605
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,330
Yeah. If she dares,

606
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,130
Grandma will tell His Majesty

607
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,540
to punish his whole family.

608
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,090
Grandma, Grandma.

609
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,050
You keep bothering Grandma!

610
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Grandma also has her own things to do!

611
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,780
Can’t you figure out a way yourself?

612
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,980
I’m so scared.

613
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,780
What’s wrong with her?

614
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,460
Maybe

615
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,540
Count Cheng’an got her mad again.

616
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,940
So scary.

617
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,570
So fierce.

618
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:58,040
<i>Detailed account of the
official positions buyers</i>

619
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,220
Your Grace, the Acacias in front of us

620
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,980
are now a private property of the Yans.

621
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,410
Acacia means the love and yearning.

622
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,460
It’s both love and poison.

623
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,610
After reading Prime Minister Yan’s
handwriting,

624
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,460
do you have any opinions?

625
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,500
Thanks for

626
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,980
giving me such an important information.

627
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,610
But, unfortunately,

628
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,300
I don’t want to be involved into
the court disputes.

629
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,050
What a pity.

630
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,890
I thought you want
to revenge your family.

631
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,540
If I really want to revenge,

632
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,740
I’m afraid you will also be in trouble.

633
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,460
Looks like you don’t believe
what I said.

634
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,410
Alright.

635
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,650
If my being in trouble

636
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,220
can make you feel better,

637
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,780
I can only bear with it.

638
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,610
Xie, you’re generous.

639
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,410
But now I have His Majesty’s trust

640
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
and be in high position.

641
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,570
I don’t care about the old grudges now.

642
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,500
Your families are watching you
from the sky.

643
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,180
Aren’t you really curious about
the truth of that year?

644
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,780
I only got a little key information

645
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,180
after a lot of investigations.

646
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,020
Please don’t let my

647
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,700
family affairs trouble you.

648
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,850
See you.

649
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,220
You just let him go like this?

650
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,220
Didn’t you say to let him
take the bait?

651
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,650
Your Highness, don’t worry.

652
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,410
The wind has left its mark
over the water.

653
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,570
The long line catches the big fish.

654
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,300
His family grudge is his weakness.

655
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,220
What if he doesn’t want to
cooperate with us?

656
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,050
After we get rid of the Yans,

657
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,020
his enemy will be Princess Royal.

658
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,610
One is his loyal official

659
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,700
and the other is his aunt.

660
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,570
I wonder who His Majesty will
protect then.

661
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,780
At that time,

662
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,180
it’s not up to him whether to
join hands with us.

663
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,410
Destroy him by another one’s hand?

664
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,180
Good. It’s a great idea.

665
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,540
Great.

666
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,610
Xie Chongjin,

667
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,570
you have a nice place here.

668
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Young Master, there’s a clear evidence
that the Yans

669
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,810
bought the official position.

670
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,570
What are you waiting for?

671
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,700
The court is a battlefield with
no weapons.

672
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,570
May the Yans are guilty.

673
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,850
But if it causes factionalism,

674
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,500
maybe many families

675
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,260
will be broken up

676
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,610
like my family.

677
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,740
But, Young Master,

678
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,370
isn’t this the truth that

679
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,370
we have been searching for?

680
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,180
Yeah.

681
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,300
But now Prince Luo is aggressive.

682
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,050
The Crown Prince’s position is unstable.

683
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
If the Yans collapse,

684
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,980
Prince Luo will target at the Shis.

685
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,020
And the politics will be in trouble.

686
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,050
Then the common people will be involved.

687
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,050
I believe that

688
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,810
the truth comes from people’s suffering

689
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,410
is not what my parents and brother
wanted to see.

690
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,050
Du Jiu,

691
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,220
take this to the Bans.

692
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,780
This may be able to settle down
their problem of marriage.

693
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,050
Yes.

694
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,650
Excuse me for my leaving.

695
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,850
Minister Shi is here for a visit.

696
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,850
Rong, wait a moment.

697
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,370
Greeting, Your Majesty.

698
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,650
Your Majesty,

699
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,740
what’s the matter for me

700
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,180
and my grandson in such a hurry?

701
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,020
Chonghai,

702
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,890
I remember that

703
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,980
your grandson, Shi Jin, is still
not married, right?

704
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,850
Your Majesty, thanks for your concern.

705
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,220
I’m still young and haven’t made
any achievements.

706
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,300
I don’t deserve a marriage now.

707
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,330
Really a good man of my country.

708
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,700
Chonghai, you have a good grandson.

709
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,090
Your Majesty, thanks for your praise.

710
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,370
I’m really happy about it.

711
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,610
Chonghai,

712
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,500
about the matter that the Yans

713
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,810
want to marry Ban Hua,

714
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,940
what’s your opinion?

715
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,570
I have heard of it.

716
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,890
I think

717
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,650
this is

718
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,500
between the Bans and the Yans.

719
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,370
It’s not proper for others
to discuss about it.

720
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,540
But, the marriage

721
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,500
could only be perfect

722
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,570
when they do love each other.

723
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,570
Of course.

724
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,180
But it’s a pity that

725
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,330
Count Cheng’an has no feeling
for Hua.

726
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,220
Or

727
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,890
they will be a perfect match, right?

728
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,020
Yeah.

729
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,570
Princess Fule

730
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,780
is the only favored granddaughter
of Princess Royal.

731
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,890
And Your Majesty love her as well.

732
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,020
Her marriage must be decided carefully.

733
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,980
But recently there are

734
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,300
some rumors in the city

735
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,050
which also make me angry.

736
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,940
What rumors?

737
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,180
I heard that

738
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,330
Prime Minister Yan insists to unite
with the Bans by marriage

739
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,330
just to compete with me

740
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,130
in the court.

741
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,020
But I thought about it,

742
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,540
Minister Yan also has been
assisting Your Majesty for years.

743
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,890
He must know that

744
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,410
Your Majesty hate the factionalism.

745
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,850
I have heard of these rumors.

746
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,220
I believe that Minister Yan
doesn’t mean that.

747
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,700
Actually,

748
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,370
I also think this marriage is not
so perfect.

749
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,010
But I have to save his dignity.

750
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,970
Your Majesty, if there is anything
I can do,

751
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,930
please just let me know.

752
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,660
Great.

753
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,450
Shi Jin.

754
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

755
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,010
Are you willing to do me this favor?

756
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,740
It’s my great honor

757
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,970
to help Your Majesty.

758
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,810
That means

759
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,490
you also have feelings for Hua?

760
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,060
I…

761
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,410
That’s perfect.

762
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,490
Thanks for Your Majesty.

763
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,330
Thanks for Your Majesty.

764
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,930
Chonghai,

765
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,810
you really know me well.

766
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Since that,

767
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,060
just do what you have to do.

768
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

769
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,810
You may leave now.

770
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,450
Rong, what’s wrong?

771
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,410
Is there any other thing for me?

772
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:18,890
Excuse me for my leaving.

773
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,010
Your Majesty,

774
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,850
are you really betroth Princess Ban
to Shi Jin?

775
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,330
When did I say that?

776
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,260
But just now…

777
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,450
Did I say it just now?

778
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,370
Your Majesty, it’s wise of you.

779
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,620
Your Grace.

780
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,300
Mr. Shi.

781
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,450
Your Grace,

782
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,260
if you don’t like Princess Ban,

783
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,850
please show mercy

784
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,580
and leave her alone.

785
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,620
Looks like you do have feelings for her.

786
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,620
But instead of begging me,

787
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,530
you’d better think carefully

788
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,450
about how to get her love.

789
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,330
Now His Majesty wants to betroth her
to me,

790
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,010
Your Grace, please be sensible

791
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,220
and keep a distance from Hua.

792
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,010
Perfect marriage needs the two
to love each other.

793
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,180
What’s more, His Majesty didn’t
say that clearly.

794
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,930
I’m afraid it’s just your own

795
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,220
wishful thinking.

796
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,490
You have no feeling for her

797
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,100
but you always are close to her.

798
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,780
What’s your difference from Shen Yu?

799
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,410
From now on,

800
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,530
if your hurt Hua’s feeling,

801
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,660
I will not forgive you.

802
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,970
Mr. Shi, you worry too much.

803
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,530
If anyone is hurting her,

804
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,140
I’ll always be there.

805
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,260
It’ll never be your turn.

806
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
<i>Medicine</i>

807
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,530
Your Grace, it’s Count Cheng’an.

808
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,330
Princess, you are so noble

809
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,660
that not everyone can reach you.

810
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,850
You…

811
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,600
<i>Angelica Red ginseng</i>

812
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,530
They are medicine of two
different levels.

813
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,330
Why are they tied together?

814
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,300
Your Grace,

815
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,450
what’s wrong with the two of them?

816
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,060
Totally wrong!

817
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,220
In my opinion,

818
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,410
it’s not that angelica can’t
reach red ginseng.

819
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,220
It just doesn’t want to reach!

820
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,660
Your Grace! Your Grace!

821
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,930
Your Grace!

822
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,700
Your Grace!

823
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,620
Your Grace! Mrs. Yan came again!

824
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,850
How dare she come again?

825
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,490
Not only her,

826
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,140
Mr. Yan is also carried here.

827
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,930
Carry?

828
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,100
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

829
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,810
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
Young Master…

830
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,840
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

831
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,490
Mrs. Yan, what do you mean

832
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,700
by taking two coffins to my place?

833
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,010
Zhen wants to marry Princess Ban.

834
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,260
He doesn’t even care about
his health now.

835
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,660
If you don’t say yes today,

836
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,370
the two coffins

837
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,700
will be for my son

838
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,810
and me!

839
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,410
Marquis Ban.

840
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,010
Hello.

841
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,620
Mr. Ban.
