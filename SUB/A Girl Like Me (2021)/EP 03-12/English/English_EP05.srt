36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,370
Three wipes a day,

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,930
Young Master is really
paying attention to it.

38
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,130
Uncle Rong.

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,860
Young Master.

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,970
Is that scholar still standing
outside of Ban’s Mansion?

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,810
Young Master,

42
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,060
if you don’t want him
to disturb Baroness Ban,

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,580
just ask His Majesty

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,970
to drive him away.

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,020
No hurry.

46
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,020
I’m curious about

47
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,930
how she will deal with

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,210
such a trouble.

49
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,860
Scholars are the most troublesome.

50
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,180
That’s true.

51
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,410
Did he mean me?

52
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,500
My love for Hua is witnessed
by the sun and the moon!

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,060
My love for Hua…

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,930
My love for Hua…

55
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,690
My love for Hua…

56
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,580
My love for Hua…

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:08,970
Love…

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,500
The sun…

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,130
And the moon…

60
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,970
By the sun and the moon!

61
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,060
The sun and the...

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,580
Moon!

63
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,500
Wit… Wit… Witnessed!

64
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,620
Marquis!

65
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,620
Ma… Ma… Master!

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,930
Marquis! It’s witnessed!

67
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,900
Get… Get away!

68
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,860
Marquis! It’s witnessed!

69
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,810
My love for Hua is witnessed

70
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,020
by the sun and the moon!

71
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,210
Baroness is here!

72
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,860
Since I was little,

73
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,780
no one has ever really kept me in.

74
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,810
I have to figure out a way.

75
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,500
Ban Heng.

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,020
Young Master.

77
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,460
It’s OK. It’s OK. Come on.

78
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,300
I’m Shen Yu’s friend.

79
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,130
What are you eating?

80
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,580
Walnut shortbread. You want one?

81
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,650
Help yourself. Help yourself.

82
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,340
Baroness!

83
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,740
My love for Hua is witnessed
by the sun and the moon!

84
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,420
The sun and the moon! Baroness!

85
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,810
My love for Hua is witnessed
by the sun and the moon! Baroness!

86
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,180
It’s witnessed!

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,370
The rain is so heavy.

88
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,180
He’s definitely not out there.

89
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,450
Yeah, unless he’s a moron.

90
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,540
It’s not guaranteed though.
Let’s go take a look?

91
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,420
Such a beautiful face!

92
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,660
How dare you!

93
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,810
And he’s in black.

94
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,690
Invite him in.

95
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,250
Marquis, Madam,

96
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,810
I sincerely want to marry Baroness.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,420
And I hope we can have your blessing.

98
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,890
My sister is ignorant, indulgent,

99
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,660
and violent…

100
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
No, forget that.

101
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,130
She’s not nice anyway.

102
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,010
And I think she’s
prone to family violence.

103
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,130
Don’t say I didn’t warn you

104
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,010
when she beats you up.

105
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,540
How about this?

106
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,660
You can tell me your type,

107
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,450
and I’ll introduce some to you.

108
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,980
Thank you

109
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,690
for your good intentions.

110
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,540
But since I love Baroness,

111
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,690
I love her everything.

112
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,930
As her little brother,

113
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,250
how could you speak ill of her?

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,300
Marquis, Madam,

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,570
please give me a chance.

116
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,740
My love for Hua

117
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,570
is witnessed by the…

118
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,060
Stop it, please.

119
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,300
If you say that again,

120
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,130
my hands

121
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,010
might lose control.

122
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,370
Honey, that’s a rare treasure.

123
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,740
Mother is even more hotheaded than me.

124
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,180
Mr. Shen, get up, please.

125
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,860
Madam.

126
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,890
Your sincerity is truly witnessed.

127
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,930
But His Majesty likes Hua a lot.

128
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,500
He won’t marry her to a common people.

129
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,620
Yeah, His Majesty won’t allow it.

130
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,690
Just forget it.

131
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,010
I am a civilian,

132
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,690
not good enough for Baroness.

133
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,420
I’d better continue guarding the gates.

134
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,180
But you are still young and promising.

135
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,370
If you make top three
in the imperial examination,

136
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,370
there might still be some hope in it.

137
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,570
Mother, we should talk to Hua
about this first.

138
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,980
Madam, you mean it?

139
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,740
I’ll give you this jade pendant

140
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,810
as a token.

141
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,330
If you really make top three one day,

142
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,660
the two of us will ask His Majesty

143
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,500
to marry Hua to you.

144
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,890
Thank you, Madam.

145
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,450
I won’t disappoint you.

146
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
I’ll make the top three

147
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,860
and give Hua a magnificent wedding.

148
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,220
Before that, you should study hard.

149
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,810
Stop coming here to make trouble.

150
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,810
I’ll do as you say.

151
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,540
Be careful with it.

152
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,810
You may leave.

153
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,540
Goodbye.

154
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,770
Sorry to disturb you.

155
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,620
Ho… honey, but…

156
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,100
Young Master!

157
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,580
Young Master, great news!

158
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,410
How many times have I told you

159
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,860
to be calm and composed?

160
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,250
What’s the exciting good news?

161
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,410
The Bans has consented
to Shen Yu’s proposal.

162
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,250
OK.

163
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,820
Mother,

164
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,170
what if Shen Yu
really makes the top three?

165
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,290
That would mean we are blessed.

166
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,770
It might be able to
help us through disasters.

167
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,290
You are killing two birds
with one stone.

168
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
I don’t agree with it.

169
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,460
First, I don’t like Shen Yu at all.

170
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,820
Second, if our property
really gets confiscated,

171
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,410
how can I get away alone?

172
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,050
Hua, what you said makes sense.

173
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,860
How about this, honey,

174
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,460
I’ll go ask him to
give the jade pendant back.

175
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,940
Hua, listen to me this time.

176
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,220
Save your breath.

177
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,530
Running for my life without my family

178
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,370
is something I’ll never do.

179
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,940
Never.

180
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,050
Hua…

181
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,460
Honey,

182
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,530
listen, there’s no hurry.

183
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,890
No hurry at all.

184
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,650
The imperial examination
is still a long time away,

185
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,290
right?

186
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,500
We don’t have to fight

187
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,620
for such a trivial thing, right?

188
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,890
Hua, go,

189
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,500
go have some tea outside, come on.

190
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,220
Honey, calm down, please.

191
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,860
That’s weird.

192
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,890
It’s not long since he came,

193
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,580
how come the whole Daye knows it?

194
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,290
Ban Heng!

195
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,130
I…

196
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,530
Is it you? Come back!

197
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,890
Stop!

198
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,500
Hua! Hua! No!

199
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,130
My chicken!

200
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,050
Say it!

201
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,290
Hua, I sent Zhou Changxiao

202
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,050
and the others to propaganda

203
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,530
about Shen Yu’s proposal to you

204
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,700
for your own sake!

205
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,890
For my sake?

206
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,370
Reason it out now

207
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,370
and I might award you a chicken butt.

208
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,500
Think about it.

209
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,220
After Count Cheng’an knows about it,

210
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,530
he’ll get nervous.

211
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,740
And since he’s nervous,

212
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,100
he’ll come out and confess to you.

213
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,410
When did you become his little brother?

214
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,220
He’s so hypocritical

215
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,580
that he pretended sickness
to avoid seeing me.

216
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,860
It’s not like that, Hua.

217
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,980
I’m no one else’s

218
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,130
little brother except yours.

219
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
In my opinion,

220
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,340
that day you went skating,

221
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,460
Count Cheng’an has fallen for you.

222
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,820
It’s just that he thinks
he’s not good enough for you,

223
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,460
that’s why he pretended sickness.

224
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,940
Is that so?

225
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,740
It must be like that.

226
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,100
Count Cheng’an must be

227
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,740
so anxious that he can’t sleep

228
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,220
and eat well now.

229
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,890
He’ll act soon.

230
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,130
Nonsense!

231
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,770
You must have read too many novels!

232
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,500
No, Hua.

233
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,220
This is

234
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,340
<i>Naughty Princess and Her Cute Husband</i>
the most popular novel in the capital,

235
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,700
<i>Naughty Princess and Her Cute Husband</i>
Naughty Princess and Her Cute Husband.

236
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,280
<i>Naughty Princess and Her Cute Husband</i>

237
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,700
This is pretty bold.

238
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,740
I’ll take it.

239
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,410
I’ll go have a thorough study.

240
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,220
Hua, my chicken!

241
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,250
Young Master,

242
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,740
it looks like the Ban family

243
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
has given Shen Yu a gentle refusal.

244
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,770
What gentle refusal?

245
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,340
So many scholars are going to
participate the imperial examination.

246
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,580
How could he make the top three easily?

247
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,980
I think that’s a firm no.

248
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,050
That depends on fate.

249
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,010
Mr. Shen,

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,170
please make the top three.

251
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,860
Don’t let the good fate down.

252
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,770
He needs to succeed first.

253
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
Mr. Shen,

254
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,340
this is truly good stuff!

255
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,130
Where did you get it?

256
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,940
You have sharp eyes.

257
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,170
Marquis Jingting gave it to me
as a token.

258
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,700
He has promised
to marry her daughter to me.

259
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,460
Mr. Shen,

260
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,410
as a scholar,
you shouldn’t drink so much.

261
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,290
What are you saying? Not at all.

262
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,580
Don’t worry,

263
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,460
after marrying Baroness,

264
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,290
I’ll find you

265
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,530
a good girl from a noble family.

266
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,700
I should thank you in advance then.

267
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,290
However,

268
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,010
it must be valuable,

269
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,530
and you are showing it to everyone,

270
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,340
aren’t you afraid of thieves?

271
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,890
I know.

272
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,770
But if I hid it up,

273
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,890
no one would know I’m marrying her.

274
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,700
You can wear it on your neck,
it’d be more showy.

275
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,650
On my neck?

276
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,370
You are right!

277
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,370
Like this. Is it cool?

278
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,820
Yes.

279
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,940
Cool. Perfect.

280
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,410
Oh, Zhang,

281
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,410
you are my man from now on.

282
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,050
OK.

283
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,290
Baroness, please give me another chance.

284
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,410
Please leave, Sir.

285
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,770
Baroness Ban doesn’t exist anymore.

286
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,620
My Buddhist name is Miaokong.

287
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,620
No way!

288
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,010
Now that you are a nun,

289
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,890
I’ll become a monk!

290
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,220
Let’s serve the Buddha together!

291
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,290
Amitabha.

292
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,050
Be a nun?

293
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,980
What are you thinking?

294
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,740
I can’t live without eating meat!

295
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,620
Pass.

296
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,860
Darling, what’s wrong with you?

297
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,650
Please keep away.

298
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,650
I’m infected with plague.

299
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,290
I’m afraid I can only pay you back

300
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,770
in my next life.

301
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,940
Darling, you…

302
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,940
Darling!

303
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,580
Let me die together with you!

304
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,890
No, no.

305
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,290
No way!

306
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,500
Mr. Shen loves you so deeply.

307
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,100
Why don’t you just say yes to him?

308
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,220
No way.

309
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,250
You forgot Count Cheng’an.

310
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,940
What does it have to do
with that shabby scholar?

311
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,170
But…

312
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,580
Baroness, why don’t you admit it?

313
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,460
Days ago,

314
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,580
who invited Count Cheng’an
to go skating together?

315
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,410
That’s just a task, I was faking it.

316
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,050
If you were really acting
in those emotional moments,

317
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,250
you’d make a good actress.

318
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,340
Are you looking for trouble?

319
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,500
This thing with Shen Yu can’t be

320
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,580
dragged on like this.

321
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,250
Maybe

322
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,010
I should go talk to him

323
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,010
and make everything clear.

324
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,170
I can’t let him

325
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,770
block my other way.

326
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,700
Her other way is…

327
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,130
Of course the way to Count Cheng’an.

328
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,580
But that way is never blocked.

329
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,940
Forget it.

330
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,500
Baroness?

331
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,050
Baroness, I’m from a poor family.

332
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,220
This is the best thing
I can give you as a token.

333
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,010
This is drawn by me.

334
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,100
This garden in it

335
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,900
represents my dream.

336
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,810
Once I make the top three,

337
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,050
I’ll purchase a house with such a garden

338
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,610
to be our home.

339
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,010
Believe me, I’ll never let you suffer.

340
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,980
Mr. Shen,

341
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,850
I’m here today to take back

342
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,570
my parents’ words.

343
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,530
I won’t marry you.

344
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,460
To be honest,

345
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,500
I don’t want to be married now.

346
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,740
Then may I ask

347
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,980
why don’t you want to be married?

348
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,380
My family went through
something earlier,

349
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,050
which taught me to cherish them.

350
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,570
So for now,

351
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,850
I just want to be with my family.

352
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,250
Your concern is no problem at all.

353
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,500
I came to the capital all alone

354
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,570
with no relative here.

355
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,290
If you don’t mind,

356
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,530
I can marry into your family

357
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,050
and live with you in Ban’s Mansion.

358
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,250
You can stay with your family.

359
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,250
I’m born willful
and am not ready to get married.

360
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,610
You can be willful as long as you want.

361
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,660
I won’t be against it.

362
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,330
The wedding date will be up to you.

363
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,810
I’ll never be married.

364
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,180
Then neither will I.

365
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,900
I’ll stay with you forever.

366
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,220
You…

367
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,940
Why do you have to be like this?

368
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,770
Because you are worth it.

369
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,980
Because you

370
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,220
are a person who’s worth waiting.

371
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,850
That’s right though.

372
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,420
I remember the things you said

373
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,850
that day in the restaurant.

374
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,770
“It’s OK to be looked down upon,

375
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,900
but you can’t look down upon yourself.”

376
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,460
Why did I say that nonsense?

377
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,250
What should I do?

378
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,980
Baroness.

379
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,850
This is hard.

380
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,320
<i>Shi’s Mansion</i>

381
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,770
Feixian.

382
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,850
Grandpa, please have some tea.

383
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,570
OK.

384
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,980
Master, Mr. Shen is here.

385
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,570
Yes.

386
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,610
Greetings, Sir.

387
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,050
<i>Minister Shi, Prime Minister</i>
Mr. Shen,

388
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,940
<i>Minister Shi, Prime Minister</i>

389
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,140
<i>Main Official of Three Dynasties</i>
how is the thing going?

390
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,380
Sir, it’s all going as planned.

391
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,050
The Ban Family did not suspect anything.

392
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,220
I’ve been to Ban’s Mansion

393
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,010
and searched for several times,

394
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,770
but I haven’t found the tiger tally yet.

395
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,700
The only place I didn’t search

396
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,530
is Ban Hua’s room.

397
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,330
Princess Royal
loves Ban Hua very much.

398
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,850
Maybe it’s really in her room.

399
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,810
But Ban Hua’s room is in the backyard.

400
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,050
It’s really difficult for me
to get in there.

401
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,010
It’s OK, no hurry.

402
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,220
After you make the top three

403
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,380
and marry Ban Hua,

404
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,810
you’ll be free to be in there naturally.

405
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,090
If you can find the tiger tally then,

406
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
it would be a great merit.

407
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,660
I’ll ask His Majesty

408
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,180
to give you a major promotion.

409
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,290
Thank you, Sir,

410
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,940
for giving me such a valuable chance.

411
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,420
Please be assured that

412
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,940
I’ll spare no effort

413
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,180
to do whatever you need me to do.

414
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,090
Mr. Shen is a talented fine young man.

415
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,180
You’ll make the top three for sure.

416
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,660
I’ve talked to those who can help.

417
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,610
The first place is right
in front of you.

418
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,770
Thank you, Sir.

419
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,940
Get up, please.

420
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,010
I promise

421
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,140
I’ll find the tiger tally for sure.

422
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,850
Good.

423
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,010
The imperial examination begins.

424
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,090
Your Majesty,

425
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,660
this is the list of the top three.

426
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,900
Please have a look.

427
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,960
<i>Shen Yu, Zhang Qin, Li Jinzhong</i>

428
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,010
Your Majesty, there’s rumor
in the capital says that

429
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,660
once Shen Yu makes the top three,

430
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,610
he’ll marry Baroness Ban.

431
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,570
Baroness Ban marrying
a top three scholar,

432
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,570
that must be a perfect match

433
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,200
<i>Shen Yu, Zhang Qin, Li Jinzhong</i>

434
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,700
Where’s Shen Yu?

435
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,330
Your Majesty.

436
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,530
You may rise.

437
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

438
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,900
Walk a few steps for me.

439
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,500
What do you think

440
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,380
of this Shen Yu in comparison with

441
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,700
Xie Qilin?

442
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,570
Well…

443
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,740
What do you think, Your Majesty?

444
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,660
You are really useless.

445
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,010
All right. You can stop.

446
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

447
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,640
<i>Shen Yu, Zhang Qin, Li Jinzhong</i>

448
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,660
Shen Yu made it!

449
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,010
He made it?

450
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,660
Yes, let’s tell Young Master
and figure out a plan.

451
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,940
What plan?

452
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,380
I’ll go prepare a gift

453
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,660
to congratulate Baroness Ban.

454
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,330
Why are you so excited about it?

455
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,610
Shen Yu has taken
a big hit for our Young Master.

456
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,250
I hear you.

457
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,810
Young Master,

458
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,610
Mr. Du kept me from going in.

459
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,610
Mr. Shen!

460
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,700
Mr. Shen!

461
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,500
Thank you, guys!

462
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,900
Thank you for waiting.

463
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,940
Congratulations, Mr. Shen!

464
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,420
Sir! Thank you for coming!

465
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,250
Congratulations!

466
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,570
Thank you.

467
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,220
Let’s congratulate Mr. Shen...

468
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,420
Mr. Shen is really amazing.

469
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,290
He really made it?

470
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,740
Of course!

471
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,810
on making the third place!

472
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,050
Thank you for your help.

473
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,900
I’ll let you know my gratitude.

474
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,810
Mr. Shen, you are too kind.

475
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,850
I wouldn’t dare neglect

476
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,380
Baroness Ban’s orders.

477
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,050
Ladies and gentlemen,

478
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,900
I almost forgot.

479
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,180
There’s another great news for Mr. Shen.

480
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,770
What great news?

481
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,180
Not only did he make the third place,

482
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,010
he’s also engaged to Baroness Ban.

483
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,530
That’s not worth mentioning.

484
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,500
That’s great.

485
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,330
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

486
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,660
I once misunderstood it.

487
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,460
I thought the one

488
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,290
Baroness Ban liked was Count Cheng’an.

489
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,740
What are you saying?

490
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,980
This is a big day for Mr. Shen.

491
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,940
Watch what you are saying.

492
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,980
It’s OK. It’s OK.

493
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,090
All bills in this restaurant
are on me today.

494
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,330
Please come in and enjoy a nice meal.

495
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,810
-Yeah, come in, please.
-Enjoy yourselves.

496
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,250
Nice! Bravo!

497
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,250
That’s great!

498
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:25,980
Mr. Shen,

499
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,570
should I charge the money to

500
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,220
Baroness Ban’s account or yours?

501
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,380
Do you even have to ask that question?

502
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,460
Hers are mine.

503
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,420
And mine are hers.

504
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,940
Does that make any difference?

505
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,740
Good. Good. OK.

506
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,130
I’ll go prepare everything.

507
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,280
Go ahead, go.

508
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,810
Young Master,

509
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,940
The Third Scholar Shen Yu is here.

510
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,700
He sure knows who he should meet first.

511
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,180
Mr. Shen, have some tea, please.

512
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,530
Thank you, Your Grace.

513
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,290
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

514
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,460
How should I help you today?

515
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,740
I hear that Your Grace
is the best gentleman in the world,

516
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,010
a role model for all scholars,

517
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,740
and His Majesty’s great helping hand.

518
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,250
I luckily made the third place
in the imperial examination.

519
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,290
So I’ve come to learn
how to be an official,

520
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,570
and I also hope that in the future,

521
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,810
Your Grace can help me in the court.

522
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,770
Looks like he’s not a nerd.

523
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,250
He’s pretty smart
for coming to the right guy.

524
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,180
You flattered me, Mr. Shen.

525
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,290
There’s no secret in being an official.

526
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,090
We just need to be loyal
and love the people.

527
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,050
That’s all.

528
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,850
As for the best gentleman stuff,

529
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,050
that’s just an undeserved praise.

530
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,220
You are so modest, Your Grace.

531
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
You deserve your reputation.

532
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,570
And

533
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,460
I need to thank you for another thing.

534
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,140
I don’t think we ever
met each other before.

535
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,290
What are you thanking me for?

536
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,290
I hear that you helped
Marquis Jingting once.

537
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,220
After marrying Baroness Ban,

538
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,740
I’ll repay you for your kindness.

539
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,610
That’s not worth mentioning.

540
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,330
Moreover, it’s between me
and Marquis Jingting,

541
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,900
you don’t need to thank me.

542
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
From now on,

543
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,740
her problem is also my problem.

544
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,900
Baroness was trying to reject
my proposal at first,

545
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,770
but after hearing my sincere confession,

546
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,660
she was deeply moved

547
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,660
and said yes to me.

548
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,850
This jade pendant

549
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,940
is the token Ban Family gave me.

550
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,420
Congratulations on winning
the heart of a fine lady then.

551
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,330
When is the big day?

552
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,530
Well... I just finished my examination,

553
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,010
so we haven’t talked about that yet.

554
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,900
Just tell me if you need anything.

555
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,290
Thank you in advance then.

556
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,740
Sorry for the trouble.
It’s time to go now.

557
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,610
OK. Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

558
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,050
See you around.

559
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,900
I’ll come back to visit another time.

560
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,420
Young Master,

561
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,500
Shen Yu came right after
he made the top three.

562
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,700
He must be here to show off.

563
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,500
He’s so arrogant

564
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,420
and scheming, not a decent person.

565
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,420
Look into this Shen Yu thoroughly.

566
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,700
Consider it done.

567
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,010
I’ll look into every detail about him.

568
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,530
He can never diminish you.

569
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Hua, it’s dinner time.

570
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,660
Eat first.

571
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,380
Yeah.

572
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,220
Eating nothing can’t solve the problem.

573
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,980
Eat, eat, eat. You know nothing
but eating and having fun.

574
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,010
That’s what our family is good at.

575
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,180
Heng is right.

576
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,900
Hua, let me ask you.

577
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,090
You don’t like that Shen Yu

578
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,700
even a little bit, do you?

579
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,710
No.

580
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,900
Why did you take his painting
as a token then?

581
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,770
That was...

582
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
I couldn’t reject it.

583
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,180
So I could just take it for that moment.

584
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,500
There is nothing wrong

585
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,500
with Shen Yu.

586
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,900
He’s just too compliant.

587
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,810
That’s boring.

588
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,770
That’s all because of Count Cheng’an.

589
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,660
Wasn’t she talking about Shen Yu?

590
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,980
What does it have to do
with Count Cheng’an?

591
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,770
Moreover,

592
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,380
I think Shen Yu is a little weird.

593
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,740
How?

594
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,810
Mr. Shen?

595
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,610
I...

596
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,850
What are you doing here?

597
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,290
Nature’s call.

598
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,660
Toilet is on the other side.

599
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,380
Ban’s Mansion is too big

600
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,740
that I’m lost in it.

601
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,140
Where is the toilet? Where is it?

602
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,810
Toilet! Toilet!

603
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,420
Mr. Shen.

604
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,500
Why are you leaning on the door?

605
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,770
Anyway,

606
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,010
those two cases

607
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,570
are not that weird, right?

608
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,380
That doesn’t mean

609
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,220
he has some intentions.

610
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,900
Yeah, what intentions could he have?

611
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,010
After marrying Hua,

612
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,220
all that we have will be his.

613
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,570
What do you mean all that we have?

614
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,010
I own at least half of it, don’t I?

615
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,810
You good for nothing.

616
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,700
Stop talking, please.

617
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,940
Hua,

618
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,980
don’t say I don’t care about you.

619
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,010
I’ve figured out a way for you

620
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,570
to test that Shen Yu.

621
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,290
I promise,

622
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,660
this will be solved in three days.

623
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,220
You? Go play.

624
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,090
Yeah, after this meal.

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,220
This is a nice spot.

679
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,290
Mr. Shen.

680
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,460
Mr. Shen, please.

681
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,090
Dishes are all served.

682
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,210
Please sit.

683
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,170
I should say thank you then.

684
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,010
It’s my honor to drink with Mr. Shen.

685
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,380
Mr. Shen. It’s really Mr. Shen.

686
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,860
Mr. Shen.

687
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,730
Mr. Shen, you are really courageous.

688
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,550
You even dared to ask

689
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,890
<i>Zhou Changxiao, Playboy in Daye</i>
Baroness Ban to marry you.

690
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,170
<i>Zhou Changxiao, Playboy in Daye</i>
Come on, let’s drink to that.

691
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,650
I’m sincere to Baroness.

692
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,010
It shouldn’t be called courageous.

693
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,010
Mr. Shen is not a local,

694
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,340
so you don’t know.

695
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,780
Before you,

696
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,460
Baroness Ban has been
engaged to two men.

697
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,610
One was drowned, the other became blind.

698
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,650
In the whole capital,

699
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,860
you are the only one
who dares to propose to her.

700
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,210
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Shen
just became The Third Scholar,

701
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,260
why are you bringing
that kind of unpleasant thing up?

702
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,420
It’s my fault, my fault.

703
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,090
This is my apology.

704
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
Here, please, Mr. Shen.

705
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,010
Eat more while you still can.

706
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,820
Why are you speaking ill of Baroness

707
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,130
and trying to ruin her reputation?

708
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,050
Her reputation?

709
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,300
That’s already hit the rock bottom.

710
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,260
That’s right.

711
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,860
It’s hard to ruin something
that’s at the rock bottom.

712
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,050
Mr. Shen, in my opinion,

713
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,010
you should call off the engagement.

714
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,610
I, Shen Yu, am a decent man!

715
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,780
I’m not a faithless person like you.

716
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,380
-Mr. Shen!
-Mr. Shen!

717
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,220
Mr. Shen!

718
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,010
Mr. Shen!

719
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,980
Come on!

720
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,980
Come on!

721
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,300
Quickly!

722
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,210
This is yours. Mister.

723
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,210
Well...

724
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,820
Mr. Zhou, you are also doing
this kind of job?

725
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,980
Don’t mention it.

726
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,650
I just lost a big amount on cockfight.

727
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,460
Just give me the money.

728
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,610
Tell me, what other tricks do you have?

729
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,940
Baroness, Count Cheng’an is here.

730
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,010
What did I say?

731
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,940
Count Cheng’an has become nervous.

732
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,570
I’ll go open the door.

733
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,300
Wait a minute.

734
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,460
He pretended sickness
to avoid seeing me.

735
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,980
Why should I see him?

736
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,090
Don’t open the door for him.

737
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,420
Then I’ll go lock the door.

738
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,460
Wait.

739
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,980
So you do want to see him.

740
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,050
No, I don’t.

741
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,610
So you do want to see him
but you also don’t?

742
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,210
Please.

743
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,130
My sister has been busy
preparing for her wedding.

744
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,820
If you have feelings for her,

745
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,340
just win her over

746
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,050
and don’t miss the chance.

747
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,690
I bet you’ll win.

748
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,500
Baroness, what happened earlier
was my fault.

749
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,940
Please forgive me.

750
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,170
I have come today

751
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,820
to say something to you.

752
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,650
After a thorough investigation,

753
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,300
I’m sure Shen Yu is not decent
and you can’t marry him.

754
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,530
I agree with that.

755
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,690
Why?

756
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,170
My sister doesn’t want to
marry him at all.

757
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,130
Why should she pretend it?

758
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,780
Your Grace,

759
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,300
you didn’t know Shen Yu at all,

760
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,500
how did you know he’s not a decent man?

761
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,300
Please show me your evidence,

762
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,090
or

763
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,460
I’ll have to suspect that

764
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,090
you are trying to ruin my engagement.

765
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,130
Young Master.

766
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,860
You were really right!

767
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,050
Shen Yu is really working for
Prime Minister Shi.

768
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,690
Really?

769
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,940
Shen Yu once entered
Shi’s Mansion at midnight.

770
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,500
But before he came into the capital,

771
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,900
he had no contact with the Shi Family.

772
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,170
Their first contact

773
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,610
was after Baroness Ban helped him
at the Inn.

774
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
Such a coincidence.

775
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,130
There must be some secret behind it.

776
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,260
We don’t know what they are plotting.

777
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,820
Baroness, Shen Yu is not decent.

778
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,980
Please think twice.

779
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,170
Marrying him or not is my business.

780
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,460
It’s none of your concern.

781
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,730
Baroness...

782
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,980
Anyway,

783
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,570
even if you are right,

784
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,610
even if he’s not sincere,

785
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,500
even if I’m fooled and marry him,

786
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,050
what does it have to do with you?

787
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,730
I...

788
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,090
What is he thinking?

789
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,860
Just tell her you love her

790
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,050
and save us all the trouble.

791
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,380
Young Master, don’t say that.

792
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,340
If Count can’t bring out evidence,

793
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,010
maybe you should leave.

794
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,300
You can’t even answer that?

795
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,010
Tell her you love her,
you don’t want her to be fooled

796
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,980
and you don’t want to miss true love!

797
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,340
Young Master,

798
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,380
why are you even
more anxious than those two?

799
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,260
Young Master, if we can’t stop them,

800
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,500
maybe we should just congratulate them.

801
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,380
No way.

802
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,650
I believe that

803
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,730
if Shen Yu and Baroness Ban
really get married,

804
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,300
it’ll be harder for us
to approach Princess Royal.

805
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,050
Even if they get married,

806
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,130
we can figure out another way.

807
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,690
Young Master, Please think about it.

808
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,010
No need.

809
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,530
She can’t marry him.

810
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,170
She is our own chance
to approach the Ban Family.

811
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,300
Du Jiu, come with me
to the Qionglin Banquet tomorrow.

812
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,210
Greetings, Your Majesty!

813
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,300
You may all rise.

814
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

815
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,300
The Top Scholar, Zhang Qin.

816
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,420
Your Majesty.

817
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,260
You have made the top three

818
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,460
and is conferred on Director
of Ministry of Personnel.

819
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

820
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,690
The Second Scholar, Li Jinzhong.

821
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,860
Your Majesty.

822
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,900
You have made the top three

823
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,940
and is conferred on Director
of Ministry of Revenue.

824
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,210
Thank you, Your Majesty.

825
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,980
The Third Scholar, Shen Yu.

826
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,090
Your Majesty.

827
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,730
You have made the top three

828
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,530
and is conferred on Deputy Director
of Ministry of Personnel.

829
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,820
It’s much lower than those two.

830
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,650
He must have offended His Majesty.

831
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,460
That’s because he’s going to
marry Ban’s daughter.

832
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,050
What are you talking about?

833
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,420
Shen Yu, what are you waiting for?

834
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,050
Thank... Thank you, Your Majesty.

835
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,650
You should try your best
to serve our Daye.

836
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,380
Ask Count Cheng’an
if you have any confusion.

837
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,380
I have prepared you a banquet.

838
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,260
Please enjoy yourselves.

839
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

840
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,500
Brother Rong, it’s been so long.

841
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,420
Nice to see you, Count Cheng’an.

842
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,460
Young ladies, you can pick
any young man you favor.

843
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,860
Miss, here.

844
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,980
Mr. Shen?

845
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,130
You have an engagement
with Baroness Ban.

846
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,980
I can’t take your fan.

847
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,170
This fan

848
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,650
represents freemasonry.

849
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,570
At a banquet like this one,

850
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,050
no one should be neglected.

851
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,650
Please take it.

852
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,530
Thank you.

853
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,010
Mr. Shen.

854
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,010
This is for you.

855
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,340
Please take it.

856
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,090
Only if love could be

857
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,500
so simple.

858
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,010
Thank you.

859
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,300
Young Master, Shen Yu
does have a problem.

860
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,010
He has a fiancée in his hometown.

861
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,650
Even his travelling expenses

862
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,730
to the capital was from his fiancée,

863
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,500
Ms. Wang.

864
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,460
Wang Qu,

865
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,460
bring that Ms. Wang to the capital now.

866
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,380
Yes!

867
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,010
Rocky!

868
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:48,860
This is how you do your job?

869
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,650
Don’t we have gates out there?

870
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,860
You are allowing everybody in?

871
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,940
I’m sorry, but it’s an emergency.

872
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,090
What?

873
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,170
What kind of emergency?

874
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,980
Come here.

875
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,780
I have found the evidence.

876
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,610
This woman

877
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,900
is Shen Yu’s fiancée
in his hometown, Ms. Wang.

878
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,780
Shen Yu! How dare you!
