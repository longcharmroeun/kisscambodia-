<i>Episode 6</i>

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,650
What...

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,930
What’s so urgent?

38
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,620
Come on.

39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,500
I’ve found the evidence.

40
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,580
She is Wang who has been
engaged with Shen Yu.

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,340
Shen Yu, you bastard!

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,210
How will you explain about this?

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,060
This is going to be interesting.

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,860
Go and take a look at the fan.

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,500
Okay.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,020
Which one do you like, Miss Li?

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,460
None of them

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,860
is better than the one

49
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,180
you gave me.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,970
I didn’t expect you
to carry it with you.

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,060
It was a gift from you,

52
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,810
of course I would carry it with me.

53
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,690
Shen Yu!

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,060
Baroness, don’t get me wrong.

55
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,860
This fan was just a casual gift

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,580
I gave her at the banquet yesterday.

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,780
It doesn’t mean anything.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,930
Who cares about your fan?

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,690
Right now,

60
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,300
you are still talking about the fan.

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,020
I think you are just a social climber

62
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,370
and a fickle scumbag!

63
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,580
Baroness Ban, that’s not true.

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,810
You and Shen Yu
are not officially married.

65
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,970
Strictly speaking,

66
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,900
you two don’t have
any relationship now.

67
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,900
What’s wrong with me
taking this fan?

68
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,020
Who are you?

69
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,900
You don’t have a say here.

70
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,370
This fan is a gift for me.

71
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,580
Of course it concerns me!

72
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,860
You can’t be thinking

73
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,460
that I’m jealous of you.

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,210
That’s ridiculous.

75
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,130
You are no match for me.

76
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,780
You...!

77
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,690
What do you mean?

78
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,810
I mean you don’t have a say here..

79
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,970
Just get out of here.

80
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,810
Miss Li! Miss Li! Miss Li!

81
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,430
It’s my fault.

82
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,480
-Shen Yu.
-It’s my fault.

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,780
I brought her here.

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,250
What else do you have to say?

85
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,250
Who is this person?

86
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,660
You don’t know her?

87
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,890
Let me make an introduction.

88
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,690
This girl’s surname is Wang.

89
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,010
She is from your homeland.

90
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,420
She knows you since childhood.

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,890
Now you should know who she is.

92
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,420
What do you mean, Baroness Ban?

93
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,660
I don’t understand.

94
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,690
I really don’t know this person.

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,250
Shen Yu!

96
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,450
Damn you, a betrayer!

97
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,420
Who raised the money for you
to take the examination in the capital?

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,100
I thought

99
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,860
that if I served your parents for you,

100
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,620
you would take me to the capital
when you returned home with high honors.

101
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,500
But now you ranked third

102
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,500
in the examination
and you just abandoned me!

103
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,010
I...

104
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,770
You are an unfaithful betrayer!

105
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,300
Shen Yu, you are
cruel and unscrupulous!

106
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,660
What else do you want to say?

107
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,890
She... She is not Wang at all!

108
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,450
Baroness, let me explain.

109
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,810
There was a Wang who aided me
to take the examination in the capital.

110
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,570
But we didn’t get married.

111
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,010
And... That was just the order
of my parents,

112
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,980
and the words of the matchmaker.

113
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,660
I don’t have any feelings for her.

114
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,330
You are the only one I love.

115
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,100
That’s her conspiracy.

116
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,890
Shen Yu, how can you say
you don’t know me?

117
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,250
I... Stop it!

118
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,860
Shen Yu.

119
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,220
You are still lying now.

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,500
I’m the only one you love?

121
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,010
You make me sick.

122
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,690
Baroness Ban, what do you want?

123
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,980
-Didn’t you hear it?
-Miss Li.

124
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,810
Miss Li.

125
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,130
He is a scumbag.

126
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,060
Man struggles upwards.

127
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,540
This means that Shen Yu is aspirant.

128
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,250
Aspirant?

129
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,300
I think you do

130
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,250
get carried away by him.

131
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,300
He is already engaged.

132
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,450
Do you want

133
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,180
to be his concubine?

134
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,100
I don’t!

135
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,930
Let me make you sober!

136
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,690
How dare you?

137
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,130
You dare to insult
an imperial officer in public!

138
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,500
You are holding His Majesty in contempt!

139
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,500
There is such a scumbag in Daye.

140
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,330
Today I’ll teach this scumbag a lesson

141
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,130
for His Majesty!

142
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,930
The Ban family treated you well.
We lent you books and gave you clothes.

143
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,370
But you deceived us.

144
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,250
This whipping is to ask you
where your conscience is!

145
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,450
Baroness Ban, listen to me.

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,620
Don’t hit me.

147
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,770
Let’s talk.

148
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,540
It will do no good to both of us

149
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,010
if you make a big scene out of it.

150
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,420
Really?

151
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,770
I’d like to see

152
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,330
who can do harm to me.

153
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,540
Baroness Ban, are you really crazy?

154
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,620
Count Cheng’an!

155
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,010
Just stop Baroness ban.

156
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,220
These two whippings are for Wang

157
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,740
to punish you,

158
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,250
an unfaithful and ungrateful man!

159
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,740
That’s enough! Stop!

160
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,100
You are right.

161
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,860
I am ungrateful.

162
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,300
I coveted your beauty!

163
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,500
That’s why I made a proposal!

164
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,890
Why?

165
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,130
Because except
for your good-looking face,

166
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,250
you have nothing left!

167
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,980
No, you still have money.

168
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,500
You are a totally

169
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,930
vulgar

170
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,130
and extravagant tigress!

171
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,860
You finally dare to admit it.

172
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,810
Yes, and I haven’t finished.

173
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,540
You are not only a tigress,

174
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,860
but also bring bad luck to your husband!

175
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,100
Do you forget

176
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,980
how Xie Qilin become blind?

177
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,420
You’re a tigress that brings
bad luck to your husband.

178
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,100
Today,

179
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,660
I am going to break off our engagement.

180
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,570
I am going to break off our engagement!

181
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,010
Damn you!

182
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,980
How dare you smash
my father’s jade pendant

183
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,420
and break off
the engagement with me?

184
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,980
You, break off the engagement?

185
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,010
I’m the one breaking off with you.

186
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,220
Go ahead. Do it.

187
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,620
Shen Yu.

188
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,420
If I don’t kill you today,

189
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,620
I won’t be a member
from the Ban family anymore!

190
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,570
Don’t hit me!

191
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,180
Help! She is murdering her husband!

192
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,420
She is murdering her husband! Help!

193
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,890
She is murdering her husband!

194
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,250
-She is murdering her husband!
-Baroness.

195
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,250
-Calm down.
-Help!

196
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,890
You don’t help me,

197
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,010
and you stop me
from teaching this bastard a lesson!

198
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,740
Mr. Shi, you just came in time.

199
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,860
Someone is going to be killed
if you come later!

200
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,820
Mr. Shi, Baroness Ban
tried to kill me in public.

201
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
Arrest her!

202
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,370
I...!

203
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:45,890
Baroness Ban.

204
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,890
Watch your mouth.

205
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,530
She whipped
an imperial officer in public.

206
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,460
Mr. Shi, are you going
to cover for Baroness Ban?

207
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,860
Shen Yu is right.

208
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,370
If you don’t take Baroness Ban
to the government today,

209
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,410
is there any justice in Daye?

210
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,340
Yeah! Is there any justice in Daye?

211
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,290
That’s right!

212
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,820
How can you say that?

213
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,500
You’re a betrayer!

214
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,220
Exactly.

215
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,820
Baroness Ban, it’s troublesome.

216
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,740
Please go back to the government
with me.

217
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,860
No!

218
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,370
If His Majesty wants
to hold someone accountable,

219
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,700
I will explain to him.

220
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,700
I’m the one who hit him.

221
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,740
I won’t let others be implicated!

222
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,290
Everyone knows

223
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,740
that Shen Yu cheated
on their engagement.

224
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,650
If anyone should be arrested,
shouldn’t it be Shen Yu?

225
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,410
No, Count.

226
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,530
That’s right. The betrayer
should be arrested!

227
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,940
Baroness Ban, well done.

228
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,980
See if he dares to be unfaithful again.

229
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,500
You...!

230
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,130
Exactly. Yeah.

231
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,770
Mr. Shi.

232
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,620
I will ask His Majesty
to judge what happened today.

233
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,890
Baroness, let’s go.

234
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,650
Mr. Shi!

235
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,940
Did you just let her go?

236
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,130
She left.

237
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,220
What a pity!

238
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,650
She should beat him to death.

239
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,340
Beat him to death.

240
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,410
Baroness Ban is so unlucky.

241
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,980
Why did she always meet bad men?

242
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,740
No, it’s not her fault.

243
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,170
All men are jackasses.

244
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,860
Yeah, they are all jackasses.

245
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,620
Jackasses.

246
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,410
Jackasses.

247
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,580
Baroness, let me

248
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,980
send you home.

249
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:40,820
No need.

250
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,170
I have feet and I know the way.

251
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,410
I just…

252
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,530
I just promised Mr. Shi

253
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,650
that I’d send you home safely.

254
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,620
If you escaped halfway,

255
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,940
it would be hard for me
to explain to Mr. Shi.

256
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,980
Why would I escape?

257
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,890
That’s ridiculous!

258
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,940
Since you are willing to be a groom,

259
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,980
you can lead the horse.

260
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,170
Actually, this is Shen Yu’s fault.

261
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,170
You don’t need to feel sad about this.

262
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,940
I’m not sad at all.

263
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,460
What’s more,

264
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,980
even if I’m sad, does it have anything
to do with you?

265
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,860
You broke my engagement
again and again.

266
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,740
What’s your intention?

267
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,860
Young Master.

268
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,010
When our people went to look

269
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,290
for Shen Yu’s fiancée,

270
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,460
she was already missing.

271
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,370
After we inquired many people,

272
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,340
we found that she was taken away
by the secret guards of the Shi family.

273
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,500
It seems

274
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,050
that Shen Yu

275
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,890
is indeed a pawn of Minister Shi.

276
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,220
What should we do next?

277
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,650
Should we tell the Ban family the truth?

278
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,700
No need.

279
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,250
It concerns His Majesty
and the Tiger Tally.

280
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,740
The less people know, the better.

281
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,130
Yes.

282
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,890
You can’t even answer
such a simple question.

283
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,290
Sure enough,

284
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,980
we have nothing to say.

285
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,530
I don’t have any ill intention.

286
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,340
I just care about you.

287
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,500
We are neither relatives nor friends.

288
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,050
You racked your brains

289
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,940
and made all these efforts
to care about me.

290
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,410
I can’t take

291
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,340
such care.

292
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,580
That’s too...

293
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,100
Do you really think I’m stupid?

294
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,580
The person you brought

295
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,650
is not Shen Yu’s fiancée at all!

296
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,370
So… You knew it all.

297
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,500
Then why did you...?

298
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,130
You got a fake one.

299
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,290
If Shen Yu was an honest person,

300
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,370
he wouldn’t fall for it.

301
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,370
But he admitted it.

302
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,940
That surprised me.

303
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,860
But you, Count Cheng’an.

304
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,770
What’s your

305
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
calculated plan for?

306
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,620
I want to know it now.

307
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,650
We have known each other
for a long time.

308
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,050
I have already taken you as…

309
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,580
As a friend.

310
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,820
What’s wrong with a friend
caring about another friend?

311
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,410
A friend?

312
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,370
That’s from a model for all scholars?

313
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,530
He is too bad at talking.

314
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,130
Exactly.

315
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,010
There is nothing wrong
with what Young Master said.

316
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,980
I don’t know if
there is anything wrong.

317
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,010
But I know

318
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,860
Baroness is going to snap.

319
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,130
Count Cheng’an.

320
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,820
What’s that explanation?

321
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,940
It’s obvious that you are
ruining my engagement.

322
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,890
Now you tell me

323
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,500
that you only take me as a friend!

324
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,650
Baroness, calm down.

325
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Let me explain.

326
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,250
I didn’t handle it properly about Wang.

327
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,770
But it was urgent.

328
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,770
Wang was taken away intentionally

329
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,100
by someone.

330
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,250
I had to take the risk.

331
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,460
I hope you can understand me.

332
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,500
You still lied to me!

333
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,410
And you’re worse than Shen Yu!

334
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,370
I was...

335
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,340
I was also thinking for you.

336
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,050
Or, did you want to marry Shen Yu

337
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,340
even he deceived you?

338
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,100
I’ll marry your whole family!

339
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,410
There is only me in my family!

340
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,580
Was that a swearing?

341
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,530
I don’t want to waste time
talking to you.

342
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,940
Let me ask you again.

343
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,100
Are you afraid of me being cheated

344
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,980
or me getting married?

345
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,860
Good question.

346
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,500
This is a deadly question.

347
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,010
It’s easy.

348
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,250
Of course he is afraid of her
being cheated.

349
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,220
Although I’m not that clever,

350
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,820
I’m sure this is not the right answer.

351
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,370
Exactly.

352
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,050
Forget it. I can’t get anything
from you.

353
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,130
I’d better ask the God.

354
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,890
Let’s go.

355
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,010
Are you made of wood?

356
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,620
She is talking about your Young Master.

357
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,010
Ban Heng!

358
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,340
Come and lead the horse!

359
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,220
Coming!

360
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,530
Let’s go.

361
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,100
Hua.

362
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,290
Be good.

363
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,620
Am I afraid of her being cheated

364
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,220
or her getting married?

365
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,580
Baroness Ban, in fact...

366
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,530
I don’t want to waste time
talking to you.

367
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Let me ask you again.

368
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,740
Are you afraid of me being cheated

369
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,530
or me getting married?

370
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,740
Young Master

371
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,700
has been reading this page
for more than two hours.

372
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,740
Woman

373
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,770
is the hardest book in the world.

374
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,130
Mr. Rong, hush up.

375
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,460
Young Master won’t
fall in love with Baroness Ban.

376
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,290
Jiu.

377
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,980
Feelings are not something
you can control.

378
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,650
Come on, open the door. Let me in.

379
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,370
Young Master, it’s cold now.

380
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,220
Have some ginseng tea.

381
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,650
I saw that you were lost in thought.

382
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,170
Do you have something on mind?

383
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,890
There is nothing.

384
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
That’s good.

385
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,250
If it wasn’t for your help,

386
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,980
Baroness Ban would be
deceived by Shen Yu,

387
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,890
and it would be hard for you
to meet again.

388
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,530
Young Master.

389
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,860
I get along well with that kid.

390
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,460
Why don’t you find some time

391
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,290
to invite her here for dinner?

392
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,130
No need.

393
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,050
I don’t think Baroness Ban

394
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,050
will come here again.

395
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,460
That’s outrageous!

396
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,250
I’ve been planning this for so long!

397
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,770
Now it was all ruined
by a few whippings of Baroness Ban?

398
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,890
That Shen Yu

399
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,410
is indeed good for nothing!

400
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,500
It’s my fault for not
keeping an eye on him.

401
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,330
He is still from the countryside.

402
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,220
He doesn’t know how important it is.

403
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,180
Never mind.

404
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,570
Now we’ve lost Shen Yu as our contact.

405
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,980
How to look for the Tiger Tally now?

406
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,610
Do you have any idea?

407
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,850
It’s too important. We need
to give it further thought.

408
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,980
His Majesty has lost his patience!

409
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,140
Sir.

410
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,700
Why don’t you tell on the Ban family

411
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,700
to His Majesty in court tomorrow

412
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,980
about Baroness Ban
whipping Shen Yu in public?

413
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,530
Shen Yu cheated on her first.

414
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,610
It’s understandable that Baroness Ban

415
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,090
was mad at him and taught him a lesson.

416
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,380
Let’s not do such things.

417
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Young Master, you’re back.

418
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,740
Jin has a point.

419
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,220
Mr. Wu.

420
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Things like kicking a person
when he is down,

421
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,090
someone else will do it.

422
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,810
Let’s just wait and see.

423
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,530
Mr. Sun.

424
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,500
The memorial to the throne you wrote
is not profound enough.

425
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,220
His Majesty won’t feel like
he is on the scene

426
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
after he hears it.

427
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,090
And he won’t feel the anger about
Baroness Ban holding him in contempt

428
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,050
and whipping an imperial officer
in public.

429
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
You should change it.

430
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,980
All right.

431
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,140
Make it more profound.

432
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:28,940
Okay.

433
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,530
Mr. Li.

434
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,090
Yeah.

435
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,980
Your memorial to the throne
is not sensational enough.

436
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,250
It’s too dull.

437
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,810
It sounds like it has
nothing to do with you.

438
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,250
Well, imagine

439
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,660
that your son was beaten half to death.

440
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,660
Now he is lying in bed.

441
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,460
You are going to write
a memorial to the throne to His Majesty

442
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,010
to seek justice for your son.

443
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,220
You must write it in a tearful tone.

444
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,380
That makes it profound and sensational.

445
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,740
But, Your Grace, I...

446
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,090
I don’t have a son. Do you forget it?

447
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,290
It’s not a problem
that you don’t have a son.

448
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,050
Do you have parents?

449
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,570
Just imagine that happening
to your parents!

450
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,420
Yeah.

451
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,530
I’ll try my best.

452
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,660
Mr. Song.

453
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,740
Yours should be perfect, right?

454
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,460
Mr. Song.

455
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,140
I remember

456
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,460
you were among the top ten talents
in the imperial examination.

457
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,420
Yeah.

458
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,180
Why are there so many wrong words

459
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,010
in such a short memorial to the throne?

460
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,900
Seems like

461
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,500
the rumor that Mr. Song
bought a position for himself

462
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,740
is not groundless.

463
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,010
Yeah.

464
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,610
Your Grace, why don’t you show us

465
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,980
how to write it
in a profound and sensational way,

466
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,220
and strike a blow at the Ban family?

467
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,530
Yeah.

468
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,630
Okay!

469
00:19:51,640 --> 00:20:01,680
<i>Memorial to the throne Please punish
Baroness Ban for whipping people</i>

470
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,660
It’s excellent.

471
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,250
Your Grace is good at writing.

472
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,740
Your words are fascinating.

473
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,290
More than that.

474
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,660
Your Grace explained
the profound truth in simple language.

475
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,700
I’m so inferior to you.

476
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,900
We are all depending on you.

477
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,140
When you make a move,
we are all lost in admiration.

478
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,090
Yeah, exactly.

479
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,010
You are excellent.

480
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,500
Well, Mr. Song,

481
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,180
your skill of flattering

482
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,660
is much better than your writing.

483
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,660
Everyone.

484
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,090
I’ll rely on you

485
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,740
to solve our Xie family’s issue
with the Ban family.

486
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,610
We are here for you.

487
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,500
You must help
our Xie family get justice.

488
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,770
Sure.

489
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,330
My daughter was just

490
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,700
engaged to the Second Prince.

491
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,940
There are many things I need to prepare.

492
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,740
Your Grace, you are so polite.

493
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,770
Now the wedding of
the Second Prince and your daughter

494
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,610
is the most important thing.

495
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,980
Don’t worry about the Ban family.

496
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,380
Just leave it to us.

497
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,250
Yeah.

498
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,980
After your daughter
marries into the royal family,

499
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,500
we hope Your Grace can help us.

500
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,330
Yes, thank you, Your Grace.

501
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,330
Why are these memorials to the throne
all telling on Hua?

502
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,900
What do the commoners think?

503
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,010
Your Majesty.

504
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,980
There are different opinions.

505
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,530
But most people
sympathize with Baroness Ban.

506
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,660
After all, Shen Yu cheated on her first.

507
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,380
Your Majesty.

508
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,530
Ban Hua was made
a baroness by Your Majesty.

509
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,050
She received a lot of your grace.

510
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,420
She is not grateful,

511
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,810
instead, she whipped an imperial officer

512
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,290
made by Your Majesty

513
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,500
in public.

514
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,810
The people out there all think...

515
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
Think what?

516
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,700
You Majesty, I dare not say.

517
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,290
Go ahead, I won’t punish you.

518
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,500
They think that Daye

519
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,220
is ruled by the Ban family now.

520
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,220
Mr. Song, you can drink alcohol
as you want,

521
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,090
but you can’t talk nonsense!

522
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,090
That’s just how the commoners
think about it.

523
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,810
Why are you nervous about it?

524
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,180
Count Xie is right.

525
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,010
Your Majesty.

526
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,530
Please stop the spread
of rumors outside.

527
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,500
That’s ridiculous.

528
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,570
Your Majesty.

529
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,330
This is not the only trouble
Ban Hua made.

530
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,980
If you keep tolerating her,

531
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,770
your prestige will be lost.

532
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,940
Your Majesty.

533
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,330
In my opinion,

534
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,290
it was not that Baroness Ban
whipped an imperial officer.

535
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,330
It was a woman who was cheated
beating a ruthless man.

536
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,090
Shen Yu was engaged before.

537
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,140
But he coveted the wealth
of the Ban family.

538
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,740
He abandoned his dutiful wife

539
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,050
and tried to marry Baroness Ban.

540
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,660
From this point of view,

541
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,050
he is an immoral person.

542
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,220
Baroness Ban did nothing wrong.

543
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,900
Count Cheng’an tried to excuse her
with fancy words.

544
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,330
But it can’t change the fact

545
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,330
that Ban Hua whipped
an imperial officer in public!

546
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,500
Baroness Ban is rude and extravagant.

547
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,420
Count Cheng’an,
you defend her like this.

548
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,810
Could it be

549
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,460
that you two have affairs?

550
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,010
Your Grace, Mr. Song.

551
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,850
You two insist that Baroness Ban
should be punished.

552
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,140
Are you trying

553
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,290
to cover for an immoral person?

554
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,090
Well, Count Cheng’an.

555
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,610
His Grace and Mr. Song

556
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,330
are aiming at facts, not people.

557
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,900
Baroness Ban happened to be
involved in it.

558
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,290
If it was someone else,

559
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,330
these two ministers will still
vigorously offer their advice.

560
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,380
Count Xie, I know your intention.

561
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,090
What’s my intention?

562
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,090
You are seeking personal revenge
in the name of public interests.

563
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,180
You did it for your blind son.

564
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,220
You lost the money
and your son is blind!

565
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,570
That’s why you try to hurt Hua!

566
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,500
Well, Marquis Jingting.

567
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,770
What do you mean by that?

568
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,900
My son is blind.

569
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,940
You keep mentioning it all the time.

570
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,850
What do you mean?

571
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,010
What do I mean?
You know what I mean!

572
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,330
I don’t know what you mean!

573
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,290
Listen!

574
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,850
-You...!
-You...!

575
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,770
Your Majesty.

576
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,700
I think Shen Yu...

577
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,460
Your Majesty, let alone other things,

578
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,180
the fact that Shen Yu cheated on her

579
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,330
shows the immorality of his behavior.

580
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,810
I think he should be heavily punished.

581
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,290
However,

582
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,090
Ban Hua whipped the imperial officer.

583
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,660
Your Majesty, I heard

584
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,530
that Mr. Shi was there when it happened.

585
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,810
Minister Yan, you misunderstood.

586
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,740
When Shi Jin arrived there,

587
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,090
it was already over.

588
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,500
Shi Jin, since you were at the scene,

589
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,570
tell me your opinion.

590
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,090
Your Majesty.

591
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,940
Although I arrived late,

592
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,570
I also investigated this matter.

593
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,090
According to the people at the scene,

594
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,500
Shen Yu did cheat on her first.

595
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,610
Then Baroness Ban whipped him.

596
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,010
And Baroness Ban said
she would teach that scumbag

597
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,010
a lesson for Your Majesty
when she whipped him.

598
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,940
It shows Baroness Ban’s
respect for Your Majesty.

599
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,500
She also felt angry for Your Majesty
to be blinded by Shen Yu.

600
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,010
Therefore, I think

601
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,740
Baroness Ban has no disrespect
to Your Majesty.

602
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,660
Mr. Shi has a point.

603
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,610
Your Majesty, I think

604
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,220
Shen Yu should be punished.

605
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,050
If people like Shen Yu
take position in court,

606
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,500
I’m afraid it might
hurt the foundation of Daye,

607
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
and lose the support of the people.

608
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,250
Your Majesty, Shen Yu
deserves a heavy penalty!

609
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,700
But Baroness Ban

610
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,530
shouldn’t get away with it easily!

611
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,810
Yes.

612
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,290
He has a point.

613
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,740
In the morning court,

614
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,180
they were either asking me
to punish Hua

615
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,010
or asking me to forgive Hua.

616
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,220
In the court of Daye,

617
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,380
isn’t there anything more important

618
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,290
than that?

619
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,010
By the grace of Your Majesty,

620
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,290
Daye is prosperous
and people are at peace.

621
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,250
Princess Royal presents herself!

622
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,850
Why is she here again?

623
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,420
Aunt, why are you here?

624
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,500
I deserve a death penalty!

625
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,220
-Please punish me.
-Don’t.

626
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,850
Aunt, don’t do that.

627
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,140
Please stand up.

628
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,460
I neglected to discipline my child

629
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,530
and caused many troubles
to the court of Daye.

630
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,610
Your Majesty, please give me
a death penalty now!

631
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
Aunt.

632
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,380
You...

633
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,570
You mustn’t say such absurd things.

634
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,180
I can’t live without you.

635
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,980
No matter how I cherish her,

636
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,810
I can’t put you in a difficult position.

637
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,700
I can only blame my husband
for his early death.

638
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,250
I neglected to discipline my children

639
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,610
and caused trouble
for Your Majesty again and again.

640
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,290
Aunt, just listen to me.

641
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,140
No matter it’s Hua’s fault or not,

642
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,530
what I care about the most
is our relationship.

643
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,010
Your Majesty, you are affectionate.

644
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,700
But the people out there are realistic.

645
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,770
Hua whipped an imperial officer
in public.

646
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,290
It’s disrespect to Your Majesty.

647
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,250
This crime is serious enough
to get her beheaded!

648
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,980
Aunt, it’s not that serious.

649
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,050
I watched Hua grow up.

650
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,380
I’ve been...

651
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,330
I’ve been fond of her.

652
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,250
Once Hua got something interesting,

653
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,220
she would show it to me.

654
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,980
I would never believe

655
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,330
that Hua would be disrespectful to me.

656
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,900
Hua is so lucky

657
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,660
to have Your Majesty’s love.

658
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,050
I will handle it.

659
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Don’t worry, Aunt.

660
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

661
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,500
Why do you cry again?

662
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,500
Take care, Aunt.

663
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,530
Are you still in the mood
to give yourself a facial?

664
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,250
It’s a fact that I whipped him.
Whatever will be, will be.

665
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,570
Even to be punished,
I’ll still be beautiful.

666
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,290
Are you sure about that?

667
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,900
The celestial prison is dark and stuffy.

668
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,740
The food is poor there.

669
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,530
And you will eat there, sleep there,
shit there and die there.

670
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,660
You can’t even take

671
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,530
your favorite clothes and jewelry.

672
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,380
Are you sure you can stand it?

673
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,740
His Majesty has always loved me.

674
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,180
He won’t put me in celestial prison.

675
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,500
He will lock me

676
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,180
in the room at most.

677
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,010
Don’t worry.

678
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,610
You are too optimistic.

679
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,050
Well,

680
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,180
the mind of the emperor is
unfathomable as the sea.

681
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,770
Your fate is unpredictable.

682
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,010
Here is the imperial edict!
Baroness Ban, come to receive it!

683
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,570
Baroness Ban.

684
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,460
Yes.

685
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,420
Your face...

686
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,220
These are cucumber slices.

687
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,530
Put it on your face,
and it can enhance your beauty.

688
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,330
Really? Does it really work?

689
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,330
Yes. It’s excellent.

690
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,850
Tell me about it now.

691
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,420
Let’s get down to business first.

692
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,500
I’ll ask someone to send you

693
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,220
a box of it later.

694
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,050
Thank you.

695
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,050
Baroness Ban,
please receive the imperial edict.

696
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,940
By the grace of God, here is
the announcement of His Majesty:

697
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,090
Shen Yu coveted power
and cheated on his marriage contract.

698
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,050
He is removed from his position
and will never be hired again.

699
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,220
Baroness Ban is honest and righteous,
innocent and elegant.

700
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,220
She enforced justice on behalf
of the God and made a contribution.

701
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,700
Now she is made as a countess

702
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,610
with the corvee and tax
of seven hundred households.

703
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,010
Respect this.

704
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,660
Thank you for your grace!

705
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,140
Congratulations, Countess Ban.

706
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,850
I’ll leave now.

707
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,050
Innocent and elegant?

708
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,700
The minister
who wrote the imperial edict

709
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,140
is getting better

710
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,500
at telling lies.

711
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,420
Go on.

712
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,570
This is...

713
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,420
What?

714
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,700
His Majesty is that partial to her?

715
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,900
His Majesty ordered to remove
Shen Yu from his position.

716
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,010
What drugs did the Ban family

717
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,610
feed His Majesty?

718
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,850
Not only did he not punish Ban Hua,

719
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,380
he even gave her a reward.

720
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,810
Father, why don’t we get someone
to ask about it?

721
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,500
What’s their secret
to fawn upon His Majesty?

722
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,530
Stop bothering the Ban family.

723
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,740
We can’t get anything good from it.

724
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,530
Stop talking!

725
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,770
You are the most useless person
in our family!

726
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,530
Do you know that?

727
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,530
If you didn’t change your confession
in the last minute,

728
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,770
how could the Ban family
become like this now?

729
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,290
They would’ve been over a long time ago!

730
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,660
Can’t you still see it?

731
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,290
With the Princess Royal behind them,

732
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,290
nothing will happen to the Ban family.

733
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,660
No matter what you do,
it will all be in vain.

734
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,500
You! You’re pissing me off!

735
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,850
If you keep pissing me off,

736
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,380
the other eye of yours
will also be blind!

737
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,980
Blind?

738
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,660
Qilin, stop.

739
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,460
I’m telling the truth!

740
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,940
You want me to deceive myself?

741
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,500
I might as well be totally blind!

742
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,330
You...!

743
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,530
Get back here! He is…!

744
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,380
Father, calm down.

745
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,900
Qilin is right.

746
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,330
With the Princess Royal being there,

747
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,010
His Majesty can’t do anything
to the Ban family.

748
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,180
Don’t be mad at it.

749
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,980
It’s upsetting.

750
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,460
Strangely enough,

751
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,810
the Shi family never meddled
in the affairs in court.

752
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,050
This time he took the side
of the Ban family.

753
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,250
There must be

754
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,330
something strange about it.

755
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,420
Jin, have some rest.

756
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,460
I heard that you spoke up
for Countess Ban

757
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,090
and made the ministers speechless.

758
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,420
It’s not a big deal.

759
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,380
I was telling the truth.

760
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,010
Speaking of that,
the Ban family is really lucky.

761
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,700
They got good out of misfortune
again and again.

762
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,050
They are really lucky.

763
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Countess Ban got herself
in trouble twice

764
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,010
because of her engagement.

765
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,420
Fortunately, Countess Ban
is straightforward.

766
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,330
If it was some other ordinary woman,

767
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,500
she wouldn’t know how to deal with it.

768
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,290
You seem to admire
Countess Ban a lot.

769
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,610
Why do you say that?

770
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,940
As a military commander,

771
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,140
you’ve been admiring
Old General Ban since you were young.

772
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,850
Although Countess Ban is not literate,
she is good at riding and shooting.

773
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,460
And she is good-looking.

774
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,250
Therefore, I guess

775
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,900
you would appreciate a girl like her.

776
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,500
Why do you start
to guess this kind of stuff?

777
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,380
It reminds me.

778
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,050
Is there any man you fall for?

779
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,660
I like painting, doing calligraphy
and reading poetry most of the time.

780
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,090
I don’t have the time to pay attention
to any man.

781
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,850
That’s true.

782
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,530
Except for Count Cheng’an,

783
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,250
there seems to be no one

784
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,810
who is good enough for you.

785
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,810
<i>Mingyue House</i>
Get out!

786
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,530
<i>Mingyue House</i>
Don’t touch me!

787
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,610
<i>Mingyue House</i>

788
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,700
<i>Mingyue House</i>
A man like you

789
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,900
doesn’t deserve to be our customer!

790
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,420
Where are my new clothes?

791
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,810
New clothes?

792
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,900
They were used to pay for the room.

793
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,740
Those are personal items
given to me by the Ban family.

794
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,900
How can you take them?

795
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,330
Your clothes? In your dream!

796
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,140
Get out! Don’t affect our business!

797
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,180
What is that attitude?

798
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,940
I ranked third in the examination!

799
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,010
Who cares what you ranked?

800
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,460
I think you are just a joke!

801
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,330
He is just a joke!

802
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
Yeah.

803
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,740
Wait.

804
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,010
I will make great achievement

805
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,980
and make all of you
kneel down to beg me!

806
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,330
I...!

807
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,380
Sisters!

808
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,770
Let’s teach this unfaithful man
a lesson!

809
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,530
Hit him! Hit him!

810
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,290
Hit him!

811
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,570
Get out!

812
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,340
Hit him!

813
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,570
Hit him! Hit him to death!

814
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,210
Hit him!

815
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,050
Hit him!

816
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,210
Hit him!

817
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:25,820
Hit him!

818
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,860
Miss Li! Help!

819
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,340
Go on! Hit him!

820
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,230
Hit him! Hit Him!

821
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,210
Mercy!

822
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Who shot that arrow at me?

823
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,090
Who was that man in a black coat
in my dream?

824
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,690
Where did you get the talisman?

825
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,010
It’s messy.

826
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,010
Get out.

827
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,170
Hua.

828
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,500
Did you dream that you
became a countess?

829
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,730
Hua, could it be that you forgot it?

830
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,170
It’s impossible.
I’ve remembered everything.

831
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,650
Is it possible

832
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,940
that what you dreamed about
are just coincidences?

833
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,500
Our mansion
will not be confiscated at all,

834
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,730
and there will be no rebellion?

835
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,780
But it’s hard to tell the time

836
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,050
when those things happen.

837
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,260
Maybe it hasn’t happened yet.

838
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,730
Then I shouldn’t ask you

839
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,860
which cock will win
in the cockfighting a few days later.

840
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,820
Do you have any serious question?

841
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,570
You never took it seriously.
Focus on what we are talking about.

842
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,530
However, I’ve thought about it.

843
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,460
What happened in the dream

844
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,610
may not be impossible
to change in reality.

845
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,050
It’s a warning for us to be careful.

846
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,780
Anyway,

847
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,380
there is one thing for sure.

848
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,530
Shen Yu is not the man in black.

849
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,650
Yes.

850
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,820
If it’s not Shen Yu,

851
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,340
and not the blind Xie Qilin,

852
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,260
then who is the man in black?

853
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,050
I think the most likely person
is the Second Prince.

854
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,090
Dear, you have a point.

855
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,820
That won’t be good.

856
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,010
If the Second Prince marries Xie Wanyu,

857
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,170
she will revenge the Xie family

858
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,690
on us and hurt us.

859
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,420
Hua, if the Second Prince
becomes the new emperor,

860
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,210
won’t that make Xie Wanyu the empress?

861
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,170
Yeah.

862
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,340
That silly girl is so lucky.

863
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,980
What are you talking about?

864
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,940
Is the emphasis on Xie Wanyu?

865
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,980
Yeah.

866
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,300
Let me think about it.

867
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,340
No!

868
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,210
Hua, do I have to do this?

869
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,820
I’m taking... Taking precautions.

870
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,380
What precautions?

871
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,130
Anyway,

872
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,860
you are idle all day long
and have nothing serious to do.

873
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,130
If something happens to our family,

874
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,500
with one more person
practicing martial arts,

875
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
we will have one more advantage.

876
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,900
I can’t! Hua!

877
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,420
For men,

878
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,650
you would rather die than say

879
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,090
you can’t.

880
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,610
You are too weak! Higher.

881
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
No, Hua!

882
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,820
Hua, I think you should

883
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,210
make peace with Count Cheng’an.

884
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,690
After all, he still spoke up for you

885
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,980
in court.

886
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,530
That’s his mouth.

887
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,980
What he said has nothing to do with me.

888
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,170
I didn’t beg him.

889
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,690
Your hands! Don’t try to be lazy!

890
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,860
No, no, I’m not.

891
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,860
I mean,

892
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,650
I think you made a big deal
out of it this time.

893
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,130
You are not as generous as before.

894
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,860
That’s not the point.

895
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,170
The point is,

896
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,860
I think Count Cheng’an might be
the man in black.

897
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,780
Perhaps he likes to wear black clothes.

898
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,460
You can’t just accuse him for that.

899
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,570
Who would look for a cat

900
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,340
in a black coat at night?

901
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,610
We didn’t hear a meow

902
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,980
when we buried the treasure.

903
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,860
Yeah, I didn’t hear it.

904
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,340
He did it in a spooky manner.

905
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,340
There must be something weird about it.

906
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:34,860
Baroness.

907
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,210
Countess.

908
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,460
Long time no see.
You must be here to see Young Master.

909
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,610
I’ll get him for you.

910
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,210
No need.

911
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,530
I just pass by
and want to check on you.

912
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,460
Your fish...

913
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,980
I passed by the fish market.

914
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,050
So I bought it for the cat.

915
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,860
Cat?

916
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,820
Haven’t you

917
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,460
found the cat?

918
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,980
Countess, why are you here?

919
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,300
You found it.

920
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,500
Mr. Du, is there a name for this cat?

921
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,820
Your Grace, this cat is called Huahua.

922
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,380
Huahua? It’s a special name.

923
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,780
How long have you had this cat?

924
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,500
Yesterday morning...

925
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,690
We found it yesterday morning.

926
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,050
You found it yesterday?

927
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,010
It was wandering for days.
It must be hungry now.

928
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,570
Give it this.

929
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,420
Your Grace, Young Master
will be back in a minute.

930
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,570
Why don’t you come inside
and have some tea?

931
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,500
No need.

932
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,050
I only came here to see the cat.

933
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,650
I’ll visit him another day.

934
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,210
Jiu.

935
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,780
Why did Young Master buy a cat?

936
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,650
He knew Countess Ban
would come to see the cat.

937
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,780
Anyway, she has been here

938
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,730
and seen the cat.

939
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,010
Countess, why don’t you wear

940
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,690
the green dress
with this set of jewelry?

941
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,860
How is it?

942
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,820
Rocky.

943
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,090
I found that your taste
has gone really bad recently.

944
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,210
This was popular in last month.

945
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:13,980
Madam.

946
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,690
Mother.

947
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,090
Hua.

948
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,050
I think

949
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,090
you should pass the autumn hunting.

950
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,050
I’ve been worried

951
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,300
since you had that dream.

952
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,940
You may get hurt on the hunting ground.

953
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,530
What if something happens to you?

954
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,820
Mother, there is nothing to worry about.

955
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,420
It’s painful

956
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,820
to live a cowardly life.

957
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,690
Instead of being scared all the time,

958
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,300
it’s better to live the way we want.

959
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,570
Besides, there are a lot of guards
garrisoning the imperial hunting ground.

960
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,010
It’s nothing wrong to be careful.

961
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,300
This is

962
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,210
a protective talisman
I got for you at Guanyin Temple.

963
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,650
Remember to carry it with you.

964
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,860
Rest assured.

965
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,860
There are very few who can take me down.

966
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,090
Silly girl.

967
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,560
<i>Empress</i>
<i>Jiang Zhang, Crown Prince of Daye</i>

968
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,610
Finished!

969
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:32,690
Countess.

970
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,530
Please accept this.

971
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,300
Wood. Carved patterns.

972
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,860
This bow looks nice.

973
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,940
I’m glad you like it.

974
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,980
Okay, I’ll take it.

975
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,860
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

976
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,570
Well, let’s have a competition

977
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,530
on the hunting ground later.

978
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,340
The hunting begins!

979
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:53,940
Get over here.

980
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,980
Listen carefully.

981
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,780
Otherwise,

982
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,500
you will all die.

983
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,260
Yes!

984
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,610
Who is that?

985
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,860
Get that person!

986
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,530
Let’s go!

987
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,300
Search carefully.

988
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,340
Yes.

989
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,010
Count Cheng’an.
You practice martial arts?

990
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,010
They are here somewhere.
Hurry up and find them!

991
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,210
Yes!

992
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:46,234
