Yes.

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,900
Count Cheng’an,
you practice martial arts?

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,060
They are here somewhere,
hurry up and find them!

40
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,250
Yes!

41
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,970

42
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,780
Yes.

You...!

44
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,090
You...!

45
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,860
Countess, calm down.

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,900
You dare to grab my arm?

47
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,780
I can’t breathe.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,210
Countess, calm down.

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,860
Your heart is beating that fast.

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,740
Maybe you should calm down.

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,130
Don’t be afraid, Countess.

52
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,620
No matter what happens,

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,810
I’ll be here to protect you.

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,180
Protect me?

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,460
I think you are trying to strangle me.

56
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,500
I hear the sounds!

57
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,300
Be careful. Be quiet.

58
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,460
Countess, sorry.

59
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,930
You dare to push me...?

60
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,130
Count Cheng’an, you sold me out.

61
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,620
Ban Hua?

62
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,580
Cousin Luo, what a coincidence.

63
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,860
Yeah.

64
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,900
My good cousin,

65
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,130
why are you hiding in the woods?

66
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,060
I chased my prey to this place

67
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,660
and accidentally got my clothes snagged.

68
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,100
Really?

69
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,980
What kind of lousy and sly stuff

70
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,180
will be hiding here?

71
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,250
Are you here to catch a mole?

72
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,130
Cousin Luo, with my ability,

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,930
I can only hunt some small prey.

74
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,980
I’m not like you.

75
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,180
You should catch an elephant
for His Majesty.

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,330
There isn’t much time left for hunting.

77
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,660
I won’t bother you. Good day.

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,420
Why in such a hurry to leave?

79
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,860
I just want to hunt something

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,220
for His Majesty to get some rewards.

81
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,570
The Second Prince is a bully!

82
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,300
There is no justice!

83
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,450
The dignified Second Prince is a bully!

84
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,300
Ban Hua, you made a scene like this.

85
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,860
Aren’t you afraid that I will kill you?

86
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,100
He wants to kill me!
There is no justice!

87
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,660
Help!

88
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,130
Help!

89
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,060
How long are you going to
keep playing the fool?

90
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,570
Countess!

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Count Cheng’an?

92
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,060
Are you stupid? Come out to die?

93
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,690
Countess, why are you here?

94
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,330
What should I do?

95
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,770
Greeting to Your Highness.

96
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,770
Please forgive me if I offend you.

97
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,890
Why are you here?

98
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,060
I was hunting with Countess Ban
and chasing the prey.

99
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,370
Countess, you ran too fast.

100
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,500
I failed to catch up with you.

101
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,740
By the way, Countess.

102
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,420
The barbecue has started.

103
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,770
His Majesty and Marquis
are still waiting for you.

104
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,890
Your Highness.

105
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,620
Why don’t you come back with us?

106
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,420
Count Cheng’an, I still need you later.

107
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,860
Otherwise, neither of you
will leave here alive today.

108
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,570
Not necessary.

109
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,500
Good day, Your Highness.

110
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,540
Are you all right?

111
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Not at all!

112
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,620
I want to hit someone!

113
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,770
Countess! Countess!

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,890
It was an emergency situation.

115
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,130
I did it in a moment of desperation.

116
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,890
Sorry that I offended you.

117
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,060
Fine, since you brought it up.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,810
Then let me ask you something.

119
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,770
I’ll answer truthfully.

120
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,180
You have hands.

121
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,450
Why don’t you cover my mouth
with your hand?

122
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,060
I had the bow in one of my hands,

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,740
the other hand was held by you.

124
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,250
I don’t have the third hand.

125
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,860
All right. We could just lie down.

126
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,060
Why did you hold me in your arms?

127
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,420
At that time, the Second Prince
was approaching.

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,420
If I didn’t do that,
you would be exposed.

129
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,570
Fine, but why did you hug me tightly?

130
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,570
I...

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,420
In the end,

132
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,100
I think you want to take advantage of me

133
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,010
because I’m good looking.

134
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,370
That’s the first gentleman in Daye

135
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,500
who takes advantage of people
when they are vulnerable.

136
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,860
You spout the archaic words,

137
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,450
but in fact, you are shameless
and indecent.

138
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,770
Why do you only have nasty thoughts

139
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,220
in your mind?

140
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,130
Obviously, it was a helpless move
in desperation.

141
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,620
Why do you make it

142
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,540
sound nasty and indecent?

143
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,500
Could it be

144
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,890
that you want us to be exposed

145
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,130
and put us in danger?

146
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,620
I give up arguing with you.

147
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,930
Just tell me

148
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,180
how to do with that?

149
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,740
Forget it.

150
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,770
Forget it?

151
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,220
Such unsightly things

152
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,860
can be forgotten in a minute

153
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,770
if we don’t have impure thoughts.

154
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,130
It’s getting late.

155
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,220
Countess, please follow me.

156
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,410
Lest the Second Prince should go back.

157
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,940
You go first.

158
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,980
Easy for you to say. Forget it.

159
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,500
Can you forget it?

160
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,860
There is news from the hunting ground

161
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,170
that the Second Prince’s plan

162
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,460
was almost found out by Countess Ban.

163
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,250
Fortunately, Count Rong
stepped in and solved it.

164
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,580
Looks like it is
going to be interesting.

165
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,980
Minister, what should we do?

166
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,620
<i>Xie Chongjin, Eldest Son of the Xies</i>
The only two princes in Daye

167
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,770
<i>Xie Chongjin, First Adviser in Daye</i>
are having a battle.

168
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,500
This is going to be a good show anyway.

169
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,770
Does our assassin still need to

170
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,050
help the Second Prince
carry out his plan?

171
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,410
It’s time to chip away at

172
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,100
the forces of the Crown Prince.

173
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:44,940
Your Highness.

174
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,700
Suyue.

175
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,530
Mr. Shi, this is the venison

176
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,770
you just asked us to cut.

177
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,740
You are skilled in hunting.

178
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,620
It didn’t take you long to hunt a deer.

179
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,010
Sister.

180
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,410
Hua, you come back with Count Cheng’an.

181
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,130
Are you two...

182
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,820
Stop it, sister.

183
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,220
There is nothing between us.

184
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,410
Then why are you blushing like this?

185
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,620
I got inflamed.

186
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,890
Count Rong.

187
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,700
The people of the Second Prince
are not around His Majesty.

188
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,250
Are they lying in ambush
outside the palace?

189
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,650
Prepare some good wine.

190
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,530
Yes.

191
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,500
But the Second Prince

192
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,820
can’t buy off all these soldiers.

193
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,100
It’s too dangerous to assassinate
outside the palace.

194
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,290
It doesn’t make sense.

195
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,620
Will they do it inside the palace?

196
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,170
In the following arrangements,

197
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,370
the Second Prince can only do it at...

198
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,530
Cousin Luo.

199
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,770
Sorry that I ruined your mood.

200
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,340
Let me make a toast to you.

201
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,500
Drink the whole pot
if you really want to apologize.

202
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,170
Your Highness.

203
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,890
Countess Ban is a girl.

204
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,250
Please don’t push too far.

205
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,770
It’s between us.

206
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,860
Why does it bother you?

207
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,770
If it wasn’t for the possibility
that you are the man in a black dress,

208
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,580
I won’t come here to fawn on you.

209
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,340
I’ll drink it for her.

210
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,980
Jin!

211
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,980
Cousin Luo.

212
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,500
Sorry I offended you.

213
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,130
I’ll drink it.

214
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,290
Count Cheng’an, what are you doing?

215
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,890
You...!

216
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,580
You might ruin something important

217
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,170
if you drink this pot of wine.

218
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,940
When is Count Cheng’an
so close with Countess Ban

219
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,170
that he drank the wine for her?

220
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,700
I heard that Countess Ban
is a bad drinker.

221
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,940
Don’t ruin His Majesty’s banquet

222
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,580
just because of a pot of wine.

223
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,250
The wine represents Hua’s apology to me.

224
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,650
Count Cheng’an, how can you
drink it for her?

225
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,250
Jiang Luo, just let it go.

226
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,220
What does it matter?

227
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,620
Luo, be good.

228
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,410
Don’t upset your father.

229
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Yes.

230
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,860
Your Highness, thank you for your wine.

231
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,700
Ministers.

232
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,100
Who wants to shoot the first arrow?

233
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,050
The Crown Prince deserves his title.

234
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,410
You are really positive.

235
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,100
All right, Zhang, you are the first one.

236
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,370
This...

237
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,340
Then

238
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,170
I’ll start us off

239
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,290
and shoot the first arrow.

240
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,650
Zhang.

241
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,940
I prepared a new bow for you.

242
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,410
Present the golden bow!

243
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,740
The golden bow is as heavy as
the vast land of Daye.

244
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,370
With the golden bow in your hand,

245
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,170
you must take more responsibility
in the future.

246
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,890
Thank you, Father.

247
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,770
You are about to die.
How dare you steal my thunder?

248
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,820
Zhang is literate
but not good at martial arts.

249
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,460
Why don’t you let me help?

250
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,170
Luo!

251
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,010
Put it down.

252
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,580
Father.

253
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,340
This golden bow is very rare.

254
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,130
I also want to try it.

255
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,650
Why is he that drunk?

256
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,050
He is too undependable.

257
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,700
-Zhang!
-Cousin Luo!

258
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,770
-This bow...
-Cousin Luo.

259
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,890
This golden bow is so beautiful.
I also want to take a look.

260
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,940
Ban Hua, give it to me!

261
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,310
-Just let me take a look!
-Let it go!

262
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,250
Stop fighting for it!

263
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,050
Give it to me!

264
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,740
Let me take a look!

265
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,620
Let it go.

266
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,770
Let it go!

267
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,940
Father is watching us!

268
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,100
Let it go!

269
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,860
Stop it.

270
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,010
Count Cheng’an, why are you stopping me?

271
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,130
It seems like

272
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,580
Jiang Luo has a back-up plan.

273
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,700
Don’t worry, you got me.

274
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,010
It’s okay.

275
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,620
Tell me who sent you here!

276
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,580
Luo,

277
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,410
if you really like

278
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,770
this golden bow,

279
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,770
I can ask Father to give it to you.

280
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,620
Jiang Luo! Didn’t you hear me?

281
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,530
Father, I was over the line.

282
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,250
Ban Hua, since you also enjoy archery,

283
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,050
why don’t we have a real contest?

284
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:41,940
How is it?

285
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,010
What is this pig trying to do?

286
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,290
Your Highness is stingy.

287
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,530
Why do you keep trying to
compete with a woman?

288
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,700
What did you say?

289
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:50,890
Let me do it!

290
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,650
Cousin Luo, don’t be angry.
He is drunk.

291
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,700
Heng!

292
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,010
-Get some tea here!
-Okay.

293
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,650
No need! I’m not drunk.

294
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,460
Well...

295
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,410
Count Cheng’an, do you also
master archery?

296
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,100
How did I never hear of it before?

297
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,340
At the archery range,

298
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,420
how can I not draw the bow?

299
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,380
I won’t compete with a drunkard.

300
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,090
There is nothing to be
proud of even I win.

301
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,010
Your Highness, that’s not true.

302
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,420
Although I’m drunk,

303
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,850
you might not

304
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,180
necessarily win me.

305
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,810
Arrogant.

306
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:26,940
Someone!

307
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,250
You’ll win as long as
you hit the target.

308
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,180
But if you lose,

309
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,850
don’t blame me for being
ten times hard on you.

310
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,610
Your Highness, that’s insulting!

311
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,900
No problem!

312
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,290
Your Highness, don’t regret it.

313
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,770
Notch!

314
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,350
Well...

315
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,570
Bravo, bravo!

316
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,700
Count Cheng’an shot the bow

317
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,010
instead of the arrow,
that’s a masterstroke.

318
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,050
Very impressive.

319
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,050
It turns out that Count Cheng’an
doesn’t know archery.

320
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,740
Don’t you practice martial arts?

321
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,500
Why did you play dumb?

322
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,810
I didn’t.

323
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,810
I really don’t know how to shoot arrows.

324
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,660
Then why did you take the bow?

325
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,740
Stop trying.

326
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:55,980
Take the bow.

327
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,250
Notch.

328
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,180
Why did I take the bow?

329
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,420
That’s because I hate to see
you being bullied.

330
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,610
Feixian, what’s wrong?

331
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,420
Nothing.

332
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,500
She got it.

333
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,500
I didn’t expect Hua to inherit

334
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,500
your grandpa’s consummate archery.

335
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,220
Father.

336
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,140
I’m so excited.

337
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,380
Thank you for your help.

338
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,610
Who just said as long as
he hits the target,

339
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,290
someone will repay it ten times?

340
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,610
Cousin Luo.

341
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,250
Hua.

342
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,330
Hua, you are really heroic.

343
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,290
Go back now.

344
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,500
Watching your valiant gesture,

345
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,180
I can’t help but remember

346
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,900
my uncle, Old General Ban,

347
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
who fought dauntlessly
on the battlefield.

348
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,900
He taught me archery when I was young.

349
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,740
Now I am in a high position.

350
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,900
But Old General Ban...

351
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,980
Your Majesty, don’t be sad.

352
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,570
Now you are knowledgeable and virtuous.

353
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,280
Grandfather will be rejoiced

354
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,940
to know what you have achieved today.

355
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,380
I won’t feel peace

356
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,500
if I don’t take good care of

357
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,980
the descendants of the Ban family.

358
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,740
Father, are you going to

359
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,810
choose a husband for Hua?

360
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,900
Count Cheng’an, what kind of man
do you think

361
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,980
is good enough for Countess Ban?

362
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,770
I.

363
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,090
I dare not speculate

364
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,530
His Majesty’s will.

365
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,900
Marquis Jingting’s daughter
inherits the courage of General Ban.

366
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,180
As my half-daughter,
she deserves to be a princess.

367
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,500
The title is

368
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,250
Fule.

369
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,140
Thank you, Your Majesty!

370
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,010
She is promoted again.

371
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,140
Prepare the carriage.
I’ll go back to the palace.

372
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,140
Your Majesty, calm down!
Luo is still young!

373
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,530
Father, why do you hit me?

374
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,010
I granted the bow at the autumn hunting.

375
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,380
Don’t you know what it means?

376
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,250
I granted the Crown Prince
a golden bow in public

377
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,980
to let the ministers see
my expectations for the Crown Prince

378
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,850
with their own eyes,

379
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,810
to let the whole world know

380
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,700
that the land of Daye will
belong to the Crown Prince!

381
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,900
But you grabbed at the golden bow.

382
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,010
What do you want to tell everyone?

383
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,980
Father, you took me wrong.

384
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,940
I didn’t take you wrong!

385
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,500
Father.

386
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,010
I know better than anyone
about your intention.

387
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,500
The Crown Prince will always be
the Crown Prince.

388
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,380
Father.

389
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,900
Luo was just naughty.

390
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,420
Did I allow you to speak?

391
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,980
Go to kneel in front of
the Crown Prince’s Hall,

392
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,610
until noon tomorrow!

393
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,810
One day,

394
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,460
I will make you all kneel at my feet.

395
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,010
Young Master.

396
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,050
You don’t even touch any alcohol.

397
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,740
Why did you drink so much today?

398
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,250
Du Jiu, don’t waggle.

399
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,740
It makes me dizzy.

400
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,500
Fortunately,

401
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,140
you sent the message in time.

402
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,570
Otherwise, the Palace
would be turned upside down.

403
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,530
Unfortunately,

404
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,700
the three secret agents
committed suicide with poison.

405
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,900
We have no one else to ask.

406
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,050
Although we didn’t
get any useful information,

407
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,090
His Majesty must be aware of something

408
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,460
based on what the Second Prince
did today.

409
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,770
Let His Majesty

410
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,050
handle his family affairs on his own.

411
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,530
I’m afraid that the Second Prince
will make a move again.

412
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,460
What will happen...

413
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,660
Let’s worry about it later.

414
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,330
Don’t waggle.

415
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,180
I’m so exhausted.

416
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,850
Rocky.

417
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,660
Massage my shoulders.

418
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,180
Okay, Your Grace.

419
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,500
What’s wrong?

420
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,460
You...

421
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,050
Do a manicure for me.

422
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,380
All right.

423
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,010
Don’t be afraid.
What’s the harm to lose?

424
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,330
I want to share
the consequence with you.

425
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,660
Even to lose, I will lose with you.

426
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,980
Why did I take the bow?

427
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,700
That’s because I hate to see
you being bullied.

428
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,570
What’s wrong again?

429
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,090
Son of a ghost! Son of a ghost!

430
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,090
A ghost?

431
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,050
But... There is no ghost.

432
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,660
It’s fine.

433
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,660
Maybe I just need to
apply some cucumbers.

434
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,770
Apply...Cucumber?

435
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
All right.

436
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,940
What’s wrong, Your Grace?

437
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,500
Don’t scare me!

438
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,220
Forget it. No cucumbers.

439
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,050
I’ll go to sleep.

440
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,250
But...

441
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,770
Your Grace! This is...

442
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,420
What’s happening?

443
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
<i>Black dress</i>

444
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,660
Your Grace, are you...

445
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,090
Are you acting as a gentlewoman?

446
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,400
<i>Black dress</i>

447
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,380
Your Grace,
did you have that dream again?

448
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,220
This time

449
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,900
I dreamed of something different.

450
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,770
Come here.

451
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,900
Look.

452
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,530
I dreamed that the man in the
black dress had a scar on his chest.

453
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,770
It looks like a sword wound.

454
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,090
But it also looks like something else.

455
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,420
It’s just a scar.

456
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,770
There is no name for it.

457
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,290
How do we know who he is?

458
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,900
This is an important clue, okay?

459
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,770
Everyone has a black dress.

460
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,810
But a scar on the chest is unusual.

461
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,810
It’s hard to see it
in such a hidden place.

462
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,090
Then how do we find it?

463
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,610
Easy, strip off the clothes.

464
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,460
There are so many men in this capital.

465
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,850
Can you strip them all?

466
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,940
The men who are capable
to usurp the throne

467
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,850
in the capital are numbered.

468
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,660
We can

469
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,090
strip one man a day.

470
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,900
Strip one man a day?

471
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,140
In all weathers
and regardless of any trouble.

472
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,180
I believe one day

473
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,180
we can check all the men.

474
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,940
Your Grace, this is improper.

475
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,010
From the existing men,

476
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,090
the bastard Jiang Luo bears the brunt.

477
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,220
Let’s start with him.

478
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,010
Your Grace.

479
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,010
You can’t stop suspecting Count Rong

480
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,980
just because you like him.

481
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,770
What?

482
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,380
I’m thinking with my brain, okay?

483
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,810
Rong Xia can’t shoot arrows at all

484
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,220
at the autumn hunting that day.

485
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,330
So what?

486
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,420
But the man in the black dress...

487
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,250
Your Grace.

488
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,330
What does archery have anything to do

489
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,610
with the man in the black dress?

490
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
It... It’s irrelevant.

491
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,120
Anyway, it’s not Rong Xia.

492
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,120
You two,

493
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,080
think about

494
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
how to strip the clothes

495
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,920
of Jiang Luo.

496
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,920
The Second Prince doesn’t
get along well with you.

497
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,760
Not to mention
stripping off his clothes,

498
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
I’m afraid it’s hard
to get close to him.

499
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,720
I got it.

500
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
Let’s do it at
Grandma’s birthday banquet.

501
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,000
At my place,

502
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,400
I’m sure there is no way for him

503
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,000
to run away from me.

504
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,400
I’ll strip him naked.

505
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,640
But... But...

506
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,680
You humiliated the Second Prince
at the autumn hunting last time.

507
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
As for the birthday banquet,

508
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,400
it would be nice
if he doesn’t send a coffin.

509
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,960
How can he show up?

510
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,360
Don’t worry.

511
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
He will show up.

512
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,280
Luo.

513
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,000
You knelt here all night?

514
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,920
Just go back.

515
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
I will talk to Father.

516
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,040
Hurry up!

517
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Go away! Don’t touch me!

518
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,360
Who allow you to touch me
with your hands?

519
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,160
Such a short road,

520
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,920
I can kneel my way back if I have to!

521
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Luo.

522
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,920
Why don’t you come inside

523
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,240
and warm yourself up with a cup of tea?

524
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,080
Spare me your false courtesies,
my good brother.

525
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,720
You were only born
a year earlier than me.

526
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,640
Don’t try to give orders to me.

527
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,440
It’s impossible.

528
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,720
You want to laugh at me?
You don’t deserve it!

529
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Luo, your legs...

530
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,280
What legs?

531
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,760
Watch carefully.

532
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,880
This is how a royal man walks!

533
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,840
Luo.

534
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,640
Take care.

535
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,960
Father,

536
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,520
Great-aunt’s birthday feast
is such a big event.

537
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,160
I’m afraid I’m too insufficient

538
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,000
to take over such a major task.

539
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,800
You are the Crown Prince.

540
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,800
If you can’t handle such a little event,

541
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,320
how would that make
the ministers think of you?

542
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,360
I didn’t mean that.

543
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Do you know

544
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,840
why I value you so much
as the Crown Prince?

545
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
I was also the Crown Prince.

546
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,760
I’m the eldest son.

547
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,680
However,

548
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
my father didn’t think much of me.

549
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,600
He even tried to abolish me

550
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,960
and make a new crown prince.

551
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,560
If it wasn’t for my aunt to protect me,

552
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,960
I wouldn’t sit on
the throne to this day.

553
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,440
You are also the eldest son,
the Crown Prince.

554
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,840
Everything I arranged for you

555
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,880
is to clear the way for your future.

556
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,480
Do you understand it?

557
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,160
Father.

558
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,880
I know my mistake.

559
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,920
The chance you have now

560
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,440
is something I dared not to imagine
when I was the Crown Prince.

561
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,560
You don’t even know how precious it is.

562
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,160
I hate the most to see you

563
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,960
becoming a spoiled
and good-for-nothing prince.

564
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,200
You will understand my heart one day.

565
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,040
I will try my best to arrange

566
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,920
Great-aunt’s birthday banquet
as you wish.

567
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,320
Princess Ban presents herself!

568
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,240
Greeting to Your Majesty.

569
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,320
Hua, why do you want to see me today?

570
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,560
Of course it’s because
I miss Your Majesty.

571
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
You are still that sweet.

572
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,040
Go ahead, what’s the matter?

573
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,040
It’s Grandma’s birthday next month.

574
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
I want to hold it myself

575
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,640
to please Grandma.

576
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
That’s thoughtful of you.

577
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,400
I was just discussing about

578
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,360
her birthday feast
with the Crown Prince.

579
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,360
Whatever concerns Aunt

580
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,360
is the top priority for me.

581
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
I hope she can

582
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,800
have an enjoyable birthday banquet.

583
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,080
Wang De.

584
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,400
Yes.

585
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,240
Pass on my verbal message.

586
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,360
The Ministry of Internal Affairs
will pay for the birthday banquet.

587
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,800
The Crown Prince
is in full charge of it.

588
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,720
Yes.

589
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Father.

590
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,560
I see.

591
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
I will let Rong Xia help you.

592
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,960
Are you satisfied?

593
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,080
Yes.

594
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,840
No!

595
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,440
Actually, for such a small event,

596
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,400
I can do it myself.

597
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,200
There is no need to
bother Count Cheng’an.

598
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,760
Will Count Cheng’an be bothered

599
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,120
to do the work I give him?

600
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,840
Besides,

601
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,160
wasn’t there chemistry

602
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,280
between you at the autumn hunting?

603
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,800
No chemistry.

604
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,960
All right, I know it.

605
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,600
You were that close
when you shot the arrow.

606
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
How can you say there is no chemistry?

607
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,640
I understand

608
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,600
your mind as a girl.

609
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,560
Anyway, I can rest assured
with Rong Xia taking care of it.

610
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,480
That’s it.

611
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Wang De, summon Rong Xia to the Palace.

612
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,360
Yes.

613
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,040
Oh no. With Rong Xiao
the sly fox by my side,

614
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,960
I don’t think I can strip off
the Second Prince’s clothes.

615
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,200
How is it going with the Tiger Tally?

616
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,560
There has been no progress
since Shen Yu failed.

617
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,240
Your Excellency.

618
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,160
We have all these people in our mansion,

619
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,800
and you still achieved nothing
after such a long time?

620
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,400
Please forgive us.

621
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,040
If it weren’t for Count Cheng’an

622
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
stepping in the marriage
of Princess Ban,

623
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,720
we would have found
some clues about the Tiger Tally.

624
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,200
Did Rong Xia do it

625
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,040
for Princess Ban,

626
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,160
or for the Tiger Tally?

627
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,200
Master.

628
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,120
Master, there is a message
from the Palace

629
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,240
that His Majesty is going to hold
a birthday banquet for Princess Royal.

630
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,080
The Crown Prince will be
in full charge of it.

631
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,480
Good.

632
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,920
Good. That’s great.

633
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,600
Get the deployment map of
Mansion of Peace and Longevity now.

634
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,680
When His Majesty leaves the Palace,

635
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,760
we can replace the guards
of Princess Royal’s mansion

636
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,240
with our people.

637
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,400
Then we can search every corner

638
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,800
of the Princess Royal’s mansion.

639
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,880
I don’t believe we won’t
find the Tiger Tally.

640
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,120
Your Highness, don’t worry.

641
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,640
I have received the decree.

642
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
I will do my best to handle it well.

643
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,120
Don’t do your best.

644
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,800
Just be casual about it.

645
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,800
It’s our family’s affair anyway.

646
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,200
How can we bother...

647
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,320
Bother...

648
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Hua, that’s not true.

649
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,760
Just because it’s
Grandma’s birthday banquet,

650
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,400
we can’t make any mistakes.

651
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,800
We need the help
of Count Cheng’an even more.

652
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,080
Since it’s a task His majesty gave me,

653
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
I won’t fail His Majesty.

654
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,440
Princess, you and I
should share everything

655
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,880
and have a good discussion about it.

656
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,000
Princess? Princess?

657
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,480
It suddenly occurs to me

658
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,640
that I have something to do at home.

659
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,480
I should leave now.

660
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,160
Why don’t we...

661
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,440
How about I pick you up at your mansion?

662
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,480
No need!

663
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,400
Isn’t this Princess Ban?

664
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,400
Get out of my way.

665
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,320
I’m just standing here.

666
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,760
Is there any place

667
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
I can’t go in the Palace?

668
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,360
You...!

669
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,320
You hit people
whenever you are unhappy.

670
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,240
You are not like a woman at all.

671
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,520
If your grandfather was alive

672
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
and seeing you like this,

673
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
he would be pissed off to death again.

674
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,560
Say it again.

675
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
Think about what happened
on the shooting range.

676
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,720
Do you want to feel

677
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,920
the style of the Ban family again?

678
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,680
No need.

679
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Your bravery and toughness

680
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,440
have made all men feel inadequate

681
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,480
and too scared to come near you.

682
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,240
I’m saying you were dumped many times

683
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,800
and you won’t get married for life.

684
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,000
The Emperor and the Empress are normal.

685
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,120
How did they give birth to
such a blockhead?

686
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,880
If we are not in the Palace,

687
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,600
I will definitely blow his head off.

688
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,120
The man in the black dress?

689
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,640
Why are you staring at me?

690
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,720
Ban Hua, let me make it
clear for you today.

691
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,840
Setting yourself against me

692
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,440
will do no good for you.

693
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
What happened at the autumn hunting,

694
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,880
I’ll just let it go.

695
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
As long as you be a good girl,

696
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,120
and when you meet me...

697
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Ban Hua, what are you doing?

698
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,480
Are you trying to molest me?

699
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,960
I will call for help.

700
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,520
Go ahead.

701
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,080
Not a soul will come to your rescue.

702
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,480
Your Highness, forget it.

703
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,520
Princess, get off him.

704
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,960
Get off me!

705
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,360
How would I be hit by a woman?

706
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,160
Ban Hua, what are you doing?

707
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,320
What should we do?

708
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,200
I will call for help!

709
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
-What can we do?
-Help!

710
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,960
We can’t afford to offend any of them.

711
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,000
Wait!

712
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,920
Get off me!

713
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
You... Come here!

714
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,000
You’re crazy, Ban Hua!

715
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,480
Stop!

716
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,320
-Your Highness!
-Ban Hua!

717
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,920
You are a pervert!

718
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,560
Where are you going?

719
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,280
Your Highness!

720
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,080
Get down! Get down!

721
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,240
Ban Hua, why are you
pulling down my pants? Stop it!

722
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,760
Cousin Luo, get down.

723
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,720
Let’s have a good chat.

724
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,160
You rascal, get off me!

725
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,120
Stop.

726
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
Princess, don’t be rude.

727
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,520
Count Cheng’an.

728
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,800
Get her out of here now.

729
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,200
Are you crazy?

730
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,320
How dare you strip my clothes
in the Palace?

731
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,520
Are you tired of living?

732
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
You molested me first.
That’s why I beat you.

733
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,360
I’ll just beat you a rascal!

734
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,400
I...!

735
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,680
Go to dress His Highness now!

736
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,000
If it gets out,

737
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,360
how will the people comment on this?

738
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,400
They will say that Prince Luo
is inferior to the Crown Prince,

739
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,720
Prince Luo has bad manners,

740
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,120
Prince Luo is disgraceful,

741
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,640
Prince Luo is overwhelmed by his work!

742
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,920
What are you waiting for?

743
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
Your Highness, come down.

744
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,960
Go... Go away!

745
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,440
Ban Hua, you dare to
offend a prince today.

746
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,920
I will not let you get away
with it this time!

747
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,760
Your Highness, you are right.

748
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,200
Count Cheng’an, are you drunk again?

749
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,800
I just don’t know

750
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,720
what Princess Ban did.

751
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
Why do you have to pick on her

752
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
and force her to make such a move?

753
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,000
I pick on her?

754
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,200
Ban Hua!

755
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,200
Count Cheng’an, you still know
that I am the Second Prince.

756
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,920
What you said

757
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
is chipping away at my prestige!

758
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,040
Jiang Luo.

759
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,680
As the saying goes,

760
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
the minister would rather die
than see his monarch humiliated.

761
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,760
Even if I made a huge mistake,

762
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,360
you shouldn’t insult my grandfather.

763
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,320
I’m just a weak girl.

764
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,200
I can’t beat you.

765
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,160
But I won’t take such an insult.

766
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,160
So, you must go to His Majesty

767
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,000
and let him judge who is right!

768
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,320
Get down!

769
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,080
Ban Hua!

770
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,200
Princess.

771
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,320
Justice rules in the Palace.

772
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,520
His Majesty will decide
who is right and who is wrong.

773
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,600
In this case,

774
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,600
please, Your Highness.

775
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,920
You two have a rapport today, do you?

776
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,760
All right, let’s do it.

777
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,520
Ban Hua, you beat a prince in public.

778
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,840
My father won’t forgive you this time!

779
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,400
Get off me!

780
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,640
Ban Hua, what have you
been eating since you were born?

781
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,720
You are stronger than a cow.

782
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,600
You claimed to be a weak woman,
aren’t you ashamed?

783
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,200
That’s because you are
weaker than a woman!

784
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,400
Let’s go!

785
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,280
Wait, my pants!

786
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,480
Let me put on my pants!

787
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,000
Let’s go!

788
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,160
Get off me!

789
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,400
Wait!

790
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,040
What’s wrong? Now you know
your mistakes?

791
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,080
It’s too late!

792
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,160
Take it.

793
