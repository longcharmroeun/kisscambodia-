<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,980
<i>Episode 12</i>

36
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,370
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,420
I’ve devoted myself
to our nation for decades!

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,610
I had my son at an old age.

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,420
My son is the only heir of our family.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,380
If my son can’t marry Princess Ban,

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,820
my wife will kill me

42
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,660
and then kill herself!

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,140
Your Majesty, I’ve worked for you
for so many years.

44
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,770
I could have credit
for hard work at least!

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,210
You once said

46
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,420
that I was your left hand.

47
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,660
If I die,

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,330
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,660
won’t you feel sad?

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,260
Your Majesty!

51
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,980
Your Majesty,
Prime Minister Yan gets paid,

52
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,050
but he doesn’t share your burdens.

53
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,170
Instead,

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,700
he’s threatening you with his life.

55
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,980
Your Majesty, please punish him

56
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,330
to maintain your dignity.

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,100
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,770
Count Cheng’an made sense.

59
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,980
Why is Prime Minister Yan

60
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,610
doing such a ridiculous thing?

61
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,890
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,730
Yan Zhen has true love.

63
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,770
Prime Minister Yan even

64
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,580
sacrifice his whole family

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,700
to make his son marry Princess Ban.

66
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,890
Such true love

67
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,610
is nowhere to be seen!

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,210
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

69
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,050
What are you doing?

70
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,450
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

71
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,330
Shut up!

72
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,730
Son, I’m so useless.

73
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,330
I’m sorry.

74
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,140
I can’t get you the wife you want.

75
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,580
I would be your mother

76
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,580
in our next life.

77
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,300
What are you doing?

78
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,380
Let go of me!

79
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,540
-Let go of me!
-Guards!

80
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,140
Yes!

81
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,010
Protect Mrs. Yan and Mr. Yan

82
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,170
and don’t get anything go wrong!

83
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,820
Yes!

84
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,580
Your Majesty!

85
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,100
If my son can’t marry Princess Ban,

86
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
I can’t explain

87
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,490
to my son or my wife!

88
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,170
My wife will

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,580
tweak my ears off, Your Majesty!

90
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,700
Help me! Help me!

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,330
I’m so embarrassed!

92
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,980
Your Grace.

93
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,690
Prime Minister Yan, what are you doing?

94
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,340
Your Grace.

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,860
Don’t do this!

96
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,400
Help me!

97
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,220
Prime Minister Yan, calm down!

98
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,890
-Your Grace!
-Calm down!

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,540
-Your Grace!
-Prime Minister Yan!

100
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,610
I hear you’re also henpecked.

101
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,100
You must understand me best.

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,980
Please show some mercy!

103
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,930
-Help me!
-Prime Minister Yan!

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,130
-Help me!
-Prime Minister Yan!

105
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,130
Come on, Ban.

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,420
Why are you keeping

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,300
so much private money?

108
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,300
Your wife doesn’t know, does she?

109
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,220
Leave me alone.

110
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,980
Okay now. Stop it!

111
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,250
Marquis Jingting.

112
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,420
Does your daughter really not want
to marry Yan Zhen?

113
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,490
Your Majesty.

114
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,660
Even if she wanted,

115
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,050
I wouldn’t

116
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,610
marry her to him.

117
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,130
Your Grace.

118
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,610
Are you going to arrest us?

119
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,050
I don’t mean that.

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,690
I just want you

121
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,730
to take care of your son.

122
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,250
If you do stupid things
and get him killed,

123
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,420
you’ll lose more!

124
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,810
If you don’t marry my son,

125
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,020
he will just die.

126
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,130
It doesn’t matter where he dies.

127
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,220
She’s ridiculous!

128
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,130
Fine.

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,540
Let me make myself clear.

130
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,050
I will never marry him!

131
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,420
If he dies here,

132
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,250
I’ll pay with my life.

133
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,690
-Hua!
-Your Grace!

134
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,250
Eunuch Wang.

135
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,730
Please give them to His Majesty.

136
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,930
Your Majesty, please review them.

137
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,900
There aren’t only bank notes.

138
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,900
There are also evidences

139
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,540
of someone’s crimes.

140
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,020
Yan Hui!

141
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,570
How dare you?

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,100
Haven’t I given you
enough position or wealth?

143
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,340
You’re still so greedy?

144
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,300
I’m sorry, Your Majesty!

145
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,100
You dealt official posts
and took bribes!

146
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,020
I’m sorry, Your Majesty!

147
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,540
Your wife doesn’t need
to tweak your ears off.

148
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,100
I’ll cut your head and give it to her!

149
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,300
I’m sorry, Your Majesty!

150
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,020
Your Majesty.

151
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,610
Prime Minister Yan has devoted himself
to our state for years.

152
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:41,930
He...

153
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,690
He should be punished.

154
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,100
But his merits equal demerits
and he doesn’t need to be executed.

155
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,300
Your Majesty.

156
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,810
Count Cheng’an made some sense.

157
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,460
But we must put an end
to the dealing of official posts.

158
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,900
We can’t convince the public
unless we severely punish him.

159
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,930
Shi Chonghai, stop being hypocritical!

160
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,130
Have you not done anything dirty?

161
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,490
You think you can have supremacy alone

162
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,170
after I die?

163
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,420
In your dream!

164
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,860
Prime Minister Yan.

165
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,730
You took bribes
and are still impenitent.

166
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,370
You...

167
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,860
You even slandered me
in front of His Majesty.

168
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,130
You took more bribes than me!

169
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,250
Guards!

170
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,170
Yes, Your Majesty!

171
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,780
Put Yan Hui in prison.

172
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,540
Search his mansion

173
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,370
and confiscate all his bribes!

174
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,020
Yes, Your Majesty!

175
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,300
Your Majesty! Spare me, Your Majesty!

176
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,610
Your Majesty,

177
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,610
what about my daughter’s marriage?

178
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,300
Let her make her own decision.

179
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,020
I don’t want to bother anymore.

180
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,170
Thank you, Your Majesty!

181
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,490
Here comes the imperial edict!

182
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,730
At the behest of His Majesty,

183
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,300
Yan Hui disregarded imperial favor
and ganged up.

184
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,570
He dealt official posts
and can’t be spared!

185
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,220
He’ll be dismissed right now

186
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,100
and be put in prison!

187
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,370
He will pay twice as many bribes
as he took.

188
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,220
Yan Zhen shall not marry Ban Hua!

189
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,730
Congratulations to you!

190
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,460
Now Yan Hui is in prison,

191
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,780
other ministers will all obey you.

192
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,900
Wu.

193
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,690
How many years have you worked for me?

194
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,260
Over twenty years.

195
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,780
The court has been in peace

196
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,450
for so many years.

197
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,500
The balance is now finally broken.

198
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,050
I’m afraid

199
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,660
something terrible is going to happen.

200
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,140
I was just wondering

201
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,020
why Marquis Jingting

202
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,450
had those evidences.

203
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,970
It was you, Count Cheng’an.

204
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,850
Up to this day,

205
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,740
you’ve made complete mistakes.

206
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,970
It’s just a winner-take-all game.

207
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,570
You’re wrong.

208
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,380
You’ve made three mistakes.

209
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,660
First,

210
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,810
you shouldn’t have dealt official posts
to disturb the court.

211
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,900
What a hypocrite!

212
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,540
Does any minister not do dirty things?

213
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,690
Second,

214
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,930
you shouldn’t have messed
with the Ban family.

215
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,210
I should have known.

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,690
Your Grace.

217
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,970
You want

218
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,330
to marry Ban Hua.

219
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,140
Third,

220
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,690
I didn’t find the evidences

221
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,500
that ruined your family.

222
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,520
<i>He set a trap and annoyed His Majesty.
The Rong family will be gone.</i>

223
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,920
<i>Detailed Records
of Dealing Official Posts</i>

224
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,740
Who found them?

225
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,570
The Shi family or the Xie family?

226
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,540
Why must you know it

227
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,380
to make yourself unhappy?

228
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,660
You don’t come to tell me this,

229
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,090
do you?

230
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,170
It’s clever of you, Prime Minister Yan.

231
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,420
Think about it.

232
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,740
If His Majesty knows

233
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,210
that his favorite courtier

234
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,570
is still checking the old case,

235
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,740
what will he do?

236
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,260
Can you still defend yourself?

237
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,090
Don’t worry about me.

238
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,900
Tell me the truth of the old case,

239
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,900
and I can keep your families alive.

240
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,810
What do you think of this deal?

241
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,300
What do you think? Use my plan?

242
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,740
You call the shots.

243
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,330
What a pity!

244
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,850
He used to be a living man
in the capital.

245
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,140
Bury him carefully.

246
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,420
All right. Go away.

247
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,450
Your Grace.

248
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,850
What’s wrong?

249
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,740
Shi Jin?

250
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,450
Shi... Shi...

251
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,090
Could it be Mr. Shi?

252
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,850
Hurry. Get me a writing brush.

253
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,210
Your Grace, what are you drawing?

254
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,140
An arctic fox fur cloak, can’t you see?

255
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,660
Could the man in black
be related to the cloak?

256
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:34,970
All right.

257
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,090
Go give it to the tailor.

258
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,210
Ask him to make it
with the best arctic fox fur.

259
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,330
Oh, no.

260
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,780
You want some new clothes again.

261
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
But didn’t you just mention

262
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,380
Mr. Shi?

263
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,210
Yes. I’ll go meet him, too!

264
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,020
Mr. Shi.

265
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,210
We’re kept to help Her Grace.

266
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,380
Now she needs us.

267
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
The best arctic fox fur
for making a cloak.

268
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,050
Go look for it!

269
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,620
Yes.

270
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,380
Search every corner!

271
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,540
Look carefully for it!

272
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,050
Search that place! And the back!

273
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,330
What’s happening?

274
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:12,970
Young Master.

275
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,970
What jewel does my sister want again?

276
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,020
This.

277
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,170
She dreamed of an arctic fox fur cloak.

278
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,850
She wants to have it
before the first snow.

279
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,570
She hasn’t found a husband yet.

280
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,210
Why is she looking for a cloak?

281
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,140
Last night, she also dreamed of Mr. Shi.

282
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,300
Why did she dream of that old man?

283
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,140
Shi Jin!

284
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,690
As estimated,

285
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,810
I think

286
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,660
she has seen Shi Jin by now.

287
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,970
Oh, no.

288
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,900
My sister will have a new sweetheart.

289
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
A new sweetheart?

290
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,570
What?

291
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,420
Who else?

292
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,210
Me!

293
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,540
Come on! Come on! Come on!

294
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,500
Come on! Come on! Come on!

295
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,050
Bravo! Bravo!

296
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,930
You have great marital arts. I lost.

297
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,620
You didn’t lose.

298
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,020
I used a trick.

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,260
Just now,

300
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,330
I used the Back-Thrust Spear
my grandfather taught me.

301
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,380
Otherwise,

302
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,090
you would have defeated me.

303
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,740
You’re as excellent as men.

304
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,140
I didn’t know you were also so generous.

305
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,540
I really admire you.

306
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,970
Mr. Shi, we both practice martial arts.

307
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,210
We don’t need

308
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,850
to flatter each other.

309
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,930
It’s generous of you, Your Grace.

310
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,170
Just like your grandfather.

311
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,970
Today, I experienced his martial arts.

312
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,170
I’m glad

313
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,330
I’ve admired him as my idol.

314
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,330
You admire my grandfather?

315
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,740
But compared to him,

316
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,210
I’m far weaker.

317
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,780
That’s great!

318
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,540
You helped us a lot

319
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,930
so that I didn’t need to get married.

320
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,690
On my way here,

321
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,260
I was thinking
what gift I should give you.

322
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,260
I don’t know what you like.

323
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,690
But now,

324
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,620
shall I teach you

325
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,380
my grandfather’s Back-Thrust Spear

326
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,570
as a gift?

327
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,500
Really?

328
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,810
Sorry, Your Grace.

329
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,090
It was my duty to help you.

330
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,690
I don’t need a gift.

331
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,620
Come on.

332
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,330
I always keep my promise.

333
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,380
Squat.

334
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,900
Come on.

335
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,970
Okay.

336
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,210
Yes.

337
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,850
Uh...

338
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,420
Is Count Cheng’an having no chance?

339
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,140
Very good.

340
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,690
Princess Ban and Shi Jin...?

341
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,020
Mr. Shi is a good man.

342
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,500
He’s strong.

343
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,540
It’s a good thing
if Princess Ban likes him.

344
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,660
What are you talking about?
Get out of the way!

345
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,540
I want to see Count Cheng’an.

346
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,210
Don’t be rude.

347
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,450
Your Grace.

348
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,540
Bad news!

349
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,500
What brings you here?

350
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,330
Hurry. Go get my sister,

351
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,170
or she’ll be with Shi Jin. Hurry.

352
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,210
Du Jiu.

353
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,020
They’re both single.

354
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,380
There’s no problem if they’re in love.

355
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,330
You really think so?

356
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,090
It doesn’t matter how I think.

357
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,130
The point is how she thinks.

358
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,540
There’s something terrible.

359
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,050
Do you know that my sister dreamed

360
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,460
of arctic fox fur cloak and Shi Jin

361
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,300
last night?

362
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,300
She dreamed of them,

363
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,020
so what?

364
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,330
My sister

365
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,890
only cares

366
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,020
for appearance, costume and jewelry.

367
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,130
Last night,

368
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,940
she dreamed of a cloak and Shi Jin.

369
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,090
Doesn’t it mean

370
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,890
that she also cares for him?

371
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,460
Young Master, you’ve known Princess Ban
for a long time.

372
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,180
What good luck you have
when she hasn’t dreamed of you!

373
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,410
What are you talking about?

374
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,260
This is how serious the problem is!

375
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,540
Your Grace,

376
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,810
do you really think
you’re not good enough for her?

377
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,180
Young Master Ban.

378
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,980
Young Master said that to be modest.

379
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,090
When you said so, you sounded...

380
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,410
In fact,

381
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,020
I ran all the way here

382
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,980
with a little selfish motive.

383
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,220
Think about it.

384
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,700
My sister forces me

385
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,370
to practice martial arts.

386
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,610
But if she marries Shi Jin...

387
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,940
I can already imagine

388
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,300
what a miserable life I will live!

389
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,220
They will torture me together.

390
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,890
If you want to use Young Master,

391
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
ask him if he wants that.

392
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,300
Your Grace.

393
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,050
Would you like to be my brother-in-law?

394
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,130
Brother-in-law, hold the book carefully.

395
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,650
Since your sister already

396
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,220
has a great man around

397
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,410
like Mr. Shi,

398
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,130
why do you think

399
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,220
she will like me?

400
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,300
Because...

401
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,980
I will help you.

402
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,220
Jin.

403
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,180
Grandfather.

404
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,780
You’ve practiced these two moves
for half an hour.

405
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,130
Princess Ban taught me the unique skills

406
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,740
Old General Ban mastered.

407
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,570
I was so absorbed that...

408
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,300
You mean Princess Ban taught you?

409
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,740
That’s great.

410
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,740
Did you give her any gift in return?

411
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,300
No.

412
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,890
My silly boy.

413
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,540
Marital arts have numbed you!

414
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,020
How can you

415
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
seize her heart then?

416
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,500
When I was young,

417
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,850
I was a passionate...

418
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,540
I’m asking you.

419
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,460
Why am I talking about myself?

420
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,740
You mean

421
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,780
I should give her something in return?

422
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,090
What should I give her, then?

423
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,460
I hear the Ban family is offering

424
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,090
a high price for the arctic fox fur.

425
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,370
I see, Grandfather.

426
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,090
You will marry her with such a speed!

427
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,610
Remember.

428
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,370
Buy the best at whatever cost!

429
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,460
Young Master, be careful.

430
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,540
Hunters always set traps in the wild.

431
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,850
Young Master,
your mother left them to you.

432
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,050
Take them down.

433
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,410
Are you sure, Young Master?

434
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,570
All of them.

435
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,680
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

436
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,810
You are...

437
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,220
Is Princess Ban in?

438
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,020
Your Grace, what do you want me for?

439
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,540
Your Grace.

440
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,020
I lost the bet.

441
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,090
I knew you were looking
for the arctic fox fur.

442
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,780
I happen to have some.

443
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,780
Unfortunately,

444
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,890
I’m on my way to see Shi Jin.

445
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,740
But my parents and my brother are home.

446
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,980
Help yourself.

447
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,880
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

448
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,330
Young Master.

449
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,460
How ungrateful

450
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,650
Princess Ban is!

451
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,650
Du Jiu.

452
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,050
Give the fur to Young Master Ban

453
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,890
so that she can make it into a cloak.

454
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,650
But...

455
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,980
Did I hurt you, Young Master?

456
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
It’s okay. Go on.

457
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,540
Leave us. I’ll take care of it.

458
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,130
Your Grace.

459
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,180
This is the Healing Elixir

460
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,810
my grandfather used at wars.

461
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,020
Your wound will form a scab
within three days.

462
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,090
You won’t have a scar, either.

463
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,650
Your Grace.

464
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,570
Luckily, the wound isn’t
on the left chest

465
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,740
and he can be crossed
off the suspect list.

466
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,780
Your Grace...

467
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,540
I... I can do it myself.

468
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,460
Don’t be shy.

469
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,540
Sit still!

470
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,740
Am I hurting you?

471
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,330
No, no, no.

472
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,890
You’re the gentlest girl

473
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,020
I’ve ever met.

474
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,810
You...!

475
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,570
Miss.

476
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,300
Count Cheng’an is walking
towards the bookstore.

477
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,650
Well, stick to our plan.

478
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,610
How shameless she is!

479
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,780
But my brother has a sense of shame.

480
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,810
Yeah.

481
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,850
Princess Ban must have

482
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,130
fallen in love with Young Master.

483
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,300
He was naked to the waist.

484
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,940
She just broke in.

485
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Keep your voice down.

486
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,850
I don’t care about her reputation.

487
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,570
But don’t ruin my brother’s.

488
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,050
Your Grace.

489
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,090
What a coincidence!

490
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,460
Greetings, Your Grace.

491
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,130
Greetings, Miss Shi.

492
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,130
Your Grace.

493
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,540
What a coincidence to meet you!

494
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,050
I have some paintings
to ask you for advice.

495
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,890
I wonder

496
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,700
if you can spare some time.

497
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,610
Miss Shi, you’re still unmarried.

498
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,610
I don’t want to disgrace you.

499
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,700
I’d like to leave.

500
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,650
Think about it.

501
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,810
Count Cheng’an gave her
such good fox fur.

502
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,370
She didn’t even take a look

503
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,850
before going to see Shi Jin.

504
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,130
Mother. Father.

505
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,370
You’d better start

506
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,650
to prepare the dowry for her.

507
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,330
Looks like

508
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,610
our daughter really fell in love
with Shi Jin.

509
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,810
I thought His Majesty used Shi Jin

510
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,940
to help us out.

511
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,740
Unexpectedly,

512
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,850
their relationship developed so quickly.

513
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,980
Mother. Father.

514
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,370
Do you really want

515
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,180
to marry her to Shi Jin?

516
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,410
Don’t you think about Count Cheng’an?

517
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,180
Young Master.

518
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,650
You don’t like Mr. Shi so much.

519
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,850
Are you afraid

520
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,890
that he’ll urge you
to practice martial arts?

521
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,570
I...

522
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,460
Anyway, I’ve told you

523
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,410
the importance of this matter.

524
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,370
Don’t wait

525
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,180
until what’s done can’t be undone...

526
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,220
Go boil the preys.

527
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,460
Daughter.

528
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,330
You went hunting?

529
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,180
Back from hunting?

530
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,570
I didn’t have time for hunting.

531
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,700
Mr. Shi hunted them for me

532
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,020
on the mountain.

533
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,460
He was even wounded.

534
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,460
He was?

535
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,300
An antelope is slain,
wrapped in white on the plain.

536
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,780
A maiden for love would long,
tempted by a hunter strong.

537
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,740
Could he...

538
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,570
Dear, you said so many words.

539
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,650
Why do they mean?

540
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,540
Your Grace.

541
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,260
How will you deal with the preys?

542
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,370
There are many kinds,
perfect for the hot pot.

543
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,700
That’s good.

544
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,740
What?

545
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,220
Nothing.

546
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,890
You look messy.

547
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
I tried to make it flat.

548
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,570
I don’t look messy.

549
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,260
I’m a bit tired. I need a rest.

550
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,540
Tell me when the hot pot is ready.

551
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,780
Okay. Go have a rest.

552
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,090
Dear.

553
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,180
You said a lot of words

554
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,570
including antelope.

555
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,570
What do they mean?

556
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,650
A Jade-like Maiden in Book of Poetry.

557
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,410
The next is...

558
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,700
He cuts wood on the plain,
another deer is slain.

559
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,330
He sees the white-dressed maid,
as beautiful as jade.

560
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,020
Mother, you said quite a lot.

561
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,410
But what do they mean?

562
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,890
Silly boy.

563
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,300
They mean

564
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,540
that Mr. Shi Jin gave Hua these things

565
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,850
to propose to her.

566
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,130
-What?
-Propose...?

567
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,810
-Uh...
-No way!

568
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,130
I must tell Count Cheng’an.

569
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,020
Dear, what do you think we should do?

570
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,650
Do nothing.

571
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,700
Count Cheng’an is good.

572
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,810
Mr. Shi Jin is also good.

573
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,180
Grandfather.

574
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,650
Today, Princess Ban came
to give you the Healing Elixir.

575
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,850
Did you give her any gift in return?

576
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,460
Thanks to your instruction,

577
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,090
I gave her something in return.

578
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,180
You finally begin to understand.

579
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,050
What did you give her?

580
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,460
I gave her all the preys I hunted.

581
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,130
Wrapped in white cloth?

582
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,020
How did you know, Grandfather?

583
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,020
Good! You didn’t waste your knowledge.

584
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,540
What did she give you?

585
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,940
Nothing,

586
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,700
but the Healing Elixir.

587
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,410
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

588
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,650
I believe

589
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,220
you’ll get her jade pendant.

590
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,050
Here.

591
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,650
It’s the fur cloak

592
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,020
made of the fur you gave me.

593
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,890
Shi Jin got a head start.

594
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,940
You can’t lose again.

595
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,500
We’ll have the hot pot tonight.

596
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,180
You must come with this cloak.

597
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,980
You will win for one time.

598
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,890
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

599
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,130
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
Master! Madam!

600
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,460
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

601
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,540
Your Grace! Young Master!

602
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,850
The hot pot is ready.

603
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,180
What a big dinner!

604
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,890
Yeah.

605
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,460
There’s a vacant seat there.

606
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,410
Why are you shoving me?

607
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,020
I’m not.

608
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,610
My eyelids keep twitching today.

609
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,410
I think

610
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,610
we’ll have a visitor.

611
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,980
He always tries to be mysterious.

612
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,300
Don’t do anything stupid.

613
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,610
If you disturb my dinner,

614
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,980
I’ll throw you into the pot.

615
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,890
Sister, you’ll be grateful to me.

616
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,740
Mind your own business.

617
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,330
What a big dinner we have! Come on.

618
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:37,940
Be careful not to burn yourselves.

619
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,650
Your Grace? Come on.

620
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,410
Your Grace. Your Grace.

621
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,700
Come on. Come, please.

622
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Greetings, everyone.

623
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,020
You’re just in time.

624
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,260
-Sit down and have dinner with us.
-Be seated.

625
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,780
Who invited him?

626
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,810
Rocky, get tableware for His Grace.

627
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,650
Okay.

628
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,410
Oh, yes. Get him the tableware.

629
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,020
Your Grace, enjoy yourself.

630
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,460
What kind of dip
would you like, Your Grace?

631
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,700
Whatever.

632
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,330
Dip?

633
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,780
Is this the hot pot
Young Master Ban mentioned?

634
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,700
Precisely.

635
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,700
This was the only effective means

636
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,300
my grandfather used
to inspire the army at war.

637
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,460
It can inspire the army?

638
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,180
I’ve never heard of it before.

639
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,220
Oh, there’s something
you haven’t heard of?

640
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,650
Don’t laugh at me, Your Grace.

641
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,780
Could you introduce the hot pot

642
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
to me?

643
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,810
My grandfather reformed
the Double-Flavor Pot

644
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,810
into Trellis Hot Pot.

645
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,650
So, there are nine flavors.

646
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,500
Spicy, light soup, sour soup,

647
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,130
mushroom soup, tomato soup, bacon pork,

648
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,940
pig’s feet, pork stomach with chicken

649
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,130
and special soup of Western Regions.

650
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,370
Your Grace, which flavor

651
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,410
do you like best?

652
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,610
Spicy and special soup
of Western Regions.

653
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,220
Don’t talk too much. Just eat it.

654
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,300
You have a good taste, Your Grace.

655
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,090
It’s the baby chicken Mr. Shi hunted.

656
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,180
It tastes great.

657
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,890
It’s the meat of baby chicken?

658
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,850
How cruel it is!

659
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,610
I won’t eat it.

660
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,020
I’ll enjoy it, then!

661
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,410
Come on. Here it is.

662
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,850
Try this. It tastes good.

663
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,300
Come on. Try this.

664
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,050
It’s the venison Mr. Shi got.
It’s fresh.

665
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,940
It’s...

666
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,610
It’s too cruel.

667
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,460
Why don’t you have it, Young Master Ban?

668
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,970
Goat meat.

669
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,260
Have some goat meat.

670
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,450
All right?

671
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,220
Yes, yes.

672
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,780
The goat meat Mr. Shi gave us

673
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,850
tastes wonderful.

674
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,740
Hua.

675
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,300
Your Grace, try this.

676
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,450
Meat of frog.

677
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,180
It’s simple food. Enjoy yourself.

678
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,300
Have some.

679
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,930
Mother.

680
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,970
It’s so considerate of Mr. Shi.

681
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,580
Everything he hunted
is my favorite.

682
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,620
I’m so sorry.

683
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,930
I just remembered

684
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,740
that I went to pray
with His Majesty lately.

685
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,970
I’m in the fasting period.

686
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,140
May I have some vegetables?

687
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,700
-Softy!
-Vegetables.

688
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,810
Vegetables.

689
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,530
All right.

690
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,260
Enjoy them.

691
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,850
Enough?

692
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,930
Far enough.

693
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,300
Your Grace.

694
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,060
Don’t take her words seriously.

695
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
She’s angry with you,

696
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,700
because you told His Majesty

697
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,060
you weren’t good enough for her.

698
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,220
Just explain to her.

699
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,330
Don’t stop me.

700
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,300
Tell Hua

701
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,450
that you just tried to be modest, right?

702
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,700
Your Grace.

703
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,580
I’m full.

704
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,580
-Hua!
-Sister!

705
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,740
Hua. Hua. Listen to me.

706
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,140
Listen to what? You only talk nonsense.

707
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,180
What the hell!

708
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,010
I’ll go explain to her.

709
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,520
Go.

710
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,990
-Okay.
-Hurry!

711
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,530
-Go, go!
-Go. I support you.

712
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,300
Hurry.

713
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,260
Your Grace! Your Grace!

714
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,620
Let me explain.

715
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,580
What would you like to say?

716
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,010
How will you go on satirizing me?

717
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,850
You think I’m not humiliated enough?

718
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,220
I never satirized you.

719
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,100
I never tried to humiliate you, either!

720
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,780
Fine.

721
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,180
What reputation do you have?

722
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,740
What reputation do I have?

723
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,490
The best man said
he wasn’t good enough for me.

724
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,300
You mean I’m not good enough
for you, right?

725
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,180
If you don’t like me, just tell me.

726
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,580
You don’t need to be hypocritical.

727
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,810
Sounds like

728
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,220
you really get me wrong.

729
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,260
I was telling the truth

730
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,370
by saying that I wasn’t
good enough for you.

731
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,890
Sounds like fresh news.

732
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,930
Your Grace, why don’t you explain

733
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,450
how you’re not good enough for me?

734
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,970
Your Grace.

735
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,220
You have a gorgeous face,

736
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,410
a forthright character

737
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,060
and a harmonious family.

738
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,970
These are precious things to me

739
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,180
which I can hardly have.

740
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,810
Every time I see you,

741
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,530
I want to get close to you,
but I hesitate.

742
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,890
Because...

743
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,300
I’m not confident

744
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,010
to give you

745
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,330
a better future.

746
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,780
That’s why I said

747
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,060
I wasn’t good enough for you

748
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,060
when His Majesty asked if I loved you.

749
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,450
See?

750
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,620
Even the heaven doesn’t believe you!

751
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,100
Ban Hua!

752
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,490
What did you do, then?

753
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,330
You and Shi Jin easily

754
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,530
got in a relationship.

755
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,410
Why are you angry

756
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,580
for what I said to His Majesty?

757
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,930
Who was in a relationship with Shi Jin?

758
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,620
I have a bad reputation.

759
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,300
But I’m not a casual girl!

760
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,930
He gave you the antelope
wrapped in white cloth.

761
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,370
You accepted it

762
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,300
and you ate it so happily!

763
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,700
You’re so weird.

764
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,140
If you really care how I feel for you,

765
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,850
why did you accept another man?

766
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,780
What are you talking about?

767
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,490
Stop kidding me.

768
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,010
An antelope is slain,
wrapped in white on the plain.

769
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,580
A maiden for love would long,
tempted by a hunter strong.

770
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,140
He cuts wood on the plain,
another deer is slain.

771
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,810
He sees the white-dressed maid,
as beautiful as jade.

772
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,930
“Oh, soft and slow, sweetheart!
Don’t tear my sash apart!”

773
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,370
The jade-like maid says, “Hark!
Do not let the dog bark!”

774
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,580
Let me get to the point.

775
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,220
You accepted what Shi Jin hunted.

776
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,300
Still don’t admit it?

777
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,660
You’ve experienced everything

778
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,890
in the poem.

779
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,530
What...

780
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,740
What did you say?

781
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,850
A maiden for love would long?

782
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,490
Rong Xia.

783
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,850
Do you think I understand that?

784
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,410
How little you know about me!

785
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,100
Fine. Tell me.

786
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,530
I gave you the fox fur.

787
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,450
But you only cared for Shi Jin’s wound,

788
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,260
and didn’t even look at me.

789
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,970
Regardless of your own reputation,

790
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,810
you broke into his bedroom
and gave him the Healing Elixir.

791
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,180
That’s fine, then.

792
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,660
You even applied the Elixir
to him personally.

793
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,020
Have you ever considered for me?

794
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
You sent someone to stalk me?

795
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,450
Don’t change the topic!

796
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,780
I just want to ask

797
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,030
why you did that!

798
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,740
I...

799
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,060
You sound so baffling!

800
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,240
Shi Jin was wounded
when hunting the fox for me.

801
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,890
I should give him the Healing Elixir.

802
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,680
I just ate some meat
of baby chicken and deer

803
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,260
he had hunted.

804
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,850
But you distorted my motives.

805
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,060
This is nothing,

806
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,930
but your own imagination.

807
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,370
I don’t know
what you’re thinking about.

808
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,780
Forget it.

809
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,850
I don’t want to argue.

810
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:18,874
