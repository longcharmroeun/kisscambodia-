1
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:15,766
ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,460
Let go!

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,730
Speak already!

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,330
Let go!

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,530
Tell me!

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,930
She said let go.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
Move.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,280
This is no place for you.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,510
You want me to move?

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,750
I'm ordering you as your boss.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
Move, Chae Hyun-seung.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,110
Senior Yoon.

13
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,250
I think you should be the one leaving.

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,289
Get out of my girl's face, you rascal.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,910
What did you just say?

16
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,440
Did you forget who I am?

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,510
You're BM Lee, Song-ah's ex-boyfriend.

18
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,009
You know, and yet you
talk to me like this?

19
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,009
Yes.

20
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,750
Did you make the first move?

21
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,430
I shook her up.

22
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,250
No matter who she was with,
I couldn't give her up.

23
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,320
Not to someone like...

24
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,250
Get over here, Yoon Song-ah.

25
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,960
Tell me yourself.

26
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,200
Yoon Song-ah!

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,960
If you don't want to move, we'll leave.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,270
Let's go.

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,400
Wait.

30
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,730
He's right.
My feelings for you have changed.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I like him so much
that I don't even feel sorry.

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
You don't even feel sorry?

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,100
No.

34
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,970
Not at all.

35
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,290
No matter what you do, it won't work.

36
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,310
So stop it.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,930
Tell him to go away so that we can talk.

38
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,410
I'm done talking to you.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,640
You should leave.

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,720
He's gone.

41
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,490
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,160
Don't say that.

43
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,780
I know this is tiring,

44
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,960
but don't think about it first.
Go get some sleep.

45
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,760
Okay?

46
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,940
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

47
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,079
<i>Meet me at the coffee shop
across the street.</i>

48
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,330
EPISODE 4

49
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,260
Americano with two shots of espresso

50
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,480
and two pumps of vanilla syrup, right?

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,180
Thanks.

52
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,370
You don't listen to others, do you?

53
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,140
Did you get some sleep?

54
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,740
Do you want to take a day off?
I'll do all the work.

55
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,610
It's okay.

56
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,890
I guess I still have a long way to go.

57
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,650
I'll do better.

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,420
I rejected you,

60
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,700
and yet I ended up taking your hand.

61
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,530
But I'm glad.

62
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,190
For not leaving you all alone
at that moment.

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,360
Anyway, I owe you a favor.

64
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,340
Though I don't know what to do next.

65
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,020
Just trust me and follow my lead.

66
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,260
Trust your boyfriend.

67
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,020
Not for real.

68
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,920
Yes, fake boyfriend.

69
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,410
Don't worry.

70
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,550
If something were to happen,
I'll take care of you.

71
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,290
Nothing will happen at work.

72
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,220
He's not that kind of person.

73
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,290
You never know.

74
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,130
We should be careful.
Don't make it too obvious.

75
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,260
We'll only fake it in front of BM Lee.

76
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,950
What will happen if it's obvious?

77
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,310
Oh.

78
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,670
Okay. I'll be careful, Senior Yoon.

79
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,010
Promise?

80
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,850
Yes, I promise.

81
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,540
Aren't you getting off?

82
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,910
Senior Yoon.

83
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Yes.

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,660
As written in the report,
the sales stop at 103% this month.

85
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,830
I talked to the Sales Department
to increase the number,

86
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,160
but the situation is not good.

87
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,570
How's the progress for the new product
launching next month?

88
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,740
We'll launch it
at the beginning of next month.

89
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,970
What's the sales percentage?

90
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,440
The sales goal for
next month is 33 billion won...

91
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,040
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

92
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,240
Yes, sir?

93
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,180
Why don't you answer this?

94
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,960
It's 8.2 billion won.

95
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,120
The sales percentage is about 25%.

96
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,150
Can you classify it?

97
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,490
The department store is 2.8 billion won,

98
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,960
and for other distributors...

99
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,600
Is the department store
the only distributor to you?

100
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,800
I'll check the others next time.

102
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,840
Next time?

103
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,730
Don't you think it'll be too late?

104
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,180
Your mind is a million miles
away from work.

105
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,720
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

106
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,190
Yes, sir?

107
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,790
Have you tried the new product
launching next month?

108
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,890
Yes.

109
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,960
Where? On the back of your hand?

110
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,500
Do consumers only
apply products on their hands?

111
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,500
Assistant Manager Kang.

112
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:50,390
Did you test the product
only on the back of your hand?

114
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,970
I tested it on my face too.

115
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,010
Assistant Manager Ahn?

116
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,380
Me too.

117
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,170
Why did you only try it on your hand then?

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,750
Is it because you're a man?

119
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,760
If that's the case,
you're not suited for our brand.

120
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,330
Or do you despise KLAR and the BM so much

121
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,620
that you just can't be bothered?

122
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm sorry,

123
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,900
I'll test the products properly next time.

124
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,190
Do you have something to say, ABM Yoon?

125
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,020
I'm sorry, sir.

126
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,820
I thought I taught him well,

127
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,110
but I wasn't good enough.

128
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,060
From now on,

129
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,970
I'll keep him closer
to my side and teach him.

130
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,620
It hasn't worked until now.

131
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,430
Do you think he will improve
if you keep him closer?

132
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,540
I'll keep doing it until he does.

133
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,150
As his trainer, I'll take
the responsibility till the end.

134
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,790
Is he going through something?

135
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,140
It's going to be okay.

136
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,180
Don't mix business with pleasure, sir.

137
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,720
I think you need the advice more than me.

138
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,860
Everyone will face criticism at work.

139
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,470
But if it was someone else,

140
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,920
you wouldn't have done it
in front of everyone.

141
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,990
What's the reason?

142
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,740
No matter how hard I think,
I can't understand why.

143
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,310
There was no problem between us.

144
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,200
That's why I'm breaking up with you.

145
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,040
You should know what the problem is,

146
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,880
but you don't.

147
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,410
This isn't the way to do this.

148
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,380
You should have talked to me

149
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,440
instead of dragging
a third party into this.

150
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,890
Do you really want to end it this way?

151
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,490
We're done talking.

152
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,960
In your plan for the next 10

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,560
or 20 years in your life,

154
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,230
I'd always been
a part of your future, right?

155
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,100
So reconsider it.

156
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,700
How about you?

157
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,290
Will I be a part of your future
for the next 10

158
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,940
or 20 years in your life?

159
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,930
Is that the reason?

160
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,880
You want me to assure you?

161
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,020
No.

162
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,060
What I want is to end
our relationship here and now.

163
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,990
What is it about him
that you like so much?

164
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,580
Let's talk after work.

165
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,840
That'll be better.

166
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
No,

167
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,030
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

168
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,780
Do you like the food here?

169
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,750
It's so delicious.

170
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,180
I was really curious about this place.

171
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,010
I'm finally here thanks to you.

172
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,050
I heard this place is really popular.

173
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,990
It'll take months to get a reservation.

174
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,260
Really?

175
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,160
Your husband must be
really close with the owner-chef.

176
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,970
He probably is.

177
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,140
He's always at home or at the clinic,

178
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,000
but sometimes he'll come home late

179
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
when he hangs out with the chef.

180
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,340
Lucky you.

181
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,160
You married a hotshot doctor

182
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,110
who has an oriental medical clinic.

183
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,680
And he's also a family man.

184
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,720
I heard that you're close
with your mother-in-law too.

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,520
Of course, she treats me
like her own daughter.

186
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,160
Sometimes, I think
I might really be her daughter.

187
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,130
I don't think so.

188
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,230
You always wish that Grandma
would move to the South Pole.

189
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,370
How could a real daughter...

190
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Be quiet!

191
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,470
She had a fever this morning.
Why is she talking gibberish?

192
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,670
You should eat well to get well soon.

193
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,270
Eat up.

194
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,210
Open your mouth.

195
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,260
Good girl. How precious!

196
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,510
Oh, right.

197
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,690
I heard that the chef is still single.

198
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,960
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?

199
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,530
If he doesn't, I want to
introduce him to my sister.

200
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,900
Children, here's your dessert.

201
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,510
We'll get going now.

202
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,520
Good work today.

203
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,840
Goodbye.

204
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,480
He's well suited for my sister.

205
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,180
Why hadn't I thought of that before?

206
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,690
It's hard to see
what's right under your nose.

207
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,590
He's young, good-looking

208
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,350
and excellent at what he does.

209
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,030
Chef Ryu isn't seeing anyone, right?

210
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,670
I couldn't ask him directly,

211
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,500
so I asked his staff.
They said he's not seeing anyone.

212
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,300
Is it true?

213
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,290
Probably.

214
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,370
I knew it!

215
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,640
Every Jack has his Jill.

216
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,740
My sister is his Jill.

217
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,890
It's too early to do it this year.

218
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,380
They should get married next year.

219
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,350
Mom should make her wedding dress.

220
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,120
Should I call her?

221
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
But

222
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,720
I don't think he'll
be interested in marriage.

223
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,100
Of course, he isn't.

224
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,980
That's why he's still single.

225
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,580
But it doesn't matter.

226
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,720
We can make him interested.

227
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,920
I'm more worried about my sister.

228
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,120
I'll talk her into it.

229
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,910
You don't want to do this?

230
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,330
Do you think it'll be weird?

231
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,310
It doesn't matter.

232
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,980
He's your best friend anyway.

233
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,380
He's much better

234
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,400
than a complete stranger.

235
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,410
Honey,

236
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,990
let's set up a date.

237
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,930
You talk to the chef

238
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,490
and I'll talk to my sister, okay?

239
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,090
This week. What do you think?

240
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,550
Ha-eun said she wants cake.

241
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,030
Let's go get it.

242
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,240
What in the world am I doing?

243
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,670
I thought we'd go on a date,

244
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,610
but you only think about Ha-eun.

245
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,420
Let's go home.

246
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,920
Good work today, bye.

247
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,980
Goodbye.

248
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,150
Goodbye.

249
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,510
See you tomorrow.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,100
{\an8}AUNT

251
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,630
I'll wait for you at Anemona.

252
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,570
Hyun-seung.

253
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Yes?

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,270
Do you have dinner plans tonight?

255
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,680
No.

256
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,550
Let's go check the products after work.

257
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,620
It might take a while.
We should go eat dinner first.

258
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,390
Okay, I'll set up the products
in the meeting room.

259
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,390
Alright.

260
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,640
Goodbye.

261
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,619
You did that on purpose, right?

262
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,410
What?

263
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,530
Just before we left.

264
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,490
Should I meet him alone?

265
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,890
What do you think?

266
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,859
Should I smash him
so that he won't come near you?

267
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,070
Are you a thug? Why would you do that?

268
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,610
Stop talking nonsense and eat your food.

269
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,870
We don't have much time
to study the products.

270
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,900
Today isn't the only day.

271
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,920
We have tomorrow and the day after that.

272
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,330
And an excuse to be together.

273
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,020
I should thank him.

274
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,640
He gave me a reason to be with you.

275
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,430
You promised.

276
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,560
You're only helping me and that's it.

277
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,610
Why?

278
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,160
Are you worried if
I would break my promise?

279
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,500
Yes, I'm worried sick.

280
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,160
Don't worry,

281
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,610
I won't haunt you for this.

282
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,380
But there's a risk though.

283
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,290
You might just fall for me.

284
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,790
What?

285
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,940
Eat your kimchi.

286
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,940
First, the base.

287
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,980
It's totally different when you apply it

288
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,680
on your hand and your face.

289
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,250
Let's prep your skin.

290
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,410
Wait a second.

291
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,950
I'm ready now.

292
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,690
Here.

293
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,560
I need to wipe my face, right?

294
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,800
Wipe your cheeks, T-zone and U-zone.

295
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,680
Let's go straight to the base.

296
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,900
You know the effects, right?

297
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,970
Geez,

298
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,410
I did make a mistake for
applying it only on my hands,

299
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,080
but I know the theory inside out.

300
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,600
This is the Actress Cream.

301
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,610
Hand.

302
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,510
You should...

303
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,190
Trust me, I know the theory really well.

304
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,590
Dab, dab, dab like this.

305
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,060
Roll it out with your index
and middle finger.

306
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,920
Wow, the shine!

307
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,110
Don't I look glowy?

308
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,950
Our KLAR team is the best.

309
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,460
Don't roll it too wide.

310
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,010
Do lightly around the eyes
with middle fingers.

311
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,190
Be careful not to get it in your eyes.

312
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,980
Ow!

313
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,490
What's wrong?

314
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,520
I got it in my eyes.

315
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
It's in your eyes?

316
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,320
Yes.

317
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,090
I told you to be careful.

318
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,500
Here, wipe it.

319
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,230
I can't right now.

320
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,600
Why can't you? Here.

321
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
I can't touch my eyes.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,870
Come here then.

323
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,940
Why?

324
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,620
Come here, I'll do it for you.

325
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,550
Senior Yoon?

326
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,350
Oh.

327
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,410
Done. Open your eyes.

328
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,510
Now I can see again.

329
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,210
Are you alright now?

330
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,910
Yes, I think so.

331
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,620
Let's do it again then.

332
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,730
My eyes are red.

333
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,360
How are you?

334
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,600
You've gotten so pretty.

335
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,960
Have a drink. So pretty.

336
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,810
Hey, Steve!

337
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,610
How have you been?

338
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,580
I've been well.

339
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,640
How's your English?

340
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,700
I've improved.

341
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,610
Let's drink it up.

342
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,580
Cheers!

343
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,920
Bottoms up!

344
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,800
<i>What I want is to end
our relationship here and now.</i>

345
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,360
How dare you drink alone!

346
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,090
You said you weren't coming.

347
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,600
Why are you here by yourself?

348
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,910
What's the matter?

349
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,880
Nothing.

350
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,120
I just felt like drinking.

351
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,130
I understand.

352
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,690
I've been stressing you out lately

353
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,890
with sales and E-Project, right?

354
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,470
There's no one I can trust but you.

355
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,400
This is the hotshot, Lee Jae-shin, right?

356
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,170
Jae-woon's right-hand man.

357
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,090
Of course, he's a hotshot.

358
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,610
Our company is doing so well
all thanks to him.

359
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,430
Really?

360
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,250
We're thinking of
jumping into cosmetics too.

361
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,850
Lend Lee Jae-shin to me for a while.

362
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,860
I'll return him after I use him well.

363
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,520
Hey, how much is he paying you?

364
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,880
Doesn't matter, I can give you
that much too.

365
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,830
Is your annual salary 100 or 150 million?

366
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,220
Hey, are you drunk?

367
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,870
If you are, go play somewhere else.

368
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,520
I'm not drunk.

369
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,280
So how much?

370
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,740
Never mind, I'll just
give you 300 million.

371
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,180
Only if you do as much work
as you did for him.

372
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
That's it?

373
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,680
That's puny.

374
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,290
He's got some nerve!

375
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,650
But

376
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,720
I won't go no matter how much you pay me.

377
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,660
I'm picky with people.

378
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,680
I'm calling it a night.

379
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,540
You little numbskull.

380
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,810
Do you think nobody knows

381
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,140
how you're leeching off of Jae-woon?

382
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,850
You'd never mix in here without him.

383
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,680
Know your place.

384
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,310
Why? Am I wrong?

385
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,330
Correct me if I am.

386
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,230
Are you deaf? Speak up!

387
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,200
It's you who should know your place.

388
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,980
What if your family finds out that

389
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,360
their heir gambled off a secret fund?

390
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,710
What will happen?

391
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,080
I think your brother
would love to hear that.

392
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,350
Should I go meet him?

393
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,100
Why flinch?

394
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,930
Pathetic.

395
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,210
Lee Jae-shin!

396
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,350
Good job.

397
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,420
That was awesome.

398
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,040
Why did you come out?

399
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,380
I was getting bored anyway.

400
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,990
It was like seeing the old Jae-shin.
I loved it.

401
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,590
That was so you.

402
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,130
Do you want to go
somewhere else for drinks?

403
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,500
There's a cool bar over there...

404
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,380
No thanks.

405
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,770
I want to take a breather tonight.

406
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,180
Is that so? Okay then.

407
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,530
But you can't say no next time.

408
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,220
The girls there are hot.

409
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,290
Thanks for driving me home, drive safely.

410
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,860
Wait.

411
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,300
What is it?

412
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,700
I guess Lee Jae-shin isn't here.

413
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,470
Are you not going to call him BM Lee?

414
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,890
No, I'm not.

415
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,880
Age alone can't earn respect.

416
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,280
That jerk has failed to meet my standards.

417
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,250
If you find fault with me later,

418
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,510
would you talk down to me too?

419
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,450
Not necessarily.

420
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,770
Fine, do whatever you want.

421
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,520
But if you speak down
to my face, I'll kill you.

422
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Okay.

423
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,230
Song-ah.

424
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,140
Why you little...

425
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,540
Your heart fluttered, right?

426
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,980
You're right, my heart fluttered.

427
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,910
I found an opportunity
to hit you on the head,

428
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,870
so my heart's fluttering like crazy.

429
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,680
I've been waiting for this day.

430
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,750
Seriously!

431
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,570
You're not even dodging it?

432
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,990
You can hit me. It's you.

433
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,100
Here, hit me.

434
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,060
Hit me.

435
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,340
You thought I wouldn't do it, right?

436
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,040
If you go over there,
you'll find a big hospital.

437
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Give me the receipt.

438
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,940
-Concussion...
-Bye.

439
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,620
No, my head...

440
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,250
Let's just play soccer.

441
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,110
A man's sport is basketball.

442
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,850
Zero, zero...

443
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,090
Stay still.

444
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,320
Where is Lee Jae-shin?

445
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,290
Where is Lee Sae-dong's son?

446
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,160
Oh, there he is!

447
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Hey!

448
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,940
You know where your father is, right?

449
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Where is that swindling crook?

450
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,760
I don't know.

451
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,440
How can you not know?

452
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,040
He said he needed to support you.

453
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,050
He begged us and took off
with our hard-earned money!

454
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,250
Do you know how hard
we worked to save up the money?

455
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,420
So why did you get conned?

456
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,320
What, you scumbag?

457
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,630
You look down on us

458
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,910
because you're a top student, is it?

459
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,200
It's messed up.

460
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
What?

461
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,200
Did I ask you for a scholarship?

462
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,070
Am I the one who deceived you?

463
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,710
You were the ones
who fell for his sloppy schemes.

464
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,430
Why are you taking it out on me?

465
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,340
I didn't get a penny of your money.

466
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,780
I don't have to pay you back.

467
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,000
So, don't ever touch me.

468
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,860
What is he saying?

469
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,000
What are we going to do?

470
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,050
Why did you want to see me?

471
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,240
I want you to buy me.

472
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,760
Pay off my father's debt
and send me abroad to study.

473
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,500
I don't want to be transferred.

474
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,220
Why should I?

475
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,870
You have a lot of money.

476
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,970
If I leave now,

477
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,410
I'll live in the ditches forever.

478
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,410
What's the condition?

479
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,540
I'll be your dog forever.

480
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,910
But I don't need a dog.

481
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,450
Let's be friends, it'll be fun.

482
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,140
Just follow the plan.

483
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,830
When you receive the materials,

484
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,150
send it to us immediately.

485
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,490
Thank you for the meal, Director Lee.

486
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,620
I look forward to your support.

487
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,460
Of course, so do we.

488
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,020
That way.

489
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,030
Yes.

490
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,060
Sir, should I proceed with your schedule?

491
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,930
Yes, just follow the schedule.

492
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,650
Sir?

493
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,480
Yes?

494
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,220
Sir?

495
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
What?

496
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,590
What the...

497
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,770
I'm seeing things now?

498
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,670
I'm going to get sick at this rate.

499
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,510
Should I just commit a crime?

500
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,670
What?

501
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,320
Two, then swing. Good, just like that.

502
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,080
Two, then swing!

503
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,040
She's married.

504
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,230
I should think about
my status and dignity.

505
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,730
No matter what happens,

506
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,900
I should maintain the common courtesy.

507
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,670
Wait a second,

508
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,790
she might be a divorcee

509
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,450
or a single mom.

510
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,260
Did you receive any call
from Ms. Lee Hyo-joo?

511
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,790
No, I didn't.

512
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,950
I see.

513
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,090
I'm so exhausted these days.

514
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,770
I need extra attention today.

515
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,980
Yes, ma'am.

516
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,960
<i>The phone has been turned off.</i>

517
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,670
<i>Please leave a voicemail.</i>

518
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,630
<i>Hello, this is Hara.</i>

519
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,870
<i>I need to talk to you
about your wedding dress</i>

520
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,790
<i>but I can't seem to reach you.</i>

521
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,190
<i>It's very important,</i>

522
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,540
<i>please call me as soon as you can.</i>

523
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,910
So the mascara dries out quicker?

524
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,200
Yes, it wasn't like that before.

525
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,080
Whenever we open a new tester,
it won't last long.

526
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,220
The number of customers
are still the same though.

527
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,050
I'll take it back and check on it.

528
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,690
Okay.

529
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,760
Are the other mascaras okay?

530
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,990
I think it's the same for all of them.

531
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,290
Manager.

532
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,860
Just a second.

533
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,690
You must be busy, go on ahead.

534
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,120
I'll call you as soon as possible.

535
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,130
Okay.

536
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,310
Are you looking for
something in particular?

537
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,910
I wonder which one is better?

538
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,350
They're both pinky shades,

539
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,780
but the upper one has more beige

540
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,390
while the bottom one has coral in it.

541
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,010
I work for this brand.

542
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,760
Is that so?

543
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,930
I'll take the upper one then.

544
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Okay.

545
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,730
Did I make you uncomfortable?

546
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
No.

547
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,719
It's not over yet.

548
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,699
Our relationship won't end that easily.

549
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:01,050
She turned her head for a second

550
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,540
because I upset her.

551
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,960
You're being used, Hyun-seung.

552
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,520
I heard that you two dated for two years,

553
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,890
and yet you know her less than I do.

554
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,420
When she says no, she really means it.

555
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,890
You lost your chance to get her back.

556
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,840
We will reconcile.

557
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,240
As you said, we dated for two years.

558
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,840
If you have an ounce of sincerity,

559
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,030
you should stop now

560
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,970
before it gets too ugly.

561
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,730
What gives you the audacity to be so rude?

562
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,070
I want to protect her.

563
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,420
No one has my back.

564
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,470
I just want to protect her,

565
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,230
and I will.

566
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,420
You're back.

567
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,870
What happened?

568
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,230
Nothing.

569
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,810
Really?

570
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,070
Nothing happened?

571
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,760
You went to the store, right?

572
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,680
Yes.

573
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,800
Why?

574
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,090
What happened?

575
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,180
I met the woman.

576
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,480
Did you,

577
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,480
by any chance, hit her?

578
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,730
She wished.

579
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,480
I pulled her hair out.

580
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,530
All of it?

581
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,300
Are you actually believing this?

582
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,510
Of course, since you said it.

583
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,520
She's quite pretty,

584
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,080
but not as pretty as me though.

585
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,280
She managed to be less pretty?

586
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,370
You little...

587
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,980
Why? What's wrong?

588
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,470
Actually, Lee Jae-shin...

589
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,030
He knocked me into a wall

590
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,670
and threw coffee at me.

591
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,670
Liar.

592
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,020
It's true.

593
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,440
Really? He really did that?

594
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,240
Do you need to go to the hospital?

595
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,940
No, not the hospital.

596
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,300
What then?

597
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,900
I need you to keep me close to your side.

598
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,820
Anywhere, everywhere.

599
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,390
Seriously!

600
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,420
Hey!

601
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,670
My throat...

602
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,340
Seriously.

603
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,420
This is so good.
The meat melts away like honey.

604
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,160
Manager Ahn,

605
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,590
why are you so excited?

606
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,660
Are you that happy as BM Lee isn't here?

607
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,620
A little, I'm a little happy.

608
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,690
Even though he's great,
he's still our boss.

609
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,800
Why isn't BM Lee coming?

610
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,620
He just told me to go without him.

611
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,660
He didn't say why.

612
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,930
He doesn't look so well these days.

613
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,530
I guess he didn't want to dampen the mood.

614
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,140
Right, Hyun-seung!

615
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,040
Yes?

616
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,170
You're not seeing anyone, right?

617
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,070
Why are you asking me that?

618
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,480
I want to introduce you to someone.

619
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,680
She's an elementary school teacher.

620
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,870
You guys will go so well together.

621
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,790
What do you think?

622
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,890
Oh, I don't really want to.

623
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,610
Why? You two will be a perfect match.

624
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,150
She's really great.

625
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,600
It's okay, I'm good.

626
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,360
Go out for dinner with her then.

627
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,870
How about tomorrow?

628
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,480
I'll tell her to come to our office.

629
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,740
I'll text her now.

630
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,330
No! Don't!

631
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,810
What? Why are you stopping me?

632
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,910
Stop it, don't do this again.

633
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,680
This is another type
of workplace harassment.

634
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,650
Harassment?

635
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,250
Alright, just forget it!

636
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,690
Hyun-seung, we'll talk later.

637
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,960
She will change your mind...

638
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,440
I said don't! He has one!

639
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,430
What? What does he have?

640
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,230
What do you think?

641
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,800
He has one, so don't...

642
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,770
What on earth does he have?

643
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,820
A girlfriend?

644
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,810
Girlfriend?

645
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,810
Context-wise, that's the answer.

646
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,650
Do you really have a girlfriend?

647
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,290
What?

648
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,490
Since when?

649
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,040
No...

650
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,720
Tell us quickly. Do you have one or not?

651
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,260
You do, don't you?

652
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,290
-You do, right?
-Have another drink.

653
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,230
-Tell us quickly.
-He has one for sure.

654
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,530
-Do you really have a girlfriend?
-Tell us quickly. You do, right?

655
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,210
One-sided love!

656
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,740
Yes, it's just one-sided love.

657
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,740
One-sided love?

658
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:40,049
Out of the blue?

659
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,850
Who is it then? Is it someone we know?

660
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,520
She must be from the office
because Manager Yoo knows too.

661
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,120
Someone from the office?

662
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,330
Who is it?

663
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,740
Who is it, Manager Yoo?

664
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,640
I don't know!

665
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,830
Who is it?

666
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,830
Huh?

667
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,630
Who is it?

668
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,330
Hyun-seung, who is it?

669
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,370
Who is it? Huh? Who?

670
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,020
Who is it?

671
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:27,608
You like someone?

672
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,500
Hyun-seung, you can't go home
until you tell us!

673
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,180
-You can't leave.
-No way.

674
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,800
Ma'am, can I get a crate of beer?

675
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,920
One crate of soju, please.

676
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,060
Don't touch it.

677
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,590
I'll mix it up for you.

678
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,480
No, it's too much.

679
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,100
Never mind!

680
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,600
Okay, I'll tell you.

681
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,370
Tell us.

682
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,140
Tell us.

683
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,690
Tell us.

684
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,650
It's Manager Yoo!

685
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
I knew it!

686
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,390
I'm going home.

687
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,310
She's belching.

688
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,360
I guess he likes belching women.

689
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,540
Use this.

690
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,370
I can't believe it.

691
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,420
Some more tissue, please!

692
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,300
Where's the bathroom?

693
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,510
The meat's getting burnt. Eat more.

694
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,570
There's more.

695
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,560
They're so persistent.
We almost got caught.

696
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,650
It was really tough.

697
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,460
Right, what if they really find out?

698
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,930
Still, how could you turn against me?

699
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,400
You'd only save yourself, huh?

700
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,500
Of course, we can't die together.

701
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,040
That's despicable.

702
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,370
If you and I ever fall into the water...

703
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,690
Then what?

704
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,950
I'll save you, no matter what happens.

705
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,870
I should protect my senior.

706
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,770
Anyway, what should we tell Manager Yoo?

707
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,990
I think she suspects us.

708
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,450
Tell her what? Just leave it.

709
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,450
What do you mean?

710
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,160
Even though it's fake,

711
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,920
office romance must be done in secret.

712
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,790
It's not good to go official.

713
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,110
Play innocent, okay?

714
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,700
Okay.

715
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,090
You are taking a cab, right?

716
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,090
BM LEE JAE-SHIN

717
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,940
DIRECTOR LEE WANTS WAREHOUSE INVENTORY.

718
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,970
TELL CHAE HYUN-SEUNG
TO DO IT, THANK YOU.

719
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,210
It's a bit different, so compare them...

720
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,680
Hyun-seung.

721
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,570
Yes, sir.

722
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,300
Do you have an urgent business?

723
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,520
I'm going to an event hall
with Senior Yoon later.

724
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,060
Oh, the event hall.

725
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,190
Why? Is there something you want us to do?

726
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,140
Director Lee asked for something urgent.

727
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,650
Can you go to
the event hall alone, Song-ah?

728
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,040
It's okay, I can go alone.

729
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,140
Hyun-seung, go to the warehouse
and take inventory.

730
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:35,880
Yes, sir.

731
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,760
All the samples too.

732
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,290
Including the samples? Okay.

733
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,070
Thanks.

734
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:40,910
Sure.

735
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,480
This is Petit La Bene,
the main hall on the second floor.

736
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,200
Various company banquets were held here.

737
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,350
It's smaller than the one on first floor,
but the view is better.

738
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,010
We adopted European style
for the decoration.

739
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,350
We hung a chandelier
to give it a luxurious vibe.

740
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,760
Can we call for another catering company?

741
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,640
Our banquet hall
is connected to the square,

742
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,470
and so the lighting is very good.

743
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,100
That's why customers prefer this place.

744
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,160
People usually favor warm light.

745
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,840
If it's necessary, we can
hang curtains to cover it up.

746
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,770
The size is perfect here.

747
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,070
Can I look around on my own?

748
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,480
Yes, of course.

749
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,510
Thank you.

750
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,420
I'm back.

751
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,130
You're done?

752
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,760
Yes, I'll send you the file.

753
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,520
Good job.

754
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,630
Thank you.

755
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,200
Sit on a chair, you'll bend the table.

756
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,270
Where is BM Lee?

757
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,430
He said he went to check on a store.

758
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Okay.

759
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:37,890
Oh, sir!

760
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,430
What should I do
with the warehouse inventory?

761
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,190
What inventory?

762
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,730
BM Lee said you wanted it
reported by today.

763
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,350
Me?

764
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:48,910
Yes.

765
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,440
It wasn't me.

766
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Just send it to BM Lee.

767
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,340
Okay, goodbye.

768
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,180
Did I make a mistake?

769
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,050
No, I was right!

770
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,060
He told me to take inventory.

771
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,910
Are you done here?

772
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:35,850
Yes.

773
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,610
Let's go, I'll drive you.

774
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,840
What is this about?

775
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,500
You're mixing in personal life
with work again.

776
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,590
I have nothing to say.

777
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,870
You should at least explain to me

778
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,410
so that I can understand.

779
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,050
Do I not even deserve that?

780
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,570
I've already chosen someone else.

781
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,930
The reason doesn't matter anymore.

782
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,390
What if I say I don't care?

783
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,390
As long as you come back to me,

784
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,050
I won't care about that.

785
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,990
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

786
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,860
Let's get married.

787
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,270
Let's get married.

788
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,320
SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

789
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,730
Get married?

790
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,860
When you said you wanted to go public,

791
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,250
didn't you think about marriage too?

792
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,260
Let's do it.

793
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,140
I'll do everything you want

794
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,980
as long as you come back to me.

795
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,080
So I'd be the one walking down the aisle

796
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,470
at the wedding ceremony one month later?

797
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,040
What do you mean?

798
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,290
You know it better than anyone.

799
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,610
Tell me.

800
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,010
Will I be the bride at that wedding?

801
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,550
So that's the reason.

802
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,100
When did you know about that?

803
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,720
Scratch that.

804
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,650
You should've asked me first.

805
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,540
You should've checked with me

806
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,750
instead of doing this.

807
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,490
What would you have said?

808
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,860
What lies would you tell me again?

809
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,980
I've been sincere to you
in every single moment.

810
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,780
If not, I would've told you easily.

811
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,540
Why can't you think that way?

812
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,330
Stop making ridiculous excuses.

813
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,040
You got the reason,
so don't ever show up like this.

814
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,320
Song-ah.

815
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,660
What are you going to do?

816
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,620
Are you going to call off the wedding?

817
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,540
You should've called it off.

818
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,630
If you really have an ounce of sincerity,

819
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,860
you should've called it off

820
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,100
while I was still smiling in front of you

821
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,330
out of ignorance.

822
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,670
You have no regard for me.

823
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,470
How ridiculous was I?

824
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,520
Is this your sincerity? Really?

825
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,820
You piece of trash.

826
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,270
Still, we shouldn't end it this way.

827
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,900
You haven't heard me out yet!

828
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,470
Let go!

829
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,430
Song-ah, please!

830
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,050
-Please listen to what I have to say.
-Let go!

831
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,250
-Song-ah, please.
-Stop it!

832
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,220
Song-ah.

833
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,590
Senior Yoon!

834
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,140
Song-ah, listen to me. Let's talk.

835
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,950
-Stop.
-Listen to what I have to say.

836
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,090
That's enough.

837
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,870
Song-ah, listen to me...

838
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,610
Stop it!

839
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,740
Stop.

840
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,930
I said stop!

841
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,270
Stop it now.

842
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,330
Let's go.

843
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:19,200
Drink this, you'll feel better.

844
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,530
What about you?

845
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,740
Are you okay?

846
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,440
Go to the hospital.

847
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,850
Don't worry about me.

848
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,560
If it wasn't for you,

849
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,320
I wonder what would've happened?

850
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,810
If you didn't tell me about it,

851
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,620
perhaps

852
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,610
I wouldn't have been able to break it off

853
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,100
even if he tells me the truth.

854
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,320
If he were to say that
he was forced to do it,

855
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,940
I would've accepted it.

856
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,500
If he tells me to stay by his side,

857
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:27,890
I would've stayed

858
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,580
even though I know it's wrong.

859
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,730
Thank you.

860
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,220
Thanks for everything.

861
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,540
I'm not even embarrassed
in front of you anymore.

862
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,400
I'll forget it.

863
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,400
So you should forget it too.

864
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,140
Okay, good.

865
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,120
Beautiful.

866
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,410
Can you move closer to the bride, sir?

867
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,330
Good.

868
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,960
Wider smile, please.

869
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,540
Yes, very good.

870
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,660
Look at each other.

871
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,400
Smile.

872
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,610
Yes, give us a wider smile.

873
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,290
Yes.

874
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:28,770
Okay.

875
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,230
Okay, good.

876
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,390
Okay, great.

877
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,450
Can you move closer to the bride, sir?

878
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,660
Okay. Sir, can you look at the bride?

879
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,780
Look at each other with love.

880
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,960
Good, okay.

881
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,040
Put your hand on the bride's shoulder.

882
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,880
The groom is stiffening up again.

883
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,390
Look at each other one more time.

884
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,330
Okay, good.

885
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,230
It looks new.

886
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,730
Why did she throw it away?

887
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:06,910
That sucker.

888
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,390
Hey! Yoon Song-ah!

889
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,110
What are you doing?

890
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,290
I'm tired, I don't want to go out.

891
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,090
I think I'm going to go overboard.

892
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,990
The customer yesterday
was unbelievably rude.

893
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,640
I'm going to die from stress.

894
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,230
So, don't say anything
and do as I tell you.

895
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,730
What are you going to do?

896
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,490
Just wear this!

897
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,030
Why?

898
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,390
Cheers!

899
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,890
Cheers!

900
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,360
Why? Are you waiting to hear from someone?

901
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:58,980
No, it's nothing.

902
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,820
It doesn't seem like nothing.

903
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,420
Who is it? Is it someone special?

904
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,100
Mind your own business.

905
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,420
Fair enough,

906
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,220
I'm the one in trouble.

907
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,050
Give me some ideas
for the new launch promotion.

908
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,470
Manager Jung said he'll kill me

909
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,020
if I don't bring anything.

910
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,000
By the way,

911
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,420
you two were in
the same marketing club in college.

912
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,020
You must've a lot of ideas.

913
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,090
Company is different from college.

914
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,280
There's nothing you can use.

915
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,650
Still, there could be something.

916
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,390
Just throw it, I'll filter the ideas.

917
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,380
My suggestion is to think practical.

918
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,710
You can consult other industries too.

919
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:38,980
Industries?

920
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,160
That's easy to say...

921
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,290
This won't do.

922
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,810
It won't do, right?

923
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,120
I'll go outside for a while.

924
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,120
Huh?

925
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,060
You're not abandoning me, are you?

926
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,870
You can't leave me!

927
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,160
I'll be really upset!

928
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,860
Hello?

929
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,670
Senior Yoon.

930
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,420
Hi. What's up?

931
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,690
I'm just wondering
how your weekend's going?

932
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,460
It's going well.

933
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:16,850
That's good.

934
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,910
What did you do today?

935
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,470
Did you stay at home all day?

936
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:22,360
Don't you need to cheer up?

937
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,550
I'm outside right now.

938
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:26,050
Don't worry. Have a good weekend.

939
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,260
Bye.

940
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,000
Who was it?

941
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640
No one.

942
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,650
Let's go inside.

943
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,270
Hey,

944
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,750
do we really have to go in there?

945
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,290
Let's just go to a bar and drink.

946
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,930
Hey! If we're only going to drink,

947
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,350
we'd be at home now.

948
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,670
Everything is on me tonight.

949
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,760
Don't say anything and do as I tell you.

950
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,310
You should relieve some stress too.

951
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,700
Does it have to be this place?

952
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,130
Let's go!

953
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,090
Huh?

954
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,640
Senior Yoon?

955
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,280
Hey, Ga-young.

956
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:32,690
Hey!

957
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,640
Yes, good. Okay.

958
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,370
Last three shots!

959
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:27,560
Okay, last one. Smile!

960
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,070
Thank you, good work.

961
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:33,750
Well done!

962
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,470
Well done!

963
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:42,960
See you after we get changed.

964
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,720
Okay.

965
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,960
I'll remove the makeup for you.

966
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:48,160
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

967
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,440
Alright then.

968
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,480
<i>I want to be confident about it.</i>

969
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,500
I don't want to be hidden all the time.

970
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,950
<i>For the next 10
or 20 years in your life,</i>

971
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,010
did you ever consider me as a part of it?

972
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,960
<i>If you have an ounce of sincerity,</i>

973
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,520
you should've called it off

974
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,720
while I was still smiling to you

975
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,230
out of ignorance.

976
01:07:37,341 --> 01:07:39,944
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

977
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,470
<i>Manager Kang, you'll be
Chae Hyun-seung's new trainer.</i>

978
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:46,160
<i>He'll be working closely
with Manager Kang.</i>

979
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,070
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

980
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:49,170
<i>You're suffering because of me.</i>

981
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,860
<i>I'm really okay.</i>

982
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,080
<i>He thinks we're dating,</i>

983
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,940
<i>so he'll surely split us up.</i>

984
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,510
<i>Become a director before the wedding
and go to Europe after that.</i>

985
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,990
<i>It's perfect, isn't it?</i>

986
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:01,480
<i>Do you really want to end it like this?</i>

987
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,180
<i>You can't walk all over me.</i>
