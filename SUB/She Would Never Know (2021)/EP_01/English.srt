Yes, we put in
our basic skincare ingredients.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,990
It moisturizes the skin

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,920
and gives the skin a healthy glow.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,490
I can feel the moisturizing effect.

00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,700

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,600
How to apply it? By using your hands?

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,140
Oh, right.

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,790
The researcher told us to use the hands,

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,870
but we think it'd be better to use a puff.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,070
We'll develop them together.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,250
Yes, I agree with you.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,790
I'll focus on the basic ingredients,
and its moisturizing glow effect

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,090
during the training, okay?

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,040
Also, emphasize how it
differs from the existing ones.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,370
We'll send you the material.

20
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,190
By the way, ABM Hyun-seung
can do it all by himself now.

are still struggling.

I wonder who taught him.

00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,560
She taught me.

25
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,150
Send me an adequate amount of samples.

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:07,670
Okay.

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,770
You're heading back, right?
I have another meeting.

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,200
Thank you for your hard work.

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,520
Thank you.

30
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,370
I'm glad I taught you well.

31
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,450
It's so rewarding.

32
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,520
You think I'm a kid, right?

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,389
Not a kid, per se.

34
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,030
Why? Did I offend you?

35
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,260
Not exactly.

36
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,740
But you're treating me more like a kid
as compared with my older sisters.

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,560
I'm only a year younger than you.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,090
It's a one-year difference in age,

39
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,050
but two-year difference
in working experience.

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,720
You really are a kid.

41
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,760
Let's go, we'll miss the bus.

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,940
Okay.

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,290
Did you pack all the samples?

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,520
Yes, I did.

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,240
-You'd better not leave anything behind.
-Huh?

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,560

Wait.

It's good if it turns out well,
but if it doesn't...

78
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,990
I can't bear to think about it.

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,930
And it's worse for the woman.

80
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,590

81
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,300
Right,

82

How in the world
would sales go up on their own?

138
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,740
It goes up because
our BM and ABMs work hard.

You have no basic manners,

153
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,630

Yes, sir.

159
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,890
I owe you again. Thanks, BM Lee.

160
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,260
It won't happen again next month.

161
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,840

162
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,880
Right, I really hope it will.

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,450
Of course it will.

164
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,340

and so I want to repay your kindness.

165
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,470
You still play tennis
with the director, right?

166
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,440

and head out for a meal.

167

The world is so unfair.

170
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,900

should have more spare time,

171

But the incompetent ones...

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,570
It's almost time for evaluation.

174
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,690
Be concerned about your sales, BM Seo.

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,630
By the way,

176
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
you should only play tennis
for the sake of your health.

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
Serves him right.

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,490
What do you think about office romance?

179
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,690
What?

180
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,580
I was listening back there

181
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,850
and wondering if
it's really that inconvenient.

182
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,810
You have to be careful.

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,060
When you're dating,
people make a huge fuss about that.

184
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,340
And you have to keep seeing
that person after breaking up.

185
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,890
There are more cons than pros.

186
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,640
So you won't date at work, is it?

187
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,900
Me?

188
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,520
I'd be reluctant.

189
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,360
But still, if you like someone,

190
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,460
what can you do but date them?

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,880
If you see anyone dating secretly,
just ignore them.

192
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,430
Okay.

193
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,680
-Keep on looking.
-Okay.

194
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,980
How's the new product?

195
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,720
The sales aren't bad.

196
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,010
Yes, it's selling well.

197
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,610
But can you make us a mirror
for sales promotion?

198
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,850
That brand's got a pretty mirror.

199

Over there.

200
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,190
May I help you?

201
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,470
It's okay, I'm just looking around.

202
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,870
What are you doing?

203
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,030

I'm doing market research.

206
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,400
You're making it obvious that
you're from a competitor.

207
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
Am I?

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,240
Do you need any help?

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
It's okay, thank you.

210

Yes, please!

212
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,110
Can you pick one

213
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,200
for my girlfriend?

214
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,610
Pick one, honey.

215
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,280
Your girlfriend is so beautiful.

216

Right? What's the best one here?

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,250
In this line, this product
is the best seller.

218
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,060
Would you like to test this out?

219
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,500
Do you want to try it on?

220
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,840
You are unbelievable.

221
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,220
We can't do market research
out in the open.

222
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,590
I'll let it slide. Just this once.

223
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't you remember what happened
the first time we worked together?

224
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,990
People suspected if we were dating.

225
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,130
Things have cooled down now,

226
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,340
but they still want to ship us.

227
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,360
What if someone saw what happened?

228
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,470
Well, I just...

229
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,490
I know.

230
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,610
It's because you feel at ease with me.

231
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,780
Still, it's better to be careful

232
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,020
to avoid misunderstanding.

233
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,220
I might seem like an old fossil,

234

I've experienced.

Yes.

I'm sorry, I didn't think it through.

Senior, you should take it.

242
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,520
It's okay, I have a lot of lipsticks.

243
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,110
But you don't have this one.

244
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,310
Even if you have a lot,
you only apply the same one.

245
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,030
This one looks good on you.

246
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,630
Well, anyway. You should take it.

247

Take it as a thank-you gift
for teaching me well.

248

Well, I did work really hard.

Thanks, I'll use it well.

252

Okay, but

They used to.

He doesn't like you?

He's just friendly.

278
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,390
Perhaps because he has two sisters.

279
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,100
Wow, he has two sisters?

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,170
Lift your chin.

366
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,960
Slightly to the right.

367
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,430
Lower your hand.

368
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,280
Lower.

369
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,340
Look at the camera.

370
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,110
Not like that.

371
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,910
Like this.

372
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,500
Like this.

373
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,480
This angle is the best for you.

374
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,090
Okay, last ten shots.

375
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,500
Director!

376
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,410
What's the matter?

377
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,740
Do you

378
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,370
have a boyfriend?

379
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,610
No.

380
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
Give me your phone number then.

381
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,340
I have a husband.

382
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,480
What?

383
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,370
Honey!

384
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,860
I had fun today.

385
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,770
He has such a unique hairstyle.

386
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,910
I did well, right?

387
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,660
You were creepy.

388
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,080
When someone helps you,
you should say thank you first.

389
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm hungry. Just drive.

390
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,300
Alright.

391
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,490
[How are you going to celebrate
your birthday? Do you have any plans?]

392
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,390
[You should take it.]

393
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,600
[It looks good on you.]

394
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,550
[You have to use it.]

395
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,710
I'm going upstairs for a meeting.

396
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,110
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

397
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,330
What would you like to order?

398
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
One Iced Americano
with two shots of espresso

399
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,880
and two pumps of vanilla syrup, please.

400
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,050
I'll have one Iced Americano.

401
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,710
I'll have the same as the first one.

402
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,670
Love you, my colleague.

403
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,240
I'll buy it for you next time.

404
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,380
Yuck, why is it so sweet?

405
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,910
This isn't your style.

406
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,910
How is it?

407
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,150
Whoa, man.

408
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,520
What's wrong with your taste?

409
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,270
I like it.

410
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,590
What?

411
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,720
You poor scoundrel.

412
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,090
If your work life is tough,
you must say it out.

413
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,300
How could you do this to yourself?

414
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,860
Why are you here?

415
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,760
Assistant Manager Jung
told off Min-seong again.

416
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,420
Seriously, that guy...

417
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,140
He's a total disaster for a trainer,
but he said I'm the disaster.

418
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,010
I have the worst boss.

419
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,190
I might stand up against him one day.

420
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,130
-You haven't done it yet?
-No.

421
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,590
But when he goes back to the office,

422
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,740
he'll say he admires
the assistant manager.

423
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,090
Man.

424
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,290
Of course, that's what I'll do.

425
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm going to work here for a long time.

426
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,670
As long as they don't kick me out,
I won't leave on my own.

427
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,140
Honesty is your biggest charm.

428
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,060
Have you fallen for me?

429
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,380
Do you want to go out with me?

430
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,160
I'm not really into office romance.

431
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,910
What should I do, Hyun-seung?

432
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,300
-What should you do?
-Stop.

433
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,100
Hyun-seung!

434
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,080
It's your birthday soon.
What are your plans?

435
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,060
When is it?

436
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,930
Thursday.

437
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,260
Oh! Let's hang out that day.

438
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,440
No!

439
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,170
We won't meet up. No. Never.

440
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,340
I'll get going now.

441
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,590
Hey, hold on.

442
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,700
He downright refused.

443
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,900
Senior Yoon.

444
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,300
Yes?

445
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,020
What are you doing on Thursday?

446
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,650
Do you have any plans?

447
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,720
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

448
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,710
♫ Happy birthday, dear Hyun-seung! ♫

449
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,970
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

450
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,210
Cheers!

451
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,630
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

452
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,290
That hits the spot!

453
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,230
Wow, I'm full.

454
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,140
Beef for dinner and drinks afterward.

455
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,660
The birthday boy is buying everything.

456
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,700
Sorry for being a freeloader.

457
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,810
Stop being one then.

458
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,140
You buy the drinks.

459
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,160
-Me?
-Yes.

460
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,340
You said you feel sorry.

461
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,030
You should be paying then.

462
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,840
Are you finally paying?

463
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,810
Hey, I paid once in a while.

464
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,800
Everything is on me tonight.
You're all celebrating my birthday.

465
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,390
-You should've said that earlier.
-I was holding back on my appetite.

466
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,890
She never says she'll buy.

467
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,690
Why are you spending
your birthday with us?

468
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,410
You must have a lot of friends.

469
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,860
Right. Even if you have no girlfriend,

470
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,250
do you not have any friends either?

471
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,360
Come on, sir. I have a lot of friends.

472
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm here because I like my teammates.

473
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,000
He's buttering me up.

474
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,100
Poor Hyun-seung,

475
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,580
you should meet people outside the office.

476
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,100
With your face and your talent!

477
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,670
I'll set you up...

478
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,410
He'll do well on his own.

479
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,610
What decade are you living in?
Stop bugging him.

480
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,550
Good job.

481
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,940
What? Bugging?

482
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,740
Assistant Manager Ahn, stop bugging him.

483
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,550
You're a terrible matchmaker.

484
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,270
Sir, you are nagging me now.

485
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,840
I didn't tell you, but

486
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,550
there are eight couples...

487
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,270
Are you waiting for a phone call?

488
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,150
No.

489
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,340
By the way, it's my treat here.
As a birthday gift.

490
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,500
I refuse.

491
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,070
Why? It won't be much.

492
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,600
That's why I refuse.

493
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,260
Tell me what you want then.

494
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,790
Nothing expensive though.

495
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,960
It doesn't have to be an object, right?

496
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,700
Later, when we finish here...

497
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,780
Excuse me.

498
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,510
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Okay.

499
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,010
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

500
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,660
You should make more friends.

501
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,150
Cheers.

502
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,090
Cheers.

503
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,370
BM Lee has finished his meeting.

504
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,250
We'll have one last drink when he comes.

505
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
Already? Why?

506
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,220
Let's hang out some more!

507
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,170
Karaoke! How about karaoke?

508
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,670
Karaoke? Sounds good!

509
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,130
Not for me.

510
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,140
I thought you liked it.

511
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,700
Why not? It's not that late.

512
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
Hyun-seung, you're coming, right?

513
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,180
-Of course, he will.
-Me?

514
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,340
Let's go to a karaoke bar. It's on me.

515
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,600
I don't know.

516
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,000
Let's go.

517
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,430
You're making me uncomfortable.

518
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,220
You have to go.

519
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,110
You'll go, right? You're going, right?

520
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,130
Stop, you're making me exhausted.

521
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,930
Let's go together.

522
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,270
I have to go to the restroom.

523
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,760
The restroom? Not karaoke?

524
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,820
Make it quick! Be ready!

525
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,350
It's dangerous.

526
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,239
You startled me! When did you get here?

527
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,380
Just now.

528
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,630
Seriously.

529
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,920
Did you have dinner?

530
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,200
Yes.

531
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,340
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

532
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,230
Did you drink a lot?

533
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,610
Moderately.

534
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,700
Which means you drank a lot.

535
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,840
Aren't you going to ask me
how the talk went?

536
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,610
I'm sure it went well.
It's you who did it.

537
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,850
It didn't go well.

538
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,270
It didn't?

539
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,640
What should I do?

540
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,920
What else can you do? Go see them again.

541
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,370
Why aren't you heading back?

542
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,000
Do you really want me to go?

543
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,490
Yes.

544
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,220
I'm leaving!

545
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,330
I actually did well.

546
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,890
Seriously.

547
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,100
Let's go, everyone's waiting.

548
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,710
Did you get home safely last night?

549
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,900
Yes.

550
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,500
You disappeared while
I was out for a second.

551
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,830
Did your friends call you?

552
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,680
Yes.

553
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,790
You were up all night, right?

554
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,170
You look really tired.

555
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,200
Chae Hyun-seung,
aren't you getting on the lift?

556
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,540
You two go ahead first.

557
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,270
What's the matter with him?

558
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,820
Who?

559
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,580
Hyun-seung. He doesn't look good.

560
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,520
I wonder if he's okay.

561
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,210
Aren't you paying
too much attention to him?

562
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,600
He's my trainee.

563
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,000
Are you jealous?

564
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,290
Maybe?

565
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,260
Have a good day.

566
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,090
-I'm going upstairs for a meeting.
-Yes, sir.

567
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,040
General Manager Yoo.

568
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,580
[I'm going upstairs for a meeting.]

569
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,730
Do you want another beer?

570
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,600
Come by the shop tomorrow
and get your present.

571
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,250
She's taken.

572
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,310
That never crossed my mind.

573
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,320
That's why she doesn't care about me.

574
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,660
I had no idea.

575
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,560
How pathetic.

576
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,470
Is there someone you like?

577
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,020
Did you tell her?

578
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,980
I didn't even get to that part.

579
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,710
You like her a lot, right?

580
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,580
I guess so.

581
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,700
Are you trying to figure out
what to do now?

582
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,210
The weather is so nice.

583
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,590
It's so depressing.

584
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,260
Nobody asked me out on a day like this.

585
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,670
You're right, the weather is so nice.

586
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,730
Why aren't you on a date?

587
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,740
He's busy.

588
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,070
Again?

589
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,070
Why is your BM always
busy on the weekends?

590
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,760
It's suspicious.

591
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,300
It's because he's meeting the director.

592
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,980
Hey!

593
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,760
Darn it.

594
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,100
I heard that they are friends.

595
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,360
Yes, since high school.

596
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,550
They studied abroad together, too.

597
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,740
But why do I hear that they are cousins?

598
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,830
Probably because their names are similar.

599
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,290
Also, he got the BM position
soon after he got in.

600
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,850
-Is that a good thing?
-Nobody cares about it now.

601
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,580
Because

602
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,780
he's very capable.

603
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,330
You're so hyped when you
talk about your boyfriend.

604
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,310
-Do you like him that much?
-Yes, I like him a lot.

605
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,920
Will you introduce him to your mom?

606
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,350
Do you think about getting married?

607
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,390
You said you weren't interested.

608
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,510
I used to.

609
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,200
Used to?

610
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,110
If I introduce him to my mom,

611
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,890
she'll go berserk, right?

612
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,440
Are you really thinking
about marrying him?

613
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,730
It's okay, I have one here.

614
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,010
You always draw a hard line.

615
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,090
Play easy. It's not a tournament.

616
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,420
You'll blow out my knee.

617
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,330
One more round?

618
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,220
No, I need to leave now.

619
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,890
Where are you going?

620
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,050
Oh,

621
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,570
poor fellow.

622
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,420
You really are thinking
about marrying him!

623
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,690
So, stop suspecting him from now on.

624
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,520
No gossip, okay?

625
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,240
Okay.

626
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,320
What about your mom?

627
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,580
She'll go crazy when she finds out.

628
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,070
Why think about that already?

629
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,240
I don't even know
if he feels the same way.

630
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,380
Of course he feels the same way.

631
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,390
You guys have been
going out for two years.

632
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,120
If he doesn't feel the same way,
then that son of a...

633
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,450
Man.

634
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,430
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

635
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,820
You have someone you love.

636
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,600
I envy you.

637
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,660
You should start dating already.

638
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,700
Did you get some sleep?

639
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,630
Right, your present.

640
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,330
I should

641
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,240
stop, right?

642
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,420
She looked so happy.

643
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,190
Get back inside. Thanks for the clothes.

644
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,050
Call me whenever you need
a drinking buddy.

645
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,750
No way.

646
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,670
When I'm with you,
people think you're my girlfriend

647
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,280
and no woman will come near me.

648
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,110
You only think about yourself, is it?

649
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,790
You should think about yourself too.

650
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,530
They're here.

651
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,360
Bride Lee Hyo-joo,

652
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,120
groom Lee Jae-shin,

653
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,680
welcome.

654
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,730
I'll escort you to the second floor.

655
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,580
Do you know them?

656
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,440
Yes, they're our customers.

657
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,280
Why? Do you know them?

658
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,790
So, are you saying that

659
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,520
those two people

660
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,010
are getting married?

661
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,570
Ji-seung,

662
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,140
I can't give up

663
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,050
on this crush.

664
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,540
What?

665
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,920
What kind of dress should I make you wear?

666
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,120
A simple one?

667
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,070
Or a glamorous one?

668
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,990
What are you talking about?

669
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,350
Your wedding dress.

670
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,850
We need to think about that.

671
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:15,150
Hey! I'm not getting married right away.

672
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,360
It's good to be prepared in advance.

673
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,540
You have no friends or siblings,
but me to help you.

674
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,620
I'll be your big sister

675
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,280
and make arrangements for your wedding.

676
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,610
Thank you, Big Sister.

677
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,100
I'm so honored.

678
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,840
But first, take that eye booger out.

679
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
Eye booger?

680
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,320
The other side!

681
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,410
Stop talking nonsense
and get ready for work.

682
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,580
Bye.

683
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,040
Let's talk some more later.

684
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,540
Come home early!

685
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,910
-Okay?
-Whatever.

686
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,700
[The wedding is three months later.
What are you going to do?]

687
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,970
Did you have a good weekend?

688
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,990
Not so bad.

689
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,500
What about you? How are you doing?

690
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,400
Not so bad.

691
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,820
Hello.

692
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:35,270
Hi.

693
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,560
Pardon me.

694
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,730
Get on, Senior Yoon. Over here.

695
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,930
Okay.

696
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,390
Did you have a good weekend, sir?

697
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,960
I did. How about you?

698
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,910
Not so good for me.

699
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,060
I saw something nasty.

700
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,570
You look really tired.
You must've been busy

701
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,690
going here and there.

702
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,960
Why don't you get off first, sir?

703
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,540
Sir?

704
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,560
Hyun-seung, what...

705
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,490
What's the matter?

706
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,830
It's not bad.

707
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,230
The title already says about
requesting for container purchase,

708
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,730
so you don't have to write that again.

709
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,980
I think you should take this phrase out.

710
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,960
The numbers are accurate, right?

711
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,860
Owing to the high expectation
for the new essence,

712
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,120
we received a good response for
Evaluation Team.

713
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,170
It's better than what we thought.

714
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,730
We're considering increasing the quantity.

715
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,720
We ran a cost simulation.

716
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,460
Even if we double the quantity,

717
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,970
it's still within the monthly budget.

718
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,720
If you approve it, the factory has agreed

719
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,990
to supply additional products this week.

720
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,230
What's wrong, Hyun-seung?

721
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,330
Sorry, my clothes caught on something.

722
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,110
Shall we do that?

723
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,220
Yes, check with the factory one more time.

724
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,110
[What on earth has gotten into you?]

725
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,350
Why are you acting like that to BM Lee?

726
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,370
What is it? Tell me.

727
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,890
I'm asking you now. What's going on?

728
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,990
Hyun-seung!

729
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,420
If you see anyone dating secretly,
just ignore them.

730
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,510
I'll put up with it for now

731
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,570
since you don't want to be discovered.

732
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,690
What are you talking about?

733
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,600
Put up with what and discover what?

734
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:57,360
-Can't you see BM Lee is...
-However,

735
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,300
if I think it's gone far enough,

736
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,690
I won't just stand by.

737
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,860
Because I'm protective.

738
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:12,930
I'll get going now.

739
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,380
Come on in.

740
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,130
Why are you drinking all of a sudden?

741
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,030
I just felt like it.

742
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,700
Why do you want to drink?

743
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,020
Did you talk with BM Lee
about getting married?

744
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,480
Did he say no?

745
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,610
Then what? Did something happen
with your product?

746
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,300
It's about Hyun-seung.

747
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,480
I think he wants to quit his job.

748
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,920
Your trainee? Why?

749
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,920
He's good at his job
and gets along with everyone.

750
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,550
He's doing great.

751
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,120
Did he confess his love for you
and get rejected?

752
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,800
Seriously.

753
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,690
I thought he was doing well too,

754
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,820
but it wasn't what it seemed, I guess.

755
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,300
I did my best because
he's my first trainee.

756
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,240
Well, if he wants to quit,
let him quit then.

757
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,830
It's his life anyway. What can you do?

758
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,540
Don't let it bother you.

759
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,060
That's right,

760
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,920
but I still hope he makes
the right decision.

761
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,900
[One month later]

762
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,910

Wedding dresses are really pretty
these days.

765

Look at this.

766
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,620
What is it?

767
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,950
If you start looking at wedding dresses,
it means it's time for you to get married.

768
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,990
I don't even have a boyfriend.

769
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,830
You don't need one to want to get married.

770
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,430
You should date someone.

771
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,150
Is that so?

772
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,050
It's good to date.

773
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,040
It's time, you know.

774
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,670
What style would be suitable for me?

775
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,220
You have to try them on first.

776
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,030
Get a boyfriend and go on a dress tour.

777
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,900
Are you going to get married
all of a sudden?

778
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,910
No, I'm not!

779

with all the talking?

780

I'm sorry, but about tonight...

788
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,410
Director Lee said we have to go somewhere,

789
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,630
but I forgot.

790
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,310
Is it something important?

791
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:55,010
Yes, it's work. I can't get out of it.

792
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,180
I'm really sorry.

793
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,270
Since it's work, there's nothing
you can do.

794

Didn't you mention that
you have something to tell me?

795
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,530
It's almost our second anniversary.

797

You're free, right?

808

I think you are
because you were turned down.

-What are you talking about?
-I heard everything.

810

You were turned down
by the guy who seems like your boyfriend.

811

I wasn't turned down. He's not my...

You were turned down for sure.
