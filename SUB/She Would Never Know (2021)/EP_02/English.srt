00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,030
I'm sorry, but about tonight...

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,590
Director Lee said we have to go somewhere,

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,870
but I forgot.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,760
Is it something important?

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,810
Yes, it's work. I can't get out of it.

10

I'm really sorry.

Since it's work, there's nothing
you can do.

Didn't you mention that
you have something to tell me?

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,740
It's almost our second anniversary.

Yes.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,710
I heard everything.

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,910
You were turned down
by the guy who seems like your boyfriend.

23
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,100
I wasn't turned down. He's not my...

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,540
You were turned down for sure.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,170
Compared to what you'll face
in the near future,

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,589
this is nothing.

27

Anyway, you're free, right?

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,760
No, I don't have time for you.

don't put on that lipstick.

34
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,600
We'll meet at the crosswalk after work.

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,180
Let me make this clear,

Do you know about this?

42
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,990
We'll go beyond the existing way
of global marketing

43
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,990
and open a specific distribution channel

44

45
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,350

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,410
It had failed before.

47
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,680
Are you doing it again?

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,430
We failed 20 years ago.

49
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,090
I know you went through a lot
when you pulled out from the market.

50
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,300
So, you should understand very well.

51
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,010
Entering the market is not the problem.

52
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,440
The problem is that it'll cost even more
when we pull out.

53
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,139
I know you're ambitious,

54
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,350
but don't use the company money
to fulfill your ambition.

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,600
That's why we must succeed this time.

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,630

Korean cosmetics.

But now, it's different.

Korean makeup style has become
one of the beauty trends.

60
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,880
As long as we lay down a proper strategy,

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,310
there's no need to worry.

62
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,150
Do you think we failed because
we didn't have a strategy?

63
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,000
How can a business
rely solely upon strategies?

64
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,160
Isn't it better to just focus on Asia?

65

It's easier to increase
the sales in Southeast Asia.

Let Masstige join you in the plan.

67

We're a family.
We should do this together.

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,880
Don't you think so, BM Seo?

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,030
Oh, yes. That sounds good, Director Park.

70
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,950
Of course, we'll formulate the strategies
to conquer the Asian market.

71
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,810
But if the brand is not recognized
in Europe and America,

72
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,130
it won't go very far in Asia as well...

73
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,690

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,920
[You were turned down for sure.]

169
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,200
Compared to what you'll face
in the near future,

170
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,870
this is nothing.

171
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,460
What do you think you're doing?

172
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,130
I can't stand by and
watch you being mistreated.

173
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
Who mistreated me?

174
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,720
I know it's cruel.

175
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,230
You'd rather want me
to look the other way.

176
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,360
But

177
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,070
I can't bear it.

178
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,370
Please have a seat.

179
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,270
Just a moment.

180
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,230
Don't avoid it.

181
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,070
Senior Yoon.

182
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,850
Lee Hyo-joo,

183
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,100
she's the chairman's granddaughter

184
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,350
and Director Lee's sister.

185
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,890
Who did you say she is?

186
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,530
I thought they were cousins,

187
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,360
but apparently, they aren't.

188
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,630
No, that's not true.

189
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,130
No way.

190
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,620
Senior Yoon,

191
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,830
what are you saying?

192
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,940
You still refuse to believe it now?

193
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,140
You still think they are cousins?

194
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,730
Don't talk nonsense
if you don't know anything.

195
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,760
I don't know anything? What should I know?

196
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,140
That he is stabbing you in the back?

197
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,570
Or the fact that he's getting married
in two months,

198
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,460
and yet he's still
fooling around with you?

199
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,710
Are you this stupid?

200
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,220
Watch your mouth
if you don't know anything!

201
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,130
Ma'am, would you like to try the dress on?

202
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,860
Yes, I'd like to.

203
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,760
Come with us, sir.

204
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,130
Okay.

205
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,860
This way.

206
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,330
What do you think? Pretty?

207
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,470
Yes, it's pretty.

208
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,080
Do you like it, ma'am?

209
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,910
Yes, I love it.

210
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,480
Their first reservation
was made six months ago.

211
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,350
Clearly, they've been dating
longer than that.

212
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,230
Stop denying it like a fool.

213
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,090
Look after yourself first.

214
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,610
That's your job from now on.

215
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,370
What are you going to do?

216
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,640
Are you going to turn the place
upside down?

217
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,690
You told me to face the facts.

218
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,320
Move, this is how I do things.

219
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Think it through before you do anything.

220
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,650
Then what?

221
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,020
What should I do?

222
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
Should I write up a script
and rehearse before I go?

223
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,570
If I do that,

224
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,570
will that make me feel less of a fool?

225
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,900
I helped you, but it doesn't mean
it's right to do so.

226
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,870
She's going to hate me so much.

227
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,460
Aren't you prepared for that already?

228
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,030
I am,

229
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,200
but I'm still afraid.

230
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,510
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

231
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,690
I'd like to get to know you more,

232
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,000
but perhaps some other time.

233
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,890
Take care.

234
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,870
I'll take you home.

235
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,370
You might not notice,

236
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,090
but I'm really scared right now.

237
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,700
Senior Yoon.

238
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,350
You said you like me, right?

239
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,310
I'll give you my answer now.

240
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,700
Don't.

241
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,530
Who do you think you are?

242
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,350
Why would you do such a thing?

243
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,470
You should've let me be.

244
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,690
Whether I look like
a complete fool or not,

245
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,610
you should've at least
let me keep my dignity.

246
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,130
Listen carefully,

247
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,790
don't ever interfere

248
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,090
in my business or his business.

249
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,330
Piss off.

250
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,400
Go inside.

251
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
You must be tired. Get some rest.

252
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,820
-What?
-It suddenly seems real

253
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,050
that we're really getting married.

254
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,590
Jae-shin,

255
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,410
can I ask you something?

256
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,490
Who was your first love?

257
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,800
First love?

258
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,930
I know everything about you
except for that.

259
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,000
You must've had a first love.

260
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,050
Although I've never seen you date anyone,

261
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,470
you had one, right?

262
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,130
Wait, you really did?

263
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,620
Who was it?

264
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,130
Was she prettier than me? When was it?

265
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,950
Go inside.

266
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,780
Jae-woon must be waiting.

267
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,330
Never mind.

268
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,850
What's important is that
you're marrying me.

269
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,110
I won't ever let you go.

270
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,860
[I'm sorry, but about tonight...]

271
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,490
Director Lee said we have to go somewhere,

272
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,210
but I forgot.

273
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,590
[Is it something important?]

274
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,500
[Yes, it's work. I can't get out of it.]

275
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,180
[I'm really sorry.]

276
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,990
Alright, he got it.

277
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,430
How did the dress shopping go?

278
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,010
That'll make them share the lead.

279
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,920
Be cautious. Yes, that's it.

280
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,860
Don't you have any dinner plans?

281
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,260
-Huh?
-I'm warning you.

282
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,460
If you ask Jae-shin to hang out with you
after we get married,

283
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,060
I'm going to kill you.

284
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,920
Man, that's harsh.

285
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,030
Who am I supposed to hang out with?

286
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,480
Figure that out on your own.

287
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,370
Make friends or start dating.

288
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,500
Making friends will be a lot faster.

289
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,290
What? Hey,

290
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,070
I think you've misunderstood me.

291
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,060
It's not that I can't date,
it's just that I don't want to.

292
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,120
Yeah, whatever.

293
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,620
What do you mean? You know I...

294
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,400
Forget it.

295
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,170
You only have eyes for Jae-shin anyway.

296
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,720
Jae-shin is the only man
in the world, isn't it?

297
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,420
It's been so ever since we were kids.

298
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,970
What are you trying to say?

299
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,070
Don't just think about yourself.

300
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,040
Think about Jae-shin too.

301
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,990
Love and marriage involve two people.

302
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,500
Did Jae-shin say I'm wearing him out?

303
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,440
No, he didn't, but...

304
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,130
That's enough then.

305
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,990
Even though you're my brother,
you've gone too far.

306
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,300
You're home.

307
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,350
Yikes.

308
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,430
I'm not coming back tonight.

309
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,440
Hey! What's wrong? Hey!

310
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,890
You can't enter without permission.

311
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,810
Just a moment.

312
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,310
-No, you can't.
-I'm sorry.

313
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,420
-Let him in.
-Yes, sir.

314
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,490
You're here.

315
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,010
How is she?

316
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,650
She was found just in time.

317
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,390
She's relentless. She took some pills.

318
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,670
Jae-shin, there's no other way.

319
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,360
My sister...

320
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,440
Could you please accept her?

321
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,130
She said she can't live without you.

322
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,430
Please, I'm begging you.

323
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,630
[Calling...]
[Leader Yoon from Support Team]

324
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,180
[Aunt]

325
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,400
What's going on?

326
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,340
What happened? Why are you here?

327
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,850
Is it because of your mom?

328
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,060
Did she call and nag you?

329
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,250
Or is it about work?

330
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,890
Did a subcontractor mess up again?

331
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,810
Hey!

332
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,950
Right, you should've held back.

333
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,690
I should've held back from the start.

334
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,450
I should've pretended not to know.

335
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,980
I feel like I hurt her even more.

336
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,760
Either way, she would've gotten hurt.

337
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,650
As you said,

338
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,470
it's not bad that she has a choice now.

339
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,760
That's why I didn't stop you.

340
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,300
I hope she's not in too much pain.

341
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,140
She won't

342
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,970
and so you should wait for her.

343
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,740
Wait until she makes her choice.

344
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,270
[1 kill]

345
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,200
[1 kill]

346
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,330
How about this?

347
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,310
-No.
-No?

348
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,120
Wow, Ha-eun. This is so pretty.

349
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,640
Oh? No again?

350
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,800
Then...

351
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,960
So princessy!

352
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,940
You like it?

353
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,400
We'll take this.

354
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,200
Come this way.

355
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,070
That girl.

356
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,330
She insisted that you pick out her outfit,

357
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,080
not knowing that I'm more fashionable.

358
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,330
Why is she making such a fuss?

359
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,330
Why else would she do it? It's for a boy.

360
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,990
A boy?

361
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,230
Her crush is throwing a birthday party.

362
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,440
The funny thing is,
she plays hard to get with him.

363
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,270
That squirt already knows how to flirt.

364
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,370
Get your act together.

365
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,280
-Huh?
-Even that little kid knows what to do.

366
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,360
-What are you doing?
-Why is she taking so long?

367
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,600
Ha-eun! It's your aunt.

368
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,960
Gosh.

369
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,970
Let's call Hyun-seung
and have a meal together.

370
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,510
He's probably cooped up at home.

371
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,040
Next time.

372
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,460
Raincheck.

373
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,320
Why? Didn't you say you are free today?

374
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,410
An important client is
coming in without notice.

375
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,630
Is it? I'll eat with Hyun-seung then.

376
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,830
He seemed tired.

377
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,670
Did you two talk without me again?

378
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,570
He popped into my head
while I was coming here.

379
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,040
He drank until late last night.

380
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,500
Why? A company get-together?

381
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,010
Yes, that's why.

382
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,620
You know I hate it
when you two leave me out

383
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,610
and share secrets, right?

384
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,810
Of course.

385
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,360
So, if you don't want me to be mad,

386
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,470
don't go behind my back.

387
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,140
Alright.

388
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,020
Anyway, let's have a meal
together next time.

389
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,440
-What about a cup of coffee?
-Sure, I can do that.

390
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,140
Go ahead.
I have to buy something real quick.

391
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,820
Which do you prefer among the two colors?

392
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,290
I think crystal gold is a lot better.

393
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,190
-Do you want a color test?
-Yes.

394
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,940
-I'll do it lightly.
-Okay.

395
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,580
-It's so pretty.
-It looks really good on you.

396
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,920
-What's the color of the pink one?
-I'll show you.

397
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,080
-Really?
-You have bright complexion.

398
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,630
You need a lighter color.

399
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,910
Manager.

400
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,100
Yes, sir.

401
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,310
Good work so far.

402
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,940
Thank you.

403
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
Here, take the staff to dinner.

404
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,430
Director Lee!

405
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,310
I put in a lot, so go to
a place with beef BBQ.

406
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
Thank you.

407
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,000
Everything's fine at the shop, right?

408
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,910
Okay, I'll get there sooner
than I planned.

409
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,769
Hello, it's been so long.

410
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,769
How may I help you?

411
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,160
Do you, by any chance, have this?

412
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,740
Oh, it's a limited edition.
It's all sold out now, ma'am.

413
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,900
I see, so you can't get it?

414
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,769
No, I can't.

415
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,740
It sold so well that
it was sold out in a week.

416
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:10,200
You can't find it anywhere
in the country now.

417
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,350
It's okay then.

418
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,690
Would you like me to
recommend a similar color?

419
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,180
The new one is really pretty.

420
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,510
Maybe later, I still have some left.

421
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,920
-Thank you.
-No problem.

422
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,820
I'll get it for you

423
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,230
even if I have to make it myself.

424
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,950
Here's my number.

425
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,270
[Director Lee Jae-woon]

426
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,470
No, it's okay.

427
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,830
What?

428
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,430
You don't think much of me, is it?

429
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,430
It's a first for me, right?

430
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,960
See you next time.

431
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,110
Yes, ma'am. Goodbye.

432
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,180
A regular customer?

433
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,890
Yes, she's a regular customer.

434
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,740
Her phone number

435
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,480
is personal info, so I guess no.

436
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,400
She's my type.

437
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,610
[You should've let me be.]

438
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,160
Even if I look like a complete fool,

439
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,460
you should've at least
let me keep my dignity.

440
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,120
[Listen carefully.]

441
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,230
[Don't ever interfere.]

442
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,070
[Aunt]

443
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,770
Can you engrave this?

444
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
It's our second anniversary.

445
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,590
Of course.

446
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,570
Write it down here.

447
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:32,940
[Always with you]

448
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,320
[What's wrong?]
[Call me when you see the text.]

449
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,030
[You have one missed call from Aunt.]

450
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,830
[Did something happen?]

451
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,120
[Call me when you see my text.]

452
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,360
[I hope she's not in too much pain.]

453
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,100
[She won't]

454
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,890
[and so you should wait for her.]

455
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,010
[Wait until she makes her choice.]

456
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,940
-Good morning, sir.
-Hello.

457
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,220
There's no signature here...

458
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,290
Alright.

459
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,370
-Good morning.
-Hello.

460
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,760
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

461
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,700
Hello.

462
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,180
-Hello.
-Good morning.

463
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,020
Miss, aren't you going to kindergarten?

464
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,660
You'll be late.

465
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,400
Mom, I want to go there.

466
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,390
Where?

467
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,680
Dad's friend's restaurant,
where we went last time.

468
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,850
Chef Ryu's place?

469
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,560
Okay.

470
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,850
With Jae-young's family.

471
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,300
What?

472
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,940
Is this a meeting with the in-laws?

473
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,430
Call Jae-young's mom and arrange it, okay?

474
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,820
Ha-eun!

475
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,470
Bye.

476
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,360
I'm coming!

477
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,450
And the other foot.

478
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,500
All done, okay.

479
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,540
See you later.

480
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,590
-Have a great day.
-Okay.

481
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,050
Bye!

482
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,990
Like mother, like daughter.

483
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,500
Hello, the team code is B21530.

484
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,230
It's going to Yeoksam-dong.

485
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,900
I'll do that...

486
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,990
That's heavy, let me...

487
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,430
Next.

488
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,950
Next.

489
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,670
Next.

490
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,790
Okay, send these three as the final ones.

491
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,020
The last ones are definitely better.

492
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,920
These three were taken last, right?

493
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,790
It's because he fell for me.

494
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,720
You know what people say.

495
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,260
The best photos are taken

496
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,950
when the photographer fell in love
with the subject.

497
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,420
But I think in a different way.

498
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,450
The subject must love the photographer

499
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,380
in order to get a good picture.

500
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,940
So you did that to the model on purpose?

501
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,100
Get it now? It's my secret.

502
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,280
Man.

503
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,040
Does that always work?

504
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,290
I haven't failed once.

505
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,860
If you want something,

506
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,220
it doesn't matter how you get it

507
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,470
as long as you get it.

508
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,880
BM Lee, let's go for lunch.

509
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,420
Come on.

510
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,610
Let's go for lunch too.

511
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,200
I'm so hungry. Let's go.

512
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,670
How are you getting taller? Incredible.

513
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,020
Sir,

514
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,710
I have a lunch appointment.

515
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,540
Okay, have a good one.

516
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,390
Enjoy your lunch!

517
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,300
Sir, did something good happen?

518
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,490
Is it obvious?

519
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,180
What happened?

520
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,530
How about we all go to lunch together?

521
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,720
It's my treat.

522
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,790
Sounds great, sir!

523
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,780
-What do you want?
-Beef BBQ.

524
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,030
She's a beef maniac.

525
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,960
Okay then. Beef. Where should we go?

526
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,120
Let's go.

527
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,010
Ma'am, I have an appointment.

528
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,620
Okay, enjoy your lunch.

529
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,950
You too.

530
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,520
[Mom]

531
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,140
I left my wallet.

532
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,460
[Your call cannot be connected...]

533
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,900
She never picks up right away, that girl.

534
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,030
Stop calling and just text her then.

535
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,050
She must be busy at work.

536
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,830
It's lunchtime.

537
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,260
Since she said she's busy all the time,

538
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,220
I only call her outside office hours,

539
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,030
but she never picks up.

540
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,790
She's bad, right?

541
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,110
What's the matter this time?

542
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,650
The thing is,

543
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,610
I put the blouse I bought in the closet.

544
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,440
But it has vanished into thin air.

545
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,900
Where could it have gone?

546
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,740
Why would Song-ah know about that?

547
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,930
She doesn't live here.

548
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,130
She might know.

549
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,060
She might have taken it.

550
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,040
That girl.

551
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,770
She abandons her mother to live her dream.

552
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,150
She's not dating, is she?

553
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,570
She can't.

554
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,110
Why? Dating is good.

555
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,990
Good, my butt.

556
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,050
It's not good at all.

557
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,650
Fighting wears you out,
and breakups are hard.

558
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,130
Why would she do that?

559
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,870
It's an absolute no-no.

560
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,720
Should she live alone forever?

561
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,000
She won't be alone. She has me.

562
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,590
We'll live happily together.

563
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,340
Living happily is already
out of the equation.

564
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,380
Anyway, she'd better not be dating.

565
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,610
What do you think? Is it good?

566
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,200
It's supposed to be a nice place.

567
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,550
It's really good, sir!

568
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,940
The meat just melts in my mouth.

569
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,610
You know I'm always
grateful to KLAR, right?

570
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,790
I'm proud of BM Lee and the KLAR Team.

571
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,540
Thank you.

572
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,320
By the way, is it difficult to reproduce
a discontinued product?

573
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,050
What's the item?

574
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,890
It's lipstick.

575
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,930
It's a limited edition,
but it's still in demand.

576
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,280
What do you think, General Manager Yoo?

577
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,710
It's different with every item.

578
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,530
If it's a limited edition,
it might not be easy.

579
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,040
All you have to do is
to produce the color.

580
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,580
Is that hard?

581
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,750
The whole line
might have been discontinued.

582
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,960
The container of lipstick
changes depending on the texture.

583
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,380
We have to check the product first.

584
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,370
Has it been discontinued for a long time?

585
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,090
I don't think so.

586
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,020
Don't worry too much then.

587
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,270
General Manager Yoo can

588
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,860
do anything, but this time...

589
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,530
I'll talk with the team and report to you.

590
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,560
Okay.

591
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,830
Let me know if you need anything.

592
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,910
Let's do a big event when we re-launch it,

593
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,590
so people can't help but buy it.

594
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,190
Make it happen
as soon as possible, BM Lee.

595
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,990
Yes, sir.

596
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,540
Do you want anything more to eat?

597
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,280
Can I order one more piece of steak?

598
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,970
How was lunch?

599
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,340
It was so good.

600
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,710
Thank you, sir.

601
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,420
-I trust you'll work hard now.
-Yes, sir.

602
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,360
BM Lee, a word.

603
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,460
Did you have a good lunch, Song-ah?

604
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,170
Yes. How about you?

605
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,060
It would've been good if you were there.

606
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,470
Director Lee bought us steaks.

607
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,460
You had to tell her that?

608
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,300
ABM Yoon Song-ah,

609
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,950
see me in the meeting room.

610
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,640
You don't look so good.

611
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,590
Is there something wrong?

612
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,980
I just don't feel well.

613
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,360
Did you catch a cold?

614
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,980
You have a fever?

615
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,840
We're at work.

616
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,940
It's the first time you're so sick
that you couldn't even pick up the phone.

617
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,600
Right.

618
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,540
Director Lee wants to reproduce
a limited edition lipstick.

619
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,120
It's possible, right?

620
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,260
I'll look into it.

621
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,350
Do it when you have time.

622
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,950
Don't overtax yourself.

623
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,880
I'll set a separate budget,

624
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,570
so think about how to promote it.

625
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,200
I'll report to you when I'm ready.

626
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,900
Did I...

627
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,320
Did I do something wrong?

628
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:26,710
[Large meeting room]

629
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,180
Are you free after work today?

630
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,050
You play tennis, right?

631
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,000
I'd like to play with you sometime.

632
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,420
Show me what you've got.

633
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,140
Are you really up for a match?

634
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,700
Sure, let's set a date.

635
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,840
Weekend is better, right?

636
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,070
It's better for me,
but I don't know about you.

637
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,970
You seem extremely busy on the weekends.

638
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,750
I don't have a lot of free time,

639
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,830
but I have time for tennis.

640
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,720
Let's go for a game then.

641
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,320
I won't go easy on you.

642
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,290
I look forward to that.

643
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,550
How do you feel?

644
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,670
You're upset because of me, right?

645
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,350
Did you do something to upset me?

646
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,160
Men are usually like that.

647
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,730
We do something wrong
without realizing it.

648
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,080
I'm no different. I'm an ordinary guy.

649
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,120
Should we tell people
that we're dating now?

650
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,190
You mean at work?

651
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,940
At work or to your friends.

652
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,440
Director Lee still doesn't know
we're dating, right?

653
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,700
You know he's not my real friend.

654
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,430
Besides, we're dating at work.

655
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,070
People are frown upon it.

656
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,270
It'll make you uncomfortable too.

657
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,200
What if I say I'm okay with it?

658
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,460
Why?

659
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,230
Why the sudden change of heart?

660
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,410
I want to be confident about it.

661
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,980
I don't want to be hidden all the time.

662
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,340
It's been two years.

663
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,980
We're not dating casually, are we?

664
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,940
No, it's not a casual relationship.

665
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,940
