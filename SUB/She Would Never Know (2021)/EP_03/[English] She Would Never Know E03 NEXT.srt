1
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:14,020
ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,705
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,200
So tell me,

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,080
what should I do?

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,200
If I don't do it my way,

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,280
what should I do to get back at him?

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,170
To that jerk who made me an idiot.

8
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,380
If I tell you the way,

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,490
are you going to do it?

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,620
Just tell me.

11
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,500
Do it with me.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,820
Date me, Senior Yoon.

13
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,240
I must've been out of my mind.

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,490
Forget what I said.

15
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm not joking.

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,890
I'm not trying to make a move on you.

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,830
What is it then?

18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,860
Do whatever you can
to get back at him, as you said.

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,770
So that he'll know how cruel he is.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,340
I'm not going to lower myself
to his level.

21
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,840
Are you still worried
that he might get hurt?

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,590
Just focus on your own pain.

23
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,430
Look at your wounds and nothing else.

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,240
That's the only thing I can see.
Why can't you do the same?

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,750
What are you going to do then?

26
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,690
I'll figure it out.

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,030
Mind your own business.

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,360
What time is it already?
Why hasn't she called me?

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,870
{\an8}SONG-AH'S MOTHER

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,130
What is it this time?

31
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,770
Hello, ma'am.

32
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,610
Has Song-ah come home?

33
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,560
No, not yet. Why?

34
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,850
Did something happen to her?

35
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,350
I don't know. What's the matter?

36
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,950
You don't know either?

37
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,920
Oh, well...

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,980
Why don't you know?

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,920
Aren't you her only friend?

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,020
How come you don't know anything?

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,640
What is Song-ah going to do then?

42
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,190
What kind of friend are you?

43
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,950
What's going on with her tonight?

44
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,050
Is it Song-ah?

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,550
Oh, yes.

46
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,160
Maniac.

47
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,220
Those maniacs.

48
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
EPISODE 3

49
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,700
Have you decided what to do?

50
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,860
Take the next lift.

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,230
Just do that.
Also, for next month's policy meeting...

52
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,220
Sir,

53
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,170
this is for you.

54
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,630
Thank you for the drink.

55
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,820
You don't have to,

56
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,660
I'm just taking care of my boyfriend.

57
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,970
Boyfriend?

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,640
What are you talking about, ABM Yoon?

59
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,210
You should take care of yourself.

60
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,810
It must be a lot of work to cheat on me.

61
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,790
So, was it fun?

62
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,920
Was it fun making a fool out of me?

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
You piece of trash!

64
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,409
Congratulations, sir.

65
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,650
I heard your sister is getting married.

66
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,350
How did you know that?

67
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,060
But did you know about this?

68
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,860
He's been going out with me for 2 years.

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,930
He even asked me to go on a trip with him.

70
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,980
You dirty rascal!

71
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,750
Get up!

72
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,430
What? Do you have something to say to me?

73
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,330
No.

74
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,770
Oh, you didn't have to.
Thanks for the drink.

75
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,690
Will that be enough?

76
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,970
Song-ah, Hyun-seung.

77
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,770
Yes?

78
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,770
Is it okay if we leave at 11a.m.
for the career consultancy?

79
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,180
Yes, it's okay for me.

80
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,080
Me too.

81
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,050
You brought your car, right?

82
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,610
Yes.

83
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,680
Check the material and products
before we leave.

84
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
We'll be gone till tomorrow,

85
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,590
so deal with urgent matters now.

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,790
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

87
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,990
Where are you going?

88
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,790
-Samcheok.
-Samcheok?

89
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,260
Their pickled vegetables are good.

90
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Give it to me...

91
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,290
-You're sitting at the back too?
-What?

92
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,750
One of us should sit shotgun,

93
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,930
Hyun-seung isn't the chauffeur.

94
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
You're more comfortable
with Song-ah, right?

95
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Yes.

96
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,770
Go sit in the front seat, Song-ah.

97
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,890
What's he doing?

98
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't know. What's up with him?

99
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,420
Sir.

100
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,830
Jesus!

101
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,040
Christ!

102
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,880
What are you doing?

103
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
Do you have a meeting here, sir?

104
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,450
Why would I have a meeting?

105
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,750
It seems like you're waiting for someone.

106
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,750
I'm not waiting for anybody.

107
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,350
I'm just trying to study the customers.

108
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,790
Don't mind me and get back to work.

109
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,390
Oh, studying the customers?

110
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,530
At this early hour
when we have no customers?

111
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,710
Alright then.

112
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,110
Hey!

113
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes?

114
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,660
Single? Married?

115
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,250
That's personal info too, so

116
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,020
you can't disclose that.

117
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,560
How often do our regulars
come to our booth?

118
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
That's different for everyone.

119
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,890
Some come in once a week.

120
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,630
Some come whenever there's a new product.

121
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,660
It's up to the customer.

122
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,270
But if you look at the customer data,

123
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,000
you can figure out how often they come

124
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
or which day of the week they prefer.

125
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,610
Yes, but...

126
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,280
No way.

127
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,740
Is it because of...

128
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,750
Hey!

129
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,020
No, it's not. Get back to work.

130
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,630
What do you think about me?

131
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,700
What?

132
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,660
I'm pretty attractive
at first glance, right?

133
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,530
Well, you're not my type.

134
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,020
I can be categorized into a type?

135
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,470
It's the first time I heard about that.

136
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,100
This is the progress report
of the wedding dress.

137
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,080
LEE HYO-JOO

138
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,800
{\an8}PROGRESS: PENDING

139
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,820
How should we deal with
Ms. Lee Hyo-joo's project?

140
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,500
Right,

141
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,460
it's time to make a decision.

142
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,630
<i>I want to ask a favor of you.</i>

143
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,500
A favor? What is it?

144
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Those people...

145
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,100
I don't want her
to wear your wedding dress.

146
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,300
That's a difficult request.

147
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,610
I know.

148
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,250
It's difficult for the shop,
for you, and for mom too.

149
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,750
I know it'll cause great losses.

150
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,790
Even so, you still want me to do it?

151
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,560
Does she mean that much to you?

152
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,590
Ma'am?

153
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,500
I'll take care of it.

154
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,230
How?

155
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,660
I'll try this on.

156
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,940
Okay, ma'am. Come this way.

157
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
Hyo-joo, your phone's ringing.

158
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,180
Tell them I'll call later.

159
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,310
Hello, this is Lee Hyo-joo's phone.

160
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,180
Is Ms. Lee Hyo-joo not there?

161
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,020
She can't come to the phone right now.

162
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,930
Leave your message, and I'll let her know.

163
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,100
Please ask her to call Hara

164
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,970
as soon as possible.

165
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,820
I haven't seen the ocean for so long.

166
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,310
Thanks, Hyun-seung.

167
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,670
You are so nice
for being our driver today.

168
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,420
You must be exhausted from driving.

169
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,040
It's okay, I like to drive.

170
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,660
I should really drive too.

171
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,750
Do you have a license, Song-ah?

172
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
I do.

173
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,600
I'll drive on the way back.

174
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,630
It's okay, it's better if I drive.

175
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,620
You made the right choice,
don't you think so?

176
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,200
What if you took the bus alone?

177
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,580
You'd have to transfer to another bus.

178
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,710
It would've been so exhausting.

179
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,670
You can just hand over your job
to someone else.

180
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,580
You're too responsible.

181
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,670
We can't travel much these days.

182
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm just glad to see the view.

183
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,050
It's like we're on a trip. Let's enjoy it.

184
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,710
Okay.

185
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,960
But it seems like
Senior Yoon traveled a lot.

186
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,930
Really? You do, Song-ah?

187
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,840
Oh, well, I suppose...

188
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,040
I heard about your anniversary trip.

189
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,540
Are you still going for the trip?

190
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
Anniversary trip? What anniversary?

191
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,780
Are you going with your boyfriend?
Have you been dating secretly?

192
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,520
No, I'm not dating.

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,260
I'm going with my girl friend.

194
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,820
Oh, with your girl friend?

195
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,500
Too bad.

196
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,280
Here's your bag, Manager Yoo.

197
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,550
Thank you.

198
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,010
I'll get mine...

199
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,380
Take it yourself.

200
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,330
And this. Take this too.

201
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,060
Let's leave after putting down the bags.
We'll be there on time.

202
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll go check us in.

203
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,470
Park the car, Hyun-seung.

204
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,430
Okay.

205
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,680
What are you playing at?

206
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,920
How dare you bring that up in the car?

207
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,720
Is it because I didn't do as you said?

208
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,870
Did you find an excuse to come along?

209
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,270
No,

210
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,620
it's for my promotional quota...

211
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,280
You know that's too obvious, right?

212
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,890
Fine, I used an excuse to come along.

213
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,660
Nothing will change if you avoid it.

214
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,800
Same goes for you. Nothing will change.

215
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,090
So stop.

216
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,620
There's no way I'll do as you said.

217
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,110
We'll have to wait and see.

218
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,940
It's a new product.
Would you like to check it?

219
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,380
I'm sure there's no problem.

220
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,350
I'll wrap it up for you then.
Please wait for a while.

221
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,910
I'll pay.

222
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,750
It's your wedding gift.

223
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,490
She'll pay then.

224
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,690
Yes, ma'am.

225
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,790
Thanks.

226
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,590
I'll give you something better
when you get married.

227
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,190
What should I get for you?
What do you want?

228
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,700
Whatever you like.

229
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,930
What more could she want?

230
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,370
She's getting married,
that's what she wanted the most.

231
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,700
Right.

232
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,740
It's such a shame though.

233
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,220
A lot of guys like you.

234
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,940
You should've made some comparisons.

235
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,260
Just like you, my cousin
got married for love too and...

236
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,750
Hey.

237
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,390
It's okay, she's not wrong after all.

238
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,090
So what happened to her?

239
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,560
It didn't even last a year
before she got divorced.

240
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,030
Compromising has its limits.

241
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,690
Their lifestyles were too different.

242
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,760
Is that so?

243
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,970
Lee Hyo-joo?

244
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,830
Go pick something out.

245
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,840
Okay.

246
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,810
Long time no see, Hyo-joo.

247
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,780
You've gotten prettier.

248
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,950
Get to your business.

249
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,300
Don't be so sassy.

250
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,680
Let me take a seat.

251
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,690
I heard a weird rumor about you.

252
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,380
You're getting married

253
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,390
with an employee at your company.

254
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,380
Is that true?

255
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,690
Don't worry, I won't send you
the invitation card.

256
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,790
Is it true? Are you serious?

257
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,170
You really did have a weird taste in men!

258
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm surprised you collect
those types of men.

259
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,020
Oh, sorry.

260
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,940
I should respect your cheap taste in men.

261
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,510
Why? Are you ashamed?

262
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,680
Why collect something you can't show then?

263
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,690
You should be grateful to your parents.

264
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,750
Not only did they raise an idiot like you,

265
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,390
but they also didn't break your bones

266
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,589
even if you're being a disgrace to them.

267
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,430
Or,

268
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,870
perhaps they have nothing to say

269
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,820
because that's all they taught you.

270
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,610
Hyo-joo, don't cross the line.

271
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,910
Just because I adore you...

272
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,550
Who are you to adore me?

273
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,550
See, Min-jung?

274
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,120
Lifestyles are indeed important.

275
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,850
But first, he must be
a decent human being.

276
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,930
My Jae-shin makes me proud
whenever I'm with him.

277
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,750
Do you think it's easy
to find someone like him?

278
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,500
Have you packed everything?

279
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,700
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,500
Leaving already?

281
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,470
What a good match.

282
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,880
Birds of a feather.

283
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,780
We'll start the consultant training now.

284
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,940
First, let's talk about
KLAR's color concept.

285
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,220
Just like KLAR's skincare,

286
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,230
we focus on creating our own style.

287
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,100
The comfort of your skin, natural shade

288
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,540
and long-lasting effect

289
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,570
are the three basic elements

290
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,550
we focus on while working on
KLAR's foundation and cosmetic products.

291
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,050
Let me show you the base line.

292
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,180
The Actress Cream
and All-Day Pearl Compact

293
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,090
from the White Pearl base line.

294
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,990
Enjoy your meal.

295
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,990
Thank you.

296
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,080
Eat up.

297
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,160
You must be exhausted, coming so far.

298
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,620
Not at all, I had fun.

299
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,400
Felt good to get some fresh air.

300
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Hyun-seung must be exhausted
since he drove all the way.

301
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,470
He also led the training.

302
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,670
You did a good job, Hyun-seung.

303
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,370
You too, Song-ah.

304
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
Thank you.

305
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,470
Thanks.

306
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,000
You did so well on your first time.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,580
He prepared thoroughly.

308
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,980
His material was chock full of notes.

309
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,890
Like senior, like junior.

310
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,420
Song-ah also works hard.

311
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,460
Of course.

312
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,800
But why were you staring at him?

313
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,590
Were you worried?

314
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,360
Did I? I didn't know.

315
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,070
You didn't even blink.

316
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,670
Were you aware of it, Hyun-seung?

317
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,570
She watched me with such focus.

318
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,440
Thanks to her, I was more alert.

319
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,080
She almost smacked me with her glare.

320
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,980
Seniors have to be harsh to the juniors.

321
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,820
I think I was too soft on him before.

322
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,290
He should learn
to be afraid of his seniors.

323
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,390
I'm scared, but I don't avoid it.

324
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,890
Because you are my senior,
not anyone else.

325
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm grateful that he thinks highly of me,

326
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,010
but he shouldn't
intermeddle with everything.

327
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,970
I have my own reasons

328
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,480
and I can take care of myself.

329
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,180
You two aren't fighting, are you?

330
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,550
-No, of course not.
-We're not fighting.

331
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,770
No,

332
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,590
they're not fighting.

333
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,890
There's no way they're fighting.

334
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,960
Right, there's no way.

335
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,630
Good night, see you tomorrow.

336
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,940
-Good night.
-Good night.

337
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,870
What are you two going to do?

338
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,810
I'm going to take a walk.

339
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,010
I'll go up to my room.

340
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,310
Me too.

341
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,780
Okay, don't mind me and get some rest.

342
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,180
Okay, good night.

343
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Good night.

344
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,860
Go on ahead, I'm going to take a walk...

345
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:22,312
TWO YEARS AGO

346
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,420
I'm giving it to you because you asked,

347
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,940
but do you really need this?

348
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,390
This is the last time.

349
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,580
I'm sorry for asking you this favor.

350
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,750
Will it really end here?

351
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,490
Your father can't be helped.

352
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,340
He came straight to you

353
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,790
once he heard you're back in Korea.

354
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,520
Do you want me to settle it for you?

355
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,960
I heard he's barely living a decent life.

356
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,130
No, that's not what I meant.

357
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,360
It's a lot of money.
I wonder how he'll use it.

358
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,740
I'll pay you back, but

359
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,540
I'll take care of him myself.

360
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,180
Wait, do you think I've gone too far?

361
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,850
Do you still consider him your father?

362
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,450
I'm saying this because I'm frustrated!

363
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,280
Did you forget why you
did that to me back then?

364
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,480
Wake up already!

365
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,100
Forget it, do what you want.

366
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,860
Hold on a second!

367
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,670
I forgot to buy coffee.

368
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,050
You go on ahead, sir.

369
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,850
-Eat up, Song-ah.
-Okay.

370
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,230
Stop singing in the office.

371
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,780
What do you mean?

372
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,020
-Song-ah's okay with it.
-You did that yesterday too.

373
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,500
Stop him!

374
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,300
Don't you like my singing?

375
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,100
You almost cried while singing.

376
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,500
Cry? I have no tears.

377
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,980
It's okay to cry, but...

378
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,600
Aren't you curious?

379
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,290
About what, sir?

380
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
The director's office.

381
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,210
I knew it. It was you.

382
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm sorry. It just happened.

383
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,490
-I won't tell others...
-It doesn't matter.

384
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,740
Rumors or not, it doesn't change the fact

385
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,200
that I'm Lee Jae-woon's dog.

386
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,730
So, you don't have to feel sorry.

387
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,130
You can spread the word

388
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,200
or mock me if you want.

389
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,520
Is that all you took me for?

390
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,860
The reason I avoided you was

391
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,750
because I was sorry for listening in,

392
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,130
regardless of my intention.

393
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,330
I wasn't even thinking
about spreading a rumor.

394
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,030
Also, I don't really care

395
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,210
about your relationship with Director Lee.

396
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,280
The reason I respect you as a senior

397
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,140
is not because of your background.

398
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,050
I'll get going now.

399
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,690
So,

400
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,890
what about now?

401
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,900
It's still the same now.

402
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't know what I'll feel later though.

403
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,880
May I go now?

404
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,790
Are you hungry?

405
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,980
I am.

406
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,450
If it's okay for you,

407
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,720
do you want to go for dinner with me?

408
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,970
Why can't you let him go?

409
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,740
Are you even thinking about breaking up?

410
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,380
Or

411
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,450
do you still have anticipation?

412
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,170
Hoping that he doesn't break up

413
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,530
because he can't let you go?

414
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,030
Do you think he'll come back to you

415
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,530
if you hold onto him?

416
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,900
Is that what you're thinking?

417
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,480
Is life that easy for you?

418
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,870
That's why you can say it so easily.

419
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,150
You don't care if I'm struggling in a pit,

420
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,770
if I'm ripped to pieces
or covered in blood!

421
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,540
You're right.
Like an idiot, I can't let go

422
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,720
even though I know
he was never sincere to me.

423
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,490
I know he deceived and belittled me,

424
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,430
but I'm still hoping that he'll pick me.

425
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,170
I hope he'll pick me instead of the girl.

426
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,880
So? So what?

427
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,770
Even if I make a fool of myself,
why do you care?

428
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,050
I'm going crazy as it is.

429
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,350
You don't know anything.

430
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,100
Who do you think you are
to talk wild and all?

431
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,520
This is my last warning.

432
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,530
You've no right
to interfere in my business.

433
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,860
I won't tolerate it anymore.

434
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,530
If you ignore my warning one more time,

435
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,870
I won't forgive you.

436
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,940
I don't do this.

437
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,180
I don't do this to anyone but you.

438
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,240
Did you forget?

439
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,970
I turned you down...

440
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,240
I've been through it.

441
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,600
The same thing as you.

442
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,430
Are they already asleep?

443
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,450
I pretended I didn't know.

444
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,520
I held out, pleading and begging.

445
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,030
That's what I did.

446
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,330
But do you know how it ended?

447
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,660
She dumped me in the end.

448
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,760
You're right.
It might be different for you.

449
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,610
But even if that jerk chooses you,

450
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,440
will you be happy?

451
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,950
Is that how you regard yourself?

452
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,190
Alright,

453
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,460
I'll pretend not knowing anything
as you wish.

454
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,750
But listen,

455
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,720
life isn't easy for me either.

456
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,300
Hurt?

457
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,570
I get hurt too.

458
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,330
I know what that feels like.

459
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,340
<i>Nice tie.</i>

460
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,050
<i>I wonder who picked it out for you?</i>

461
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,060
<i>I'm going home first.</i>

462
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,560
<i>Hang in there!</i>

463
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,960
<i>You skipped lunch
because of the meeting, right?</i>

464
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,190
<i>Eat this.</i>

465
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,300
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

466
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,130
<i>I feel bad for you. Get well soon!</i>

467
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,840
<i>Choose our secret rendezvous spot.</i>

468
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,180
Sir, please take a look
at my approval request.

469
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,320
Q. CHOOSE OUR SECRET RENDEZVOUS SPOT

470
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,630
EMERGENCY STAIRCASE

471
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,820
<i>I'm sorry, I have a stomachache.</i>

472
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,060
It's okay, I happen to be free.

473
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,530
It's not bad, is it?

474
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,000
Did you tell your husband?

475
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
<i>Of course.</i>

476
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,470
<i>He gave me acupuncture
and some medicine.</i>

477
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,430
<i>Don't worry.</i>

478
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,640
Okay, get well soon.

479
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,810
I'll drive Ha-eun home later,

480
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,440
so don't worry.

481
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,680
Okay, I'll call you later.

482
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,010
Is Mom still very sick?

483
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,270
She's getting better.

484
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,150
Have fun with me today.

485
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,430
<i>It's her! My destiny!</i>

486
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,010
Daughter?

487
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,639
-Instructor!
-Hello.

488
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,180
-Hi, Ha-eun.
-Hello.

489
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,740
Is Ha-eun doing well these days?

490
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,130
She's very athletic,

491
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,630
she follows my instructions very well.

492
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,380
Please teach her well.

493
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,180
Okay.

494
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,780
Here you go, Ha-eun.

495
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,530
I need to use the bathroom.

496
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,690
Stay here, okay?

497
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,000
Okay.

498
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,810
Hello, little miss!

499
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,840
No!

500
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,440
What?

501
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,510
No!

502
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,480
No?

503
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,830
No, it's not that.

504
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,850
I'm not a bad person.

505
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,820
A bad person won't say
that he's a bad person.

506
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,290
You're smart, little miss.

507
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,790
But you should adjust your standards.

508
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,260
How can such a handsome guy
be a bad person?

509
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,400
Hey!

510
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,650
Alright, alright!

511
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,370
I want to ask you this one thing.

512
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:10,430
You know, the person you're with...

513
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,610
I mean, is she your mo...

514
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,800
Mommy!

515
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,490
Ha-eun, why did you call me mommy?

516
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,930
I think he's interested in you.

517
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,230
Who?

518
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,950
The man just now?

519
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,540
But he's not your type.

520
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,810
What's my type?

521
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,910
A tall and handsome man
like uncle Hyun-seung.

522
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,280
And he must be young.

523
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,240
Young?

524
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,880
Mom said that since you're old,

525
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,410
young men will suit you better.

526
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,380
But that man

527
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,950
looked even older than my dad.

528
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,390
Do you think I can ever get married?

529
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,490
Don't worry, every Jack has his Jill.

530
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:08,400
Gosh, you've grown so much!

531
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,670
Let's go.

532
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,160
In the Urban Mood line,

533
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,360
there are Serum Point Lipstick

534
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,510
and Long Lasting Moisture Lip Ink.

535
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,030
The Urban Mood line
focuses on a natural look

536
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,380
that isn't too artificial.

537
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,620
Let's see the selling points
of Serum Lipstick.

538
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,120
The selling point of this lipstick is...

539
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,580
Good job.

540
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,780
You worked so hard.

541
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,590
I'm so tired.

542
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,890
Thanks for driving us,

543
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,360
I'll treat you next time.

544
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,130
Thanks for all your hard work.

545
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,430
You guys live near each other, right?

546
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,080
You should ride with him.

547
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,840
I'll report to BM Lee,
so don't worry about that.

548
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,640
Okay.

549
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,540
Get home safely. See you tomorrow.

550
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,610
Goodbye.

551
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,100
Goodbye, ma'am.

552
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,920
I'll be off now...

553
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,720
Get in, I'll pass by your place anyway.

554
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,310
Hey,

555
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,450
about yesterday...

556
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,333
ASSISTANT MANAGER AHN

557
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Yes, ma'am?

558
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,620
It's me, can you talk now?

559
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
Yes.

560
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,690
The freebie remover
for this month's event.

561
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,060
Do you have extra?

562
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,130
We have around three
or four thousand of them.

563
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,230
Can I take 500 then?

564
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,330
500?

565
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,330
Hold on, please.

566
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:28,110
AUNT SENT A MESSAGE.

567
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Song-ah?

568
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,110
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

569
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,680
You said 500, is it?

570
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,920
Can you spare me or not?

571
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,150
If you can pay for it, then it's okay.

572
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,650
Send it to Busan Logistics tomorrow.

573
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,870
The event starts on Friday,

574
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,320
so they have to ship it tomorrow.

575
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,790
General Manager Im has a foul temper,
so don't forget.

576
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,360
No, I won't.

577
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:54,520
AUNT

578
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,930
<i>Are you free tomorrow evening?</i>

579
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,280
I'll just get off here...

580
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,120
It's rush hour.
You'd better use the subway.

581
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,140
Yes.

582
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,960
No way! It can't be true!

583
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,890
She's married?

584
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,430
Her beauty says otherwise though.

585
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,370
It took me so long to find her.

586
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,570
Why do you hate me, god?

587
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:37,955
MANAGER YOON, SUPPORT TEAM

588
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,660
Who is that prick?

589
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,220
Who could've snatched up that beauty?

590
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,290
He's probably uglier
and has less money than me.

591
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,060
A good guy like me is hard to come by.

592
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,400
Why didn't she wait for me?

593
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,050
Why did she have to rush?

594
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,970
Should I just become the bad guy?

595
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,670
I'm sure I'll succeed.

596
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,610
I'm just saying.

597
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,780
I'm going upstairs for a meeting.

598
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Yes, sir.

599
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
Song-ah.

600
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,090
Yes, ma'am.

601
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,320
The freebie remover I mentioned yesterday.

602
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,060
Oh, right!

603
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,420
I'm so sorry!

604
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,730
What? Why sorry?

605
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,390
Those removers...

606
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,430
Right, can I use some more?

607
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,500
They expect a good reaction,
so they want more.

608
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,460
They should've asked for it earlier.

609
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,700
500 more. Is it possible?

610
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,140
No?

611
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,130
It is. It's possible.

612
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,810
I'll put a request to the SCM team.

613
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,050
Okay, thanks.

614
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,250
Sure.

615
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,350
Yes, sir. She said it's possible.

616
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,390
ABM Chae Hyun-seung requested it.

617
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,860
ABM Chae?

618
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Yes.

619
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,150
Excuse me, sir.

620
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,790
Did ABM Yoon request a freebie shipment?

621
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,270
No, she didn't.

622
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,210
Could you do this today, please?

Here, have this.

I'll do it because
you're always good to me.

630
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,450
Next time, you should

Okay, I will.

Thank you!

<i>He requested it
right before closing time.</i>

Why? Is there a problem?

635
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,930
No, there isn't.
There has been a request for more.

636
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,270
Send it via email then.

Okay.

Yes.

640
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,100
I heard you did it.

641
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,340
You requested for the product movement.

642
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,610
Oh, yes.

643
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,080
Seemed like you forgot.

644
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,880
I'm sorry for interfering in your work.

645
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,320
No, that's not why...

646
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,150
I want to say thank you.

647
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,020
Thanks to you, things went smoothly.

648
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,360
I just did what you taught me.

649
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,780
At first, when I made mistakes,

650
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,260
that's what you did.

651
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,770
You did things for me
so I wouldn't get into trouble.

652
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,600
I was your trainer...

I've grown that much now.

654

I can protect my trainer.

655
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,120
But if you don't like it,

656
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,120
I won't interfere anymore.

657
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,370
Is that what you want?

<i>You're free this evening, right?</i>

668
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,150
Do you have plans tonight?

669
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,980
No.

670
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,790
Do you want to have dinner together?

671
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,660
We can go for a drink.

672
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,690
You'd rather not?

673
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,050
As long as you're paying.

674
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,620
Of course, I'm paying.

675
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,110
I'm going to eat
something really expensive.

676
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,190
I'm off now.

677
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,840
Yes.

678
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,360
No.

679
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,130
Just check if it's 82%.

680
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:43,530
MANAGER YOON, SUPPORT TEAM

681
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,470
I have an appointment.

682
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,110
BM Lee!

683
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,880
Hurry!

684
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,250
You call this expensive?

685
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,690
You were glaring at me so hard.

686
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,530
I thought you'd kill me with it.

687
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,570
I'm sorry about what I said in Samcheok.

688
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,670
I was too harsh.

689
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,780
I was even harsher.

690
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,300
I talked out of line like you said.

691
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,380
I'm sorry, too.

692
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,730
Let's order something!

693
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,600
You're scary when you're hungry.

694
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,260
We just made up, so let's stay that way.

695
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,960
Ma'am! Three servings of pork belly

696
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,170
and one bottle of soju, please.

697
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,730
-Okay.
-Alright.

698
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,490
A scary person will be eating it,

699
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,650
so give us good meat!

700
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,670
-Okay.
-Alright.

701
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,280
Seeing that my grandfather called us here,

702
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,520
the Europe Project
must've really appealed to his taste.

703
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,720
Don't be nervous.

704
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,690
Let's go in.

705
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,730
Only you, Director Lee.

706
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,680
Wait here for a minute.

707
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,710
Is it that hard to let him go?

708
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,880
He's a piece of trash.

709
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,260
I will.

710
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,490
What else can I do?

711
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,030
Honestly, I don't know.

712
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,200
I don't know what I'm hoping for.

713
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,210
I don't know what I want.

714
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,720
My head is about to explode.

715
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,780
From morning till night.

716
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,880
But I can't seem to come to a conclusion.

717
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,660
It's not my first break up.

718
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,160
There's no reason I can't do it.

719
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,460
It won't kill me.

720
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,280
I'm so pathetic, right?

721
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,010
Ridiculous.

722
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,280
No.

723
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,560
Not at all.

724
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,430
By the way,

725
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,920
why did she do that to you?

726
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,900
You're such a nice guy.

727
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,640
So you do know that I'm a nice guy.

728
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,540
She said the same thing as you,

729
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,970
that life was so easy for me.

730
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,510
She said I couldn't understand her

731
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,520
because she got it hard.

732
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:30,010
That's why she left me.

733
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,850
I told her everything
was going to be alright,

734
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,500
but she picked the man
who shared her pain.

735
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,880
That's why he likes her better.

736
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,270
I live in the same reality as him

737
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,440
but she can make him forget that reality.

738
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,170
But I like him for being real.

739
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,600
<i>It wasn't real.</i>

740
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,050
What you knew about him.

741
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,680
Right.

742
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,210
I thought I was really in love.

743
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,600
I guess I got conned.

744
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,470
It's empty.

745
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,650
How about a second round?

746
00:53:58,410 --> 00:53:59,520
Are you up for it?

747
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,610
Your father...

748
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,270
Did he still find you?

749
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,930
I'll make sure he doesn't cause trouble.

750
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:32,780
Blood ties and attachment
make you incompetent.

751
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,750
Your position is out of your league.

752
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,610
Get your act straight.

753
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,480
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

754
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,520
Go then.

755
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,160
I'll make sure to get
good results, Grandfather!

756
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,420
MANAGER YOON, SUPPORT TEAM

757
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,560
Is this the second round?

758
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,270
I can't take care of you
if you get drunk.

759
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,800
I'm the only one here.
Are you okay with that?

760
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,220
Should I sue him?

761
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,550
I know a good lawyer.
Do you want his number?

762
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,590
It'll cost a lot, right?

763
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,930
I can lend you the money.

764
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,900
You're lucky to have a lot of money.

765
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,880
You really don't like what I suggested?

766
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,840
There's a saying.

767
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,740
While trying to avoid a fox,
you meet a tiger.

768
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,590
I can see through your rotten core.

769
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,970
If I take your hand,

770
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,460
I won't be able to manage the aftermath.

771
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,420
What are you going to do then?

772
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,530
Tell him that he's a jackass,

773
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,700
that he's on his own from now on,

774
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,670
and let him go?

775
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,280
Acting all cool and refined?

776
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,920
Why would I do that?

777
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,800
I will get back at him.
Whatever it takes.

778
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,910
How?

779
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,510
I'm sober now because of you. Let's go.

780
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,620
I promise I won't.

781
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,200
You're right.

782
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,010
If I take your hand,

783
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,000
I'd never want to let it go.

784
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,030
But I promise I won't.

785
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,570
Because you're really important to me.

786
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,530
All the more reason not to do it.

787
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,110
I can't give you anything.

788
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,690
You can't either.

789
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:02,490
Please.

790
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,560
Thanks for walking me home.

791
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,140
I'll do it.

792
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,370
I'll do as you say.

793
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,850
If that's what you really want.
I'll do that.

794
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,750
Thank you.

795
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,920
But I'll still protect you.

796
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,490
You just taught me how.

797
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,220
Bye.

798
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:11,800
AUNT

799
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,960
<i>Yes?</i>

800
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,830
I have something to say.

801
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,790
<i>Okay, go on.</i>

802
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,430
Let's stop.

803
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,170
<i>Stop what?</i>

804
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,610
I want to stop seeing you.

805
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,850
You disgust me.

806
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,690
<i>What?</i>

807
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,290
You heard me. I'm hanging up now.

808
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,940
Say that again. What did you say?

809
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,290
Why are you here?

810
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,960
Do you really mean it?

811
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,290
Why?

812
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,670
Isn't that obvious?

813
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,500
I don't like you anymore.

814
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,830
What have you been doing all this time?

815
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,170
Is it Chae Hyun-seung?

816
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,100
If not, then why?

817
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,690
I have nothing more to say.

818
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:44,150
Please let me go quietly.

819
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,880
You can't just dump me.

820
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,920
Get in my car. Let's talk there.

821
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,820
Don't touch me.

822
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,050
Is it really Chae Hyun-seung?

823
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,160
Why do you keep dragging him into this?

824
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,290
I said I don't like you anymore.

825
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,830
Does he know we are seeing each other?

826
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,770
When did you two start dating?

827
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,410
I asked when it started!

828
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,710
Why did you say you wanted
to date openly with me?

829
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,110
Why did you say that?

830
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:13,940
Let go!

831
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,070
Speak already!

832
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,040
Let go!

833
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,150
Tell me!

834
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,510
Let go!

835
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,070
She told you to let go.

836
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,020
Move.

837
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,170
This is no place for you.

838
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,060
You want me to move?

839
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,600
I'm ordering you as your boss.

840
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,840
Move, Chae Hyun-seung.

841
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,340
Senior Yoon.

842
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:22,166
I think you should be the one leaving.

843
01:02:24,317 --> 01:02:26,522
Get out of my girl's face, you rascal.

844
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:01,993
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

845
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,390
<i>Our relationship won't end that easily.</i>

846
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:05,960
<i>You're being used.</i>

847
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,930
<i>You should stop now before it gets ugly.</i>

848
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,010
<i>I don't understand why.</i>

849
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,140
<i>You piece of trash.</i>

850
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,230
<i>Should I do something
so that he won't come near you?</i>

851
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,350
<i>I can teach him a lesson.</i>

852
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,420
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

853
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,030
<i>Just trust me and follow my lead.</i>

854
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,780
<i>Trust your boyfriend.</i>

855
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,030
<i>Your heart fluttered, right?</i>

856
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:26,530
<i>He's young, good-looking
and excellent at what he does.</i>

857
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,770
<i>Hyun-seung, you have a girlfriend?</i>
