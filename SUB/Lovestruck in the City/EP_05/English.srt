#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,081
<i>What do you do with the memory box
after breaking up?</i>

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,254
-Memory box?
-I even kept the movie ticket stubs.

10
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,674
Since they're precious memories.

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,635
-They remind me of him.
-They torture me.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
That's the biggest problem
after a breakup, though.

13
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,307
I don't obsess over items.

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,894
I don't obsess over them,
but I should get them back.

15
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,563
Why do you want them returned?
They're just objects.

16
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,024
Right. We can just keep

17
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,235
our precious memories in our hearts.

18
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,696
That's exactly how I felt.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,655
3 YEARS AGO

20
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,365
-Take it off.
-Take off what?

21
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,327
We just broke up. So take it off.

22
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,120
There you go again.

23
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,997
Breaking up has nothing to do with it.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,541
I bought the coat you're wearing

25
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,835
during my trip to the US.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,878
Take it off.

27
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,048
Fine. I'll take it off.

28
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,354
-The shirt, too.
-Are you crazy? It's winter.

29
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,065
That was our matching shirt. Take it off.

30
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,608
Hey, I was the one who bought--

31
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,527
-Take it off. Now.
-Gosh.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,612
You'll think about me
whenever you wear it.

33
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,447
-I don't want that. Take it off.
-Come on.

34
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,457
Take off your shoes, too.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,719
The socks, too.

36
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,848
-Why should I?
-I bought them for you.

37
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,059
-When did you buy me socks?
-I got them with the Mickey Mouse socks.

38
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,519
You did? The smiley ones, too?

39
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,354
Yours had holes, so I got them for you.

40
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,481
Not the socks.

41
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,358
The feet

42
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,653
are like the second heart.

43
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,621
Put them on. You must be freezing.

44
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,581
It's okay.

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,167
I'm walking barefoot on purpose.

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,627
I heard it's good for you.

47
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,880
I saw you guys fighting
in the <i>jokbal</i> alley.

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,049
Oh, did you?

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,718
Thank you. I'll put them on.

50
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,272
Do you want to wear this?

51
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,358
Gosh. Thank you.

52
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,405
-Wait, this sweaterâ€¦
-It's from my high school.

53
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,115
-Daeun High School?
-Yes.

54
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,243
-Soccer team?
-Soccer team?

55
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:08,414
<i>Daeun's spirit is
full of energy and passion</i>

56
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>Spread the spirit of Daeun

57
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,003
<i>-Shoot, run

00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,505

00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,053
-Daeun!
-Daeun!

62
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,472
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

63
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:28,142
Wow, I can't believe you still have this.
Did you graduate this year?

64
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,310
No. Five years ago.

65
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,021
I graduated six years ago.
I still have this at home, too.

66
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,107
No wonder you looked familiar.

67
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,442
Weren't you the goalkeeper?

68
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,152
No, he just looks like me.

69
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,738
I was always on the bench
as the cheering squad.

70
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,782
I didn't like getting sweaty.

71
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,329
Oh Dong-sik, offense, Year 24.

72
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,832
I see. Nice to meet you.

73
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,459
-What a small world.
-I'm happy to be of help.

74
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,797
Do you always carry this stuff around?

75
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,300
No, I passed
the police entrance exam today.

76
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,051
So I'm moving out of my studio.

77
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,849
-Congratulations. I mean it.
-Thank you.

78
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,477
It's interesting. I was leaving
the studio with my stuff

79
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,563
when I saw you getting
beaten up with a bag.

80
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,025
It kind of broke my heart.

81
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,694
It must've been because we're alumni.

82
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,488
That's the bag I bought for her.

83
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,824
Were you ever beaten up
with a bag you bought?

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,828
Well, she definitely packed a punch.

85
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,333
It's all right.
Anything can happen in life.

86
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,754
It's a crazy coincidence
that we met today.

87
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,672
Why don't we grab a drink?

88
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,467
Let's go. I'm buying.

89
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,553
-Thank you.
-All right.

90
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
<i>That day, we had three rounds.</i>

91
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,016
Gosh, I miss it.

92
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,187
We got drunk and went
to our high school that night.

93
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,315
We played soccer
without a ball on the field.

94
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,692
It was so fun. I didn't even sweat.

95
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,196
You had fun after our breakup?

96
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,449
Damn it. I should've taken
your pants off, too.

97
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,243
If he's Geon's junior alumni,
he's my alumni, too.

98
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,579
He's probably on patrol
somewhere in Seoul right now.

99
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,417
-Damn it. I'm so pissed.
-We'll meet someday.

100
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,628
-By coincidence, like that day.
-Kang Geon, that jerk.

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,629
I think we're meant to be.

102
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,716
You are, if you meet him again.
Hey, marry him.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,051
How are you doing?

104
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,137
<i>I still have your flip-flops
and sweatshirt.</i>

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,722
I'll return them if we meet.

106
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,475
I threw away everything related to him.

107
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,353
I can't throw out anything,
let alone take the ring off.

108
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,355
It's better to throw them away.

109
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,148
I think returning them is better.

110
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,777
What's the point of getting them back?
I'd throw them away, anyway.

111
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,030
-Who cares if one side throws them out?
-Doesn't it help you end the relationship?

112
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,535
Hey, I know you, Kyeong-jun. Be honest.

113
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,079
You didn't go there to end
your relationship with her that day.

114
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:04,799
2 YEARS AGO

115
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,146
-Must you do this when I'm at work?
-But you wouldn't see me.

116
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,523
We broke up. Why should I meet you?

117
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,901
-Why won't you answer my calls?
-We broke up.

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,362
Then, what about all this stuff?

119
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,114
I texted you. Throw them away.

120
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,950
I texted back.
I can't just throw them away.

121
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,828
-Fine. I'll do it, then.
-Wait. I'm sorry.

122
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,330
It's all my fault.

123
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,749
Why would you say that now?

124
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,293
You wanted to end it properly.

125
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,087
Isn't that why you brought
everything I gave you?

126
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,297
That was all a lie.

127
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,174
I was pretending I was okay.

128
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,217
I don't want to break up.

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,887
I brought this as an excuse.

130
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,348
I'm here to get back with you.

131
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,184
I don't want to.

132
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,227
-Leave them here and go.
-No.

133
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,437
There's more.

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,398
I still have a lot of stuff left
to give back to you.

135
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,108
And you'll have to do the same.

136
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,235
We have to meet ten times,
no, more than that.

137
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,197
-At least dozens of times.
-You should've brought all of them.

138
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,907
It'll be too heavy for you.

139
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,283
Do you know how heavy it is?

140
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,288
You told me to hug it
whenever I thought of you.

141
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,373
The teddy bear you gave me
on our 100th day.

142
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,375
It was too big for me to carry.

143
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,587
The plant you gave me is
still in my office.

144
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,965
I need to pick up the coat you bought me
at the dry cleaner's.

145
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,301
If I collect them,
it's more than a boxful.

146
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,011
I'll need to rent a truck.

147
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,013
Use your car.

148
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,557
Bring them all to my place in your car.

149
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,894
Then, can I go to your neighborhood?

150
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,689
When we fought and broke up,

151
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,775
you told me not to.

152
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,860
You said you had to return them.

153
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,863
Like you said, I can't carry them
home by myself.

154
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,490
That's true.

155
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,952
In that case,
can I sleep over at your place?

156
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,668
We broke up. Why would you sleep over?

157
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,088
I don't want to break up with you.

158
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,757
If you don't want me to sleep over,

159
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,843
let's meet ten more times
around your house.

160
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,847
I'll bring you a box when we meet,
one at a time.

161
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,934
The next time we meet,

162
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,979
shall we go
to your favorite <i>tteokbokki</i> place?

163
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,398
What's that, by the way?

164
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,362
-Don't you remember this?
-Did I buy you that?

165
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,448
You bought it when we went
to the amusement park

166
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,866
for the first time together.

167
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,120
Did I?

168
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,873
Why did you keep all this?
That was ages ago.

169
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,418
Then, instead of going to
the <i>tteokbokki </i> place,

170
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,878
how about a date at the amusement park?

171
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,881
I'll wear this all day long
and goof around.

172
00:09:59,098 --> 00:09:59,974
Then,

173
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,477
wait right here until my shift is over.

174
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,065
Then, I'll reconsider
breaking up with you.

175
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,735
You mean it?

176
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,745
Thank you, ma'am.

177
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,631
<i>When I saw that bunny headband,</i>

178
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,092
I remembered how much fun I had with him.

179
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,887
That's what I was aiming for.

180
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,766
"We loved each other.
No, we still love each other."

181
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,392
Turn crisis into opportunity.

182
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,603
You know, I'm a pro at that.

183
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,608
There's something
I really want to ask her.

184
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
Wellâ€¦

185
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,492
I said I threw out everything.

186
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,577
I don't have anything
that's related to him.

187
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,413
I had cameras.

188
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,958
I brought a few along
when I went to Yangyang.

189
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,627
But I don't have them

190
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,213
anymore.

191
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,105
All right.

192
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,484
All right. I'm two weeks in.

193
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,653
The boards are almost done,

194
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,030
and I'm moving on to the next step.

195
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,324
-So the next--
-What are you doing?

196
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,537
-You have another order for wood boards?
-Yes.

197
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,540
-You have two orders?
-Yes. Two boards.

198
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,750
Can you finish them
before you go back to Seoul?

199
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,252
Yes, I think I can.

200
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,505
What's that?

201
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,550
Polaroids. I wanted to take some pictures.

202
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,802
-I want to take photos with this, too.
-Wait.

203
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,097
It's ruined.

204
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,143
This is the one.

205
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,270
Hold it.

206
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,355
Like this. Just take a photo.

207
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,024
-Do I press this button?
-Yes.

208
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,734
-You're taking a photo of me?
-Yes.

209
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,778
One, two, three.

210
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,574
And now,

211
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,661
you need to take the film out from here.

212
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,747
You just need to wait.

213
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,124
-Oh, I have to wait?
-Yes.

214
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,086
While I wait, I'll take photos
with this one, too.

215
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,379
The film camera?

216
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,548
That one is hard to handle.

217
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,426
Well, you need to learn
about the sensitivity of the camera,

218
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,011
understand shutter speed,

219
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,181
and know about aperture in photography.

220
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,017
Never mind. Come here.

221
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,895
-Look. This is the focus.
-Okay.

222
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,105
You can use that to adjust the focus.

223
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,691
-It's blurry, right?
-Yes.

224
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,111
Unscrew it.
You'll see two images in the middle.

225
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,281
-Yes.
-When they overlap, it will be in focus.

226
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,575
I can see clearly now.

227
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,618
-You can?
-Yes.

228
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,287
Good job. You have a knack for this.
You're smart.

229
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,705
In that case, show me.

230
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,415
A kiss?

231
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,013
-The weather is so nice today.
-So nice.

232
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,976
Do you want some?

233
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,689
-Let me try.
-Okay.

234
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,150
Right here. Put your hands here.
Slow down.

235
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,236
Faster? Here I go.

236
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,823
I almost fainted!

237
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,032
-I'll let go now.
-No.

238
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,743
-No. Not yet.
-I'm going to let go now.

239
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,287
No. Not yet.

240
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,499
Let's go!

241
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,173
ARA

242
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,466
Okay. Here I go.

243
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,302
One, two, three.

244
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,303
Strike a pose.

245
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,685
One, two, three.

246
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,021
Done?

247
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,069
How pretty.

248
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,157
One, two, three.

249
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,830
-I'm bleeding.
-Where?

250
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,791
-I lied.
-"I lied"?

251
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,927
WE GOT MARRIED

252
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,894
Adjust the focus, so the buildingâ€¦

253
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,896
-I think it's in focus.
-Really?

254
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,651
It's totally out of focus.

255
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,986
<i>Jae-won! Come on out now!</i>

256
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,946
<i>What is it?</i>

257
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,156
<i>What are you doing? Gosh, stop filming me.</i>

258
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,616
<i>Don't film me. I look puffy.</i>

259
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,118
<i>Put your hand down. Look over here. Smile.</i>

260
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,204
<i>-Smile?
-Gosh, you look great.</i>

261
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,664
-Hold on.
-What?

262
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,167
-We can't take selfies with a manual--
-One, two, three.

263
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,506
So I don't have the camerasâ€¦

264
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,636
because she has them. Yes.

265
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,264
I gave them to her
since she really loved them.

266
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,684
-Hi.
-Ta-da.

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,229
Gosh, I don't believe him.

268
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,481
He went through a lot to get the cameras.

269
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,024
He gave her his cameras?

270
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,026
-Jae-won, out of all people?
-Exactly.

271
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,278
I begged him,
but he didn't let me borrow them.

272
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,948
The Jae-won we know
would've bought her a new one, right?

273
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,076
So, the Yoon Seon-a woman
has the cameras now?

274
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,411
<i>All three of them?</i>

275
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,538
He really gave her
all three of his cameras?

276
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,499
Jae-won is unnecessarily too romantic.

277
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,168
Fine. I'm unnecessarily too romantic.
Happy now?

278
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,837
Whatever. Anyway,

279
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,673
I really want to know
what she did with my cameras.

280
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,677
But I'm sure Ms. Yoon Seon-a sold them.

281
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,178
Why would she sell them?

282
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,306
If she's watching this interview,

283
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,101
I would like to tell her this.

284
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,728
Can I?

285
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,645
WHAT?

286
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,771
Okay.

287
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,316
Here I go.

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,443
OKAY, SURE

289
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,361
Hey.

290
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,073
Did you really sell my cameras?

291
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,366
TO YOON SEON-A

292
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,076
If you did sell them,

293
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,871
what did you do with that money?

294
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,290
Did you buy food?
Did you go drinking? Shopping?

295
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,875
Why are you doing this to me?

296
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,670
You shouldn't do that.
You can't toy with a personâ€¦

297
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,840
Gosh. Damn it.

298
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,052
Why did you do that to me?

299
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,182
I was in love with him for two months.

300
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,683
Gosh. Seriously.

301
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,896
Just thinking about her pisses me off.

302
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,483
Everything was a lie,

303
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,153
<i>but my love for himâ€¦</i>

304
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,700
I meanâ€¦

305
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,287
Please find her. Her name is Yoon Seon-a.

306
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,539
She's pretty but mean.

307
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,252
What a loser. Gosh, he's pathetic.

308
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,842
PRETTY BUT MEAN

309
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,140
<i>I was sincere back then.</i>

310
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,477
<i>But that doesn't matter now.</i>

311
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,187
<i>It's all in the past.</i>

312
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,482
<i>I won't look back on my past.</i>

313
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,610
<i>My present matters the most now.</i>

314
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,072
O3
MARKETING AGENCY

315
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,285
We throw out
the general trash today, right?

316
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,578
You ask me that every day.

317
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,414
General trash on even weekdays,
recycling on odd weekdays.

318
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,500
I was craving pasta today.

319
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,171
Take it after the meal.
We haven't eaten yet.

320
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,383
No. Let me take care of
my precious skin first.

321
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,593
Give me a second.

322
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,516
-Are the noodles well done?
-Throw it.

323
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,643
Look.

324
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,314
They need a bit more time.

325
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,026
What are you doing? That's dirty.

326
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,738
Excuse me? This is what Italian chefs do.

327
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,783
No, they don't. I worked at a restaurant
that serves all kinds ofâ€¦

328
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,537
All kinds of what?

329
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,374
No, never mind.

330
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,712
-Do you want some wine?
-Sure.

331
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,213
I didn't chill it.

332
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,965
I'll put it in the fridge.

333
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,134
Just chill it with ice.

334
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,846
By the way, what's this in the fridge?

335
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,098
Some weird stuff is in the wine drawer.

336
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,314
Aren't these roll films?
They're all used, right?

337
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,615
Why did you put them there?

338
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,121
All right. That's a perfect fit.

339
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,666
-Why put them in the fridge?
-I don't want the colors to change.

340
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,670
I'll develop them at my regular
photo studio in Seoul once I go back.

341
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,549
Do the colors not change in there?

342
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,593
Well, they will change a little,

343
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,762
but it's better than keeping them
at room temperature.

344
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,348
-Why? Isn't it interesting?
-Yes.

345
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,517
Don't eat them when I'm gone.

346
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,687
I'm going to check.

347
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,105
-You know how many there are?
-Thirteen.

348
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,696
Why are you putting them back
in the fridge?

349
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,782
-Why?
-I'm going to eat them.

350
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,742
They taste better when they're kept fresh.

351
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,163
You have a camera?
You don't have a film camera.

352
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,207
Hey, the garlic is burnt. Throw it away.

353
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,500
Wait.

354
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,335
What a waste.

355
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,546
<i>So Kang Geon is living with a woman?</i>

356
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,883
I know. He's living with Lee Eun-o.

357
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,763
Geon and I broke up because of her.

358
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,435
I think

359
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,813
they'll end up getting married someday.

360
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,540
Okay. Good work.

361
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,292
-Good work.
-Good job.

362
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,089
Where are you going?

363
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,175
Did they finish cleaning
the building in Sangam-dong?

364
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,261
-Yes. Why?
-I'm going to take pictures.

365
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,055
-Leave that to the experts--
-Sure.

366
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,516
He's always asking for trouble.

367
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,647
I took them a year ago,
so the colors might have changed.

368
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,359
Well, some people like
that kind of faded colors in photos.

369
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,486
Did you keep them in the fridge?

370
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,447
Yes.

371
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,701
Will you store them as computer files,
or shall I scan them for you?

372
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,287
-No, develop them, please.
-All of them?

373
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,832
Yes. All of them. One each.

374
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,917
Gosh.

375
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,004
I heard that you were
the best at developing photos.

376
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,047
Pardon?

377
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,216
Well, it's true that a lot of experts
come to my studio.

378
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,013
How long will it take?

379
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,063
Hello?

380
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,940
Hello, sir. This is Park Jae-won.

381
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,234
Hey, it's been a while.

382
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,070
Where have you been?
Don't you use film cameras anymore?

383
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,739
No, I don't use film cameras.
I only use a digital camera these days.

384
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,742
I finished photoshopping
and uploading them.

385
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,701
When should I be there?

386
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,288
Gosh. I'm kind of busy today.

387
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,667
If it's not urgent,
I'll send them over tomorrow via courier.

388
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,010
Are they all done?

389
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,887
Yes.

390
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,688
Wait, this guyâ€¦

391
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,483
-I know him.
-No, you're mistaken.

392
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,361
No, I'm not.
He works at an architecture firm.

393
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,113
No. That's not him.

394
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,198
Gosh.

395
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,534
-I'll pick them up. Please ring them up.
-Okay.

396
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,348
<i>I wasn't planning to say this.</i>

397
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,269
<i>I said I gave her the three cameras.</i>

398
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,272
I didn't give them to her.

399
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,568
-<i>I saw the camera bag at the airport.</i>
-Bye.

400
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,820
But I forgot because I was in a hurry.

401
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,781
<i>And it didn't matter
because I thought I'd get them back.</i>

402
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,975
It's filming.

403
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,620
All right.

404
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,039
It's finally Day One.

405
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
I got wood.

406
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,878
I thought about using balsa,
but it was too expensive.

407
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,423
Oak is too knotty and too heavy.

408
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,009
So I decided to use paulownia wood.

409
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,343
<i>Starting today,</i>

410
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:40,307
<i>I'm going to show you
how to make a surfboard.</i>

411
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,978
<i>All right. Today,</i>

412
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,023
I'll make a rough sketch on the plank,

413
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,942
and then cut it with a jigsaw.

414
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,695
Okay.

415
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,656
All right.

416
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,950
Your shift starts soon, so I'll stop here.

417
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:13,798
Today, I'm going to attach
the ribs on the stringer.

418
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,885
I'm making a frame
that will go on the board.

419
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,346
Oh, right.

420
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,681
I forgot to tell you.

421
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,893
I'm making our own boards right now.

422
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:30,273
<i>You know, making surfboards
looks easy, but it's really hard.</i>

423
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,611
I'm going to work
on the surfboard rails today.

424
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,907
<i>It takes about two hours
until the glue hardens.</i>

425
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,535
<i>I have to wait two hours for each one.</i>

426
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,568
<i>You're seeing how hard this is, right?</i>

427
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,406
<i>It takes a lot of effort
to make one surfboard.</i>

428
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,324
Just so you know.

429
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,078
It's so hard,
making them without you knowing.

430
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,997
Well, I'm not sure
if you'll like your board.

431
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,667
But I'm doing my best.

432
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,294
So the next--

433
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,921
-What are you doing?
-Here-- What?

434
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,091
You have another order for wood boards?

435
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,261
Yes. Wait.

436
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,976
<i>Let's go inside. Here we go.</i>

437
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,811
All right. Slowly.

438
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,230
Guess where we are.

439
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,274
Where are we? What is this?

440
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,442
Where are we?

441
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,485
-Your workshop.
-Yes.

442
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,987
It smells like your workshop.

443
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,949
Ta-da.

444
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,660
-What? It's your workshop.
-Yes, it is.

445
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,162
-And surfboards.
-Yes, surfboards.

446
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,415
How many do you see?

447
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,251
-Two.
-Yes, there are two.

448
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:14,753
So what?

449
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,504
"So what?"

450
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,052
I see. Do you want me to help you
sand the surfboards?

451
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,305
No, that's not it.

452
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,432
Look at them. There are two surfboards.

453
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,518
Why two? You and me.
They are matching surfboards.

454
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,936
I made them from scratch.

455
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,647
I made them when you were asleep.
And before you woke up

456
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,024
and went to work.

457
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,818
I made them from scratch.
It was a lot of work. All of it.

458
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,946
I made them myself.

459
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:43,990
Incredible.

460
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,703
Yes. "Incredible."

461
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,079
Is that all you've got to say?

462
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,289
Wellâ€¦

463
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,418
So what do I do?

464
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,254
Now, we're going to draw
on the surfboards.

465
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,673
<i>This is yours. And this is mine.</i>

466
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,928
<i>-Isn't this great?
-Thank you!</i>

467
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:08,848
<i>Gosh.</i>

468
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,414
After saying goodbye at the airport,

469
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,626
she neither called nor showed up here.

470
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,879
But what I really can't understand is,

471
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,297
on that day,

472
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,883
the day we were supposed to meet here,

473
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,302
she left me a voice message.

474
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,273
Jae-won, it's me.

475
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,275
Seon-a.

476
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,194
I had a nice time with you.

477
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,154
We

478
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,615
shouldn't meet again.

479
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,954
I'll keep the cameras.

480
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,374
No. I stole them from you.

481
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,502
That was my plan from the start.

482
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,171
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

483
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,178
I didn't even tell Kyeong-jun about this,
since it's not a good story.

484
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,473
I've listened to her last message
dozens of times, butâ€¦

485
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,435
Does anyone know what she meant?

486
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,529
CHEONGGYE 2-GA

487
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,829
I dressed up like a millionaire's wife.

488
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,294
This is a secret.

489
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,590
These are all empty.

490
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,385
Nothing. They're empty.

491
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,389
I carry them around sometimes.

492
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,642
It cheers me up.
