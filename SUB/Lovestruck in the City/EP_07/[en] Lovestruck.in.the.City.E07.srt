6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,788
-Let me go home. Take it off.
-How could you say that?

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,874
-Calm down.
-Hold on. What?

10
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,002
-Are you going to hit me?
-You know what? Fine.

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:48,757
Since you're so petty,
take them with you. Happy now?

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,095
-Gosh.
-Do you have spare shoes?

13
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,097
He returned everything.

14
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,225
-Please calm down.
-Okay.

15
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,268
-Okay.
-Good.

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,895
Okay.

17
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,236
What?

18
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,697
-Take off your underwear.
-What?

19
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,866
-Are you crazy? Come on.
-Take it off!

20
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,867
-Stop it!
-Wait!

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,286
-Take off your underwear!
-Hold on.

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,872
-That's enough, miss.
-Are you insane?

23
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,832
-Why do you want him naked?
-Hold on.

24
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,709
Hey. Give me your bag.

25
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,712
-I bought it for you. Give it back!
-This?

26
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,925
I should give it back to you. That's fair.

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,219
-Take it.
-Give it back.

28
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,806
-Take it. Take the bag!
-You're crazy. Come on.

29
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,516
-Take it!
-Goodness. Hold on.

30
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,934
-Hey, hold on.
-Stop her.

31
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,685
-Hey, are you crazy?
-Take it.

32
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,437
-My gosh.
-You don't think I can?

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,232
-Hold on. I'll leave after I give it back.
-Wait.

34
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,358
Hey, take it!

35
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,195
I think I've seen that woman before.

36
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,448
She was beating up a man
when I was moving out a few years ago.

37
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,699
Name, Oh Seon-yeong.

38
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,494
I've seen her at another division.
She does that often.

39
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,788
But she still keeps falling in love.

40
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,415
Yes. She doesn't get sick of it.
I'm jealous.

41
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,919
However, gifts are donated properties,
so she can't get them back.

42
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,132
Don't come to the police after a fight.
It's tiring for us, too.

43
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,716
It gets worse when they're drunk.

44
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,052
Hey. Damn it.

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,722
Take off your underwear before you go.

46
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,768
TAEPYEONG-RO POLICE BOX

47
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,440
Catch the thief.

48
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,818
The camera thief.

49
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,279
She

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,782
stole my cameras.

51
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,576
Her name is Yoon Seon-a.

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,163
I'd like to report

53
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,832
this heinous camera thief.

54
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,420
-Sure. Okay.
-112. You're the police.

55
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,131
Yes. Come this way.

56
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,757
Okay. Right here.

57
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,845
-Where do I sit?
-Right here. Sit here.

58
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,265
All right. Goodness.

59
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,311
Officer, I had

60
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,606
some cameras.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,858
Three, to be exact.

62
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,404
Those cameras were special.

63
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:22,160
After I got my first paycheck,

64
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,496
I saved up what little I got to buy them.

65
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,792
But she stole those cameras.

66
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,712
The name of the woman
who stole those cameras is…

67
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,213
-Yoon Seon-a.
-Yoon Seon-a.

68
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,509
-Kang Geon.
-And I first met her at…

69
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,594
The karaoke.

70
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,179
-A beach in Yangyang.
-A beach in Yangyang.

71
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,473
That's where we first met.

72
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,236
<i>You met Yoon Seon-a
during your surfing trip in Yangyang.</i>

73
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,153
<i>Yes.</i>

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,449
And that girl stole your cameras,
right, Mr. Park Jae-won?

75
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,409
She stole them.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,787
She took more than my cameras.

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,084
She took my heart.

78
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,215
She took my heart, too.

79
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,302
I have to get the underwear back.

80
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,846
My heart.

81
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,933
I won't cry.

82
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,770
By the way,

83
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,439
how do you know my name?

84
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,985
-Mr. Park Jae-won?
-Yes.

85
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,820
Aren't you an architect?

86
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,072
How did you know that?

87
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,663
Look. It's written here.

88
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,999
"Park Jae-won."

89
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,625
-What?
-"Drunk."

90
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,253
-And it's written here, too.
-This is…

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,422
"February 7th."

92
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,883
Everyone at this police box
knows who you are.

93
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,511
Everyone knows me?

94
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,638
And the camera thief, Yoon Seon-a.

95
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,682
-You know me, too?
-Yes.

96
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,434
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

97
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,352
You're a regular here.

98
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,105
"Regular"?

99
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,690
For the past year,

100
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,859
you came here five times.

101
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,903
-Five times?
-This is your sixth.

102
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,405
Sixth?

103
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,991
Sixth? I came here way too often.

104
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,787
How come I don't remember anything?

105
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,497
Right. I bet.

106
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,044
-You can't remember because…
-I don't remember.

107
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,378
Why did I come here?

108
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,214
You were always drunk when you came here!

109
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,884
Why are you yelling at me?

110
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,803
-Don't yell at me.
-Look.

111
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,263
-Oh Dong-sik.
-Okay. Look.

112
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,390
-Name, Oh Dong-sik.
-Right here. Look at this.

113
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,517
-December 15th.
-Okay.

114
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,312
-That was your first time here.
-"He was drunk."

115
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,064
Yes. And then,

116
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,317
-February 7th.
-February 7th.

117
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,568
This is for this year.

118
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,655
June 14th. August 9th.

119
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,991
-And October 27th.
-But are you sure that was me?

120
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,284
Yes.

121
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,079
-Are you sure?
-I beg you.

122
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,166
-Please stop coming here.
-Please catch her, then.

123
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,211
Can't you go to another precinct
and ask them instead?

124
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,798
Why do you always come
to our police box, Mr. Park?

125
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,424
Did we do something wrong?

126
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,386
Do you not have any patrol division
in your neighborhood?

127
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,222
We need more than a name to find her.

128
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,598
We need more information,

129
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,267
like her resident registration number
or home address.

130
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,063
Don't just say that she is a camera thief.

131
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,524
-We need other information.
-She was pretty.

132
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,528
Thank you.

133
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,613
She was so beautiful.

134
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,452
Earlier tonight

135
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,039
in Seongsu-dong,

136
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,001
I ran into Yoon Seon-a.

137
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,174
She changed her style.

138
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,844
And she looked prettier.

139
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,514
Well…

140
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,143
But I've always been pretty.

141
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,479
And I'm super stylish, too.

142
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,151
She's not Seon-a, is she?

143
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,777
Okay.

144
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,029
Why don't you lean back? Sit comfortably.

145
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,262
Kyeong-jun.

146
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,223
Hey. You're up.

147
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,226
Are you making salad?

148
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,980
Yes. I wanted to do something nice
for you this morning.

149
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,607
You're not eating at Eun-o's?

150
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,485
We're going to have bread for breakfast.

151
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,279
Really? Are you craving bread?

152
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,409
I see. Then, I'll stop by a bakery
and pick up some bread.

153
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,536
Head over there first.

154
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,834
-This shoulder is too rounded.
-Hey, square your shoulders.

155
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,377
-Yes. Like that.
-But it hurts.

156
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,338
I'm always sitting down.

157
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,256
<i>What's your relationship?</i>

158
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,383
We're kindergarten friends.

159
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,386
We've lived around here
ever since we were kids.

160
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,056
I've never left this neighborhood.

161
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,725
After my parents moved to a farm,
I thought about moving,

162
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,352
but I decided to stay here.

163
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,938
I was born and raised here.
I like it here.

164
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,941
-This is my home and office.
-I live in a studio in the next alley.

165
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,109
It's nice to live close.
We can hang out a lot.

166
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,070
I can't date because of them.

167
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,781
You won't believe me, but it's true.

168
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,243
It must be our fault that you haven't
slept with a girl for two years, then.

169
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,537
-Of course, it's their fault.
-Don't blame us.

170
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,122
There's only one reason
why girls leave me.

171
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,833
They ask me a question, and I answer them.

172
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,876
And then, it's over.

173
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,670
4 YEARS AGO

174
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,012
Hey.

175
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,014
Do you like me or Lee Eun-o?

176
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,227
I like both you and Eun-o.

177
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,063
Do you like me or Suh Rin-i?

178
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,361
Are you asking me to choose

179
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,738
between love and friendship?

180
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,032
No. I don't believe
men and women can be friends.

181
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,243
Is it me or Eun-o? Is it me or Rin-i?

182
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,123
I like you as my girlfriend.
And I like them as my friends.

183
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,810
I bought this for you.

184
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,273
Ask your nice "female friends"
to buy one for you.

185
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,907
-Let's go.
-Okay.

186
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:20,953
Rin-i.

187
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,553
She's here.

188
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,642
Hello, Seon-yeong.

189
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,352
Seon-yeong.

190
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,994
Girls shouldn't fight with each other
over stupid boys.

191
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,752
For your boyfriend.

192
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
She's so cool.

193
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,557
Girl crush.

194
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,858
<i>There's no way they broke up
because of us.</i>

195
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,735
I bet it was something else.

196
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,987
-You were a bad kisser.
-Or you were bad in bed.

197
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,114
Or both.

198
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,032
He had skills, but not passion.

199
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,077
Or he was passionate,
but he didn't do it often enough.

200
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,622
-Are you done?
-Yes.

201
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,873
Keep going. Are you done?

202
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,709
Here's what I don't understand
the most about my ex.

203
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,086
How could she think…

204
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,174
How could she think that
I would fall for girls like these two?

205
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,926
I don't see them as women.

206
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,803
Do you think we see you as a man, then?

207
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,721
I realized you were a boy
when we were eight.

208
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,099
Didn't he wear his sister's dress
to kindergarten?

209
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,559
Hey!

210
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,978
-They were shorts.
-Right. He did.

211
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,440
You did wear them!
And it drove your mother crazy.

212
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,899
Guys, I'm here!

213
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,401
Rin-i, I got some bread.

214
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,945
It's cold outside. Let's go in.

215
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,406
-Did you get cream buns?
-Not sure. You can check.

216
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,117
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Pushover, play some music.

217
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,119
-I'll play something sexy.
-Eun-o, I'll get the milk.

218
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,371
Okay. I'll get the plates and cups.

219
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,415
-These will do, right?
-Yes. Good.

220
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,085
-I'm hungry.
-I'm so hungry.

221
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,133
-I've been digging this song lately.
-Same here.

222
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,017
This is why I can't see them romantically.

223
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,604
I like sexy women.

224
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,355
Yes.

225
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,817
Don't come near me. Move back.

226
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,407
You guys are the opposite of sexy.

227
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,619
What are you talking about?
Rin-i is so sexy.

228
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,788
Are you okay?

229
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,292
Don't do it. Stop it.

230
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,712
I told you to stop it.
If you don't, I'll dance, too.

231
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,384
What's he doing?

232
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,803
I know that dance. It's the Fly Dance.

233
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,268
Hello?

234
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,979
Where?

235
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,358
The police?

236
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,901
Hey, turn it off.

237
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,695
Park Jae-won is at the patrol division?

238
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,784
TAEPYEONG-RO POLICE BOX

239
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,119
Hello.

240
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,332
Thank you for your hard work.

241
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,169
-Thank you.
-Accepting this will get us in trouble.

242
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,712
No, it's nothing big.

243
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,215
You're working so hard at this early hour.

244
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,884
I hope these drinks will help
boost your energy.

245
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,012
Think of it as my gesture
to wish you a good day.

246
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,138
Good day!

247
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,393
-The Constable Oh Dong-sik I spoke to…
-It's me.

248
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,397
You're Park Jae-won's cousin,
Choi Kyeong-jun, correct?

249
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,731
Yes, that's me.

250
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,401
By the way, where is Jae-won?

251
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,738
If he keeps this up, he could be charged

252
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,408
with public intoxication
based on the Minor Offenses Act.

253
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,869
It wasn't a big scene,
but he's done it many times.

254
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,453
"Many times"?

255
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,414
What was the reason?

256
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,083
You came quickly.

257
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,128
Isn't it quite cold in there?
The floor is cold.

258
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,214
-Why did you come here? Tell me.
-Well, I…

259
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,969
Did that girl really steal your cameras?

260
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,392
Hey, Kyeong-jun.
You should have some ox blood.

261
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,062
-Have two pieces.
-Can't you eat it?

262
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,523
I like it,

263
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,734
but I'll give it to you.

264
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,403
You made a fool of yourself.

265
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,281
What is this? It's embarrassing.

266
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,077
-I don't live here.
-Fine. You're so cool.

267
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,079
I'm glad you don't live here.

268
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,999
I'll do all the client meetings
for a month.

269
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,751
Meetings with constructors, too.

270
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,046
Okay. You can have my rice, too.

271
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,925
Don't tell Rin-i about the cameras.

272
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,094
Hey, Rin-i. This is crazy. Listen.

273
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,888
-Don't.
-Do you remember Yoon Seon-a?

274
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,308
He didn't give his cameras to her.
She stole them from him.

275
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,562
Exactly.
They probably cost 20 to 30 million won.

276
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,689
-Stop it.
-Yes. I'll tell you later.

277
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,232
Okay. Talk to you later.

278
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,404
-A bottle of soju, please.
-Ma'am, ignore him.

279
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,574
No. Ma'am, five bottles of soju, please.

280
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,742
Drink them all and die.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,132
<i>Where and when did we agree to meet?</i>

282
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,386
Cheonggyecheon's third stepping stone,
last Saturday of this month, at ten.

283
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,773
Hey.

284
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,734
What are you staring at? Let's just go.

285
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,459
What is it?

286
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,424
-What are you looking for?
-Nothing.

287
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,842
Come on.

288
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,345
My gosh. There you are.

289
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,681
Darn it.

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,935
I'm confiscating them.

291
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,312
Did you think I couldn't find them?

292
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,899
Drink again,
and I'll inject you with alcohol.

293
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,068
-Hey.
-Thanks for the liquor.

294
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,132
ALL ABOUT MARKETING
O3

295
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,097
What? Are you throwing that out?

296
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,811
Yes. Go ahead and throw it out.

297
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,312
You can do it, Jae-won!

298
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,382
-Are you done?
-Yes.

299
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,009
Let's see.

300
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,221
-Gosh, they look great.
-We're done.

301
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,165
-How are the waves?
-I heard the waves would be great.

302
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,249
-Really?
-Yes.

303
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,375
Let's check.

304
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,340
What is this? The waves suck today.

305
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,383
Right. They never get anything right.

306
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,387
Let's do something else.

307
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,765
Okay? Let's do something else.

308
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,976
Hey!

309
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,187
Come here! Come here.

310
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,250
-Give it back.
-Here you go.

311
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
Give it back. Come on. Now!

312
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,213
-Right here. Here you go.
-Give it back now.

313
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,174
-Right here.
-Forget it.

314
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,216
Right…

315
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,926
Okay. I'll stop.

316
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,431
Let me dry your hair. Just like this.

317
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,852
Hold on.

318
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,272
How beautiful. You look gorgeous, Seon-a.

319
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,872
-Stoop down.
-Down?

320
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,749
Here.

321
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,462
-Take that!
-Stop it.

322
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,591
Stop that.

YEOKSAM-DONG COMMUNITY CENTER

324
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,127
Hello.

325
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,173
How do I throw out this surfboard?
I need to pay first, right?

326
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,425
Take a number first.

327
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,345
A number? I'm sorry.

328
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,017
I want to throw this out.

329
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,646
You're here to buy stickers
for oversized garbage.

330
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,398
Hold on.

331
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,692
<i>I'll throw it away.</i>

332
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,570
<i>I'll forget her.</i>

333
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,620
You do need to buy the sticker
to throw it out.

334
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,664
-Okay.
-But we no longer sell them.

335
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,958
-You can buy them at other stores.
-I see.

336
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,085
Do you want the list of stores?

337
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,754
Yes, please.

338
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,548
-Here.
-Thanks.

339
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,433
Isn't that a surfboard?

340
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,560
It looks fine.

341
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,270
-But you want to throw it out?
-Yes.

342
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,897
-Really?
-Yes.

343
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,609
If you're really sure about that,
leave it here.

344
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,610
Give it to me.

345
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,154
Well…

346
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,499
No.

347
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,086
Why not?
You said you were throwing it out.

348
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,672
If I take it, you won't need a sticker.

349
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,305
Okay. Keep it.

350
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,603
That felt nice.

351
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,759
-It's so refreshing!
-Isn't it nice?

352
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,079
<i>It's raining like that day.</i>

353
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,337
I can't throw it out today.

354
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,133
<i>This rain will pass.</i>

355
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,600
Right. Even if I put off
what I can do today until tomorrow,

356
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,102
I'll be okay.

357
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,815
That's my life philosophy.

358
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,750
<i>It will pass.</i>

359
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:15,610
We should decide on this
after we discuss it with the client.

360
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,611
Okay.

361
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,741
What on earth is Mr. Park carrying?

362
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,120
Don't mind him.

363
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,289
It might be better for us
to think that at our office,

364
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,794
we have a drunkard who went crazy
after getting dumped by a girl.

365
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,900
-The project in Bongcheon-dong--
-Hey, Kyeong-jun.

366
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,819
The dashcam.

367
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,155
-The dashcam in my car.
-What are you talking about?

368
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,657
I went to the police box last night

369
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,535
because I saw Yoon Seon-a
in that neighborhood yesterday.

370
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,036
In Rin-i's neighborhood?

371
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,372
My gosh. Why didn't I think of that?

372
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,125
It's in my car.
I have a dashcam in my car.

373
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,919
Wait. Where's your car?

374
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,296
TOW NOTICE

375
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,027
Hey! Where's my car?

376
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,362
Damn it. Gosh. No!

377
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,698
It's been towed away.

378
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,367
Kyeong-jun.

379
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,830
Hey, my car was towed.
Why are they so diligent?

380
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,915
My car…

381
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,084
Hey, can you comfort me?

382
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,671
Come on. This is not cool.
I'm about to go crazy.

383
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,589
Hey, Rin-i.

384
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,426
-Jae-won is officially insane.
-Don't tell her about the car.

385
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,887
He said he saw Yoon Seon-a
in your neighborhood.

386
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,973
So he parked his car here
and went to drink.

387
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,975
-Don't tell her.
-But his car got towed.

388
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:16,564
I think Jae-won is seeing things
because of alcohol addiction.

389
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,025
This is pretty serious.

390
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,569
Right? Don't you feel bad for him?

391
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,157
Now? We're on our way to
the storage facility for towed vehicles.

392
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,535
What a crazy morning.

393
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,995
He's been dragging me along all morning.

394
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,289
No. We can keep talking.

395
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,750
Did you eat lunch, baby?

396
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,669
What did you eat?

397
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,546
A salad?

398
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,382
I told you to have some rice.

399
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,220
What? "Alcohol addiction"?
"Feel bad for him"?

400
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,931
You just wait here.
I'll show you how she looks.

401
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,560
-How will you do that?
-With the dashcam.

402
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,105
Gosh. Why didn't I think of this sooner?

403
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,690
You're dead meat.

404
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,113
Yes. I'm calling
from 310-23, Seongsu-dong.

405
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,115
I'm reporting an illegally parked car.

406
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,826
Yes. Tow it away, please.

407
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,287
Okay.

408
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,834
Wait. Is it okay if I pay the fine?

409
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,921
Oh, I can't? I see.

410
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,801
Okay. Please tow it away carefully
without damaging the car.

411
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,721
Okay. Thank you.

412
