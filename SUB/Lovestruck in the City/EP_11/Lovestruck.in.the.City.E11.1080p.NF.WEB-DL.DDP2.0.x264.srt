00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,830
PSYCHIATRIST KIM SEONG-U

9
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,958
{\an8}<i>Is there an advisable way to break up?</i>

10
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,253
I think that's an important discussion.

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,630
Breakups are more important
than relationships.

12
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,759
A healthy breakup leads
to another healthy relationship,

13
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,220
and in a healthy relationship,
people can find love again.

14
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,098
Who's talking such nonsense?

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,726
That was the question.

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,979
I was just giving my professional opinion.

17
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,357
What is a healthy breakup?

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,777
That's what I was talking about.

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,654
Step one. Inform your loved one
why you're breaking up.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,823
You're an idiot.

21
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,825
Do you think they will understand why?

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,620
Even if they don't,
you should still tell them.

23
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,247
Step two. Break up face-to-face,

24
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,124
not via text or over the phone.

25
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,043
Do it in person and peacefully.

26
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,169
Why did you hit him?

27
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,800
-I broke up with her.
-That's not the whole story.

28
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>I believe we should tell</i>

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,179
the people we used to love
why we want to break up.

30
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,515
You said you couldn't stop
looking at my nostrils,

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,392
and it felt like
you were talking to my nostrils!

32
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,687
-<i>What they do next is up to them.</i>
-"She was offended.

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,397
He could only see her nostrils

34
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,525
whenever he looked at her."

35
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,903
Why did you say such mean things?

36
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,155
You could've been nice about it.

37
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,990
I was nice about it.

38
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,160
But when I kept giving her good excuses,
she didn't understand it.

39
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,413
See? Breakups can never be healthy.

40
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,291
You're ending a relationship
with someone you loved so dearly.

41
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,086
A breakup is inevitably painful
for everyone

42
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,004
regardless of who's ending it.

43
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,089
Yes.

44
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,674
It's painful however you put it.

45
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,343
You just have to move on with the pain.

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,866
I didn't get any sleep last night.

47
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,910
I lay down to get some sleep.

48
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,205
But I kept getting pissed off!

49
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,751
<i>Yes. That's it.</i>

50
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,130
You should get mad at her
and vow to take revenge.

51
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,049
No. Taking revenge makes no sense.

52
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,844
<i>Breakups are out of your hands,</i>

53
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,888
<i>and so is the pain from breakups.</i>

54
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,015
<i>But I believe ruining your life</i>

55
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,977
just because you had one bad relationship
is a very foolish move.

56
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,186
Was that Kyeong-jun?

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,898
Shut up before I kill you.
You don't even know Seon-a.

58
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,608
<i>-Damn it.</i>
-What do you mean?

59
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,278
Didn't he say that was a fake name?

60
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,487
Come on.

61
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,157
Stop telling other people about me.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,327
I'm the only one who looks lame
in this interview right now!

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,912
Damn it.

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,749
-Who are we talking about?
-Isn't it about Jae-won?

65
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,876
Is there another lame guy
in this interview?

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,837
Tell him to grab a drink with Jae-won.

67
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,174
I was already stabbed in the back
when she gave me a fake name.

68
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,593
But this…

69
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,846
It feels like

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,850
she slashed my heart.

71
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,605
What? Seriously? Are you kidding me?

72
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,482
She's a friend of Rin-i?

73
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,400
Rin-i's friend?
She must know Kyeong-jun, too.

74
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,613
She's been so close all this time,
living her life as if nothing happened.

75
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,948
How can this be?

76
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,616
Answer me! How can that be?

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,785
How is it even possible?

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,329
Damn it!

79
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,257
Get out. Stop filming me.
Get the hell out of here!

80
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,349
Get out right now!

81
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,477
Get out of my house. Stop filming me.

82
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,740
You're so fast!

83
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,792
I'm tired.

84
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,175
-Rin-i, let's go home.
-What?

85
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,177
It's so cold. Let's go home.

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,972
Eun-o, do this ten times.

87
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,725
You sit all the time. You should exercise.

88
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,977
It's good for your back.

89
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,156
{\an8}CAN WE… COME CLOSE TO YOU?

90
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,866
I told you to leave.

91
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,995
So you have been waiting for me out here?
Unbelievable.

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,293
Fine. The thing that made me angrier is

93
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,836
that guy.

94
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,303
It sounded like she had a guy.

95
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,473
I'm hungry. Let's go home now.

96
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,974
-Come on.
-Let go.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,436
Rin-i, let's go home. I'm hungry.

98
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,395
All right.

99
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,773
Come on, I'm hungry. Stop it now.

100
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,982
What do you want to eat?

101
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,817
-"Think about it."
-Let's just go.

102
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,071
"How much did my body
have to endure all this time?"

103
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,949
What should we eat?

104
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,494
-Eun-o, can you pick this up for me?
-Let's go home.

105
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,413
Hey, can you pick it up?

106
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
-Hey.
-Get up. Pick it up yourself.

107
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,876
I can't do that right now.
Come on, get it for me.

108
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,721
It sounded like she was living with him.

109
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,141
She lived with me, too. How is that easy?

110
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,727
Is dating a joke to her,
like playing house?

111
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,438
Fine. Dating isn't that big a deal.

112
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,024
People break up.
People can move in together.

113
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
But

114
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,695
she should do that
after ending things with me.

115
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,324
She should break up with me first,
and then date other men. Shouldn't she?

116
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,744
Look, Seon-a.

117
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,125
You'd better be single.
If you're seeing someone right now…

118
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,436
<i>Yes. Hetbahn has the best instant rice.</i>

119
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,147
-Bibigo has the best soup.
-Parks, for exercising.

120
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,857
-Come on.
-What?

121
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,026
Why spend money on that expensive gym?
Parks have everything.

122
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,029
-No, Rin-i. It was cold there.
-I agree. Let's stop going there.

123
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,531
Let's go back in spring.

124
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,201
Hey. Let's take this moment
to think seriously about this.

125
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,372
When will we be able to get
a membership at a nice gym?

126
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,541
Not in this life.

127
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,668
I did some marketing gigs for hotels.

128
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,298
-Guess how much a membership costs.
-Forget it. My hourly rate is 9,000 won.

129
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,425
Exercising at the park is enough for me.

130
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,721
So does it mean none of us has
a bright future ahead of us?

131
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,141
Her future is bright enough.
Her boyfriend is Choi Kyeong-jun.

132
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,519
Right. He must have a lot of money.
I'm sure he's rich.

133
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,773
Hold on. You'd better take me
seriously right now.

134
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,609
What does he have to do with this?

135
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,738
Let me be serious, too.
Aren't you going to marry him?

136
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,825
I don't want to marry anyone,
not even Kyeong-jun.

137
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,792
Yes. Hello?

138
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,587
Yes, this is Lee Eun-o of O3.

139
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,838
Yes, that's right.

140
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,592
I see. A presentation? Today?

141
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,720
-This is quite sudden.
-We're going to watch a movie--

142
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,847
Yes. I can do it. I can totally do it.

143
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,183
Yes. O3 is always ready.

144
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,436
Yes. I'll see you
in the afternoon, then. Bye.

145
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,397
Guys. Just wait and see.

146
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,900
It looks like O3 is about to receive…

147
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,527
<i>A lot of projects</i>

148
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,320
<i>A lot of projects</i>

149
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,321
Hold on.

150
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,825
Then, why don't I get my skin treated
before my presentation?

151
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,410
Excuse me.

152
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,662
-Again?
-All of a sudden?

153
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,288
Hey.

154
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,754
Does she think they'll hire her
to market the product?

155
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,382
Will the advertiser even watch this?

156
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,517
Are you done?

157
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,897
Were you serious when you said
you're not going to marry Kyeong-jun?

158
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,774
You weren't, right? Does he know?

159
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,402
Kyeong-jun and I never
talked about marriage.

160
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,572
-If you didn't tell him, he would assume--
-Hey.

161
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,532
Marriage isn't important to us right now.

162
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,450
Making a living is.

163
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,786
Are you even writing these days?

164
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,706
You should have one, too.

165
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,333
Rin-i, don't trust men.

166
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,210
Trust me and just wait. Okay?

167
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,212
Yes. I love you.

168
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,385
This one is really nice.

169
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,680
But I'll take that one.

170
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,601
But the one you chose at first
is the most popular model nowadays.

171
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,019
I can tell.

172
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,313
But I'll still take this one.

173
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,189
Okay.

174
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,026
-Can I take it home right away?
-Yes, you can.

175
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,877
I should buy a bicycle for Rin-i.

176
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,353
-Rin-i.
-Kyeong-jun. I'm glad you're here.

177
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,605
Let's take this to Eun-o's house.

178
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,983
I told you I needed a nightstand.
And look what I found!

179
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,943
Wouldn't it look great with some fixing?

180
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,529
-Open up the trunk.
-Wait.

181
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:05,206
An interior design agency I work with
used that for their open house.

182
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,292
-I got dibs on it.
-Really?

183
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,379
So you can forget about this junk.

184
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,048
Is that expensive?

185
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,348
-Hello.
-Hi.

186
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,558
Han-gyeol, where's Kyeong-jun?

187
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,560
He went to the site in Pangyo
this morning.

188
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,688
Mr. Park. I got the O3 materials
during the weekend.

189
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,150
I looked into the agency,
and most of her projects had good results.

190
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,777
Should I ask her to bid?

191
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,948
It's a small agency. Can she handle it?

192
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,785
Even if big agencies win,
they usually assign only one employee.

193
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,328
It won't be an issue.

194
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,163
And I looked into the opening party

195
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,541
O3 did for an art gallery
a couple of months ago.

196
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,836
She made great use of social media.

197
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,089
We were looking for a novel agency,
so this is a great find.

198
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,342
I'll schedule a meeting with her
once Mr. Choi returns.

199
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,179
-I'll look over the materials a bit more.
-Okay.

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,977
You can tell it's expensive, right?
Doesn't this look new?

201
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,646
-Buy it for 300,000 won.
-What?

202
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,566
-I won't even pay 100,000 for it.
-Hey.

203
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,026
That's imported.

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,446
-How much is it originally?
-How much?

205
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,948
About 1.2 million won.

206
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,284
I got it for free.

207
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,369
-But it's around that much.
-Really?

208
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,247
Really? I didn't know that.

209
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,333
Hey, I take back my offer.

210
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,502
Since it was on display,
I want 500,000 won.

211
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,712
What? No.

212
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,173
You're missing out on a great deal.

213
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,300
Look at this beautiful,
expensive nightstand.

214
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,095
Forget it.
I won't sell it to you whatsoever.

215
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,016
Rin-i, don't sell it to him.
That's way too cheap.

216
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,017
Is it?

217
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,228
He's checking it out.

218
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,356
JAE-WON

219
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,859
Hey, Jae-won.

220
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,737
I'm going to the site in Pangyo today.

221
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,712
I'm not the Lee Eun-o I used to be.

222
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,590
Do a good job.

223
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,051
<i>Tell me about Ms. Lee Eun-o.</i>

224
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,931
You woke me up at 4 a.m.
just to ask me that?

225
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,102
You always say you're in Pangyo
when you go see Rin-i.

226
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,649
No one was there to receive the materials,

227
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,526
so I really went there at 4 a.m.

228
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,948
It's true I went to see Rin-i,
but it was after I finished my job.

229
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,783
You can't do this.

230
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,662
Should I work from nine to five
and count overtime, then?

231
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,833
TAILORED, NEED-BASED PROMOTION STRATEGY

232
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,711
Han-gyeol said this agency is pretty good.

233
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,797
Then, should I tell her to bid?

234
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,759
By the way,
why are you asking me about Eun-o?

235
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,471
Why did you do that last weekend?

236
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,684
You and Rin-i cost us a client.

237
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,937
Shouldn't you have given me
an explanation afterwards?

238
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,189
-I'm sorry.
-Tell me.

239
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,903
So, was the client and Ms. Lee Eun-o

240
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,699
engaged or something?

241
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,286
I saw Kang Min-su.

242
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,915
He came to Kyeong-jun's company
to build a house.

243
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,169
Did you ask why he broke up with Eun-o?

244
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,213
Apparently, he's married.

245
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,924
-The wife's from the same airline.
-What?

246
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,261
Isn't that crazy?
Their baby is already nine months old.

247
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,768
Eun-o went down to Busan last year.

248
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,521
And the woman was already pregnant
with the baby then.

249
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,734
Then, he was cheating on her.

250
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,569
-Yes.
-Is he still in Busan?

251
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,487
-Let's take the train to Busan.
-Hey.

252
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,365
Kyeong-jun already beat him up.
I poured coke on him, too.

253
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,283
Sit down.

254
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,583
-That's why they broke up.
-That's why she vanished for three months.

255
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,502
He made her go to Busan
so they could be together.

256
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,214
They stayed together in Busan.
Once he got transferred to Seoul,

257
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,593
they decided to get married.
She even got a job in Busan.

258
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,137
But she suddenly disappeared
for three months.

259
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,140
Rin-i was in the UK
to spend time with her mother.

260
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,100
But she came back for Eun-o.

261
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,353
In that case,

262
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,981
did you go talk to that jerk back then?

263
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,442
We did.

264
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,320
But they broke up
as soon as she got to Busan.

265
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,492
Oh, right. We went to the hotel
where Eun-o had been hired.

266
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,119
And Rin-i and I

267
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,414
met a woman who had
a job interview with Eun-o.

268
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,918
The hotel decided
not to hire Ms. Lee Eun-o.

269
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,297
I don't think she got the notice.
She came to the hotel.

270
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,426
How could a company
cancel her employment so abruptly?

271
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,639
So what about my friend?
What happened to her?

272
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,643
Did she say she was going somewhere?

273
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,896
I don't know.

274
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,774
She seemed like a nice girl.

275
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,110
We could have been colleagues.

276
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,362
Don't worry.

277
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,282
She might have taken the chance
to go on a long trip.

278
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,036
Thank you.

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,663
She got rid of her phone.

280
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,874
We talked about reporting her missing.
It was crazy back then.

281
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,085
Rin-i cried every day.

282
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,508
Then, did she tell you where she stayed
when she came back?

283
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,094
She wouldn't even tell us
why she broke up with him.

284
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,974
Can't you guess how she must have felt?

285
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,517
Her boyfriend cheated on her.

286
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,937
Her job at the hotel was canceled,
and she had no place to go.

287
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,982
After that, she changed a lot.

288
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,652
She used to be innocently kind and quiet.

289
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,114
Innocently kind and quiet?

290
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,118
Can handing out flyers to random passersby
improve your company's image?

291
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:21,415
I'd like to suggest more direct
and more effective methods.

292
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,001
I've brought a few theater posters.

293
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,755
This recent play, <i>How About You?</i>,
is very popular in Daehangno these days.

294
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,465
<i>What Do Couples Live for?</i>

295
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,842
will probably be
in the box office for some time.

296
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,970
<i>A Good Day for an Affair</i>,
<i>The Taste of Marriage</i>.

297
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,138
All right.

298
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,267
Now, find differences
in the posters I'll show you next.

299
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,560
<i>HOW ABOUT YOU?</i>

300
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,356
The actress who was just standing
is now holding a bag of <i>ramyeon.</i>

301
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,026
The title's meaning became
<i>How About Ramyeon?</i>

302
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,071
And in this poster, she's holding a drink.

303
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,782
What do you think?
Don't the products grab your attention?

304
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,284
This doesn't only apply to posters.

305
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:02,372
While the actress is delivering her lines,
she will be holding the bag of <i>ramyeon.</i>

306
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,418
Why? Because she was about to cook it
when her boyfriend came to her house.

307
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,630
Ring, ring. "Who is it?

308
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,968
Gosh. What brings you here at this hour?

309
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,554
You need to talk to me?
It's three in the morning.

310
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,100
{\an8}<i>Ramyeon</i>?
I got hungry when I was about to sleep.

311
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,436
Want some <i>ramyeon</i>? It's tasty.

312
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,479
Hold on."

313
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,565
<i>A GOOD DAY FOR AN AFFAIR</i>

314
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,236
"By the way, why are you here?
What? You want to break up? Why?

315
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,030
You came here to say that at this hour?

316
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,323
But why?

317
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,119
You've been seeing someone else?
Who? For how long?

318
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,040
Put yourself in my shoes.
How can you possibly be okay with this?

319
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,501
How long have you been lying to me?"

320
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,420
Just like this,
during important scenes in the play,

321
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,673
she'll deliver her lines
while holding the <i>ramyeon.</i>

322
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,510
That's good, but how is that different
from product placement in dramas?

323
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,304
I doubt it will increase
our sales that much.

324
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,143
You don't do this for big bucks.
You do it to win people over.

325
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,980
"A leading food company
sponsors the culture industry."

326
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,899
With this, you can improve
your brand image at the same time.

327
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,777
We can easily achieve that
by donating some of our products.

328
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,279
That's another way.

329
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:20,284
But it will be embarrassing
to call a donation "sponsorship."

330
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,369
It probably will be.

331
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,707
To be honest, our marketing team
can take care of this.

332
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,335
Right. Of course.

333
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,090
But you will definitely be embarrassed
to steal someone else's idea.

334
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,303
It went better than I thought.

335
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,014
Seeing how they reacted,
I can tell they liked your pitch.

336
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,933
I always exceed people's expectations.
You can trust me.

337
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,689
Are you holding job interviews today?

338
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,900
Yes. We're only recruiting
two people today.

339
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,944
But a lot of people applied,
so interviews will last all day.

340
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,655
Coffee or green tea?

341
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,533
Green tea, please. Thank you.

342
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,461
{\an8}-Please read this.
-Okay. Thank you.

343
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,453
<i>That day,</i>

344
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,873
{\an8}<i>if I hadn't met Yoon Seon-a,</i>

345
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,418
<i>where would I be now?</i>

346
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,427
Everyone, don't be nervous!

347
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,806
Just…

348
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,058
Just be yourself.

349
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,228
Someone will
definitely recognize your talents.

350
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,690
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

351
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,275
Good luck!

352
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,698
-I'll make my own tea.
-Okay.

353
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,575
-Jae-won.
-Yes?

354
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,036
I'll send Eun-o a request
to join the bidding.

355
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,207
She's good at her job.

356
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,584
Come on, you saw her portfolio.

357
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,461
Oh, right.

358
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,381
We're camping out on her rooftop tomorrow.
Do you want to come?

359
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,716
You should come.

360
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,884
At Ms. Lee's house?

361
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,929
You can just stop by her neighborhood
just like last time.

362
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,930
No pressure.

363
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,516
And then, you can talk about the project.

364
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,979
Camping out on the rooftop in winter?
It's freezing.

365
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,357
Come on. Why do you think
<i>naengmyeon </i>is a winter dish?

366
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,651
You eat Pyeongyang <i>naengmyeon</i> in winter.

367
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,194
It's the same thing.

368
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,448
Are you sure I can join you?

369
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,866
Of course.

370
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,577
She shares her studio
with her friend, anyway.

371
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,830
Remember Geon,
my unemployed novelist friend?

372
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,876
Why does she share a house with a man?

373
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,046
Did they move in together?

374
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,716
-Are they dating?
-What? No way. They're just friends.

375
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,760
-Bundle up. It's cold.
-Okay.

376
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,220
See you tomorrow.

377
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,198
It's all done.

378
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,205
-Is it ready?
-Yes. Almost.

379
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,582
It's burning.

380
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,338
Guys, the charcoal's ready.
Let's grill the meat.

381
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,506
-Okay.
-Okay.

382
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,508
-I'll take them.
-Take these, too.

383
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,929
Kyeong-jun, don't tell Eun-o
we ran into Kang Min-su.

384
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,890
I'm not stupid.
Why would I? That's an awful memory.

385
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,894
She must have been heartbroken.
She doesn't even mention his name.

386
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,063
But Eun-o has promise rings.

387
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,899
What?

388
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,113
-There are two rings on her necklace.
-No way.

389
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,574
You don't think
she's still hung up on Min-su, do you?

390
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,621
They broke up because he cheated on her
and knocked up another woman.

391
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,039
She still has the rings?

392
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,583
Then whose rings are they?
They were matching rings.

393
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,087
No way. I doubt they're the ones
she had with Min-su.

394
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,841
She's seeing someone. She must be.

395
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,094
Why is she keeping
so many secrets from us now?

396
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,929
Listen. She's seeing someone.

397
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,431
Did she tell you anything?
You should find out.

398
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,475
-Why are you excited?
-That must be it.

399
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,102
-Go.
-Bring some drinks.

400
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,272
-Don't tell her anything.
-Okay.

401
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,482
Drinks.

402
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,026
Alcohol.

403
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,965
It's so cold.

404
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,718
Why is it so cold today?

405
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,101
I should have bundled up. Damn it.

406
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,689
Am I overdressed for this?

407
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,110
Goodness.

408
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,160
-Dig in.
-Let's eat.

409
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,077
Let's eat.

410
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,120
Hold on.

411
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,875
Ta-da.

412
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:08,506
Let me tell you about this liquor
before we start our meal.

413
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,383
-Just pour it.
-Let's just drink.

414
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,343
Let's just drink it.

415
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,098
You'll regret it.
Let me tell you about this liquor.

416
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,186
This beautiful liquor was made by mixing
1,200 types of centuries-old extracts.

417
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,688
Do you know how much I paid for it?

418
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,316
-I paid 100,000 won.
-From whom?

419
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,903
From these two fools!

420
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,947
How much is it, then?

421
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,200
A bottle would cost
about three million won.

422
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,161
Come here. You jerk, come back.

423
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,537
You scammer.

424
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,331
-Give it back.
-Hey.

425
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,875
-Where did you get that expensive bottle?
-Give it.

426
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,879
-From my cousin.
-From Jae-won.

427
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,967
My cousin got totally messed up
because of some girl lately.

428
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,010
He almost became an alcoholic.

429
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,513
You know, the camera thief.

430
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,599
What a romantic.

431
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,602
He went to the police station to find her
when he got wasted.

432
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,356
So, Kyeong-jun took
all of his liquor from his house.

433
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,942
-He sold it to me.
-Only for 100,000 won.

434
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,569
If this one costs three million won…

435
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,323
-How much would the other ones cost?
-You scammer.

436
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,953
Eun-o, I'll let you taste it first.

437
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,165
You jerk.

438
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,127
If it was that expensive,
you should have told me.

439
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,587
-You're so vicious.
-Did you call me a jerk?

440
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,839
Yes. You scamming jerk.

441
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,550
-My Rin-i, do you want some?
-Hey, hold on.

442
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,844
Don't call her "my Rin-i."

443
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,763
Only I can call her "my Rin-i."

444
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,851
Kyeong-jun's Rin-i.
Let me pour you a drink.

445
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,730
-You dropped some!
-Come on.

446
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,651
JAE-WON

447
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,779
Can you even taste this?

448
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,072
Hey, where are you?

449
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,034
You're here? Hold on.

450
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,580
Hey, over here. Come up here.

451
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,914
-Okay.
-Is that Jae-won?

452
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,208
I forgot to tell you.

453
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,044
I invited him here. I hope it's okay.

454
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,879
-Should I hide this?
-Take the stairs.

455
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,469
Jae-won!

456
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,516
Come. Join us. We just started.

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,770
It's your first time meeting my friends.
Say hello.

458
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,730
Hello, I'm Kang Geon.

459
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,150
I'm Park Jae-won.

460
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,944
-You're handsome.
-I've been wanting to meet you.

461
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,908
This is my friend, Jae-won.

462
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,545
It's nice to meet you. I'm Park Jae-won.

463
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:58,968
Hi.

464
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,643
I was very curious about you,
Ms. Lee Eun-o.

465
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,900
That's long enough for a handshake.

466
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,111
-Give me what you brought.
-Here.

467
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,657
What? You took off your ring?
Where did it go?

468
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,409
Oh, the ring?

469
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,869
I threw it out.

470
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,794
Because everything about her was fake.

471
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,275
Geon, pour him a glass, too.

472
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,777
Okay. I'll go bring a glass.

473
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,409
-Jae-won, sit down.
-Okay. Thanks.

474
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,952
Sit down, Jae-won.

475
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,791
You must be freezing.
You should have layered up more.

476
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,335
It's not that cold. I'm okay.

477
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,712
-Did you drive here?
-Yes.

478
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,797
You should call a chauffeur.

479
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,594
-Isn't it pretty here?
-It's nice.

480
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,391
-Eun-o, are you okay?
-What?
