00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,129
FOUR-MEMBER ROCK BAND
FORMED IN 1962 IN LIVERPOOL

9
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,006
Are you sure it's going to rain?

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,300
Yes, they said so.

11
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,719
I don't think it'll rain.

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,013
I don't mind it.

13
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,349
THIS BAND WAS BOTH ARTISTIC AND POPULAR

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,726
Come here.

15
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,522
EVEN TO THIS DAY,
THEY'RE STILL AN INSPIRATION TO MANY

16
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,649
UNLIKE MOST OF THEIR SONGS,

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,527
"KISS ME KISS ME" IS A SONG
THAT OPENLY TALKS ABOUT LOVE

18
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,863
MANY KOREAN ARTISTS HAVE COVERED THIS SONG

19
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,536
-You know what?
-What?

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,122
I can't focus on the book.

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,335
I can offer more to watch.

22
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,341
What does this mean?

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,718
I bought it just because it was pretty.

24
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,138
I no longer try to find
any meaning in anything.

25
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,389
That's what it means.

26
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,769
-I like that.
-Why?

27
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,938
Just because.

28
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,318
I like your style, personality…

29
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,781
I like every single thing about you.

30
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,378
It's raining.

31
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,840
See? I told you.

32
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,675
-Right?
-Yes.

33
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,010
I was right, wasn't I? I told you so.

34
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,730
-Let's go.
-What? Where?

35
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,065
Where are you going?

36
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,527
Hey, be careful!

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,862
Hurry up, Jae-won.

38
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,446
Hey, Seon-a!

39
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,532
Wait for me!

40
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,416
-Hey!
-It's raining!

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,834
Wait for me, Seon-a!

42
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,760
-It's so refreshing!
-Isn't it nice?

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,654
<i>That was the very first time
I wasn't upset over the fact</i>

44
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,116
<i>that I didn't have an umbrella.</i>

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>Rather, I was happy.</i>

46
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,722
-You're leaving in a month, right?
-Yes.

47
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,516
I asked for a one-month leave. Why?

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,853
If you took another month off,
would you get fired?

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,105
Why?

50
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,273
Shall I take another month off?

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,610
If I get fired,

52
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,528
I'll just work at my previous company.

53
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,412
If I do request one more month,

54
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,498
will you marry me?

55
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,506
Are you serious?

56
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,508
Yes.

57
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,801
There are a bride and groom here.

58
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,137
We have a place to live,
and we like each other.

59
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,433
I thought you quit being

60
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,102
reluctant or hesitant.

61
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,646
You're right.

62
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,899
A wedding would be fun.

63
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,317
Right? Won't it be fun?

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,945
Let's do it for fun. Okay?

65
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,114
-Let's do that.
-Sure.

66
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,119
But is this all you have
for your proposal?

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,038
Proposal?

68
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,334
<i>I have this fantasy.</i>

69
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,680
Say that again. What?

70
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,056
Pay phones still exist?

71
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,184
Doesn't he have a cell phone?

72
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,936
That's so cringy.

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,938
Proposal? Yes, I did it.

74
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,156
"WHAT DO YOU THINK?" BY YURISANGJA

75
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,034
FORMED IN 1996,

76
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,953
THIS MALE DUO HAS BEEN LOVED
FOR THEIR MELLOW BALLADS

77
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,124
THIS SONG WAS INCLUDED
IN THEIR 2005 SPECIAL ALBUM

78
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:37,253
THE MELODY IS FROM MOZART'S
"TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR"

79
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>It's quite strange</i>

80
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,385
<i>I spend all day looking at you</i>

81
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,096
<i>-I wonder to myself</i>
-What is it?

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,640
<i>-if I'm crazy</i>
-What is it?

83
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:55,354
<i>And then, I smile again</i>

84
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,649
<i>It's quite fascinating</i>

85
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,237
<i>You entered my heart</i>

86
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,823
<i>Without a knock</i>

87
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,953
<i>You run around noisily</i>

88
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,748
-Is he crazy?
<i>-And make me feel flustered</i>

89
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:18,044
<i>I just can't get you</i>

90
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,381
<i>out of my head</i>

91
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,677
<i>Could you perhaps give me a room</i>

92
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:34,102
<i>In your heart where you can lock me up?</i>

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,442
<i>What do you think?</i>

94
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,537
-Here we go.
-Okay.

95
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,957
It's filming.

96
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,712
Okay, then.

97
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,715
Yoon Seon-a and Park Jae-won's wedding
will start now.

98
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,592
Don't do that.

99
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,346
Yoon Seon-a, do you promise
to love Park Jae-won forever?

100
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,722
Yes!

101
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,518
Park Jae-won, do you promise
to love Yoon Seon-a forever?

102
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,811
Yes!

103
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,567
Do you promise to be together

104
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,526
until you grow old?

105
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,778
Yes!

106
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,117
Even on rainy, snowy, or windy days,
will you…

107
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,326
No.

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,412
Even on rainy, snowy, or windy days,

109
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,205
do you vow never to be apart?

110
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,540
Yes!

111
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,333
-That's enough.
-What?

112
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,918
We will now end the wedding.

113
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,504
No, it's not over yet.

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,801
Here.

115
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,155
<i>Let's never take it off.</i>

116
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,498
PARK JAE-WON

117
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,550
<i>That makes me angrier at her.</i>

118
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,478
<i>I wonder where her ring is.</i>

119
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,855
I bet she threw it away.

120
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,108
That's right. I threw it away.

121
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,155
You should at least return the ring
after you break up.

122
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,741
What will you do next?
Give it to someone else?

123
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,244
Do I look like a cheapskate?

124
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,329
I just can't understand her.

125
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,999
Why did she have the wedding
if she was going to dump him?

126
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,209
-Exactly.
-Will you excuse me?

127
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,837
I was writing a project proposal.
I'm kind of busy.

128
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,673
She definitely wasn't planning to.

129
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,759
I guess he still wants to sugarcoat it.

130
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,595
That wedding wasn't legally effective.

131
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>-I want him to forget it.</i>
-Yes, he should.

132
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,267
-Do you think the legality matters here?
-I get him.

133
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,978
Since it wasn't legal to begin with,

134
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,063
he's become more emotional about it.

135
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,482
It's better to think simply.

136
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,485
They lived together for only two months.

137
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,154
Is that short?

138
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,406
Life is long. Two months is short.

139
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,118
I don't think it's something
he should dwell on like that.

140
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,870
Forget it. That's enough.

141
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,414
It's easy for them to say
since it's not about them.

142
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,334
During their time together,
did he lose anything?

143
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,212
Why all of a sudden?

144
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,214
This just popped into my head.

145
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,675
What if he wasn't her target?

146
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,885
Then what?

147
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,430
Well…

148
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,643
Perhaps, she approached him

149
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,728
with an ulterior motive.

150
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,814
What if he had a golden frog
that weighs one <i>nyang</i>?

151
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,024
How much is that?

152
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,735
Am I worth less than one <i>nyang</i> of gold?

153
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,656
I'm sorry. My friend is a bit dumb.

154
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,033
He's quite imaginative
since he's a writer.

155
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,868
No, it's possible.

156
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,788
She wanted something,
so she approached him and stole it.

157
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,706
She achieved her goal, so dumped him.

158
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,167
You said he's a writer.
Are you sure he's competent?

159
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,919
He debuted in a quarterly magazine.

160
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,047
He has a terrible imagination.
How does he make a living?

161
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,507
Did he really not lose anything?

162
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,633
I didn't.

163
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,636
I really didn't.

164
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,679
Why did she approach him
if he had nothing?

165
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,973
<i>Tell him I want to meet him in person.</i>

166
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,600
Gosh, I hate him.

167
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,520
Tell him to see me first, okay?

168
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,105
Me. Meet me first.

169
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,816
My sixth sense is tingling.
He did lose something.

170
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,359
I'm certain Seon-a stole it.

171
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,737
<i>She approached him
because of that something.</i>

172
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,406
He just doesn't want to admit

173
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,283
she faked her feelings for it.

174
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,577
You know,

175
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,206
it's what a woman in her twenties
would say to a rich man in his eighties.

176
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,167
"I love you. I love you so much,

177
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,294
I want to have babies with you!"

178
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,587
HE'S PISSED

179
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,089
He just wants to believe

180
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,591
it's true.

181
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,468
-You're right.
-Hey…

182
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,886
Stop filming.

183
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,806
Turn the camera off. I… This interview…

184
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,809
No. I can't do this. I'm done.

185
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,436
I quit.

186
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,478
HE'S UPSET

187
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,194
I'm telling you. That's not true.

188
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,447
Her feelings for me were genuine.

189
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,824
She was completely honest and passionate.

190
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,035
I didn't think I could
be more loved by her.

191
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,539
You know what? She knew no middle ground.

192
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,251
No one loved me as much as she did.

193
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,503
Damn it. You have no idea.

194
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,511
-We'd like two more beers.
-Two more?

195
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,307
BIN'S SURFING & RA-RA'S RAMYEON

196
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,685
-Seon-a.
-Yes?

197
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,520
-Throw away the food waste.
-Got it.

198
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,525
-Here are your beers.
-Thanks.

199
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,943
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

200
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,244
You're back already? Where's the bucket?

201
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,370
I don't know.

202
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,206
-You don't?
-No.

203
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,625
Did you throw it away?

204
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,921
-Of course.
-That's not true.

205
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,757
-Really?
-I'm not as good as I was before.

206
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,051
-Come on.
-Give that to me.

207
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,302
-Is it over?
-Yes.

208
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,554
-Let's go.
-This counts as a smile.

209
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,223
-You've changed.
-Do you regret getting married?

210
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,516
What is this?

211
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,809
-Tell them you're leaving.
-Seon-a, have a beer.

212
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,977
-Sit down.
-Have some.

213
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,854
-No, I need to go home.
-What?

214
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,689
-Why?
-"Home"? You mean, your lodgings?

215
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,566
Yes, he needs to come with me.

216
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,277
What? Are you guys going somewhere?

217
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,488
-I just--
-We're going home.

218
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,406
I live with him in his trailer.

219
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,785
-Seriously?
-Together?

220
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,537
Yes, we live together.

221
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,540
It's been about a month now.

222
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,542
-Yes, almost a month.
-What?

223
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,918
-What?
-A month?

224
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,670
Have you gone insane?

225
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,255
Is she serious?

226
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,549
We even got married.

227
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,925
-What?
-You did?

228
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,135
-No way!
-No--

229
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,471
-Let me explain.
-You're crazy!

230
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,473
Yes, we did get married.

231
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,226
-But it's nothing serious--
-So remember this.

232
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,229
Jae-won's mine.

233
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,941
-Let's congratulate them.
-Right.

234
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,277
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

235
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,405
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

236
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,368
How could you be so open
about us living together?

237
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,203
Because it's true.

238
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,038
I've been staying there for three weeks.

239
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,082
Even so, aren't you embarrassed?

240
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,669
Not at all. I could tell the entire world.

241
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,046
Now, how would you possibly do that?

242
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,466
-We got married. We live together.
-Hey, stop that.

243
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,302
We got married. We live together.

244
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,511
Wait.

245
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,847
Congratulations.

246
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,765
We got married. We live together.

247
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,767
Stop that. You're embarrassing me.

248
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,810
Seriously.

249
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,022
We got married! We live together!

250
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,069
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

251
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,951
The weather's lovely.

252
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,828
-Isn't it refreshing?
-Yes.

253
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,126
This is fun.

254
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,758
-Come on, Seon-a.
-Wait up!

255
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,683
UPHILL
REST STOP 150M

256
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,700
Jae-won, hang in there!

257
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,954
You can do it! I'll go first!

258
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,248
Don't go! Wait for me!

259
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,358
Where is Yoon Seon-a's Earth?

260
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,568
And where is her Mars…

261
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,279
What? Hey, what did you do?

262
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,572
What's this?

263
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,408
I hate that!

264
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,454
Isn't it so cute? It's so pretty.

265
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,169
-Your food is ready.
-Awesome.

266
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,424
-What?
-What?

267
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,925
Why is Jae-won's bigger?

268
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,635
-Right.
-Eat up, Jae-won.

269
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,095
I added some blood clams.

270
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,100
Gosh, why did you add so many?

271
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,476
I love blood clams.

272
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,233
Is it good?

273
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,028
The broth is… different.

274
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,196
<i>We had a great thing going.</i>

275
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,241
She didn't approach me
with an ulterior motive.

276
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,784
It's all his fault.

277
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,328
Kyeong-jun, that rascal.

278
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,582
Yes, I'm the Choi Kyeong-jun.

279
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,210
He didn't do his job properly,
so I had to hurry back to Seoul.

280
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,464
How could he be gone for two months
when it was originally one?

281
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,715
Is work a joke to him?

282
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,468
The president here scouted me
under one condition,

283
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,178
a one-month vacation.

284
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,472
Exactly. One month.

285
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,765
You still didn't come back,

286
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,392
That's why I had no choice
but to cause trouble.

287
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,352
Because I'm not as competent as you.

288
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,521
And speak quietly when you criticize me.

289
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,981
I can hear everything.

290
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,317
Goodness.

291
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,154
Stop calling me. I'm on my way.

292
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,698
Yes, I'll go back and take care of it.

293
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,117
First, don't do anything and stay still.

294
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,494
Tell my dad I got it.

295
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,038
I'll go to the District Office
and take care of it.

296
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,166
Yes. How many times did I tell you
not to worry

297
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,043
since we did nothing illegal?

298
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,422
Anyway, I sent my surfboard,
so make sure to retrieve it.

299
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,423
Jae-won.

300
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,425
Sorry, Seon-a.

301
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,969
Something really urgent came up
back in Seoul.

302
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,224
-Have you memorized my number?
-Yes.

303
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,393
What do you do if you forget my number?

304
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,813
-Here.
-What if you lose it?

305
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,898
-I won't.
-I said, "If you lose it."

306
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,775
where and when did we agree to meet?

307
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,653
Cheonggyecheon's third stepping stone,
last Saturday of this month, at ten.

308
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,904
Good. Don't forget that.

309
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,948
Excuse me.
Could you move your car, please?

310
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,575
Yes, sir. Please give us a minute.

311
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,120
I told you to get your own phone.

312
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,663
Why do you keep borrowing Bin's?

313
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,040
I'll call you as soon as I get one
in Seoul.

314
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,500
-You should go.
-Okay.

315
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,835
-Bye.
-Bye.

316
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,461
-I mean it.
-Okay.

317
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,754
-Bye.
-Bye.

318
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,719
-Bye.
-See you.

319
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,720
Go.

320
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,140
Hurry up.

321
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>That was the end.</i>

322
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,269
Forever.

323
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,647
We clearly promised to meet again
in Seoul.

324
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,941
But that was it.

325
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,778
We were supposed to come back
to Seoul together.

326
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,281
But Kyeong-jun…

327
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,299
-Where are you going?
-I don't know.

328
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,758
Why don't you know? This--

329
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,053
Throw them away!
Why do you still have them?

330
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,264
-Why would I?
-We're not using them!

331
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,975
You're a terrible worker. What an idiot.

332
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,854
He's starting to piss me off.

333
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
Jae-won, come here.

334
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,152
Jae-won. Gosh.

335
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,280
-You're changing the design?
-Yes.

336
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,740
-You can't.
-Why not?

337
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,158
-Look--
-I'm the team--

338
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,453
Hello, sir.

339
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,787
I'll open the door for you.

340
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,498
Come here.

341
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,586
ARCHITECTURE AND PEOPLE

342
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,962
Hello.

343
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,681
How dare you

344
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,725
change the design
for that house in Buam-dong?

345
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,809
Is this your company?

346
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,145
Are you trying to ruin
your father's company?

347
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,813
-Sir.
-You rascal.

348
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,149
It's Mr. Park, not "rascal," sir.

349
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,361
Uncle, I shut the door.

350
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,905
You can yell and beat him up
as much as you like.

351
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,741
How many times have you changed it?

352
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,536
You should've found a constructor
and started construction by now!

353
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,708
Look here. Bugaksan Mountain would be
on this side.

354
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,335
The stairs should be here

355
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,879
for them to admire the view
as they go up and down.

356
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,467
We've reconfirmed
that the mountain is seen very well

357
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,594
in the upstairs living room.

358
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,098
The client says
the design is great as it is.

359
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,766
He doesn't know what's better.

360
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,227
We know more about models,
so we should advise him.

361
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,772
Then you should've done a better job
from the start.

362
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,693
Did Bugaksan Mountain suddenly
move to this town this month?

363
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,404
How could I have
when I had no previous experience?

364
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,906
That's why I only receive
one-fourth of your salary.

365
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,202
I can't believe I trusted you
with my company.

366
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,954
Exactly. Why did you do that?

367
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,957
I was happy at my previous company,
so why did you drag me here?

368
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,087
I truly respected the president
of my former workplace.

369
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,715
Uncle, what did I tell you
when we had codfish soup and soju?

370
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,592
-I said you'd regret--
-What did you do, you rascal?

371
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,053
It's Mr. Choi, not "rascal," sir.

372
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,222
You ridiculous brats.

373
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,393
Goodbye.

374
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,564
Do this again, both of you,

375
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,399
and you're both fired.

376
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,984
Thank you.

377
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,902
Why me?

378
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,165
I love this company. However,

379
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,126
I don't like the president.

380
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,712
I actually really like him.

381
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,756
But not my team leader.

382
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,216
Speaking of which, Kyeong-jun…

383
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,470
I've thought about changing
the location of the stairs.

384
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,096
-Like this.
-Hold on.

385
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,265
Let's make this clear.

386
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,349
Change that,

387
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,145
and you'll have to move the bathroom
and the bedroom as well.

388
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,314
I know that, but let's do it.

389
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,649
-Should we go there now?
-Don't touch me. I can't.

390
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,567
Why not?

391
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,652
I can't go. I have a date with Rin-i.

392
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,780
I'm leaving around the time
she clocks out.

393
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,617
-Then let's all go.
-Don't be absurd.

394
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,702
-Let me join you.
-And do what? No way.

395
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,079
Let me join you.

396
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,955
-I'll buy you ice cream.
-Forget it.

397
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,915
Kyeong-jun.

398
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,043
Hey, Mr. Choi. Hey!

399
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,593
-It's here.
-Is it?

400
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,889
Here's your combo pizza. Enjoy.

401
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,308
-Thank you. It looks good!
-Thank you.

402
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,435
Hold on. One minute.

403
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,835
I'm not who I used to be.

404
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,462
I'm the new Lee Eun-o.

405
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,719
Ma'am.

406
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,721
Goodness.

407
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,183
I didn't recognize you.
You changed so much.

408
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,268
How have you been?

409
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,437
Right.

410
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,190
I heard you're
a deputy general manager now.

411
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,942
Yes. You've become prettier.

412
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,571
-Your style changed drastically.
-That's not all.

413
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,322
Everything about me has changed.

414
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,951
Right. How long has it been
since you worked here?

415
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,162
-It's been seven years already.
-You're right.

416
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,581
-You were still a student, right?
-Yes.

417
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,504
-Here. This is my business card.
-You got a job.

418
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,717
What? You set up a company?

419
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,720
It's a one-person company.
The name is O3, not 03.

420
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,306
It's for the three rounded alphabets
in my name.

421
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,640
You've become more eloquent as well.

422
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,767
How long has it been?

423
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,145
Less than a year. It's been nine months.

424
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,689
How's business?

425
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,152
I've been visiting and begging
those I know for work.

426
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,529
I've never turned down any work orders.

427
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,407
I'm just barely making ends meet.

428
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,869
Speaking of which, Miss…

429
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,954
I mean, ma'am.

430
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,207
Please give me work.

431
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,376
-What kind of work?
-Anything.

432
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,128
Let me know if you need a subcontractor.

433
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,963
I'll hire part-timers if necessary.

434
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,342
I don't care how small or exhausting
the job is. I'm not picky.

435
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,428
Did you bring your portfolio?

436
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,027
-Hello.
-Hey.

437
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,612
What's wrong?

438
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,906
We haven't connected the drainpipes yet,

439
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,532
and it rained two days ago. Damn it.

440
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,118
This is for you.

441
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,703
It's your wife's birthday today.

442
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,539
You didn't need to do this.

443
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,166
You don't need to buy a cake now.

444
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,335
-These are some snacks.
-Gosh, thank you.

445
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,963
-Thanks, Mr. Park.
-Don't mention it.

446
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,632
-I'll do it for you.
-No, don't.

447
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,510
Your suit will get ruined.
It's going to reek.

448
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,929
-Goodness.
-Throw it over there.

449
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,764
You already know.

450
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,649
You only work after a good beating.

451
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,371
<i>-Do you know this song?
-Yes.</i>

452
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:28,253
<i>I couldn't let you go</i>

453
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:34,384
<i>So even the time
Couldn't take you away from me</i>

454
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:41,474
<i>Our memory together
Was deeply stuck like a thorn</i>

455
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,234
<i>He had just arrived at Yangyang that day.</i>

456
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,902
<i>…to live a month in a camper.</i>

457
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,614
And the second wish was
to surf for a month, nothing else.

458
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,326
<i>He looked excited.</i>

459
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,954
<i>Everyone's excited when they're on a trip.</i>

460
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:03,997
<i>So was I.</i>

461
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,750
Ta-da!

462
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,847
<i>I think we were a little crazy back then.</i>

463
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,448
Yoon Seon-a and Park Jae-won's wedding
will start now.

464
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,493
We got married! We live together!

465
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,709
<i>The two months we spent at the beach
feels like a dream.</i>

466
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,378
<i>She said she lived in Seoul, too.</i>

467
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,255
<i>I thought I'd run into her at least once.</i>

468
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,966
<i>But I didn't.</i>

469
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,637
<i>I'm trying to forget him.</i>

470
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,306
<i>No, I already have.</i>

471
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,311
Is it raining?

472
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,524
What? Is this broken?

473
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,776
Come on.

474
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,695
What's wrong? What's the problem?

475
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,697
What?

476
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,491
You can't stop there.

477
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,869
Go down. I said, go down.

478
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,006
Goodness. You're broken, too?

479
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:38,883
Darn it.

480
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,930
-It's reeking.
-What a nice car.

481
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,517
His parents must've bought it.

482
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,644
I bought this car myself. With my money.

483
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,233
This is embarrassing.

484
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,026
That window's broken as well.

485
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,657
Yes, it must be great
to have windows that work fine.

486
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,494
This is crazy. It's a small world.

487
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,183
He didn't see me, did he?

488
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,214
Why I dumped him?

489
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,800
You know what's the worst
about these kinds of breakups?

490
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,513
It's not about missing her
or the days I spent with her.

491
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,559
You keep asking yourself
what you did wrong.

492
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,854
Let's see…

493
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,106
There are too many reasons.

494
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,107
Reasons?

495
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,402
I'm sure there's none.
I did nothing wrong.

496
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,946
First,

497
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,114
he doesn't remember this.

498
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,826
I like every single thing about you.

499
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,286
-What if…
-Yes?

500
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,748
I was a different person?

501
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,125
A different person? What kind of person?

502
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,962
What if I didn't have this tattoo

503
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,339
and wore different outfits and hair?

504
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,843
Then that's not Yoon Seon-a.

505
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,720
<i>That's the reason.</i>

506
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,807
I told you. The person in Yangyang
wasn't the real me.

507
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,810
That's when I thought,

508
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,229
"I should

509
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,940
break up with him.

510
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,527
I should end this relationship here."

511
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,074
The breakup would've been less painful
if we fought.

512
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,829
The second reason is…

513
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,747
I just wish

514
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,459
I knew where she is
and how she's doing now.
