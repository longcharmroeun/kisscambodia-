HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,788
<i>You can mail it now. Thank you.</i>

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>Customer 13.</i>

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,255
-<i>Go to Window 2.</i>
-I'm sorry. I'm back.

11
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,139
<i>I'm truly sorry,</i>

12
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,476
<i>but could you please return my surfboard?</i>

13
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,696
Why do you come here and torment me
every single day?

14
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,576
I can't. I'm going surfing
with my girlfriend this weekend.

15
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,704
It's made of wood,
so it's extremely heavy.

16
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,332
If you hit your head on it,
it will hurt a lot.

17
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,543
-Next customer, please.
-<i>Customer 14.</i>

18
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,962
-Could you please give it back?
-<i>Go to Window 2.</i>

19
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:28,922
Hello.

20
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,264
I'll buy you a new one.

21
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,893
No, just sell it back to me.
I'll pay you enough to buy two boards.

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,522
You already gave it to me.
Why are you doing this?

23
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,150
You threw it away, and I took it.

24
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,820
If you discarded it elsewhere,
it would've been long gone.

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,655
-Move aside.
-Come on.

26
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,699
Do you want to keep it when the date
of my kiss is written on it?

27
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,494
It's written on it. The day
I first kissed my boyfriend.

28
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,954
My boyfriend has the same one.

29
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,790
I don't care. I still like it.

30
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,377
You know you have
a really weird taste, right?

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,754
Yes, I have a weird taste.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,050
You already gave it to me.
You've been pestering me nonstop.

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,802
Why on earth are you doing this?

34
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,305
"Why"?

35
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,433
I don't know

36
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,436
how to explain it.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,105
I am…

38
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,023
Do I look sane to you?

39
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,401
I look crazy, don't I?

40
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,653
Yes, I'm crazy.

41
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,573
Do you see these rings?

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,782
These are wedding rings.

43
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,617
I'm legally single, though.

44
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,911
Anyway, I got married.
That's why I have these.

45
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,372
I couldn't throw mine away,
so I kept it with me.

46
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,916
But the guy I married
threw his into Cheonggyecheon.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,918
And I retrieved it.

48
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,962
So now, I have both of them.

49
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,341
But now that I got the ring,

50
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,469
I want the surfboard as well.

51
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,931
I want to get it back

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,101
because

53
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,273
he barged into my heart
and just won't leave.

54
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,862
He built a house in here
and became the owner.

55
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,116
You see, he helped me find
the true Lee Eun-o.

56
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,954
Not the old foolish Lee Eun-o
or Yoon Seon-a,

57
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,373
but the real Lee Eun-o.

58
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,296
He helped me find my true self.

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,218
He'd smile and embrace everything
that I did.

60
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,765
He helped me be born again.

61
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,102
So how could I forget him?

62
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,234
That surfboard is a precious memory to me.

63
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,611
He

64
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,031
made it for me himself.

65
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,326
So please.

66
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>It's been a week. How have you been?</i>

67
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
What do you think?

68
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,435
I felt like I got punched.

69
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,938
She even lied about her name. Why?

70
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,231
Damn it.

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,526
Forget it. I don't even want to know.

72
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,030
I'm just really shocked.

73
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,492
It still feels surreal.

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,707
I don't want to hear her out.
She'll lie again anyway. Won't she?

75
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,258
Do you know how I felt…

76
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,220
<i>when I left the station?</i>

77
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,431
Jae-won, wait!

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,148
I thought you weren't coming--

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,360
<i>I thought she'd run into my arms
like that time.</i>

80
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,196
<i>If she did…</i>

81
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,492
<i>If she did run into my arms,</i>

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,287
<i>I would've just embraced her.</i>

83
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>I wouldn't have asked any questions.</i>

84
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,837
I was going to do that.

85
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:39,881
Jae-won.

86
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,218
Hold on. Wait.

87
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,221
Let me return them. Take them.

88
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,140
However,

89
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,017
she didn't.

90
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,531
<i>She was a totally different person.</i>

91
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,578
I just

92
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,040
lost touch with reality.

93
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,170
I can't believe
that she's not Yoon Seon-a.

94
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,089
IDENTITY CARD

00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,341
What…

96
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,136
-Give it back.
-Hey.

97
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,346
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

98
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>Or was it a dream back then?</i>

99
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,020
Or…

100
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,777
is everything a dream?

101
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,459
ALL ABOUT MARKETING
O3

102
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,361
That's your question?

103
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,406
Is that the question of the day?

104
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,117
-Geon's going to have cup noodles.
-Okay.

105
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,039
Can you please not ask that? Please?

106
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>Did you hear that Jae-won
finally caught the camera thief?</i>

107
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,837
What? He caught the thief?

108
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
-Is that true?
-No way.

109
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,134
What?

110
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,344
He never told me that.

111
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,182
I knew something was odd about him.

112
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,185
Last week, he was overworking himself
like crazy.

113
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,981
I thought he might die.
And he called in sick this morning.

114
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,860
Then he's not physically sick.
He must be heartbroken.

115
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
Jae-won.

116
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,243
Hey, I heard you caught the thief.

117
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,665
She approached you
to steal the cameras, right?

118
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,003
-Why are you quiet?
-Hey.

119
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,299
Leave. Just go.

120
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,929
I just arrived. Go where?
I brought beef rib soup.

121
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,097
I'm sick. How can I eat that?

122
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,642
Rin-i does when she's sick.

123
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,644
Am I her? Am I Rin-i?

124
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,063
I eat plain soup when I'm sick.

125
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,191
-Close the door. It's cold. I'm a patient.
-Gosh.

126
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,985
Who has soup when they're ill?
They have beef rib soup.

127
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,321
So? So what happened?

128
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,077
-It was all a lie.
-Which part?

129
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,037
Even her name was fake.

130
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,289
No way.

131
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,625
What's her real name?

132
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,418
I don't even remember.

133
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,171
Unbelievable. So everything about her
was a lie.

134
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,256
How did he find her?

135
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,092
Those who met her in Yangyang
didn't have her number either.

136
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,930
I just caught her at Cheonggyecheon.

137
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,181
Wow, incredible.

138
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,017
Isn't that where those two agreed to meet?

139
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,144
That's so incredible.

140
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,146
What's so incredible about that?

141
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,315
Because it is. He caught that thief.

142
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,235
You should've taken her to the police.
What did you do?

143
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,486
-I did.
-Incredible.

144
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,406
But even there, she lied and said

145
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,074
I gave her the cameras.

146
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,701
Incredible.

147
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,160
Stop saying "incredible."

148
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,622
Exactly. What kind of writer
has such a small vocabulary?

149
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,249
"Incredible."

150
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,792
It's not the time to scold me.

151
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,086
Kyeong-jun's cousin was scammed.

152
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,381
How do you know if it was a scam or not?

153
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,717
Of course, it is. She lied about her name.

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,386
Then she lied about receiving
his cameras as a gift.

155
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,722
That's a scam, and she's a scamp.

156
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,104
<i>He should just throw her in jail.</i>

157
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,359
You talk quite tough today.

158
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,944
Who should throw whom in jail?

159
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,529
Who? Park Jae-won.

160
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,864
Whom? The camera thief.

161
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,074
Throw her where? In jail.

162
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,576
What did I say wrong?

163
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,996
Then should I have said
he should escort her to jail?

164
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,624
That's enough. Stop fighting.

165
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,127
How do you manage to live together
when you fight like cats and dogs?

166
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,838
I'm always the one yielding
and apologizing first.

167
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,132
Sorry for what I said.

168
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,426
I'm sorry too for being annoyed
by what you said.

169
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,095
No, I'm sorry
since you were annoyed first.

170
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,514
What do you mean?
I said it's all my fault!

171
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,682
Want to get kicked out?

172
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,808
-It's our home!
-It's our home!

173
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,393
Have some meat.

174
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,318
<i>So? So what happened?</i>

175
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,071
Was she punished?
Did he grant her leniency?

176
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,530
Which one was it?

177
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,574
So what did you do? Did you forgive her?

178
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
You did, didn't you?

179
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,286
You did.

180
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,705
You're an idiot.

181
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,088
Hold on. Did he get his cameras back?

182
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,926
Stop eating and tell me.
I'm so frustrated.

183
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,559
Have you ever felt like

184
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,479
going somewhere to kill yourself?

185
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,815
She's the thief, isn't she?

186
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,692
I got the gut feeling.

187
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,488
But why would she want to die
because of that?

188
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,241
WAIT!

189
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,201
You're a precious person.

190
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,202
I'M STILL IN HERE

191
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,996
Reach out for help if needed.

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,207
Help is available for youth as well.

193
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,835
DON'T LOCK…

194
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,879
What? She's not the thief?

195
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,172
…THE DOOR

196
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,383
-Then who was it?
-What's the brand?

197
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,760
Did Kyeong-jun tell you anything?

198
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,847
-I don't know about the brand.
-And?

199
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,225
But they're worth
over ten million won in total.

200
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,688
Kyeong-jun must be frustrated right now.

201
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,159
A video message?

202
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:24,910
Don't.

203
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,788
You'll become a laughing stock. Don't.

204
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,543
I don't have much to say.

205
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,045
Don't do it. Don't.

206
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,215
-Why did you do that?
-Damn it.

207
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,012
He never listens.

208
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,517
Well… To be honest,

209
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,187
no matter what you say,

210
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,482
I don't think I can forgive you right now.

211
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,279
Is he an idiot or what?

212
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,827
I'm sorry

213
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,164
for calling you a horrible woman.

214
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,547
I'm sorry for throwing the cameras too.

215
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,222
You must've been frightened.

216
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,226
I'm sorry for yelling at you too.

217
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,903
Those things have been bothering me.

218
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,907
<i>What an idiot.</i>

219
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,369
He's agreed to give her a message.
Will she even watch it?

220
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,538
Both of his parents seem perfectly fine,

221
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,666
but what's wrong with him? Damn it.

222
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:03,425
IF THEY WERE MEANT TO REUNITE,
THEY HAD TO GO SEPARATE WAYS

223
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,648
THEIR SEPARATE PATHS WERE INEVITABLE…

224
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,107
What are you looking at?

225
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,943
I'm just looking at you since I have eyes.

226
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,862
And now I'm watching you dancing.

227
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,413
Eun-o, I'm having trouble writing.

228
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,876
I…

229
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,006
I can't write at all!

230
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,425
Also,

231
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,930
I'm having a hard time,
so please keep it down.

232
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,643
Please…

233
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,111
Let's have dinner.

234
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,577
It's your turn to cook.

235
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,705
-No, it's your turn.
-It's your turn.

236
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,504
It's my turn, I guess.

237
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,649
I'm always the one cooking.

238
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,276
Yes. That's right.
I'm always the one who cooks.

239
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,778
Why? Because I'm a pushover.

240
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,698
That's why she tells me to cook every day.

241
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,079
Why is she trying so hard in vain?

242
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,500
That's a lot.

243
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,381
SALES-TARGETED
AUTOMOBILE LAUNCH EVENT

244
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,722
She's been working hard.

245
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,727
Is she doing that
because she has nothing to do?

246
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,107
A FEW DAYS LATER
SUNDAY, 6 A.M.

247
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,582
I kept thinking for the past week.

248
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,752
If Seon-a…

249
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,462
I mean…

250
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,632
If she was really planning
to con me from the start

251
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,177
and break up when we were living together,

252
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,262
then that would make my romance

253
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,515
become so meaningless.

254
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,601
Then

255
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,979
I'd feel so pathetic.

256
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,357
<i>So I'm going to remember it differently.</i>

257
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>We were</i>

258
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,655
<i>truly in love at the beach.</i>

259
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,784
<i>And</i>

260
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,912
<i>I gave her my cameras as a gift.</i>

261
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,128
<i>And we…</i>

262
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,591
<i>We</i>

263
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,886
<i>broke up at that beach.</i>

264
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,181
<i>That's how I'm going to remember us.</i>

265
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,864
I'm having a tough time.

266
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,075
Eun-o's been acting odd recently.

267
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,953
A few days ago, she danced all day long.

268
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,497
Yesterday, we watched a movie together.

269
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,648
What's so sad about this scene?

270
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,693
An idiot like you wouldn't know.

271
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,642
And today…

272
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,771
Just say it, will you?

273
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,442
"I'm sorry.

274
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,946
I'll repent until the day I die.

275
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,325
I'll pay…

276
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,329
for everything I've done to you."

277
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,168
This is what I wanted to say then,

278
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,754
but I couldn't.

279
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,719
You're terrible, Eun-o.

280
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,015
You're a horrible woman.

281
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,268
I mean it. You're a terrible woman.

282
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,604
<i>Today, she talked to herself.</i>

283
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,650
I think she's going crazy
since there are no projects.

284
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,319
I thought she was making a living
with her business, but…

285
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,279
She has nothing to do?

286
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,700
I'm scared she might raise the rent.

287
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,202
Should I look for other jobs?

288
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,621
Hey, take a look at this.

289
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,252
She came up with all these proposals.

290
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,880
She's been handing them out every day,
but to no avail.

291
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,299
Do you know anyone
you could hand these out to?

292
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,802
Do any of your subcontractors
need a PR boost?

293
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,626
I thought you went to see Rin-i.

294
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,336
I already did.

295
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,714
She'll come once her shift ends.

296
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,927
I can't rest on the weekends
because you booked a meeting.

297
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,053
Am I your slave?

298
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,389
I'm sorry.

299
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,312
This one fell through.

300
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,316
What am I supposed to tell my client?

301
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,693
You'll have to tell them the truth.

302
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,488
We get they love Bugaksan Mountain,
but they can't see it from every window.

303
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,074
Tell them you were just being greedy.

304
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,207
Take a look at this.

305
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,503
-What is that?
-Rin-i's friend is a marketer.

306
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,255
She's handing out her proposals.

307
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,342
Some of them are related
to our line of work.

308
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,927
What's this?

309
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,429
It's a one-person company.

310
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,847
A marketing company?

311
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,183
The Pangyo townhouse bidding has ended.

312
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,268
Yes.

313
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,480
The complex cultural center
and the library open party bidding

314
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,606
are still ongoing.

315
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,026
Ms. Lee said
she'd look over them tomorrow.

316
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,778
So she wanted them on her desk,

317
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,406
but I'll put them here first.

318
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,491
Check them out.

319
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,161
You should.

320
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,884
Are you going to Architecture and People?

321
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,345
Yes.

322
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,775
You can go first.

323
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,328
-Sir.
-Yes?

324
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,539
Give up on that. Let's go.

325
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,415
-Is she here?
-Yes.

326
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,545
Hello.

327
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,839
-What?
-We met on the way.

328
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,258
You didn't have lunch yet, right?

329
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,426
-Hi, I'm Park Jae-won.
-Hello.

330
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,804
-I'm sorry for coming on the weekend.
-It's okay.

331
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,430
You came all the way from Busan.

332
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,765
Would you like a drink?

333
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,101
-Juice, please.
-We have mango juice.

334
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,062
Two glasses, please.
My husband will be here soon.

335
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,606
-This way.
-I'll be back.

336
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,192
What did you take? The train? A plane?

337
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,569
-Our car.
-I see.

338
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,404
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

339
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,867
By the way, I heard you used to work
at City Airlines.

340
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,494
-Yes, my husband too.
-I see.

341
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,163
We're moving to Seoul next month.

342
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,373
As I told you last time,

343
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,126
we're going to renovate
our parents' house and move in.

344
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,461
This is the one.

345
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,215
We thought about renovating,
but we decided to build a new one.

346
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,760
A new one? Isn't it a waste to do that?

347
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,180
It's invading the neighbor's territory.

348
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,558
-Look.
-One minute.

349
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,727
You're right. This is…

350
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,274
What? This must be your daughter.
She's cute.

351
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,985
She's adorable. How old is she?

352
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,570
She's nine months old.

353
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,992
We're considering leaving
the house to her in the future.

354
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,913
In that case, we should make it sturdy.

355
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,623
-Right.
-Mr. Choi.

356
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,459
-Could you bring the samples?
-Yes, sir.

357
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,671
This part is…

358
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,053
-He's here.
-Oh, it's him. Hold on.

359
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,770
-Hello, I'm Park Jae-won.
-Hello.

360
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,355
This way.

361
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,157
It's been a while, Kyeong-jun.

362
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,078
-Do you know him?
-You guys know each other?

363
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,748
I didn't know this was your company.

364
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,542
Come this way.

365
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,473
This is fascinating.
How do you two know each other?

366
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,641
Friends? Alumni?

367
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,393
From way back.

368
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,233
You're married?

369
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,611
Your baby's already nine months old?
You rascal.

370
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,529
Hey.

371
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,656
It just happened.

372
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,075
She's adorable.

373
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,455
Hey.

374
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,748
Rin-i.

375
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,669
-I'll explain later.
-It was only yesterday.

376
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,504
You were going to marry Eun-o,

377
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,506
but your baby's already nine months old?

378
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,177
Excuse me. You knew
he was having an affair, right?

379
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,764
-Rin-i--
-The two of you worked together.

380
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,600
You must have known that he had a fiancée.

381
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,437
-I'll explain it later.
-Yet you still dated him?

382
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,607
How did you knock another girl up
when you were engaged to Eun-o?

383
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,818
-Rin-i--
-Is this about yourself?

384
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,154
It isn't, so why are you overreacting?

385
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,074
-Where did you make the baby?
-Let me.

386
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,328
It was your and Eun-o's house
in Busan, wasn't it?

387
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,204
She saw everything, didn't she?

388
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,583
That's why she disappeared
for three months. Because of you two!

389
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,419
Yes, that's right! So what?

390
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,006
-You crazy piece of garbage.
-Hey.

391
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,758
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

392
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,217
-You lunatic!
-Come here.

393
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,177
What are you doing?

394
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,845
-Apologize, you rascal!
-Stop it!

395
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,138
Come here.

396
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,098
-Hey.
-Come here.

397
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,725
-Hey!
-Come here!

398
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,477
Come here, you asshole!

399
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,938
You lunatic!

400
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,471
Rin-i packed some for you
because you didn't come.

401
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,070
Are you crying again?

402
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,781
Because it's tasty or because it's spicy?

403
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,452
-The former.
-Yes, it was tasty.

404
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,748
Eat up.

405
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,968
Lee Eun-o, you idiot.

406
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,303
-Seriously.
-I must've been crazy.

407
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,725
-Eun-o, that poor thing.
-I was insane.

408
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm the one who deserves
the most pity here.

409
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,939
-Why me? Why…
-I should've beaten him up further.

410
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,691
-That idiot!
-Why here?

411
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,651
Why did it have to be here?

412
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,862
And why today?

413
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,072
Why? What's the reason?

414
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,949
-Jae-won, I'm truly sorry.
-What?

415
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,535
-I can't--
-You're even worse.

416
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,662
You punched our client.

417
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,999
You should be grateful
that you're not at a police station,

418
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,125
you rascal.

419
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,086
If you two fought properly,
you would've lost. No doubt.

420
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,714
You never brought
any good clients, anyway.

421
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,174
Goodness.

422
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,217
Why did you hit him?

423
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,096
Why did you spray coke all over here
and make me… Damn it.

424
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,056
Do you have any anti-anxiety pills?

425
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,981
God, that was hectic. I have a headache.

426
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,942
Damn it.
