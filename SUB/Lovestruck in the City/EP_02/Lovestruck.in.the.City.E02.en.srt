#VOLUNTARILY SINGLE

#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:35,567
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,120
DILIGENCE AND PERSISTENCE

9
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,955
<i>How do you initiate your first sex?</i>

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,002
That's a very private question.

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,797
It's a bit embarrassing.

12
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,719
What's with you?
It's too early for that kind of question.

13
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,305
Are you talking about…

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,977
When I first have sex with a woman?

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,563
When I have sex with a guy?

16
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,570
I always start with a one-night stand,
when I'm drunk.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,119
It's been so long, I can't remember.

18
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,497
What? Do I regret it the next day?

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,708
No, why would I regret it?

20
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,211
Let me think about it.

21
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,921
How do other people initiate it?

22
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,884
Don't people normally start
by kissing each other?

23
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,678
-A kiss is too vague.
-You both need to agree to do it first.

24
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,846
How do you agree to it?

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,932
It's not like a business negotiation.

26
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,975
It all starts with the right mood.

27
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,774
But not everyone feels the same way.

28
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,776
I know. It's quite sensitive.

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,904
I might not feel the way you feel.

30
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,073
But you can't have sex
without even kissing.

31
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,742
Of course not.

32
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,495
I hate complicated things.

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,499
If I want to have sex,
I send a signal with my eyes.

34
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,505
If he gets the message, we have sex.
If not, we don't.

35
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,257
<i>I haven't had sex in over two years.</i>

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,759
But I'm still alive. It doesn't kill you.

37
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,594
I love kissing.

38
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,390
-Me too.
-I also like sex.

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,769
Who hates kissing?

40
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,230
Who hates sex?

41
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,150
I just asked him honestly.

42
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,319
My gosh, you have no idea
how startled I was.

43
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,320
But it was natural.

44
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,281
There's a time and place for everything.

45
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,366
Oh, they're a couple.

46
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,703
He's my cousin and work colleague.

47
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>And she's my cousin's girlfriend.</i>

48
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm friends with both.

49
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,334
They've been together
for what, 10 years? No, maybe 20 years.

50
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,629
Five years. Anyway, I asked first.

51
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,215
And I think it happened
at the right time and place.

52
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,760
5 YEARS AGO

53
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,145
Why do we always watch movies?

54
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,273
When are we going to have sex?

55
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,691
What?

56
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,402
I…

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,423
I guess not for a good while.

58
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,467
Every time we try to have sex,

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,928
I'll be reminded of that popcorn.

60
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,391
<i>I still find it hilarious.</i>

61
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,936
I think of Kyeong-jun
every time I see popcorn.

62
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,064
So I asked her what she wanted.

63
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,944
I know what she said.
A hotel room, white lisianthus flowers,

64
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,029
and a bottle of wine as old as they are.

65
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,781
I was still in college back then.

66
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,076
He worked tons of part-time jobs
so he could afford all that.

67
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,475
Oh, sorry.

68
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,937
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,896
-Kyeong-jun.
-Yes?

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,648
You need to unbutton me first.

71
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,359
Oh, you had a button? Button…

72
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,780
Yes, it's here. I unbuttoned it.

73
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,700
Hey.

74
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,464
My gosh. What?

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,636
Gosh, stop it.

76
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,480
You're so cute. Let me fix your hair.

77
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,485
You're so adorable.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,668
Hey!

79
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,507
Kyeong-jun was clumsy that day,
which I found so cute.

80
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,384
I was a pro from the very start.

81
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,470
He did a lot of research,
but I could tell he was lost.

82
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,765
That day, I found out
that I'm really good at it.

83
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,601
We had an amazing night.

84
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,479
He came up to me and asked,
"Have you had sex before?"

85
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,314
He knew nothing.

86
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,650
So I gave him tons of tips.

87
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,735
Let's say I was like his mentor.

88
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,822
Why do guys bluff so much?

89
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,615
It's not cool.

90
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,034
It's a lot cuter to be innocent,
you fools.

91
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,996
Your soul is more important
than your stamina.

92
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,123
I totally agree with whoever said that.

93
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,584
No, I prefer stamina.

94
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,377
The soul is invisible.

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,173
Don't let the women fool you.
They're talking about techniques.

96
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,966
"Soul" equals "techniques."

97
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,805
I gave everything

98
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,600
to her.

99
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,314
He gave her his body and soul.

100
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,283
1 YEAR AGO

101
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,723
The waves are really good today.

102
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,520
Let's take a look at the sky.

103
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,772
What…

104
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,401
What? Where am I?

105
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,528
I…

106
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,115
I'm pretty sure
I slept by the sea yesterday.

107
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,493
What was that?

108
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,912
Who was that?

109
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,958
Is this a dream?

110
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,730
Come on out. Let's practice driving.

111
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,279
Gosh, she looks so ugly.

112
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,575
Why am I here?

113
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,703
-I definitely got your permission.
-Permission for what?

114
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,622
Jae-won.

115
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,041
Jae-won.

116
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,173
Jae-won, you have
your driver's license test today.

117
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,717
Okay.

118
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,595
Are you going to practice driving today?

119
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,014
Yes.

120
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,184
Are you still asleep?

121
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,853
Yes.

122
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,607
But you're still going to practice, right?

123
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,483
Yes.

124
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,278
Gosh, I was half-asleep.

125
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,363
Still, you responded and said yes.

126
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,323
My gosh.

127
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,784
By the way, how did you find this place?

128
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,620
I also practiced here.

129
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,331
The school closed and is private property
now, so we can't be here.

130
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,498
Then why are we here?

131
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,126
It's a great place to practice driving.
So let's hurry.

132
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,046
I'm not a qualified teacher,
and it's illegal to practice here.

133
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,174
You're fully awake, right?
Let's go and practice driving.

134
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,179
Gosh, you can do this. Get a grip.

135
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,185
I mean, I'm awake and all.

136
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,896
But you're awfully confident
about breaking the law.

137
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,773
What now?

138
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,067
First, put on your seatbelt.

139
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,735
-Do you see the car key?
-Yes.

140
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,528
Step on the brake and start the car.

141
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,863
I know that.

142
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,369
Good. You need to follow that S-line.

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,372
When did you draw that?

144
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,248
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

145
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,378
You need to make a big turn
to keep the trailer inside the lines.

146
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,338
Make a big right turn outward.

147
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,632
Keep driving. Keep going.

148
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,134
-A big right turn.
-You're doing great.

149
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,637
You're on the line.
I told you to make a big turn.

150
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,180
-Okay. A big turn.
-A big turn.

151
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,848
Make a big turn.

152
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,478
-Did you just get angry at me?
-No, I never get angry.

153
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,563
You just need to make another big turn.

154
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,066
-A big turn.
-Yes, a big turn.

155
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,485
You're doing great.

156
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,654
This time, the turn was too big.

157
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,697
You crossed the line. You failed.

158
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,866
-It's too narrow.
-No, it's not.

159
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,576
I drew it just like the drive test.

160
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,662
This is really easy.

161
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,789
-See? It's narrow.
-No, it's not.

162
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,749
It's narrow even for a motorcycle.

163
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,960
You're doing great.

164
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,049
I have a good feeling.
I think you'll pass.

165
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,386
What do you mean?
I'm not so sure about this. It's so hard.

166
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,470
You did great.

167
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,722
I was a great teacher,
so I'm sure you'll pass.

168
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,684
-Hey, duck.
-Why?

169
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,727
What is it? Why?

170
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,980
What's going on?

171
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,234
We just broke the law.
We trespassed on private property.

172
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,403
But you were totally okay with it.

173
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,197
How would I be okay with it,
especially in front of a cop?

174
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,867
You're unbelievable. Then you and I both…

175
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,827
Watch out for the cops.

176
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,539
Are you kidding me?

177
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,332
-What…
-This time, it's for real!

178
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,464
Hey! Come here.

179
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,717
-Where are the cops?
-I'm sorry. They were there.

180
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,011
-Look! The cops!
-Will you stop?

181
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,346
-Where are they? Where?
-That hurts. I'm sorry.

182
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,682
It really hurts. My ears are bleeding.

183
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,987
It needs to be vertical
and slightly curved.

184
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,698
-Vertically?
-Oaks are too bumpy.

185
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,498
Did you finish eating?
You can leave it here.

186
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,749
-I'll do it.
-It's okay.

187
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,292
No, I'll do it.

188
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,836
Let's go.

189
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,965
Why did you name her Dog?

190
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,716
<i>Because she's a dog.</i>

191
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,096
-Let's go.
-Come on. Let's go.

192
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,265
Come on.

193
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,070
Hey, have some snacks!

194
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,161
-But Bin went to the bank.
-I know. Ra-ra went with him.

195
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,997
They went on a date.

196
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,542
Now that they are out,
let's eat and slack off.

197
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,710
Okay, sure.

198
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,379
You want to slack off?

199
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,509
We can't leave out beer when slacking off.

200
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,178
-I'll open it for you.
-Okay.

201
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,978
The watermelon looks delicious.

202
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,814
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

203
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,331
When did you start making surfboards?

204
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
I started learning two years ago.

205
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,795
I learned new skills every time I came,
and I'm still learning.

206
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,840
Do you come here often?

207
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,177
I met Ra-ra and Bin at Jeju Island
when I was in college.

208
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,013
I met them quite often
back when they lived in Jeju.

209
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,766
But it's my first time visiting here.
I was busy with work.

210
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,976
You must've surfed for a long time.

211
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,022
-Is it that fun?
-Yes, it's fun.

212
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,193
But not everyone feels the same way.

213
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,321
Why? Are you interested?

214
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,785
I'm going to try it once I feel like it.

215
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,954
But you told Ra-ra
that you're scared of water.

216
00:15:56,163 --> 00:16:00,793
From now on, I won't be scared,
reluctant, embarrassed,

217
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,921
hesitant, doubtful, or indecisive.

218
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,674
I've decided not to be like that anymore.

219
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,426
I'm slowly trying to refrain
from saying those things.

220
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,929
One day,
I'm going to stop saying I'm scared.

221
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,556
Once you manage to do that, let me know.

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,433
-I'll teach you how to surf.
-Okay.

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,605
I wasn't hesitant just now.

224
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,488
How long are you staying here?

225
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,366
I also stopped making plans,
so I don't know.

226
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,869
-When did you come?
-A month ago.

227
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,330
What did you do before coming here?

228
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,958
Don't you have a job to go back to?

229
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,584
Don't ask.

230
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,963
I'll just think about what to do
once I go back to Seoul.

231
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,884
Then maybe we can also meet in Seoul.

232
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,899
What are you doing?

233
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,944
I don't think I'm scared anymore.

234
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,573
-Congratulations.
-Teach me how to surf.

235
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,784
One, two. Relax your arms.

236
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,664
You're doing great.
Put your arms deep into the water.

237
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,001
Okay, good. Keep your chin up.

238
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,296
Good job. There you go.

239
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,679
Hey.

240
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,350
-Are you okay? Are you scared?
-A little.

241
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,020
Don't be scared. I'm right here.

242
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,731
I'll hold you whenever you fall.

243
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,400
So don't worry, and focus on the waves.

244
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,111
I'll focus on you. Okay?

245
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,989
-Okay.
-Let's try again.

246
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,785
Start paddling. One, two.

247
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,496
You're doing great. One, two.

248
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,872
Keep… Oh, gosh.

249
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,627
You're okay.

250
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,712
Good job.

251
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,233
It's coming. Get ready.

252
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,652
Start paddling. Here we go.

253
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,698
Start paddling.

254
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,465
It's coming. Ready.

255
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,717
Get ready.

256
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,846
Keep paddling.

257
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,640
Stand up.

258
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,440
Gosh, she fell really hard.

259
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,905
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

260
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,199
Start paddling.

261
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,795
You did it! You finally did it!

262
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,096
Seon-a!

263
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,644
Seon-a, are you okay?

264
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,854
Yes.

265
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,273
Wait a minute.

266
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,275
You…

267
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,155
-Are you really okay?
-Yes.

268
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,370
28TH, SATURDAY

269
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,175
Did you see me? Did you see me surf?

270
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,304
Yes, I saw you. I was there.

271
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,097
Yes, you were there.

272
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,059
I did great today.

273
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,354
It was only my second day.

274
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,107
Yes, you did great.

275
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,193
And you were really brave.

276
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,657
The wave was so beautiful.

277
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,077
I was scared, but it was amazing.

278
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,458
When I got up and rode that wave,

279
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,543
I felt like…

280
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,215
I was on top of the world.

281
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,635
Yes, that's why people surf.

282
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,264
I'm so glad I decided
not to be scared anymore.

283
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,725
I want to do it again tomorrow.
I want to be good at it.

284
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,352
I like surfing now.

285
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,901
But it must've hurt a lot.

286
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,292
It hurt, but it was fun.

287
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,254
I'm going to surf tomorrow
and the day after that.

288
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,131
I'm going to surf every day.

289
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,596
Your entire body will ache tonight.

290
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,141
It's going to hurt quite a lot.

291
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,185
I don't care if my body's shattered.

292
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,021
Because it's fun.

293
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,191
Dry yourself first.

294
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,564
No?

295
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,657
I told you I'm done saying no.

296
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,848
I love you.

297
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,355
<i>I thought it might be too early to say it.</i>

298
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,316
<i>But I said it anyway.</i>

299
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,943
I love you.

300
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,281
<i>She didn't say anything.</i>

301
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,826
<i>Instead, she smiled mysteriously.</i>

302
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,374
<i>Back then, that was enough.</i>

303
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,711
<i>I thought we had
all the time in the world.</i>

304
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,006
<i>And I was confident</i>

305
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,216
<i>she'd love me back.</i>

306
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,489
I was sincere.

307
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,326
Whether he was sincere or not
doesn't matter.

308
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,079
We'd only spent a week together,
but it really meant a lot to me.

309
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,707
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

310
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,254
But now it bothers me so much
that she didn't say it back.

311
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,503
Seon…

312
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,506
Hey.

313
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,392
Hey, you.

314
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,250
-I'll see you later.
-Wait a minute.

315
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,461
Did I get tricked last night?

316
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,088
Bye.

317
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,425
<i>It's really hard to explain this feeling.</i>

318
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,470
It really felt like she tricked me.

319
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,224
You know what? I bet
she planned to toy with me from the start.

320
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,898
We had sex once.
What's the big deal about that?

321
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,567
It wasn't just once.

322
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,863
Wait. Don't tell me
she's doing an interview as well.

323
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,031
I know Jae-won is doing this too.

324
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,827
I also know where he lives
and what he does.

325
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,330
If she's also participating
in this interview, tell her this.

326
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,168
"Hey, you are a terrible woman."

327
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,422
People might think
this is out of the blue,

328
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,132
but you know what I'm talking about.

329
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,967
You're a terrible woman.

330
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,596
-You terrible woman.
-<i>He's right.</i>

331
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,973
I'm a terrible woman.

332
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,225
I seduced you, had sex with you,

333
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,352
and dumped you after I had some fun.
Happy now?

334
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,732
It's been so long
since I last had a lovers' quarrel.

335
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,653
Now I'm ready to put up
with any type of woman.

336
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,158
You see,

337
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,287
I did what I did that morning

338
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,916
because everything Jae-won knew
about me was fake.

339
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,629
As you already know,
my name isn't Yoon Seon-a.

340
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,382
My name is Lee Eun-o,

341
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,427
not Yoon Seon-a.

342
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,680
<i>The girl that Jae-won met</i>

343
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,225
<i>wasn't the real me.</i>

344
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,816
Hey, eat.

345
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,277
No?

346
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,615
I guess not.
