00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,555
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,995
<i>"Feel bad for him"?</i>

9
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,998
You just wait here.
I'll show you how she looks.

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,751
-How will you do that?
-With the dashcam.

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,420
Gosh. Why didn't I think of this sooner?

12
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,465
What?

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,468
What? What the hell? Where did it go?

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,511
I removed the memory card two days ago.

15
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,972
Wait. What?

16
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,265
Two days ago in Sangam-dong,

17
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,060
they claimed our truck
crashed into someone's garage.

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,062
So I submitted it
to prove them wrong. Why?

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,564
Why did you give them mine
and not your car's?

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,568
Because your car was there at that time.
Our workers always use mine.

21
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,570
In-su took mine today as well.

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,161
You're definitely an alcoholic.

23
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,330
You habitually pestered the police,

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,082
and now you see a vision of Seon-a?

25
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,459
Is this a movie? Why would she be there?

26
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,170
Why would she appear
after stealing your cameras?

27
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,798
Hey, why did you take the memory card?

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,591
Isn't it common sense?

29
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,886
You should've told me if you took
something from my car.

30
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,471
-I did.
-You did?

31
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,932
When? You told me? When did you tell me?

32
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,684
What month, date, and time?

33
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,229
Also… Hey, look.

34
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,773
You should've put in a new one
after taking it out.

35
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,233
Why didn't you?

36
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,027
You took the car.
You went to Pyeongchang-dong!

37
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,530
Exactly. You should've told me then!

38
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,948
I did!

39
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,368
You idiot! Darn it. When did you?

40
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,995
-You never told me!
-Whatever!

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,664
I don't remember!

42
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,165
-Hey!
-I don't remember.

43
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,001
Get out.

44
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,178
Gosh. Hey.

45
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,223
Hey, kids. I have a gift for you.

46
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,766
-Hey!
-Someone will come for it.

47
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,477
-Sell it and buy some snacks.
-Kyeong-jun, you lunatic!

48
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,688
-What?
-Bye.

49
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,357
-You lunatic!
-What was that?

50
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,029
Hey, kids. That's mine.

51
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,158
But someone just gave it to me.

52
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,202
-I know, but it's mine.
-How much will you pay me?

53
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,080
Why would I pay for what's mine?

54
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,460
-Fine. How much is it?
-I want chicken.

55
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,047
PUSHOVER

56
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,551
All right. Go eat it and study hard. Okay?

57
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,428
-Here.
-There are five more in there.

58
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,513
Seven in total.

59
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,433
And we have a big appetite.

60
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,227
PUSHOVER

61
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,854
Okay. Here.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,733
Enjoy.

63
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,611
-Yes!
-He gave us a lot!

64
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,823
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND YOON SEON-A?

65
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,494
Why I'm trying to find her?

66
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,663
I want to ask him the same question.

67
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:26,998
Why?

68
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,588
Anyone would do the same
after going through that kind of breakup.

69
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,589
Tell him to stop.

70
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,050
She vanished without a word
during our happiest moment.

71
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,635
This is just unacceptable.

72
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,429
We didn't fight,
and I didn't do anything wrong.

73
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,556
He's doing this
because he has enough to live on.

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,683
Why does that matter? Are you kidding me?

75
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,976
I'm an employee, too.

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,188
I'm so jealous. No one gives me a salary.

77
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,190
There was no closure. Closure!

78
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,110
I gave him a message not to see me again.

79
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,528
If that's not closure, what is?

80
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,114
If one side wants to break up,
the relationship is over.

81
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,991
Why did she have to steal the cameras?

82
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,077
Why? You…

83
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,621
Thief.

84
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,416
Are you curious?
Is that why you're doing this?

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,919
Once I get them back,
I'll end it once and for all.

86
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,630
I won't give them back.
What did I steal them for?

87
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,510
I truly hope she sees this interview.

88
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,138
What? Another video letter?

89
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,479
TO YOON SEON-A

90
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,232
Hey. Yoon Seon-a.

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,153
You are driving me

92
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,739
insane.

93
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,953
I see visions of you now.

94
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,163
How are you doing?

95
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,001
I'm doing great. Happy?

96
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm a camera thief. A terrible woman.

97
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,713
Consider yourself unlucky and forget me.

98
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,423
Just think, "That's the way I am."

99
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,384
I could forget about her
if any of this made sense.

100
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,303
But nothing makes sense.

101
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,804
Nothing!

102
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,434
I loved him. But two months was enough.

103
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,601
Park Jae-won's

104
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,729
the boring type. I got sick of him.

105
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,105
<i>Why doesn't this make sense?</i>

106
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,482
How could she break up
with someone like me?

107
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,362
Aren't I quite a catch?
I'm pretty sure I am.

108
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,822
I'm okay.

109
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,867
I'm good at it. I'm good.

110
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>I didn't expect myself
to be this clingy and pathetic.</i>

111
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,507
I'm telling you, this isn't the real me.

112
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,719
I'm extremely gentle,
extremely attentive, extremely cool,

113
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,845
and…

114
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,016
Damn it. Why the hell
am I even saying these things?

115
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,726
I must be crazy.

116
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,020
I need a drink.

117
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,609
Do you have any?

118
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,820
No?

119
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,741
Just one drink.

120
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,581
I want to drink.

121
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,876
I can't endure this without being drunk.

122
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>I can understand him.</i>

123
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,173
You need to be crazy to date someone.

124
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
ILLEGAL LITTERING IS PROHIBITED

125
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,015
It's something you can't do
with a clear mind.

126
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,852
This

127
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,105
isn't the real me, either.

128
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,399
That was my first time
going to the police.

129
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,237
Or was it?

130
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,114
Two times?

131
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,032
Three times?

132
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,702
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

133
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,955
What's important is that

134
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,166
I turn into a lunatic
when I'm in a relationship.

135

22 PHOTOS

136
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,342
When you're in a relationship,

137
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,680
you learn more about yourself
than about the other person.

138
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,267
You end up finding out how low

139
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,602
you can go.

140
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,315
I won't be in a relationship for a while.

This is her. Kang Geon's female friend,
Lee Eun-o.

159
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,706
I came across her Instagram
and I've been checking her out.

160
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,251
I'm keeping an eye on them.

161
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,255
I'm waiting for the day

162
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,675
they officially announce they're dating.

163
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,428
And Suh Rin-i.

00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,764
She's another female friend,
but she's okay.

165
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,558
It seems like
she has a long-term boyfriend.

166
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,269
But Lee Eun-o.

167
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,524
Lee Eun-o. That girl seems dodgy.

168
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,278
Whether she has a boyfriend or not,

169
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,656
she makes me feel anxious.

170
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,869
Call it a woman's intuition.

171
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,458
You can't ignore that.

172
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,253
Lee Eun-o.

173
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,301
No way. I'm getting so many likes.

174
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,262
My client will love this!

175
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
Eun-o, this is really good.

176
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,683
-Right?
-The sausages are huge too.

177
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,434
Speaking of which,

178
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,436
how about giving limited edition freebies

179
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,772
to those who order these new pizzas?

180
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,607
That sounds nice.

181
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,568
People like him would love it.

182
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,444
That's good.

183
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,530
Right.

184
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,408
Did you hear about Jae-won's camera thief?

185
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,243
That was ridiculous.

186
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,787
He even went to the police, right?
Rin-i told us.

187
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,664
He went there six times.

188
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,374
Do you know what they call him?

189
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,042
A regular.

190
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,503
I feel so bad for him.

191
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,715
He looks totally normal in person.

192
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:55,386
I can't believe he got hammered
and spent the night in a cell.

193
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,680
Anyone here?

194
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,223
-Who is it?
-This is the police.

195
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,642
-"Police"?
-What?

196
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,227
What is this? I'm scared.

197
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,313

198
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,064
Okay.

199
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,733
We're from the Seongsu Police Box.

200
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,152
We received a theft report
in this area today.

201
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,361
A thief, in our town?

202
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,531
Three houses in this alley
have been robbed so far.

203
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:20,703
-Is this 310-23 Seongsu-dong?
-Yes.

204
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,080
-Was anything stolen?
-No.

205
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,540
Wait. One minute.

206
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,835
SEOUL SHOE FACTORY

207
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,670
Eun-o!

208
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,382
Where is she? In the bathroom?

209
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,760
Eun-o's gone.

210
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,220
If you find anything missing,
please give us a visit.

211
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,097
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

212
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,432
Goodbye.

213
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,313
What am I doing?

214
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,446
What? You were in there?

215
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,156
There's a thief in this area.

216
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,867
Seoul's supposed to be safe.
I can't believe it.

217
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,202
Are you missing anything?

218
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,496
One neighbor
got their silver spoons stolen.

219
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,707
Are the police dispatched for such things?

220
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,085
Of course. It's public security.

221
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,545
Isn't your place at risk, too?

222
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,131
It's okay.
I have no silver for them to take.

223
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,300
The police must have it rough.

224
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,428
I saw so many people like Jae-won
that day at the precinct.

225
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,390
They need to catch thieves
and deal with people like him.

226
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,517
Why do people pester cops that much?

227
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,106
Please fill that in and wait.

228
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,817
-The Director will consult you.
-Okay.

PATIENT REGISTRATION FORM

230
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,079
Jae-won!

231
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,081
What a surprise!

232
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,208
He's my friend.

233
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,960
Come inside. You should've said hi.

234
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm done for the day.

235
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,922
-But--
-Let's go. Come inside.

236

PSYCHIATRIST KIM SEONG-U

237
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,925
You should've called before you came.

238
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,510
I'm glad I didn't miss you.

239
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,264
-You moved hospitals?
-Didn't I tell you?

240
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,599
-No.
-I told you at the class reunion.

241
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,476
I see.

242
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,981
Are there any other doctors?

243
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,733
I heard the Director here is
pretty famous.

244
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,026
Why? I'm a doctor too.

245
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,531
Are you here for a consultation?

246
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,617
Not me. Kyeong-jun.

247
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,619
Then he should come himself.

248
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
Right.

249
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,250
But his symptoms are quite severe,
so I wanted to check in advance.

250
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,293
How bad?

251
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,215
Well…

252
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,303
He goes to the police when he's drunk,
but he doesn't remember.

253
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,262
Is he an alcoholic?

254
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,266
I'm not sure. He doesn't seem
to drink that much.

255
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,770
Jae-won.

256
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,356
Yes?

257
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,776
Can we talk over some drinks?

258
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,156
-In broad daylight?
-What about it?

259
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,908
One drink. It will be evening soon.

260
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,451
Let's go.

261
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,581
Come on. Aren't you going to drink?

262
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,333
I'm not in the mood today.

263
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,668
-Let me pour some for you.
-Sure.

264
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,463
More.

265
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,223
Could it be alcohol-related dementia?

266
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,435
Is it possible to hallucinate?

267
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,063
Yes, if his condition is serious.

268
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,524
Did it only happen once?

269
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,028
If that's the case,
he could've mistaken it.

270
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,864
What if it was twice?

271
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,575
It's severe, isn't it?

272
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,994
He needs to get treated for his addiction.

273
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,169
It wasn't a hallucination.

274
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>She appeared in my dreams once.</i>

275
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,370
What's wrong with me?

276
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,625
God, I drank too much.

277
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,568
<i>That wasn't a dream.</i>

278
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,657
We did meet again.

279
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,535
On a snowy day last winter.

280
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,335
<i>The snow that fell on that day</i>

281
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,671
<i>reminded me of him.</i>

282
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,883
<i>And I saw him there.</i>

283

FRENCH POP-UP BAR

284
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,072
I must be dreaming
since I miss you so much.

285
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,873
Yes, this is a dream.

286
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,962
What an odd dream.

287
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,678
I'm truly honored to see you
even if it's in a dream,

288
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,054
Ms. Yoon Seon-a.

289
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,767
Do you visit Cheonggyecheon often?

290
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,812
This was my fifth time.

291
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,441
No, was it my tenth time?

292
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,320
No, it was my 20th time.

293
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,740
But we didn't agree to meet today.

294
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,160
I know. I…

295
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,706
I thought you forgot the date,

296
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,001
so I came here every Saturday.

297
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,756
I even went

298
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,677
to the patrol division over there.

299
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,681
To send you to jail

300
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,728
because you stole my cameras.

301
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,565
Can't you just forget about me?

302
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,276
How could I forget you?

303
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,908
We got married.

304
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,118
It was a joke.

305
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,746
No, it wasn't a joke for me.

306
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,082
Look.

307
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,961
I've never taken this off.

308
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,547
Why not?

309
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,217
You told me not to.

310
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,344
Never ever.

311
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,145
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,072
Do you know that Ra-ra and Bin
moved to South Africa?

313
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,495
Do you know

314
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,541
how many e-mails
I've sent them to find you?

315
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,500
Hey.

316
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:39,756
You should be really sorry
for what you did to me.

317
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,385
It's all my fault.

318
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,553
You're right.

319
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,347
Yes, it's all your fault.

320
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,392
You are…

321
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,980
You're mean.

322
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,357
So just forget about me.

323
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,333
Where do you live?

324
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,841
How are you doing?

325
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,388
Good.

326
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,934
Really?

327
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,737
Why am I annoyed to hear
that you're doing well?

328
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,079
I know you're lying.

329
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,874
No, I mean everything that I say.

330
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,084
Because you see,

331
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,712
as you can see right now,

332
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,633
day by day, literally day by day,

333
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,261
I'm dying a little more inside.

334
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,950
I'm a horrible woman.

335
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,244
It was all a lie.

336
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:38,041
If you were going to do this,
why did you make me stay another month?

337
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,418
Why did we live together for two months?

338
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,587
When…

339
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,842
When I asked you to meet me
at Cheonggyecheon,

340
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,968
why…

341
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,013
Why did you tell me you would?

342
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,852
And why didn't you ever call me?

343
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,022
You…

344
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,024
Damn it.

345
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,779
Why did you marry me?

346
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,406
I was serious about it.

347
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,786
I really meant it.

348
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,510
You…

349
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,100
You're going to disappear again.

350
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,028
Don't go.

351
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,822
Don't go.

352
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,702
Don't go.

353
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,589
Sit over here.

354
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,343
Hurry.

355
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,515
Good.

356
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,434
Your arm.

357
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,562
Shoulder.

358
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,484
Don't go.

359
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,570
Hold me.

360
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,827
Your arm.

361
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,872
Arm.

362
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,416
Shoulder.

363
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,571
<i>She appeared in my dreams</i>

364
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,075
<i>just once.</i>

365
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,123
Excuse me, I'd like to pay.

366
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,425
I don't need the receipt.

367
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,018
Hey, Seong-u. Hey, get up.

368
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,769
Jae-won, let's have one more drink.

369
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,479
Hey, stop drinking.

370
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,149
No more drinks. Let's go.

371
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,235
Jae-won, we still have more to talk about.

372
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,237
-No, we don't.
-We do.

373
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,263
SENDER
RECIPIENT

374
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,521
RECIPIENT: PARK JAE-WON

375
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,693
Hold on.

376
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,529
What if Kyeong-jun gets this?

377
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,867
This won't do.

378
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,955
What should I do?

379
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,957
-Be careful.
-Okay.

380
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,377
Tell Kyeong-jun to call me tomorrow.

381
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,461
Okay.

382
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,381
His will to get better matters the most.

383
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,591
Are you really okay? Can you go home?

384
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,842
I'll take you home.

385
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,427
Let's have one more drink.

386
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,971
Hey, what are you talking about?
You're drunk.

387
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,515
One more drink!

388
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,058
-Let's go home.
-Jae-won!

389
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,976
What is it?

390
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,646
It's just that I miss Ji-yeong so much.

391
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,482
Okay. I know, so let's go home.

392
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,026
You know I really loved her, right?

393
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,862
I do. I know, so let's go.

394
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,698
-I need to hear her voice.
-No, that's not right.

395
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,242
-Don't do that.
-Ji-yeong…

396
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,493
-Hey--
-Let me go!

397
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,204
-I'll hang up after I hear her voice.
-Damn it.

398
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,956
Hello?

399
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,958
Were you asleep?

400
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,043
It's me.

401
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,629
Have you forgotten about me?

402
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,757
Don't you ever think about me?

403
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:44,764
Can't you appear in my dreams
at least once?

404
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,642
That lunatic.
He's totally out of his mind.

405
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,810
Ji-yeong.

406
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,108
Do I act like that when I'm drunk?
I don't, do I?

407
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,902
-Am I with someone right now?
-Say no.

408
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,488
-Yes, of course.
-No.

409
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,366
I have many friends, Ji-yeong.

410
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,578
Yes. You know Jae-won, right?

411
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,371
-Don't.
-Wait, here he is.

412
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,291
-It's Ji-yeong.
-Hey, Ji-yeong.

413
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,586
It's been a while.

414
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,046
Hi, Jae-won.

415
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,423
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

416
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,301
<i>You must be busy raising your baby.</i>

417
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,635
<i>Ji-yeong.</i>

418
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,932
Does that lunatic not remember
that we're married?

419
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,562
I'm totally exhausted from looking after
our eight-month-old baby.

420
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,856
But that asshole drinks every day.

421
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,817
<i>Tell him to come home right now.</i>

422
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,360
If he's not here in ten minutes,

423
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,030
tell him I'm getting a divorce.

424
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,285
-She hung up.
-Hello?

425
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,536
Damn it.

426
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,665
Ji-yeong and you were close too.

427
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,918
Don't you miss her?

428
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,131
You married Ji-yeong, you crazy rascal!

429
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,801
-She's married?
-Yes. God…

430
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,678
To whom? Which asshole is it?

431
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,597
To you, idiot. Gosh!

432
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,475
-I'll never drink with you again.
-Jae-won, who is it?

433
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,526
"Hello, I'm the camera thief."

434
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,362
"I have Park Jae-won's cameras."

435
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,365
Whatever.

436
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,791
What should we have?

437
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,960
-I'm fine with anything.
-Sure.

438
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,296
Let's have something simple.

439
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,470
I'm here for the last time.

440
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,097
I mean it.

441
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,474
I'll never come here again.

442
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,436
That's why I went to the psychiatrist.

443
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,085
What should I do?

444
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,838
He saw me, didn't he?

445
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,638
What?

446
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,183
-Yoon Seon-a.
-Oh, no.

447
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,684
Seon-a!

448
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,066
Seon-a! Stop there! Wait!

449
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,652
Seon-a!

450
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,281
Catch that thief!

451
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:32,992
Hey, Seon-a!

452
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,745
Hey!

453
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,249
-Are you okay?
-Let's go.

454
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,835
Seon-a, are you all right?

455
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,631
Are you? Are you hurt?

456
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,634
Let me see. Why did you run like that?
You'd get caught…

457
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,969
-You should've--
-Mr. Park.

458
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,429
Is this your camera bag?

459
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,640
Yes.

460
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,394
Ms. Yoon Seon-a.

461
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,605
You're under arrest for stealing
Mr. Park Jae-won's cameras.

462
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,692
You have the right to an attorney,
the right to defend yourself,

463
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,653
and the right to file a <i>habeas corpus</i>.
