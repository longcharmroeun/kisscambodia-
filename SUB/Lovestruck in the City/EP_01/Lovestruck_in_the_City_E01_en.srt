HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>One day, we wanted to know
how men and women in the city date.</i>

9
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to
follow several men and women in the city.</i>

10
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,847
What is this? Are you filming me?

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,600
You didn't tell me about going on camera.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,394
Hi, there.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,314
You should have told me about this.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,775
I would have put on a jacket or something.

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,615
Can this help promote my agency?

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,705
Hold on.

17
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,042
Hello.

18
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,336
<i>Do you have a script?</i>

19
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,504
Do I just talk?

20
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,340
Hi.

21
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,760
So should I look at you? Or the camera?

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,930
I'll just talk to the camera.

23
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,556
Gosh, this is awkward.

24
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,101
Should I introduce myself first?

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,856
Hello. My name is Park Jae-won…

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,733
I don't have to be formal?

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,156
Hi. I'm Park Jae-won.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,368
I'm an architect. And I'm 32 years old.

29
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,496
Oh, my. This is so awkward.

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
It's nice to meet you.

31
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,586
I'm Lee Eun-o. I'm 29.

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,506
O3 MARKETING AGENCY

33
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,717
I'm a marketer. A pretty marketer.

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,220
My name is Choi Kyeong-jun. I'm 29.

35
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,515
I'm working at the company
my father and my uncle established.

36
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,016
I'm an architect.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,770
My name is Suh Rin-i. I'm 29.

38
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,064
My job?

39
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,483
I have so many.

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,861
I'm interested in so many things,

41
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,572
so I can't pick just one.

42
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:40,702
MULTIPLE JOBS? PART-TIMER?
UNEMPLOYED? OUT OF WORK?

43
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,911
Done. Do it again?

44
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,289
This is kind of uncomfortable.

45
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,334
I'm a gym teacher at a high school.
I'm 30. My name is Oh Seon-yeong.

46
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,505
I love Seoul. And my life is fun.

47
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,383
People call me Serial Dater
because I'm always dating.

48
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,261
Will you add captions, too?

49
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,722
Where can I watch this later?
On TV? At a theater?

50
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,765
I write novels. I'm a novelist.

51
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,851
My name is Kang Geon. I'm 29.

52
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,314
<i>We won't intervene in their lives.</i>

53
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>When we think it's necessary,</i>

54
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,569
<i>we will share their interviews
with the others</i>

55
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,113
<i>or edit them to make this entertaining.</i>

56
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,367
So

57
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,913
you may share what I said
in my interviews,

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,165
but they won't know who said it?

59
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,919
No? They'll know?

60
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,088
So will we know who's participating
in this interview thing?

61
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,965
Is that a yes or a no?

62
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,134
Fifty people?
Then, I might know some of them.

63
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,469
Yes, I'm in.

64
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,262
I see. So I can use this next time?

65
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,264
We won't be able to see each other, right?

66
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,058
But what do I get if I do this?

67
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,434
Nothing?

68
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,853
How come I'm getting nothing in return?

69
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,939
Not even money? I won't do it.

70
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,568
Wait. Then there could be
someone's ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends.

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,863
There's no one from my school, right?

72
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,951
<i>They promised to treat their cameras
as their friends</i>

73
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,911
<i>and tell only the truth.</i>

74
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,457
<i>But some incidents made us wonder
if they were telling us the truth.</i>

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,252
What? About my dating life?
When I was in a relationship?

76
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,921
I'm cool and gentle.

77
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,131
I don't get clingy. I'm just cool.

78
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,801
I'm true to myself when I date

79
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,929
and when I break up as well.

80
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,890
I'm passionate.

81
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,685
I fall in love fast
and fall out of love fast.

82
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,020
I just get over them when I break up.

83
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,945
A girl hit me in the street.

84
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,993
What's the point
of winning over a girl? Gosh.

85
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,330
Slate? What? Clap?

86
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,623
This? Clap?

87
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,959
One, two, three.

88
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,170
What is this?

89
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,631
I don't play games.

90
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,550
I think I'm quite nice.

91
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,678
Before I met my current boyfriend,

92
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,846
I'd dated

93
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,889
five men. Or three?

94
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,142
Wait. Let me do it over.

95
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,063
<i>We'll let you be the judge.</i>

96
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,784

PARK JAE-WON

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,526
DO YOU KNOW WHICH MAN OR WOMAN
YOU ARE COMPATIBLE WITH?

103
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,569
<i>Do you know who you are compatible with?</i>

104
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,738
-Bye.
-Men I'm compatible with?

105
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,824
Women I can have fun with.

106
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,450
Men I can talk to?

107
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,036
Talking isn't everything.

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,205
We must connect physically, too.

109
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,915
Are you asking what I think you're asking?

110
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,376
Why is everyone playing innocent?

111
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,461
It was about that?

112
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,342
Why can't you say it? Just be blunt.

113
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,635
Fine. I got it.

114
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,138
Cut it.

115
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,765
Have a good day.

116
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,976
It's about intimacy, right?

117
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,061
I can tell by the smell. It's pheromone.

118
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,729
Some smells work well for me.

119
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,733
Well, I think it depends on the man.

120
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,361
Seriously? Tell him
not to give himself too much credit.

121
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,029
Usually, I take the lead.

122
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,865
Yes. Next fool.

123
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,743
I'll be honest. There was one time
when I had to follow the girl's lead.

124
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,703
Just once.

125
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,871
Once? I doubt that.

126
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
I don't think dating is a big deal.

127
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,625
No. I think it's important.

128
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,960
Dating changed me.

129
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,753
I've dated a lot of women.

130
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,089
I loved it every time.

131
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,094
You think the girls felt the same way?

132
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,763
Men? They are all the same.

133
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,396
There's someone I cannot forget.

134
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,149
I have one, too.

135
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,860
It was a year ago.

136
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,047
<i>She was the only one I could see.</i>

137
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,300
<i>It felt there was only
the two of us in the world.</i>

138
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,637
<i>I felt complete.</i>

139
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,282
<i>I felt a spark every time our fingers met.</i>

140
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,001
I thought it was love, then.

141
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,461
I'll remember him forever.

142
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,548
Then, you shouldn't break up with someone
you feel that way about. Don't you agree?

143
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,508
Right. I messed it up.

144
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,469
No. I messed it up.

145
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,054
No, it was my fault.

146
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,056
Right. It was her fault.

147
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,394
Right. I don't want to make any excuses.

148
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,496
Of all people, why me?
Why did it have to be me?

149
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,792
He came to me when I really needed
someone like him.

150
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,464
I wish I'd never met her.

151
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
<i>Thanks to him,</i>

152
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,094
<i>I've become who I am now.</i>

153
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,016
I was a fool.

154
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,602
<i>That fool</i>

155
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,897
was a gift to me.

156
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,036

BIN'S COMPLETE SURFING

158
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,597
Name, Park Jae-won. He's about 182cm tall.

159
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,058
Any other physical traits?

160
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>He's handsome.
He could pass for a hot model.</i>

161
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,772
Which exit will he wait for me?

162
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,067
Send me his phone number.
There are so many people here.

163
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,154
No. Never mind. I'll just park
my car in the parking lot.

164
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,501
HANDSOME

165
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>-Did you find him?</i>
-Ra-ra, let's end the call.

166
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,013
It better be him.

167
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,185
Are you Park Jae-won from Seoul?

168
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,522
-Yes. Hello.
-Hello.

169
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,482
You're here to pick me up.

170
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,737
-Hi.
-Hi.

171
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,490
-Is that all the luggage?
-Yes.

172
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,491
-Let me.
-No.

173
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,826
-Let me.
-No. I'll do it.

174
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,244
-I'll do it.
-It's fine.

175
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,665
-All right.
-Thank you.

176
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,838
-Get in.
-Okay.

177
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,185
-Put on your seatbelt.
-Okay.

178
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,562
What about Ra-ra?

179
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,190
Well, she's busy
with her <i>ramyeon </i>restaurant.

180
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,399
Ra-ra's Ramyeon.

181
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,818
"We serve all kinds of <i>ramyeon</i>."
That's the motto.

182
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,987
Right, I know that.

183
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,822
She ran it in Jeju Island, too.

184
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,115
-Right?
-Yes.

185
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,811
You asked me what kind of women
I'm compatible with.

186
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,314
I am

187
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,859
attracted to strange women.

188
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,070
And I'm compatible with such women.

189
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:46,158
ROLLING STARS IS A 4-PERSON
BRITISH ROCK BAND FORMED IN 1968

190
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,827
"HELLO, MY BEACH" WAS RELEASED IN 1978

191
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,040
THIS SONG HAS BECOME
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BAND

192
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:57,378
ITS BLUNT, STRAIGHTFORWARD LYRICS
AND INTENSE MELODY STAND OUT

193
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,130
IT'S AN UPBEAT, COUNTRY SONG
ABOUT A MAN'S WISH

194
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,342
TO GET HIS OLD LOVER BACK
DESPITE HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HER

195
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,061
<i>Have you ever</i>

196
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,898
<i>met someone and felt like
question marks were floating around them?</i>

197
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,320
<i>"What is she like? She looks fun."</i>

198
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,365
<i>You're curious, so you want to know more.</i>

199
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,452
Do you know this song?

200
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,455
-Yes.
-Let's sing it together.

201
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,880
<i>I couldn't let you go</i>

202
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:47,636
<i>So even the time
Couldn't take you away from me</i>

203
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:54,560
<i>Our memory together
Was deeply stuck like a thorn</i>

204
00:14:54,643 --> 00:15:00,024
<i>I couldn't realize that it was hurting me</i>

205
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,108
Sing it, everyone!

206
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:07,615
<i>The memory of you and our past love</i>

207
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:14,622
<i>Became a thorn piercing through my heart</i>

208
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,625
<i>I begged you to go</i>

209
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,877
<i>I wanted you gone forever</i>

210
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,093
<i>That's how I fall in love.</i>

211
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm attracted to intense women.

212
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,933
Same here. It's fun to follow their leads.

213
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,643
I do everything they tell me to.

214
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,397
I like bubbly and cheerful women,
but she was like…

215
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,066
She was feisty.

216
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,109
She was just like that.

217
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,654
The level of her feistiness
was just right for me.

218
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,447
I was curious about you.

219
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,241
-Pardon? Me?
-It's funny, you know.

220
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,661
You rented a camper trailer
without the license.

221
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,247
I moved the trailer you rented
to a nice spot near the beach.

222
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,958
It's a really good one, by the way.

223
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,126
I've had 2 wishes ever since I was 20.

224
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,713
The first wish was
to live a month in a camper.

225
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,217
And the second wish was
to surf for a month, nothing else.

226
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,637
-You must like surfing, too.
-Yes. A lot.

227
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,847
But you can't tow the trailer.

228
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,433
I rented it so I could just sleep in it.

229
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,269
No honorifics?

230
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,607
You dropped yours first.

231
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,943
When in Ra-ra's Ramyeon.

232
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,445
I see. That's how she still rolls.

233
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,114
It's fun to speak casually.

234
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,032
So do you work there?

235
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,243
As a part-timer during my stay here.

236
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,911
Then, how will you get around?

237
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,998
I'll walk. I like walking
and riding bikes and motorcycles.

238
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,543
This makes no sense.
You'll just leave the trailer there.

239
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,044
I'll sleep in there.

240
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,922
Places like that would look beautiful
on rainy days.

241
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,721
Wouldn't it be nice to drink coffee
and listen to the rain over there?

242
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,641
Well, probably.

243
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,268
Right? Then, I'll make a U-turn.

244
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,979
Now? Hold on.

245
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,315
Where are you going all of a sudden?

246
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,776
To drink coffee in a camper on rainy days.

247
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,820
-What?
-Get the Class One license first.

248
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,697
You want me to get a license?

249
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,906
-Ms. Kim Se-jeong.
-Yes?

250
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,034
You scored 68 points.
You failed. Come out.

251
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,160
-What?
-Come out.

252
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,202
DRIVER'S LICENSE TEST

253
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,455
<i>-You may begin.</i>
-All right.

254
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,125
-Get out.
-What?

255
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,044
<i>You may begin.</i>

256
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,336
What are we doing here?

257
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,297
Ta-da!

258
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,554
<i>I should've known that she was crazy.</i>

259
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,308
But I found her craziness fun.

260
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,727
So that makes me crazy, too.

261
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,147
There are certain things
you only realize until much later.

262
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:50,611
Like when you realize you've been conned
after you were conned.

263
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,618
I now understand
how some people can be just blinded.

264
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,661
-My cousin was--
-Shut it.

265
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,622
-My cousin was like that.
-Hey. Stop that.

266
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,373
-Hello.
-Come on.

267
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,751
Hi, Han-gyeol. Wait.

268
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,419
What are you doing?

269
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,922
Mr. Park told me to throw it out.

270
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,590
I did. I'm changing the layout.

271
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,179
Have you gone mad?
The CEO already approved it.

272
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,056
The client is on board, too. Why?

273
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,267
I don't like where the stairs
between the first and second floors are.

274
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,145
We've changed it three times already.
What do you want now?

275
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,313
I'm not sure.

276
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,274
Do you have a plan?

277
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,612
You don't.

278
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,280
Damn it.

279
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,159
Ms. Lee Han-gyeol! Bring that back!

280
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,245
Don't throw it out. No!

281
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,809
<i>Whenever I see a camper trailer,
I think of her.</i>

282
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,105
Register for the test today
and take the exam tomorrow.

283
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,190
It only took a day for me
to get mine here.

284
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,735
-Right. You don't have your ID photo.
-Of course, I don't.

285
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,154
What?

286
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,989
-Hurry. Go inside.
-Come on.

287
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,200
-All right.
-No one looks good in these photos.

288
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,618
Let's see.

289
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,663
Here it goes. Smile.
Say, "Braised kimchi."

290
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,957
"Braised kimchi"?

291
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,251
What? Now? Braised kimchi.

292
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,753
ROAD TEST

293
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,850
It looks exactly like you.

294
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,353
-It does?
-Yes.

295
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,479
Seriously?

296
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,065
My gosh, look at this photo.

297
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,942
-I look awful in this.
-Put it on now.

298
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,485
I really hate this photo.

299
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,531
APPLICATION

300
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,200
All right.

301
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,799
All right.

302
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,948
Come here.

303
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,910
-Come here!
-Oh, my.

304
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,540
Wait.

305
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,588
All right. Let's go. Here we go.

306
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,094
Jae-won, you know
how to use the control panel, right?

307
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,930
Let me say this just in case.

308
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,765
Don't turn off the main power.

309
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,850
If the fridge's turned off,
it'll be a mess.

310
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,354
And as for the awning, when it rains,

311
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,315
you need to slant it. Okay? To this side…

312
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,736
What is it? Are you listening?

313
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,241
She sparkles.

314
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,828
Right. Doesn't she?

315
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,712
-She has a beautiful smile.
-Hey.

316
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,423
She's making Ra-ra and me
laugh a lot these days.

317
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,843
-Good girl. You're such a good girl.
-I noticed. She's fun.

318
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,636
-Good girl.
-She was dumped here.

319
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,722
-Do you like that? Do you?
-What?

320
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,683
A guy came to surf with her,
but he dumped her here.

321
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,563
How did she end up with such a jerk?
Look at her. She's so bubbly.

322
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,648
-Do you like it?
-She eats a lot.

323
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,567
That's the only drawback.

324
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,111
I like big eaters.

325
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,907
Do you want to take her?

326
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,827
-What?
-You can take her to Seoul.

327
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,873
Me? Really? Can I?

328
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,376
-Will she just come with me?
-Just take her.

329
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,795
She'll follow you if you feed her well.

330
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:25,719
By the way, when you bring her to Seoul,
get her neutered first.

331
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,347
What? What are you talking about?

332
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,890
I don't know how they found out.

333
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,726
Male dogs keep coming.
It's a hassle to chase them away.

334
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,187
Ma'am, does it feel nice?

335
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,649
I see. You were talking about the dog.

336
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,109
Yes. Our dog.

337
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,114
What? You weren't talking about the dog?

338
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,452
-Were you talking about Yoon Seon-a?
-Is that her name?

339
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,598
BIN'S SURFING & RA-RA'S RAMYEON

340
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,311
-Oh, right. Your phone.
-Okay.

341
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,896
Here you go.

342
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,773
Good.

343
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,733
Get your own phone.

344
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,111
Why would I?
I only use it to pick up customers.

345
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,947
-All right. Here.
-Thanks.

346
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,658
-What's going on?
-We're having a barbecue party.

347
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,952
Come and have fun.
Sorry for being too casual.

348
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,871
But that's how we roll here. Come on in.

349
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,081
What is this place?

350
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,874
This place is awesome.

351
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,795
-Gyeong-gu!
-Hey.

352
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,088
Here.

353
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,175
Here I go.

354
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,888
Is that all you've got, Gyeong-gu?

355
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,848
You try it, then.

356
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,474
-Me? Okay.
-Yes.

357
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,226
-Go!
-My gosh.

358
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,480
-Nice.
-Yes!

359
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:05,193
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

360
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,239
-Is it my turn?
-It's okay.

361
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,616
-Hurry up.
-Hold on a second.

362
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,786
-Ra-ra, we need more food!
-Okay.

363
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,414
-That's all I've got.
-Thank you.

364
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,044
-You have to go slow.
-You're good.

365
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,796
-All right. Take your time.
-I will.

366
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,757
-You can do it.
-I can do it. I'll go slow.

367
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,842
Going well?

368
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,596
I think so, thanks to you.

369
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,392
Seon-a. It's the last round.

370
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,686
-I need your support.
-Okay.

371
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,313
Wait.

372
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,233
-Here I go.
-Standby, three, four.

373
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,777
Okay. Great.

374
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,490
-Yes!
-Nice.

375
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,119
That's it. That's the last one.

376
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,459
-Nice. We won.
-Yes, we won.

377
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,091
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

378
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,481
What's going on?

379
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,736
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

380
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,906
Gamers, come on out!

381
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,669
Four men and three women.

382
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,882
Two men and two women.

383
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,638
Three men and four women.

384
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,267
-Come over here!
-Over there!

385
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,854
Four men!

386
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,317
What? It's just us?

387
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,319
Three, two, one.

388
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,989
-One man and one woman.
-One man and one woman.

389
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,490
There are only men left.

390
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,869
Come on. There are no women left.

391
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,579
-That's random. My bad.
-What was that?

392
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,374
Is it broken?

393
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,525
<i>When I look at a girl's eyes, I can tell</i>

394
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,361
<i>if she's compatible with me or not.</i>

395
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,364
<i>I can sort of see
her facial expressions in her eyes.</i>

396
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,284
<i>I just felt it at that moment.</i>

397
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,537
<i>I knew that she and I would be compatible.</i>

398
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,206
Tonight's winner! Congratulations!

399
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,169
Good job, everyone!

400
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,724
<i>I liked everything about her.</i>

401
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,186
<i>Her breathing sound
and her smell up close.</i>

402
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:30,231
<i>Her weird hairstyle and clothes
she threw together without much effort.</i>

403
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,401
<i>Everything about her seemed perfect.</i>

404
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,489
<i>I just liked her.</i>

405
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,833
I find others' dating stories

406
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,919
kind of funny now.

407
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,047
"At that moment, the fireworks went off."

408
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,136
I'm sorry. I laughed too loudly.

409
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,057
I bet they heard bells, too.
I heard cannonballs.

410
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,353
Well, everyone thinks
their love life is special.

411
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,605
It's a beautiful story.

412
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,570
A man went on a trip
and met a beautiful woman there.

413
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,949
And fireworks went off that night.

414
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,620
Their eyes met.

415
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,124
And their hearts fluttered.

416
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,210
I'm serious.
All those things happened all at once.

417
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,505
It's possible
if that woman was insanely attractive.

418
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,091
That's when you must realize,

419
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,593
"I'm not myself right now."

420
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,681
Let's say you came back to your senses.
But what if you don't get together?

421
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,766
You'll be alone forever.

422
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,978
No, I'm not. I am not alone.

423
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,400
If I get to live that moment again?

424
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,867
I would still…

425
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,539
If I were to meet him again,
I would fall in love again.

426
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,126
Yes, I think I would.

427
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,753
Boom, boom.

428
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,213
Boom!
