#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,873
Ms. Yoon Seon-a. You're under arrest
for stealing Mr. Park Jae-won's cameras.

9
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,626
You have the right to an attorney,
the right to defend yourself,

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,795
and the right to file a <i>habeas corpus</i>.

11
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,922
Wait. Hold on a second.

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:53,344
Why are you putting handcuffs on her?
You're scaring her.

13
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,305
We just need to go with you, right?

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,390
Give me that.

15
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,394
We're good now. Let's go.

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,361
3 DAYS AGO

17
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,865
<i>What would you do if you ran into your ex?</i>

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,662
Well, it would depend on how things ended.

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,040
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU RAN INTO YOUR EX?

20
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,834
I wanted to put everything behind
and have tea with her.

21
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,877
Tea is nice.

22
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,463
It's all in the past.

23
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,048
Right. It's in the past.

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,800
I thought we could be friends.

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,718
At least up until I met her again.

26
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,929
How can you stay friends after a breakup?

27
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,223
You either get back together
or end things.

28
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,557
It's one or the other.

29
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,977
I turn a bit rude when I break up.

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,689
So I don't hate my exes after breakups.

31
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,191
That's the worst.

32
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,567
After a messy breakup,

33
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,111
you only remember
the bad stuff about the relationship.

34
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,113
That's so selfish.

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,782
Before Kyeong-jun and I started dating,

36
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,617
there was a guy I'd dated for a year.

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,162
The two iced Americanos
you ordered are ready.

38
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,375
Thank you.

39
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,476
That was seven or eight years ago,
but I was still mad at him.

40
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,872
Rin-i.

41
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,000
Who is she? Do you know her?

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,918
-She--
-Sweetie.

43
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,713
I didn't know you had another girlfriend.

44
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,215
What?

45
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,259
Then, you must break up with one of us.

46
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,887
I'll break up with you.

47
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,098
Hey, what are you doing?

48
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,017
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,603
-Let me--
-I wish you happiness. I'll leave you.

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,898
-I loved you.
-What?

51
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,942
Wait. Rin-i.

52
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,028
You got up?

53
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,907
-She's my ex.
-Your ex?

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,700
-My ex-girlfriend.
-So what?

55
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,994
-She's my ex!
-You crazy jerk. How dare you?

56
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:23,995
You piece of trash!

57
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,292
Good riddance.

58
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,711
Suh Rin-i!

59
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,844
Hey, how could you do that?

60
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,430
Why are you doing this to me now?

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,769
You never broke up with me.

62
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,188
You didn't have the courage,

63
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,565
so you went off the grid and avoided me.

64
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,568
You didn't even see me
when I went to see you.

65
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,947
So I just broke up with you
on your behalf. Isn't that fair?

66
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,366
If you think so,

67
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,078
break up properly
before you date a new one.

68
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,792
Hey. Hey!

69
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,798
I like giving them
a dose of their own medicine.

70
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,259
I'd love to do the same to Seon-a.

71
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>Gosh.</i>

72
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,099
Well, Rin-i is the only girl
I've ever dated.

73
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,601
Why do I feel like it's a bummer?

74
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,645
She can't find out what I said.

75
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,689
Don't tell her.

76
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,108
I don't even remember the other girls.

77
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,485
My breakup with Seon-a was crazy.

78
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,030
Meeting my ex again?

79
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,617
Now that I think of it,
it was so dramatic.

80
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,910
Stop right there!

81
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,954
-Jung Seong-jun, stop right there!
-No!

82
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,248
Hey! Stop him! Stop that guy!

83
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,624
-Hey.
-Hold on.

84
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,334
-Stop him!
-Let go of me.

85
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,211
-Gosh.
-You jerk!

86
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,254
-Come on.
-Hey.

87
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,338
-I got him.
-No.

88
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,756
You jerk. On your feet now.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,050
That rascal!

90
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,261
Stop whining and get up.

91
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,888
Why are you doing this to me?

92
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,516
-What's wrong with you?
-That hurts!

93
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,602
-Hey, am I your friend?
-No.

94
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,980
How dare you talk to me that way?

95
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,940
I'm your teacher.

96
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,859
-How many times did you do this?
-Gosh.

97
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,611
Didn't I say you'd be expelled
if you left home again?

98
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,529
You did.

99
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,491
Do you know how hard
your life gets when you get expelled?

100
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,492
You'll rip my ear.

101
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,120
Do you even think about your parents?

102
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,457
-Where are you going?
-No.

103
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,958
Seriously. Please.

104
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,627
-Mother, Father, it must be tough for you.
-Please. No.

105
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,463
Hey, apologize to your parents.

106
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,964
Apologize to them now.

107
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,218
I'm…

108
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,179
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,308
-Thank you so much, Ms. Oh.
-Gosh, don't mention it.

110
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,434
It must be hard.

111
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,103
-Thank you, Ms. Oh.
-No problem.

112
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,690
There's no point
in running away from home again.

113
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,693
I know all the places you go to.
Keep that in mind!

114
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,323
Happy birthday, Jung Seong-jun!

115
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,992
Make sure to eat seaweed soup at home!

116
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,501
<i>"That's why I fell for her."
was what I thought.</i>

117
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,606
It's been a while.

118
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,818
Yes.

119
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,237
It's been a while.

120
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,824
-I caught him thanks to you.
-Is he really a high school student?

121
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,035
-He's a bit big, right?
-It's more than a bit.

122
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,374
-Do you want one more bottle?
-Did we finish?

123
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,168
-One more bottle of sake, please.
-I was always pretty.

124
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,921
<i>The more we talked,
the more I enjoyed talking to her.</i>

125
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,091
<i>Right. It was really nice.</i>

126
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,009
We were so happy.

127
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,471
I remembered our time together.

128
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,142
I even remembered
my feelings of love for him, too.

129
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,309
But the problem was…

130
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,815
I also remembered all the other stuff
that I had forgotten about.

131
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,442
The reason we broke up.

132
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,570
What? You're living with Lee Eun-o?

133
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,865
No. I just use her studio for work.

134
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,575
What was her name?

135
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,410
Suh Rin-i.

136
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,330
Then, I bet she lives
right next to Lee Eun-o's alley.

137
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,790
There you go again.

138
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,464
Hey.

139
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,051
Let's be really honest now.

140
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,219
-Okay.
-Okay?

141
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,016
We broke up, so it doesn't matter.

142
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,268
You have nothing to hide, right?

143
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,227
All right.

144
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,771
Suh Rin-i.

145
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,399
Lee Eun-o.

146
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,986
Between these two,

147
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,448
which one do you have feelings for?

148
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,534
<i>That's when I noticed her purse.</i>

149
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,453
I bought that purse for you.

150
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,082
Answer me. Is it Eun-o or Rin-i?

151
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,751
Do you even remember

152
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,880
how badly you beat me up
with that bag on the street?

153
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,008
Is it Eun-o or Rin-i?

154
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,052
Do you know how much it hurt--

155
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,054
You're scaring me.
What are you looking at?

156
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,140
Hearts don't lie.

157
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,227
Is it Lee Eun-o or Suh Rin-i?

158
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,356
I know things got that rough between us.

159
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,275
-But how could you beat me with the bag--
-Hey!

160
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,027
Is it Lee Eun-o or Suh Rin-i?

161
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,114
<i>You're a bad woman</i>

162
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,284
<i>You're a bad woman</i>

163
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,036
Which one is it?

164
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,996
We got kicked out of the bar that night.

165
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,751
A beautiful reunion of exes?

166
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,961
There's no such thing.

167
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,005
I really want to meet her one day.

168
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,802
During the interview,
I cursed her and resented her,

169
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,804
But I didn't mean any of it. I'm okay.

170
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,847
<i>If he sees that camera thief again,</i>

171
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,932
I'm done with him.

172
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,934
I don't need him in my life.

173
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,187
But I'm sure she had her reasons.
And I'm worried about that.

174
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,231
Why would she disappear
if she had a reason?

175
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,607
Without asking for a breakup?

176
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,025
Why she did that to me

177
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,903
and why she stole the cameras
isn't important at all.

178
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,488
What matters is our reunion.

179
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,407
Whatever. I don't want him to see her.

180
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,033
I don't think she's a nice girl.

181
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,160
If I see her again,

182
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,914
I can promise not to ask anything.

183
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,295
I can understand and accept
whatever and whoever she is.

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
The pain I went through over a year?

185
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,925
That's nothing.

186
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,637
As long as we meet again,
everything will be resolved.

187
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,268
WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?

188
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,522
It makes me look mysterious.

189
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,440
NO

190
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,693
There are some days like this.
You know what I mean.

191
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,611
NO

192
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,574
Do I seem pathetic?

193
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,618
I'M COLD

194
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,121
It is cold up here.

195
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,128
Aren't you coming?

196
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,257
GO ON YOUR OWN

197
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,571
Are these your cameras, Mr. Park?

198
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,325
-Yes.
-This one is a digital camera.

199
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,288
This one is a Polaroid.

200
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,793
This is a film camera.

201
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,087
And

202
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,799
the batteries and cables are in the bag.

203
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,676
-Take their photos.
-Okay.

204
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,640
Excuse me.

205
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,520
By the way, is this really necessary?

206
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:31,357
I got my cameras back.
But they aren't what's important to me.

207
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,984
She's more important to me.

208
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,153
You know that I was looking for her.
Don't you?

209
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,199
-Gosh. Stop staring at her.
-Be quiet, Mr. Park.

210
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,496
I'll draw up an arrest report.

211
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,580
Pardon?

212
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,210
What's that? What is an arrest report?

213
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,963
As I informed you
when I was arresting you,

214
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,174
you were arrested without a warrant
for stealing his cameras.

215
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,178
We'll draw up the arrest report.
The police detectives will take it over.

216
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,763
Police detectives?

217
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,891
Ms. Yoon, you stole
Mr. Park's cameras, right?

218
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,935
-No.
-No. Wait.

219
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,311
Hold on.

220
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,023
If the detectives take over the case,
what happens next?

221
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,527
Ms. Yoon. Theft is not a misdemeanor.

222
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,070
It's one of the five felonies.

223
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,699
Even if the stolen properties don't
cost much, you'll stand trial.

224
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,534
You might even go to jail.

225
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,452
Jail?

226
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,329
Seeing you didn't return them
for over a year,

227
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,291
I don't think you were intending
to return them.

228
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,376
Let's start
with your personal information.

229
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,171
Name, Yoon Seon-a.

230
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,381
-What's your resident registration number?
-Wait.

231
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,384
I didn't officially report her
or anything.

232
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,344
-You don't have to--
-You did.

233
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,181
You reported her six times.

234
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,147
Seon-a, I didn't really report you.

235
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,107
I was drunk, and I missed you so much.

236
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,234
I didn't report you to punish you.

237
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,403
I just wanted to find you.

238
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,071
-So I reported--
-Ms. Yoon.

239
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,449
Your resident registration number, please.

240
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,411
My goodness. This is frustrating.

241
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,538
If you resist,
I must get your fingerprints.

242
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,624
Come on.
Her fingerprints aren't necessary.

243
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,918
I got my cameras back.
And I won't press charges.

244
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,879
We got the cameras,
but we also caught the culprit.

245
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,547
You must take it to trial.

246
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,966
You went everywhere to find your cameras.

247
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,178
Did you go to Cheonggyecheon

248
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,514
to take photos
using the stolen cameras, Ms. Yoon?

249
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,308
If you did,

250
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,019
it will be an aggravated crime
unlike accidental theft.

251
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,272
Ms. Yoon, given the circumstance,

252
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,317
it looks like you planned
to steal his cameras from the start.

253
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,612
What do you mean, "from the start"?
You're taking this all wrong.

254
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,905
By the way,

255
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,952
why do you keep treating me
like I'm a thief?

256
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,205
She's right.
Why do you keep saying she's a thief?

257
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,289
You're scaring her.

258
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,293
Why are you threatening her
with scary terms like "trial" and "jail"?

259
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,962
You're scaring her.

260
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,588
You gave me the cameras, Jae-won.

261
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,348
<i>I wanted to hide it so badly
that I chose to be a liar.</i>

262
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,225
He gave me those cameras.

263
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,478
You gave me the cameras.

264
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,442
What?

265
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,653
<i>I wanted to hide the real me.</i>

266
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,323
<i>He was about to find out my stupid past.</i>

267
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,325
-Did I?
<i>-I didn't want that.</i>

268
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,451
Why would I

269
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,998
give you my cameras?

270
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,791
I just took what he gave me.

271
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,210
Why do you keep calling me a thief?

272
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,005
Seon-a, how could you say that?

273
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,631
What are you talking about?

274
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,674
Ms. Yoon.

275
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,634
-Are you saying they were gifts?
-Yes.

276
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,928
What do you mean, "gifts"?

277
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,889
Then what really happened?

278
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,434
-False accusation?
-What? No way.

279
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,936
Gosh. You're frustrating.

280
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,898
Mr. Park, did you give
the cameras to Ms. Yoon?

281
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,651
Seon-a, what are you doing?
You can't do this to me.

282
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,071
Hey, the voice mail you left…

283
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,742
Should I

284
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,078
tell them everything?

285
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,539
Should I? The message… You…

286
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,003
I can go, right?

287
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,671
I didn't steal the cameras.

288
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,341
-But he can keep them.
-Wait. Where are you going?

289
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,926
Why were you at Cheonggyecheon?

290
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,802
Answer that. You came to see me.

291
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,387
-Right?
-Mr. Park.

292
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,972
Everyone comes to Cheonggyecheon.

293
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,390
-Just answer that.
-Be quiet.

294
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,560
-Were you there to see me?
-Can you uncuff me first?

295
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,521
Mr. Park, did you give her the cameras?

296
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,815
Yes.

297
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,318
I gave…

298
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,029
I think I did.

299
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
Yes. I gave them to her.

300
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,993
-Gosh, this is…
-Uncuff me, please.

301
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,709
By the way, I can't let her go like this.

302
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,253
-Don't let her go yet.
-Stop it.

303
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,798
Ms. Yoon.

304
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,091
Ms. Yoon!

305
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,094
We're not done yet.
I need your resident registration number.

306
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,263
We handcuffed you.
We need to leave a record.

307
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,473
Your ID number, please.

308
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,393
I…

309
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,438
Do I have to?

310
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,817
We have to follow protocol.
We're the police.

311
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,710
Me first. You live in Seongsu-dong, right?

312
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,045
-What are you doing? You can't--
-Hold on. Wait.

313
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,214
-Why are you looking--
-Wait.

314
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,968
IDENTITY CARD
LEE EUN-O

315
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,803
-Give it back.
-Hey.

316
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:56,890
You…

317
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,476
IDENTITY CARD
LEE EUN-O

318
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,896
What…

319
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,483
What's this?

320
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,156
-Give it back.
-Hey.

321
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,408
What is this?

322
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,994
What in the world is this?

323
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,622
What is it?

324
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,583
Is she a man?

325
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,669
Are you a man?

326
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,298
Look, Seon-a.
How can your name not be Yoon Seon-a?

327
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,175
How can this be? Who are you?

328
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,136
"Lee Eun-o"?

329
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,055
Hey.

330
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,432
Say something!

331
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,310
Gosh.

332
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,021
I didn't see this coming.

333
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,648
Where's Yoon Seon-a?

334
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,525
Are you really Seon-a?

335
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,736
No, is that really your ID card?

336
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,404
Explain what happened here.

337
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,075
Come on! Answer me.
Tell me what's going on here!

338
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,577
You…

339
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,038
How much did you lie to me?

340
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,248
Hey, I…

341
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,667
Do you know what I did,
trying to find Yoon Seon-a?

342
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,835
I looked

343
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,255
everywhere for you.

344
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,847
Ms. Lee Eun-o's
resident registration number is…

345
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,935
Can I go?

346
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,525
I gave her the cameras.

347
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,361
And I already told you
my personal information before.

348
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,280
So I can go, right?

349
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,283
Yes. We have his phone number.
We can let him go.

350
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,754
Damn it.

351
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,098
Jae-won.

352
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,227
Jae-won.

353
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,896
Jae-won, wait!

354
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,065
Wait, Jae-won!

355
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,443
Wait!

356
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,778
Wait, Jae-won!

357
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,539
Why did you jump in front of me
all of a sudden?

358
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,707
Damn it.

359
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,754
Jae-won.

360
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,674
Hold on. Wait.

361
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,761
I'll return them. Take them.

362
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,560
Why are you giving them away?

363
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,898
Why are you giving them to me?

364
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,400
You said I gave them to you.

365
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,321
You said that yourself.
So why are you giving them back?

366
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,615
Are you sure I gave them to you?

367
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,116
Or

368
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,245
should we talk this over again
at the station?

369
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,375
That wasn't my intention.

370
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,963
I just thought it'd be better
if you thought I stole them from you.

371
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,131
That's why I said that.

372
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,885
-Sorry for lying at the station, Jae-won.
-No.

373
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,553
Don't say my name like that.

374
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,473
I don't know who you are.

375
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,350
You're not Yoon Seon-a.

376
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,146
If you're not Yoon Seon-a,
Who the heck are you?

377
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,149
I don't care what your real name is.

378
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,318
No. I don't even want to know.

379
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,405
Everything you told me
from the start was all a lie.

380
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,156
Do you

381
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,618
even know what you did to me?

382
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,371
If you do, you can't just give back
the cameras like this.

383
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,750
You are

384
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,337
a horrible woman.

385
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,509
You should still take them.

386
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,310
How can I take them?

387
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,771
How can I take them back?

388
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,108
Whenever I see them,
I'll think about our time together

389
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,528
and the girl I fell in love with.
How can I possibly take them?

390
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,122
I don't care if you stole them
or I gave them to you.

391
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,458
I hope

392
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,461
we never see each other again.

393
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,549
Throw away the cameras.

394
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,635
Oh, right.

395
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,849
You already took off your ring.

396
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,186
When I saw the ring was missing
as you were being handcuffed,

397
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,228
I thought…

398
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,613
I was such a fool. Yes. I was so stupid.

399
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,239
You know what?

400
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,076
We promised not to take our rings off,

401
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,203
so I've been wearing mine, but…

402
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,750
I'm such an idiot.

403
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,547
I'll throw mine away, too.

404
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,161
<i>I tried to stop him as he left in a rage.</i>

405
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,665
<i>But there was nothing I could say to him.</i>

406
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,919
<i>Just in front of him,</i>

407
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,048
<i>I wanted to remain
as the dazzling girl Yoon Seon-a.</i>

408
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,385
<i>But Jae-won now found out</i>

409
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,472
<i>I'm not the girl he thought I was.</i>

410
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,215
Gosh. What is this?
Choi Kyeong-jun, that crazy jerk.

411
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,217
<i>Jae-won. I'm taking all the beers.</i>

412
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,802
Damn it.

413
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,346
<i>I'm taking all the liquor.</i>

414
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,265
That crazy jerk.

415
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,641
What is this?

416
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,227
<i>-Stop drinking. Forget about Yoon Seon-a.</i>
-Damn it!

417
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,943
Ta-da.

418
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,154
Where did you get all this rare liquor?

419
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,782
Well, does that matter?

420
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,994
You're right.
What matters is that it's free.

421
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,246
How much will you pay, Pushover?

422
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,790
Rin-i, you thought about selling it?

423
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,210
You're so smart.

424
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,712
No way. It's a limited edition.

425
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,797
How much? I'll buy everything.

426
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,216
Pushover.

427
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,092
Don't. I'll feel it.

428
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,011
<i>It wasn't just her name.
Everything felt strange,</i>

429
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,389
<i>from her head to her toe.</i>

430
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,985
Ra-ra, I'll go now!

431
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,297
You startled me.

432
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,884
What took you so long? I waited so long.

433
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,428
-Did you wait for me?
-Yes.

434
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,264
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

435
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,474
<i>Who was the girl I fell in love with?</i>

436
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,601
-What do you want to do?
-I don't know.

437
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,854
You always say that.

438
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,358
What?

439
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,152
-Do the dishes.
-What?

440
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,238
-If you lose.
-Hey. Wait up!

441
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,199
Wait up!

442
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,540
You're laughing?

443
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,001
Gosh. That must've hurt.

444
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,672
All right. Get up. I'll do the dishes.

445
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,383
-I don't want to get up.
-Why?

446
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,052
I want to roll back down.

447
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,851
What are you doing?

448
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,481
Fine. I'll roll with you.

449
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,711
<i>Who was that beautiful girl
who shone brightly?</i>

450
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,720
This, please.

451
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,017
-It's 30,000 won.
-Okay.

452
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,647
There are so many stars in the sky.

453
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,318
Seon-a, look at that.

454
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,822
Do you see that star
that's shining brightly?

455
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,448
Let's do it on the camper trailer.

456
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,867
What?

457
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,495
Let's do it here.

458
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,456
Here? You want to do it here?

459
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,541
Yes.

460
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,711
No way. We can't do it out here.

461
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,713
-I…
-Refuse if you can.

462
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,466
-Gosh. If you…
-Do you think you can refuse?

463
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,094
-Stop it. Seriously.
-I dare you.

464
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,138
-What if someone sees us?
-Say no.

465
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,765
Goodness.

466
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,309
Come here.

467
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,809
<i>I don't know who I fell in love with.</i>

468
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,577
Mr. Park must have been shocked.

469
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,828
I didn't see that coming.

470
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,497
Right.

471
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,791
-You know what?
-Yes?

472
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,959
Don't you think she had her reasons?

473
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,962
She didn't look like
a con artist or a thief.

474
00:29:59,005 --> 00:29:59,839
Right.

475
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,344
Anyway, when you handcuffed her,
I thought I was going to pass out.

476
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,221
What if they suspend us?

477
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,266
-Sir.
-Yes?

478
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,727
Isn't that Ms. Yoon?

479
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,324
What is she doing?

480
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,910
She's looking for something.

481
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,287
It was somewhere over here.

482
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,711
It came from there.

483
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,463
It must be here.

484
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:05,947
That must be it.

485
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,581
I found it!

486
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,421
I found it.
