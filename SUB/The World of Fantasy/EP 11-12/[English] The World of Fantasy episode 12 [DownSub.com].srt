[Episode 12]


4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,960
Gao Yu!


5
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,860
Gao Yu!


6
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,729
They said you flee before the battle.


7
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,210
What happened exactly?


8
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,900
The Lings weren't killed by
Horned Demon Race,


9
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,729
but Du Hai Tian instead.


10
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,520
What did you say?


11
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,520
Du Hai Tian used us


12
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,780
to bait Horned Demon Race,


13
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,300
and waited until both sides were injured


14
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,680
before he showed up
as a hero cleaning the mess.


15
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,770
I saw them checked on


16
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,250
every single Ling,


17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,170
Those barely alive


18
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,890
were given a final blow.


19
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,010
What were you doing then?


20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,300
Me?


21
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,329
In the beginning,


22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
I fought desperately too.


23
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,100
Then, I smelled something fishy


24
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,140
and hid away in chaos.


25
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,329
Qin Lie,


26
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,780
call me coward all you want.


27
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,940
But if I died too,


28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,100
no one would know the truth.


29
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,850
Why did he do that?


30
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,780
Du and Ling families
are already on bad terms.


31
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,210
Now,


32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,330
you're the great
Soul Reaping beast killer.


33
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,050
And during the war at Purple Mist Sea,


34
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,170
you became close with Saintess Song,


35
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,250
outshining his son.


36
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,730
These are the reasons why.


37
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,740
This must be revenged.


38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,740
That's for sure.


39
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,690
But with our current capabilities,


40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,660
we still can't go against Du Hai Tian.


41
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,130
Don't be reckless.


42
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,579
Stay back and handle the funeral.


43
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,890
I'll bring Yu Shi back from Qisha Valley.


44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,940
We'll make a plan then.


45
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,160
Comfort Yu Shi for me.


46
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,089
Brother Li!


47
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,130
Brother Li.


48
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,890
Yu Shi, someone from
Ling Borough came for you.


49
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,650
Where is he?


50
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,370
Gao Yu?


51
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,040
What brings you here?

[Xingyun Pavilion]


53
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,130
Master Yuan,


54
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,010
thanks for greeting me personally.


55
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,090
Du family has made a great contribution.


56
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,010
Of course I


57
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,780
should come and greet you myself.


58
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,730
Follow me.


59
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,570
Your son isn't with you?


60
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,130
I heard


61
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,780
Young Master Du was a great help


62
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,890
in the battle at Purple Mist Sea.


63
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,700
Even Master Mo Hai
of Artefact Forging Sect


64
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,700
speaks highly of him.


65
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,490
My son is quite capable,


66
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,260
but he's young and therefore, arrogant.


67
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,210
In the war with the evil tribe,


68
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,130
he actually made some mistakes.


69
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,450
I only scolded him a little,


70
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,980
but he decided to leave,


71
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,570
saying he's going on a travel
to gain experience.


72
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,320
His temperament


73
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,500
is definitely a joke to you.


74
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,380
It's okay.


75
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,850
Young people should get out there
to practise and see the world.


76
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,940
You're very decisive, Master Du,


77
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,720
like the way of great men.


78
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,850
While Young Master Du
is an outstanding young man


79
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,050
with great potential.


80
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
This war


81
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,330
cost us a lot.


82
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,530
And there are many things
to deal with after the war.


83
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,840
It's time to decide who will be


84
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,690
the real Master of Xingyun Pavilion.


85
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,650
I will do my best.


86
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,540
Regarding this,


87
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,780
I need to consider carefully.


88
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,730
Some things


89
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,610
just won't stop troubling me.


90
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,600
I


91
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,420
can share your problem.


92
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,290
Okay.


93
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,890
You've travelled far.


94
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,220
Take a good rest.


95
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,410
He's being hesitant


96
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,170
and acting mysterious.


97
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
Madam.


98
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,450
I heard your family is broken.


99
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,120
Who are you?


100
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,620
Who do you think I am?


101
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,690
The Terminator Profound Bomb
is not something ordinary.


102
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,300
Did you give it to me


103
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,370
intentionally or accidentally?


104
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,250
So what if it's


105
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,100
intentional or accidental?


106
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,760
Ever heard about Master Mo Hai?


107
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,000
He's a famous person.


108
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,450
He once said


109
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,050
that all magical weapons


110
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,250
must be paired with
suitable spiritual arrays.


111
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,300
You must know that.


112
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,500
Uncle Li,


113
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,210
please teach me.


114
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,540
You want to use the Terminator
Profound Bomb for killing purpose?


115
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,530
Yes.


116
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,730
Are you confident about that?


117
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,060
No.


118
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,930
Don't get yourself destroyed instead.


119
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,620
I can go down with him.


120
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,100
The second room inside is empty.


121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,420
You can stay here.


122
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,660
Thank you, Uncle Li.


123
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,490
Yu Shi.


124
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,570
Father.


125
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,170
I'm back.


126
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,620
Father.


127
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,800
I am back.


128
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,660
Where's Xuan Xuan?


129
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,990
She went to look for Yu Xin.


130
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,460
Don't worry.


131
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,980
She promised me


132
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,580
to return to Ling Borough


133
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,500
whether she found him or not.


134
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,990
But it'll be too late.


135
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,780
She even missed the chance
to look at Father one last time.


136
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,350
Where's Qin Lie?


137
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,550
He...


138
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,610
He left.


139
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,050
What?


140
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,460
Where did he go?


141
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,790
I have no idea.


142
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,050
He brought Chief and the others back,


143
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,780
and left a letter behind.


144
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,410
He was gone the next day.


145
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,670
[The war is an eye-opener to me.]

[The Artefact Forging Sect
is too good to miss. From Qin Lie]


147
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,170
What did Qin Lie say?


148
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,150
Your man just abandoned you?


149
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,350
What does it say?


150
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,900
It says


151
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,810
that the war at Purple Mist Sea


152
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,020
was eye-opening to him,


153
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,520
and that the Artefact Forging Sect
is too precious


154
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,050
to give up.


155
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,490
He'll be back
when he's achieved something.


156
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,060
What is this?


157
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,150
Even if he despises Ling Borough,


158
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,350
he should at least wait
until the bodies are buried


159
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,220
and Yu Shi comes back.


160
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,540
Ling Ying.


161
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,340
We know Qin Lie


162
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,050
better than anybody else.


163
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,490
-But he...
-You're too ruthless for him


164
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,540
that he chose to leave with Saintess Song.


165
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,540
You're abandoned.


166
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,170
Yu Shi.


167
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,980
Yu Shi.


168
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,050
Don't go after her.


169
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,580
She has enough men following her around.


170
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,180
I want to stay alone.


171
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,740
Please leave.


172
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,100
Are you sure you can stay calm?


173
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,900
Ling Yu Shi, mind you,


174
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,370
I don't like you.


175
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,380
I don't care.


176
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,220
Leave.


177
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,700
A woman's heart


178
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,780
will eventually get hurt because of a man.


179
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,780
Even when hurt,


180
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,540
you must remain strong.


181
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,850
Live on like usual.


182
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,700
Do what you're supposed to do.


183
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,700
After that,


184
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,250
you'll feel different.


185
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,490
Different, how?


186
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,300
Shutting yourself in your room


187
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,580
can't change the fact
that he's not coming back.


188
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,540
The dead ones don't matter,


189
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,730
but what about those who stayed alive?


190
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,370
Are you going to take them
and die along with the others?


191
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,980
Fine.


192
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,590
I got it.


193
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,290
I'll go.


194
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,500
Failed again?


195
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,770
Never mind. That's perfectly normal.


196
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Take your time.


197
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,750
Some things are harder to achieve
if you rush it.


198
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,940
Have a good rest


199
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,460
and think it over.


200
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,290
Maybe you can make it
when you change the way you think.


201
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,260
Thanks, Uncle Li.


202
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,690
I got it.


203
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,690
Okay.


204
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,380
May the deceased rest in peace.


205
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,510
And we should stay strong.


206
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,220
After we buried our family members,


207
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,500
will you come with me?


208
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,220
Where are we going?


209
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,180
There's a village


210
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,650
for the families of Qisha's disciples
outside the valley.


211
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,290
What are we going there for?


212
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,930
To be dependable to them?


213
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,810
We have to admit


214
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,380
that Ling Borough is gone.


215
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,890
It takes time


216
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,380
to decide where our future lies.


217
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,930
I must return there and cultivate


218
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,100
in order to cure my poison.


219
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,650
Will you revive Ling Borough


220
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,740
or go another path?


221
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,050
I'll go with you.


222
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,930
-I'll go with you too.
-Me too.


223
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,930
-We're going too.
-We'll go too.


224
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,500
Very well.


225
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,410
Tomorrow night


226
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,810
is the one day we'll see the moon
throughout the year.


227
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,460
It's been one year.


228
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,270
Even if things have changed,


229
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,580
we must never give up.


230
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,930
Tomorrow night,


231
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,890
entrust whatever wishes you have


232
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,810
to the moon,


233
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,140
Ask Her to witness our heart


234
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,130
and guide us out of the hardships.


235
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,700
-Okay.
-Okay.


236
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,260
What do you want?


237
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,340
Do you enjoy watching me sleep?


238
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,460
You did it?


239
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,740
Well yes, you made one.


240
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,340
But this Terminator Profound Bomb's power


241
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,170
is at a beginner's level.


242
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,700
If you're going to use it to fight,


243
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,340
make sure


244
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,700
to surprise and take your enemy down
with one blow.


245
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,350
If your first attempt fail,


246
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,620
the enemy will be prepared for it.


247
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,170
This will make it hard


248
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,220
for you to attack with it again.


249
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,010
Okay.


250
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,110
Master Du.


251
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,540
Is Master Yuan awake?


252
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,810
Yes.


253
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,130
But he's out.


254
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,170
How pretentious.


255
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,170
What is he trying to do?


256
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,410
Yes?


257
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,810
Someone gave the guard a letter.


258
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,100
It's for you.


259
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,470
[The evil tribe will come back.
Keep a low profile.]


260
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,410
[The evil tribe will come back.]


261
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,480
[Let's meet up at a restaurant
as the sun set.]


262
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,170
[Keep a low profile.]


263
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,860
[As the sun set today,]


264
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,530
[let's meet up
at a restaurant in the city.]


265
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,740
Du Hai Tian.


266
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,740
I'm challenging you.


267
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,460
So, the letter was from you.


268
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,260
For his own interest,


269
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,510
Du Hai Tian set up a trap


270
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
during the war at Purple Mist Sea
and killed the men of Ling Borough.


271
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,930
I, Qin Lie, am here today


272
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,110
to avenge my dead family!


273
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,650
A baseless accusation.


274
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,270
Our Ling brothers


275
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,860
died defending our land
and will go down history.


276
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,620
When you say that,


277
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,500
have you ever thought about them


278
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,130
or me?


279
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,940
You know what actually happened!


280
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,140
I'll say it again,


281
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,410
I'm challenging Acting Master Du.


282
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,780
Do you dare take it?


283
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,010
Is this kid out of his mind?


284
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,290
He's actually challenging Master Du,
the Manifestation Realm peak cultivator.


285
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,980
How reckless.


286
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,230
Fine.


287
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,810
I'll give you a chance.


288
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,050
The peak of Natal Opening Realm?


289
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,290
There is


290
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,260
a whole Realm difference between us.


291
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,890
It's not too late to feel regret.


292
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,010
You're overconfident.


293
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,460
I haven't lost.


294
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,290
You want to bring me down with you?


295
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,170
I'm experienced in fighting a war


296
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,130
and have seen all kinds of opponents.


297
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,010
Show me how long you can hold up.


298
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,140
I'm surprised


299
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,810
that you are still holding on.


300
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,410
However,


301
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,130
it feels really good to see


302
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,630
my enemy's life fade away


303
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,410
while he loses the ability to resist.
Do you know that?


304
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,100
I watched the Lings died


305
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,650
on the hill across.


306
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,620
One by one, Ling Cheng Ye and the others


307
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,820
were defeated and killed


308
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,740
-I'll kill you!
-by the Horned Demon Race,


309
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,340
and I was there watching.


310
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,890
A final attack before you die?


311
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,980
Let's end this here.


312
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,270
What? Du Hai Tian was killed by Qin Lie?


313
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,650
I heard Qin Lie blasted him to death
on the street.


314
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,770
Close all the city gates right away.


315
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,860
Send out all fighters in the Pavilion.


316
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,340
Kill Qin Lie


317
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,590
before dawn.


318
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,590
Yes, Master.


319
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,530
What?


320
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,590
He killed Du Hai Tian?


321
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,170
I've just received the news


322
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,780
that Xingyun Pavilion
has locked down the city.


323
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,520
Even Palace of Hell's commanders
outside the city


324
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,010
are put to work.


325
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,340
Qin Lie won't survive the night.


326
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,260
Should we tell the Lings?


327
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,810
Pretend you don't know about this.


328
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,420
We should avoid troubles.


329
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,460
Let's leave for Qisha Valley
tomorrow morning.


330
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,350
Is that true?


331
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,540
Rejoice.


332
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
Your man didn't abandon you.


333
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,980
He took revenge for you instead.


334
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,510
Where is he?


335
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,890
I told you everything I know.


336
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,740
It's up to you to decide what you'll do.


337
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,690
Remember,


338
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,290
Brother Li must not know


339
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,980
that I told you this.


340
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,510
[I'm too petty for them to care.]


341
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,040
[I'm going to the highest place where
they and I can see each other equally.]


342
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,530
Move. Move.


343
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Take a look there.


344
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,220
Let me see.


345
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,780
[Only the moon understands
my troubled mind.]


346
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,740
[Even if I have to live
the life of a fugitive,]


347
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,100
[please let me find Qin Lie]


348
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,130
[and stay by his side no matter what.]


349
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,940
[I'm too petty for them to care.]


350
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,690
[I'm going to the highest place where
they and I can see each other equally.]


351
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,410
What are you doing here?


352
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,700
Only the moon understands
my troubled mind.


353
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,700
My mind is troubled too.


354
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,290
He didn't write that letter.


355
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,410
It was you.


356
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,500
That's right.


357
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,620
Qin Lie


358
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,530
is a dead man now.


359
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,860
Why look for him?


360
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,820
How do you know he's wanted?


361
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,530
You fought alongside him
at the Purple Mist Sea.


362
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,220
How come he knows Du Hai Tian


363
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,180
caused my father's death


364
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,770
but you don't?


365
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,100
I was the only one who knew that.


366
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,350
Why didn't you let me know?


367
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,010
So that you won't be sad.


368
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,580
That's why you didn't tell me


369
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,810
Qin Lie went
to seek revenge on Du Hai Tian.


370
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,460
So that you won't be worried.


371
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
You knew he'd do that,


372
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,530
but you didn't go with him


373
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,050
or stop him.


374
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,890
You're sending him to his death.


375
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,980
Qin Lie didn't know that Du Hai Tian


376
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,410
was the culprit behind the Lings' death.


377
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,780
I was the one who told him that.


378
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,770
You want him to die.


379
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,260
Why?


380
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,530
Why?


381
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,220
That's because


382
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,620
my sister is dead because of him.


383
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,340
I want to get revenge.


384
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,010
Yeah.


385
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,170
I'm jealous of him.


386
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,530
Yeah.


387
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,810
I want you.


388
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
Yeah.


389
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,010
All of them are the reasons why!


390
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,290
Gao Yu,


391
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,350
it's not too late
to do the right thing now.


392
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,720
Let's look for Qin Lie.


393
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,900
Sure.


394
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,500
After we get married,


395
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,290
we'll collect his dead body together.


396
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,510
Gao Yu, don't you dare.


397
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,100
Gao Yu, no!


398
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,410
Kid.


399
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,020
Your love spell
is finally removed completely.


400
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,790
Uncle Liang,
thank you for what you've done.


401
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,130
Ting Yu,


402
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,220
something happened during the time


403
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,890
you retreat to recuperate.


404
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,780
Qin Lie killed Du Hai Tian.


405
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,020
Yuan Tian Ya gave an order to kill him.


406
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,060
Do you


407
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,090
want to save him?


408
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,170
The love spell is removed.


409
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,740
I'll be fine.


410
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,100
Okay.


411
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,130
Stay out of it, then.


412
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,370
No, I want to find out what's happening.


413
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
He has something I want.


414
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,060
It's done.


415
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,650
This kid is insane.


416
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,740
He's alive even after
losing that amount of blood.


417
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,230
And look at this.


418
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,740
This scar...


419
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,370
Logically, getting hurt here


420
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,460
means instant death.


421
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,130
But he actually lived till today.


422
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,890
That's a seal.


423
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,500
A seal?


424
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,130
That's some advanced stuff.


425
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,330
Such a remarkable kid.


426
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,930
Is he worth


427
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,330
our saving?


428
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,030
Back then,


429
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,850
I was saved by his grandpa.


430
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,060
It's only right


431
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,330
for me to save him.


432
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,220
Yes, it is.


433
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,060
It really is.


434
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,850
Commander, this is it.


435
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,220
We're closed.


436
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,570
No one is welcomed.


437
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,980
There are consequences if you barge in.


438
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,850
Master.


439
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,310
Go in.


440
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,950
[Shop]


441
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,260
Could it be the Master of Frost?


442
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,570
Master of Frost...


443
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,660
I'd like to meet her.


444
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,170
We'll leave when he is awake.


445
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,370
Even if you're the Master of Frost,


446
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,550
you should be able
to distinguish between right and wrong.


447
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,260
-This man...
-You want revenge for your subordinate?


448
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,850
Bring it on.


449
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,900
After all, killing a commander or a master


450
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,410
makes no difference.


451
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,740
Uncle Li.


452
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,850
You came to.


453
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,540
Uncle Li.


454
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,940
Cut the crap. Here.


455
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,300
Put this on and let's go.


456
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,090
I'll take ten steps.


457
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,540
Retreat or I'll attack.


458
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,990
Come on.


459
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,300
What are you looking at?


460
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,500
Tonight is the only day
throughout the year


461
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,610
we can see the moon in Ling Borough.


462
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,020
You call this moon?


463
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,060
Sleep already.
There's a long journey ahead tomorrow.


464
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,980
How could he be so brazen?


465
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,700
I'll kill him for you.


466
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,540
Never mind.


467
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,070
I'll kill him myself.


468
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,290
[Hua Tian Qiong]


469
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,780
What's so interesting about books?


470
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,890
Yet, my son loves reading.


471
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,300
You really regard Hua Yu Xin as your son?


472
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,420
[Gong Mu Shan]


473
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,580
One visit to Ling Borough,


474
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,460
and I ended up losing my wife and son.


475
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,460
Fortunately,


476
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,020
your grandson isn't dead.


477
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,410
He escaped death for many times.


478
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,540
That's because he's capable.


479
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,140
I was hoping that


480
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,260
you'd protect him.


481
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,850
Well, I'd better not.


482
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,220
Come on, there are saintesses,


483
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,740
masters and spirit beasts around.


484
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,790
I'm not needed.


485
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,700
But, I still helped.


486
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,260
As a result,


487
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,220
I lost my son.


488
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,650
Yi Yuan,
the Young Master of Purple Mist City,


489
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,090
He's honest and kind.


490
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,900
It's because of this


491
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,050
that I took out


492
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,700
[Yi Yuan]


493
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,650
the honest and kind part from him


494
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,330
and made Hua Yu Xin


495
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,380
to be your grandson's company.


496
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,370
This pity kid Yi Yuan


497
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,750
is missing one spiritual piece,


498
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,130
making him


499
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,060
a lifeless man.


500
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,460
You've had your fun.


501
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,820
Give it back to him.


502
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,750
Fine.


503
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,180
Listen,


504
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,760
I actually prefer Qin Lie.


505
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,890
As for Gong Mu Lie...


506
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,070
Whenever I make a joke,


507
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,850
he sneers at me,


508
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,790
and I don't know what to do with that,
you know?


509
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,500
In fact, the human tribe is more likeable.


510
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,090
That's because you're an old rascal.


511
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,060
Both my Lie'ers are great.


512
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,420
Is that true?
