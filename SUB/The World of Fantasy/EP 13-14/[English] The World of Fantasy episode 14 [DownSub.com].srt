[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,930
[Episode 14]


4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,780
You'll stay here from now on.


5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,340
Choose your rooms.


6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,710
Senior Lian Rou,


7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,670
you really don't remember me?


8
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,980
Shao Yang.


9
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,540
What can I do for you?


10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,300
We'll be fellow disciples from now on.


11
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,020
Do you remember


12
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,680
our senior, Zhu Xin?


13
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,270
And senior Zhang Ying.


14
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
I do.


15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,500
I heard they joined the
Artefact Forging Sect last year.


16
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,910
Just now, Senior Lian Rou


17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,050
arranged a meet and greet
with the brethren.


18
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,340
When the two seniors heard
you were coming,


19
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,780
they were overjoyed.


20
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,860
They said the Old Master
was your benefactor.


21
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,670
They suggested a secret gathering


22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,910
at the training ground
once we've settled in.


23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,579
To acquaint us with the sect's


24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,270
written and unwritten rules.


25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,660
So that we can all


26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,770
help each other out


27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,700
by way of repaying
the Old Master's kindness.


28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,670
A new initiate


29
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,780
having a secret rendezvous
with a senior.


30
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,260
Isn't it inappropriate?


31
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,190
Where else do you propose?


32
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,750
In the great hall?


33
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,060
Shall we reveal each other's
identities, then?


34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,700
So you are Xie Jing Xuan?


35
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,620
Isn't it obvious?


36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
The Xie Jing Xuan I knew


37
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,540
was the saintess of the
Eight Extremes Temple,


38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,850
leader of the human race
against the Dark Nether Race.


39
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,420
I am still a saintess now,


40
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,780
in the hearts of the men
of the Artefact Forging Sect.


41
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,060
If the Eight Extremes people find out


42
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,060
their saintess is still alive,


43
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,860
you can forget about being the saintess


44
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,140
of the Artefact Forging Sect.


45
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,910
If the people of the Palace of Hell


46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,579
find out you're here,


47
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,060
you'll be the one
who's going to die,


48
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,950
not me.


49
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,620
You know a lot about me,


50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,910
yet I know nothing about you.


51
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,150
How do I know


52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,340
this isn't one of you
and Song Ting Yu's schemes?


53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,330
Looks like that stupid girl
hasn't captured you,


54
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,500
though you're far from being
free from her grasp.


55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,140
If you want to know,


56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,940
you can always ask me.


57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,110
I might tell you
if I'm in a good mood.


58
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,390
Why did you fake your own death?


59
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,620
Because I don't want to be the saintess
of the Eight Extremes Temple anymore.


60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,080
I suppose you've been living as Tang Si Qi
for quite a while now?


61
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,210
When I was still Xie Jing Xuan,


62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,470
Tang Si Qi


63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,270
was my alias when I wanted to have fun.


64
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,490
Then


65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,460
we have an understanding.


66
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,830
We'll keep each other's
identity a secret.


67
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,590
One more thing.


68
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,550
You've killed Du Shao Yang's father.


69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,980
Are you going to kill him, too?


70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,020
If Du Hai Tian has set a trap,


71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,340
how can his son not be an accomplice?


72
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,670
If he's an accomplice,


73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,710
why would Du Hai Tian turn against
his own blood?


74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,620
Where are seniors Zhu Xin and Zhang Ying?


75
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,270
Zhu Xin here.


76
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,460
Zhang Ying here.


77
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,890
Shao Yang,


78
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,990
[Zhu Xin, Zhang Ying]


79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,740
long time no see.


80
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,390
Zhang Ying, you're a
Bloody Spear Guard now?


81
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,270
Zhang Ying's talent knows no bounds.


82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,700
He's mastered both armoury
and the Bloody Spear.


83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,659
Back when your father was the chief
of Xingyun Pavilion,


84
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,740
he took you on his travels.


85
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,020
You were only 12 when you came
to my family,


86
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,020
yet you'd already reached the
Natal Opening Realm.


87
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,900
Your father wouldn't stop
boasting about it.


88
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,420
As a result, I was locked up for ten years


89
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,100
before I reached the Natal Opening Realm.


90
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,050
It's time to settle the score.


91
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,050
You're blaming me for that?


92
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,670
What Zhang Ying means is,


93
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,330
since the Old Master isn't around anymore,


94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,900
there's no need
to keep you around, either.


95
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,390
Cast him into the cauldron


96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,960
and forge an artefact out of him.


97
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,050
Yes.


98
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,060
Stop!


99
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,320
You can't do this.


100
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,400
Silence the witness.


101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,430
Yi Yuan, run.


102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,730
Yi Yuan, run!


103
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,620
Trying to escape?


104
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,860
Qin Bing.


105
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,710
Stop looking, I'm down here.


106
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,140
It's me, Yi Yuan.


107
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,300
Yi Yuan?


108
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,950
How did you become like this?


109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,420
I have no time to explain.


110
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,740
You must save Du Shao Yang.


111
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,230
Ouyang Qing and the gang
are trying to kill him.


112
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,180
-Where?
-The armoury hall.


113
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,460
Okay.


114
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,140
Get the seniors.


115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,060
-Senior Si Qi or Senior Lian Rou?
-Both.


116
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,860
Why don't you show us your real face?


117
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,220
You pretend to be kind and righteous


118
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,300
when in fact you're ruthless and cruel,


119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,950
and you expect me to show my face?


120
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,110
Enough talk!


121
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,830
Halt.


122
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,860
Senior Si Qi, Senior Lian Rou,


123
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,980
I can explain.


124
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,740
What's there to explain?


125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,060
Zhang Ying, Zhu Xin,


126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,170
report to Elder Bi
in the Hall of Punishment.


127
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,110
You'll have your titles revoked
and your natal palaces stripped.


128
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,580
You'll relinquish your Bloody Spear


129
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,140
and be imprisoned


130
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,900
in Firetop Mountain for ten years.


131
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,270
This is Pang Feng and Ouyang Qing's
first offence.


132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,060
Take them away and give them
2000 strokes each.


133
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,450
Senior Lian Rou, have mercy.


134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,710
Without our natal palaces,


135
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,740
we're no more than outlanders.


136
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,860
Senior Lian Rou,


137
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,860
I know you're a kind lady.


138
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,620
You fools. I was lying about that.


139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,900
Senior Lian Rou is as cold and impartial
as they come.


140
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,220
Take them away.


141
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,710
If anyone resists, kill him.


142
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,940
Thank you, seniors.


143
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,910
Lian Rou, let's go.


144
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,900
Master Mo Hai.


145
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,620
-Master Mo Hai.
-Master Mo Hai.


146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,730
I need to speak with them.


147
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,860
Leave us.


148
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,110
Yes.


149
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,270
Since our parting at the Purple Mist Sea,


150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,910
I can hardly recognise you now.


151
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,190
Qin Lie.


152
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,510
Yes, master.


153
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,540
-Du Shao Yang.
-Yes, master.


154
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,860
You two have a blood feud.


155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,470
If you must settle it,


156
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,730
please do so outside.


157
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,300
Why did you save me?


158
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,500
My father killed the Ling family.


159
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,310
Not even one life could compensate for it.


160
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,440
Shouldn't you kill me?


161
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,900
Or do you want to keep me alive


162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,470
and watch me devolve into a homeless dog?


163
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,470
Senior Si Qi told me everything.


164
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,420
You tried to save Ling Borough.


165
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,860
An act which I still regret.


166
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,500
If the Ling family
were completely wiped out,


167
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,730
you wouldn't have known the truth.


168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,060
And my father


169
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,100
wouldn't have died.


170
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,470
So why didn't you expose my true identity?


171
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,140
The Palace of Hell is searching
high and low for me.


172
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,380
I didn't do it out of mercy.


173
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,580
I wanted an opponent.


174
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,660
Call it an opponent


175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,650
or an enemy.


176
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,710
We will battle one day.


177
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,140
Master Mo Hai has spoken.


178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,280
Our feud cannot be settled here.


179
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,770
Once you and I leave the
Artefact Forging Sect,


180
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,150
we'll have our final battle.


181
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,370
I look forward to it.


182
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,350
So


183
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,340
you're now a senior
at the Artefact Forging Sect?


184
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,940
When I was a barmaid,


185
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,230
you were the young master
of Xingyun Pavilion.


186
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,620
I was your damsel.


187
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,030
A dainty girl who stood behind you


188
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,180
and needed your protection.


189
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,980
But now, I'm a senior.


190
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,460
One who no longer stands behind you


191
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,390
or needs your protection.


192
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,030
Do you feel discontented?


193
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,980
I'm no longer the young master
of Xingyun Pavilion either.


194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,620
What does that have to do with us?


195
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,910
I've become a homeless dog.


196
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,530
What does that have to do with us?


197
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,700
But you're the celebrated senior
of the Artefact Forging Sect.


198
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,460
What does that have to do with us?


199
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,270
You're still you.


200
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,290
And I'm still me.


201
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,180
There are too many things
on my mind.


202
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,740
I thought


203
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,850
you'd miss me in my absence.


204
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,610
Besotted, even.


205
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,100
Was it all just my imagination, then?


206
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,910
Take back the earring.


207
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm a man.


208
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,350
I shouldn't wear women's things.


209
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,950
But I like it.


210
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,500
Du Shao Yang, you told me


211
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,070
if we ever meet again,


212
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,710
you wouldn't let me go.


213
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,980
Are you eating your words now?


214
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,950
I'm not going to let you.


215
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,630
But don't worry.


216
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,230
I'll give you ample time to come
to your senses.


217
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,980
What do I mean


218
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,790
to you?


219
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,620
That hurts.


220
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,490
Qi Bing.


221
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,980
I say,


222
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,420
there's something odd about
your gaze today.


223
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,060
You can't even dress a wound.


224
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,300
Yet when there was trouble,


225
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,060
you jumped right into the fight.


226
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,780
How did you survive all these years?


227
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,790
Easy there.


228
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,610
I had a good friend


229
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,300
just like you.


230
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,140
To everyone,


231
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,710
he was sincere,


232
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,620
loyal


233
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,390
and pure of heart.


234
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,290
You remind me


235
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,150
a lot of him.


236
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,020
Then why didn't you bring him along?


237
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,780
He's dead.


238
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,230
Sorry.


239
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,340
How did you


240
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,270
turn into a snake just now?


241
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,830
A few years ago,


242
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,970
Senior Lian Rou came to Purple Mist Sea
to forage for herbs.


243
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,730
I was the one who received her.


244
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,020
At that time, everyone looked down on me


245
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,980
except her.


246
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,390
She was kind to me.


247
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,850
I'm asking you about
the snake transformation.


248
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,860
I am talking about that.


249
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,900
After that, I'd been wanting
to see her again.


250
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,420
But I had no real abilities.


251
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,090
I would spend my time
playing in the jungle.


252
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,340
I became friends with the snakes


253
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,700
and the spiders there.


254
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,180
What does that have to do
with turning into a snake?


255
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,830
Then it hit me.


256
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,390
What if I could come up
with a magical item


257
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,470
that could turn myself into a
little snake or a little spider


258
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,150
and make Senior Lian Rou happy?


259
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,100
That would make a girl happy?


260
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,900
Of course.


261
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,650
This mirror


262
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,380
was forged from the bodies
of countless little snakes.


263
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,060
You just need to chant to the mirror,


264
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,710
"I want to become a snake."


265
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,820
-Try it.
-No way.


266
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,670
What if I can't turn back?


267
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,250
Of course you will.


268
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,120
But you have to wait.


269
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,980
As for how long, I have no idea.


270
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,550
And you still dare to mess with it?


271
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,490
Dumb people have all the dumb luck.


272
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,350
Just now, when you turned into a snake,


273
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,620
was Senior Lian Rou happy or scared?


274
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,180
When she saw me,


275
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,490
I had already turned back.


276
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,020
You're always like that.


277
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,640
It's as if no hardship


278
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,980
or trouble in the world
could get you down.


279
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,900
But of course.


280
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,700
In my world,


281
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,910
no hardship or trouble is insurmountable.


282
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,660
If you have any troubles,
come to me.


283
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,360
We'll pull through together.


284
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,750
What's with that gaze again?


285
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,700
I like women. I like Senior Lian Rou.


286
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,869
Knock it off, Qin Bing.


287
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,119
Qin Bing, stop...


288
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,110
Qin Lie is in trouble.


289
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,340
As all of you must well be aware,


290
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,300
[Artefact Forging Sect, Great Hall]


291
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,860
the Secret Realm is upon us.


292
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,230
What is this Secret Realm?


293
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,660
Where does it come from?


294
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,950
Legend has it, in the High Rank Continent,


295
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,950
there was a mysterious figure


296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,060
who unlocked the Secret Realm
at the foot of Firetop Mountain.


297
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,980
He invited all the young, promising talent


298
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,780
to train there.


299
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,380
The realm is filled with all sorts
of spirit ingredients


300
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,940
and spirit beasts.


301
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,010
All for the capable's taking.


302
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,300
And for the truly exceptional,


303
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
it holds unimaginable rewards.


304
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
Of course, the greater the reward,


305
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,540
the greater the risk.


306
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,950
To survive and reap the spoils,


307
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,890
you need skills,


308
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,330
intelligence and courage.


309
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,320
And most importantly,


310
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,590
teamwork.


311
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,200
But how are we supposed


312
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,430
to bring all the treasures


313
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
back from the Secret Realm?


314
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,260
Other sects may have problems,


315
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,820
but not the Artefact Forging Sect.


316
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,660
You can take as many as you wish.


317
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,240
Later, you will proceed


318
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,520
to the storeroom


319
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,190
and retrieve a Ring of Space each.


320
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Du Shao Yang,


321
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,820
come with me.


322
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,870
Yes.


323
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,920
The rest of you, follow me.


324
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,090
You want to join the Bloody Spear?


325
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,700
That's right.


326
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,760
Then you must've heard of


327
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,190
the name, Feng Rong.


328
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,560
Have I ever.


329
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,010
Feng Rong is your wife, master.


330
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,230
As well as the number two person
in the Bloody Spear.


331
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,830
She's famous throughout


332
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,230
the continent of Chilan.


333
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,470
Would you like to meet her?


334
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,360
You're in luck today.


335
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,470
Rong'er.


336
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,100
-Come, give me a hand.
-Is the meat ready?


337
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,360
It's ready.


338
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,890
If you don't mind.


339
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,220
Try this.


340
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,030
-How is it?
-Delicious.


341
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,350
Why is your face dirty?


342
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,580
It is?


343
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,550
I'm sweltering.


344
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,010
Alright.


345
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,560
Don't just stand there.


346
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,750
I heard


347
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,440
you wish to join the Bloody Spear Guard?


348
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,650
It takes eight to ten years


349
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,530
to become an accomplished armourer.


350
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,380
But the Bloody Spear Guard is different.


351
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,450
I want to advance as quickly as possible.


352
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,730
No one has dared to cross the
Artefact Forging Sect in all these years


353
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,530
thanks to the Bloody Spear Guard.


354
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,780
You're pretty keen-sighted.


355
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,300
Are you done yet?


356
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,300
-Yes.
-Here.


357
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,690
It's not cooked. Grill it some more.


358
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,690
-What will do you without me?
-Nothing.


359
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,040
I wish to become a leader
in the Bloody Spear.


360
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,830
That's very ambitious.


361
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,220
But I wonder


362
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,180
if you have what it takes.


363
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,870
Try-outs for the Bloody Spear are over.


364
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,760
But I can give you a chance.


365
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,060
If you could acquire the blood


366
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,020
of the Huanyu Beast in the Secret Realm,


367
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll make an exception and take you in.


368
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,250
Huanyu Beast?


369
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,420
Yes, Huanyu Beast.


370
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,010
No one has even seen it.


371
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,710
And no one knows


372
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,340
when it'll show up.


373
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,590
Last time it appeared


374
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,250
was over 100 years ago.


375
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,420
-Is it tasty?
-Very tasty.


376
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,980
That means I need luck on my side.


377
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,900
If you get to see it,


378
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,700
I wouldn't call it good luck.


379
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,380
Why?


380
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,170
You'll know when the time comes.


381
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,060
Master Mo, Saintess Song of the Profound
Heaven Alliance would like to see you.


382
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,300
Little Ting Yu.


383
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,070
Master Mo Hai, we meet again.


384
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,150
Ting Yu.


385
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,960
I've brought this year's spirit
ingredients on Liang Zhong's behalf.


386
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,330
The Profound Heaven Alliance


387
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,050
is counting on you
for the magical weapons.


388
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,980
Master.


389
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,860
You are Qin...


390
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,540
Let me introduce. His name is


391
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,330
Qin Bing.


392
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,370
Qin Bing?


393
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,990
Greetings, Saintess Song.


394
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,710
Thank you, master.


395
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,310
All the brethrens are here


396
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,490
except for the Shadow Tower people.


397
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,590
The Shadow Tower people
are mercenaries.


398
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,760
So long as you have the stone coins,


399
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,510
they'd kill anyone.


400
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,150
Why would the disciples


401
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,560
of such a faction


402
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,090
show their faces in broad daylight?


403
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,760
Senior Lian Rou?


404
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,470
What brings you here?


405
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,180
I'm here to forage for spirit herbs.


406
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,850
Right.


407
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,320
It's shady and cool over there.


408
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,100
Come, come.


409
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,480
Why don't you capture me?


410
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,530
My target is Qin Lie.


411
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,990
Not Qin Bing.


412
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,750
A party in Qisha Valley?


413
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,050
Meeting with an old flame, I see.


414
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,950
No wonder you begged Master


415
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,300
to let you come here.


416
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,360
Feel cooler now?


417
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,300
Yu Xin.


418
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,870
Look, the Secret Realm has opened.


419
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,490
It's open.


420
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,090
People.


421
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,060
Danger lurks everywhere
in the Secret Realm.


422
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,080
Why don't we team up?


423
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,740
Do you guys know which spirit beast


424
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,310
in the Secret Realm is the rarest
and most valuable?


425
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,090
It's the Huanyu Beast.


426
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,260
You're quite knowledgeable.


427
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,530
Once you get to know me better,
you'll realise


428
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,370
that I know far more than you imagined.


429
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,290
Then do you know where to find
the Huanyu Beast?


430
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,250
Funny you should ask. I happen
to know exactly where it is.


431
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,250
Follow me.


432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,130
Wait for me.


433
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,300
Yu Shi, it's dangerous ahead.


434
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,870
Follow me closely.


435
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,590
Young Master Yuan Xiao,


436
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,860
we're there.


437
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,690
You may alight.


438
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,880
[Yuan Xiao, Young Master
of the Palace of Hell]


439
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,990
Just keep driving.


440
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,830
I'm afraid


441
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,630
it'd be dangerous.


442
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,170
When Di Shi Jiu appointed you
as my personal guard,


443
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,650
I thought you had something special.


444
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,340
Turns out you're just
as cowardly as any.


445
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,420
I'm not afraid.


446
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,770
Why should you be?


447
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,380
Go.


448
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,310
All high-level spirit beasts


449
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,160
have their own territories


450
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,270
on which


451
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,830
no other beast can set foot.


452
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,920
Look.


453
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,530
Although the mud here is moist,


454
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,880
there are no spirit beast tracks.


455
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,310
And there is not a sound of bird
for tens of li.


456
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,770
If you ask me,


457
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,800
the Huanyu Beast must be nearby.


458
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,760
We haven't heard a chirp since
we entered the realm.


459
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,990
It's not only here.


460
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
Besides, the mud is wet


461
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,770
everywhere in the forest, not just here.


462
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,680
I was collecting herbs along the way


463
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,310
and noticed the flora was undisturbed.


464
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,310
It didn't seem like a beast had walked by.


465
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,480
It means


466
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,390
there may very well be


467
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
a high-level spirit beast.


468
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,280
That's right, Lian Rou.


469
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,760
I noticed the same thing, too.


470
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,040
It proves my assumptions are correct.


471
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,080
Enough.


472
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,990
Where should we go now?


473
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,840
This way.


474
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,230
Qin Bing, let's go.


475
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,990
You have no idea
where the Huanyu Beast is.


476
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,990
And you're scared to the bone.


477
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,400
You just want company,


478
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,810
don't you?


479
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
Don't expose me. We're friends.


480
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,530
Let's go.


481
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,990
Qin Lie!


482
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,680
Ling Borough is in trouble.


483
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,520
Qin Lie, where are you going?


484
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,330
Father,


485
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,440
a group of Horned Demons are heading
to the herb patch.


486
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,470
I'll bring a troop
to escort the Ling family.


487
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,950
What's the hurry?


488
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,950
Let's wait until the Ling family
is completely wiped out.


489
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,690
Someone has to pay


490
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,950
for Huang'er's death.


491
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,470
Father, you can't.


492
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,200
Qin Lie will kill you.


493
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,720
Him?


494
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,880
Kill me?


495
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm serious.


496
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,560
He will kill you!


497
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,720
Qin Lie.


498
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,520
Qin Lie.


499
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,080
Is that you, Qin Lie?


500
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,410
Qin Lie!


501
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,360
Qin Lie, where are you?


502
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,920
Not good.


503
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,470
Ling Borough is in trouble.


504
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Eat something hot.


505
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,480
It'll keep you warm.


506
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,070
So it's not all purple.


507
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,190
What?


508
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,710
Growing up in the Purple Mist Sea,


509
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,470
everything I ever saw


510
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,950
was purple.


511
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,800
But you showed me


512
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,190
that there are other colours
in this world.


513
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,310
Who are you?


514
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,260
Yi Yuan.


515
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,750
Young Master of Purple Mist City. And you?


516
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,970
Lian Rou, from the Artefact Forging Sect.


517
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,170
You're a senior
at the Artefact Forging Sect now?


518
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,040
Father specifically told me


519
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,830
to be your guide.


520
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,360
I'll take care of your food and lodging


521
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,590
for the next few days.


522
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
Your protection


523
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
is my responsibility, too.


524
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,640
Wherever you go,


525
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,400
I'll follow you.


526
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,240
Uncle Ling!


527
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,470
Retreat!


528
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,200
This is all a trap by Du Hai Tian.


529
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,920
The reinforcements will never come.


530
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,400
Qin Lie.


531
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,950
Qin Lie.


532
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,400
Gong Mu Lie.


533
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,950
Stay away from that woman.


534
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,920
Are you alright?


535
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,120
So it's you.


536
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,070
You want to kill me?


537
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,600
It's the only way to save my father.


538
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,310
Not if I kill you first.


539
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,280
I'm still alive after falling
from such heights?


540
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,200
Lian Rou, are you okay?


541
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,470
I'm fine.


542
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,600
Yi Yuan.


543
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,880
You know who I am?


544
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,270
It's me, Qin Bing.


545
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,480
Qin Bing?


546
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,880
Senior Lian Rou, it's me.


547
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,310
You are...


548
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,360
What are you people doing here?


549
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,690
Why is everyone injured?


550
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,480
We're battling the Horned Demon Race.


551
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,639
Where are they?


552
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,790
What nonsense is this?


553
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,239
The Purple Mist Sea hasn't fought
the Dark Nether Race in ages.


554
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,290
With me manning the fort,


555
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,639
what war could there be?


556
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,040
This isn't real.


557
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,400
None of this is real.


558
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,750
What's going on?


559
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,750
Saintess.


560
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,750
Are you alright?


561
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,400
If I'm not mistaken,


562
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,450
we're already in the belly
of the Huanyu Beast.


563
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,000
The Huanyu Beast isn't vicious by nature.


564
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,510
But to protect itself,


565
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,220
it would swallow its victims
into its belly.


566
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,720
Whoever's inside will face
their inner demons


567
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,240
and be trapped.


568
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:53,490
And if they die or get injured
in their hallucination,


569
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,250
so will their real selves.


570
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,750
Everyone's inner demon is different,


571
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,480
so the illusions will be different.


572
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,510
I often think,


573
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,310
if only I had tried to save my father


574
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,830
back in Purple Mist Sea.


575
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,320
Even if I failed,


576
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,030
I would die with him.


577
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,880
At least


578
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,750
I would see him one last time.


579
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,270
That's why I was transported
to Purple Mist Sea.


580
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,480
Me too.


581
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,350
How I wish I could've saved them.


582
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,070
And you.


583
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,310
You probably wish to end me,


584
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,210
so that I couldn't kill your father.


585
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,000
What is all this talk about killing?


586
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,530
Why was the Purple Mist Sea
that Senior Lian Rou and I saw


587
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,250
so calm and serene?


588
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,160
Unlike yours.


589
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,550
Perhaps you aren't thinking


590
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,080
of that battle,


591
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,880
but something else.


592
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,510
It's just that the place is the same.


593
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,350
Nevertheless, we're all in
the Purple Mist Sea's illusion.


594
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,210
Our inner demons, our deepest desires,


595
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,610
be it to kill, to hate,


596
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,380
to fight the Dark Nether Race,


597
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,770
or to pursue happiness,


598
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,440
are linked to that purple place.


599
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,300
If I hadn't tried to kill you


600
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,250
and forced you to use your thunder powers,


601
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,380
hurting the Huanyu Beast,


602
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,980
I'm afraid


603
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,170
we may never wake up.


604
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,640
I tried to invoke Thunderbolt.


605
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,270
[But to no avail.]


606
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,200
[Then I began to suspect]


607
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,510
if it was reality.


608
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,730
Let's get out of here, then.


609
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,790
We can't.


610
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,160
We're still in the Huanyu Beast's belly.


611
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,310
Listen.


612
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,940
Why don't we collect its blood
while we're at it?


613
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,310
That's right.


614
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,280
What a huge beast.


615
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,830
It nearly covered the whole sky
with half its body.


616
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,560
Yuan Xiao?


617
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,200
Has the Young Master of the Palace of Hell


618
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,600
come to the Secret Realm
for a treasure hunt, too?


619
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,830
I expected Senior Lian Rou
to come for the herbs.


620
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,490
But Saintess Song?


621
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,000
We lucked out and met the Huanyu Beast


622
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,800
and collected so much blood.


623
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,370
Is that so?


624
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,570
Since you made such a big haul,


625
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,280
you wouldn't mind sharing some
with me, would you?


626
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,490
We're leaving. Step aside.


627
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,980
You've killed Yuan Xiao!
