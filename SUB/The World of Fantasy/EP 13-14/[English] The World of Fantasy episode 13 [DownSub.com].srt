[Peak of the glacier]


5
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,730
What is this place?


6
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,740
Take a good look at the surroundings.


7
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,610
This is the Ice Peak
of the Frost Mountains.


8
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,370
Before the frost came,


9
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,970
this was a vast and lush forest.


10
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,140
It was home to many spirit beasts
in the past.


11
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,610
According to legend,


12
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,450
someone made an imprint in the void.


13
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,250
That's how the Frost Mountains came to be.


14
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,250
This palm imprint descended from the void,


15
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,060
stretching over hundreds of miles,


16
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,140
and as deep as thousands of metres.


17
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,800
The chill dissipated,


18
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,710
causing all the spirit beasts
to be frozen.


19
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,580
It sealed the world in ice.


20
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,660
The power of the palm
destroyed everything.


21
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,700
The essence of frost it embodies


22
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,220
has remained unchanged.


23
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,579
It has been hiding away
in this land of frost,


24
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,730
flourishing.


25
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,730
Whether or not you can grasp
the essence of frost


26
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,730
depends on your good fortune.


27
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,610
I'll give you three months' time.


28
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,610
We will come back after three months.


29
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,970
But,


30
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,660
how can I comprehend the essence of frost?


31
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,170
Let us go.


32
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,810

[Di Shi Jiu, Master of Shadow Tower]


40
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,090

41
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,970
Speak! Who are you?


42
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,860
We have no past history,


43
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,740
but you had wanted to kill me.


44
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,760
Nevertheless, your evil aura


45
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,370
and ruthlessness


46
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,370
deserve my admiration.


47
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,380
I don't care for your admiration!


48
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,770
Kid,


49
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,860

Di Shi Jiu.


53
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,490
Look! I caught a huge fish!


54
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,230
It was about to bite


55
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,490
but you scared it off.


56
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,120
Look at your awesome skills!


57
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,740
You caught a huge fish.


58
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,370
What would you like to eat?


59
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,930
I'll go foraging at the hill.


60
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,020
The hill?


61
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,620
When did you grow vegetables
at the hill?


62
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,090
I made it of course.


63
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,960
Sure.


64
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,650
You created the whole Chilan Continent.


65
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
You dare make fun of me?


66
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,550
Don't you hit me.


67
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,970
I'm still recovering.


68
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,740
You've recovered long ago.


69
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm going to hit you!


70
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,340
Get over here!


71
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,050
Time to eat.


72
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,060
The cook of Purple Mist Sea
is quite skilled.


73
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,810
You say that all the time.


74
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,560
Don't you have any other comments?


75
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,250
Sure.


76
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,490
The cook of Purple Mist Sea


77
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,580
is awesome!


78
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,420
So we're close now, huh?


79
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,140
So close that you keep teasing me.


80
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,370
Close or not,


81
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,580
I'll still keep teasing you.


82
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,140
So domineering.


83
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,580
I like it.


84
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,370
Let's eat.


85
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,900
What's the matter?


86
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Are you


87
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,620
hiding something from me?


88
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,980
How did you know?


89
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,220
You brought me here


90
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,100
and we've lived together for three months.


91
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,340
I can't say for sure when it started,


92
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,850
but I noticed a subtle shift
in your demeanour.


93
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,350
I think


94
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,110
I might have taken a liking to you.


95
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,930
Didn't you like me before?


96
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,730
Or could you have fallen for me?


97
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,780
Perhaps.


98
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,580
That's why I could feel


99
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,340
that you're hiding something from me.


100
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,550
The reason I didn't tell you


101
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,090
is because you were badly injured.


102
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,880
I didn't want to agitate you.


103
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,410
Shao Yang.


104
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,580
Your father has died.


105
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,330
What?


106
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,470
At the battle of the Purple Mist Sea,


107
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,700
your father supposedly had killed
many Ling members.


108
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,220
In order to avenge the deaths,


109
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,020
Qin Lie had challenged him


110
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,780
and killed him.


111
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,980
How was he able to kill my father?


112
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,810
Many people saw it.


113
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,980
The Palace of Hell has given order
to arrest Qin Lie.


114
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,140
But they haven't found him.


115
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,780
The essence of frost is almost all gone.


116
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,340
I can't believe it.


117
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,280
The boy actually did it.


118
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,340
The essence of frost is disappearing,


119
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,730
dissipating within Qin Lie's body.


120
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,110
Comprehending the essence of frost
is not unusual.


121
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,660
But being able to completely consume
and exhaust it


122
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,900
is extraordinary.


123
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,660
Back then,


124
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,730
Qin Lie's grandpa, Mr Qin Shan,


125
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,780
had trained on
the summit of the snowfield.


126
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,780
I saw how he displayed
the Law of Five Elements.


127
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,370
The five elements of metal,
wood, water, fire, earth.


128
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,610
He was able to implement them at will.


129
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,010
I had thought


130
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,340
it was because Mr Qin Shan was gifted.


131
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,900
Now I realise


132
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,580
that members of the Qin family


133
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,050
are born with innate synergy
to the five elements' spirit wells.


134
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,050
Perhaps the essence of frost


135
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,810
had been consumed by the spirit well
in his body.


136
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,380
Uncle Li.


137
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,540
The essence of frost has disappeared


138
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,490
whereas you seem to have
undergone a change in temperament,


139
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,370
as if you're a different person now.


140
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,140
Boy,


141
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,590
your level has improved.


142
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
It's only getting from
late stage Natal Opening


143
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,340
to Manifestation Realm.


144
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,170
There's still a long way to go
before I master it.


145
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,100
Uncle Li.


146
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,980
The essence of frost


147
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,490
created an image in my head.


148
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,540
It looked to be a Spirit Diagram.


149
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,540
You comprehended the essence of frost
as a Spirit Diagram?


150
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,250
Looks like you've got quite
a lot of hidden secrets.


151
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,020
Secrets?


152
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,100
This is the Eye of Frost.


153
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,850
With it,


154
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,930
you can go to any corner
of the vast world.


155
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,900
It's the key to entering Crystal World.


156
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,410
In future, you can use the Eye of Frost


157
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,220
to come here as you wish


158
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,610
in order to further master


159
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,930
your comprehension
of the essence of frost.


160
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,180
Keep the key safe.


161
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,580
No one will open the door for you
if you lose it.


162
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,490
Are you


163
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,340
going to leave?


164
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,050
Your grandpa had helped me.


165
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,540
Saving you is my way of repaying him.


166
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,930
You knew my grandpa?


167
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,300
[Qin Shan]


168
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,370
[Why did he come here?]


169
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,290
He was headed deep into
the Land of Frost.


170
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,810
And I have been guarding
this entrance all this while.


171
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,170
He beat me


172
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,610
and successfully entered
the Land of Frost.


173
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,540
It seemed as if he was in search
of something.


174
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,870
In the end, however,


175
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,780
he did not find anything.


176
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,930
What was it that Grandpa was looking for?


177
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,980
Nobody knows.


178
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,540
He only gave a few pointers
on my cultivation


179
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,260
before swiftly leaving.


180
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,910
He never came back.


181
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,510
I'm deeply grateful to him.


182
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,050
That's why I brought you here


183
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,100
to learn the essence of frost.


184
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,850
Do you know that


185
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,700
the elites in the middle stage
of Golden Class


186
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,970
have each grasped one,


187
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,490
at least one type
of spiritual power source.


188
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,370
The essence of frost


189
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,100
happens to be your source.


190
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,110
Also, the Spirit Diagram you saw


191
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,340
contains the ways of heaven and earth.


192
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,740
It's remarkable.


193
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,410
Pay extra attention in figuring it out.


194
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,410
If it's meant to be,


195
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,930
you might be able to comprehend


196
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,610
a divine spiritual skill of ancient times.


197
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,780
I will never forget the guidance


198
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,900
and help you two have given me.


199
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Now,


200
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,100
what do you plan to do?


201
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,140
I'd like to go to Artefact Forging Sect.


202
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,490
To search for clues of your grandpa?


203
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,050
Yes.


204
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,730
The entrance to Artefact Forging Sect
is located at Mount Firetop.


205
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,290
Artefact Forging Sect is of
the Black Iron Class


206
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,380
[Artefact Forging Sect]


207
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,100
but it is not under the jurisdiction
of Profound Heaven Alliance


208
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,050
or Eight Extremes Temple.


209
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,230
It is an organization
build by armourers.


210
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,890
It is the sacred place every armourer
in Chilan Continent


211
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,580
wish to go to.


212
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,410
However, you are currently a wanted man.


213
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,410
It's best not to use your real identity.


214
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,780
When the day comes


215
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,690
that you've been accepted
as a core apprentice of the sect,


216
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,690
you can reveal your real name then.


217
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,370
The day I find success,


218
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,690
I'll be sure to repay your good deed.


219
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,890
Something is bothering you.


220
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,620
Best you leave it behind. Otherwise,


221
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,940
you won't be able to pass the sect's test.


222
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,260
[Profound Heaven Alliance]


223
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,500
The Soul Reaping Beast is dead?


224
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,300
Yes.


225
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,130
But there's one thing I don't understand.


226
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,740
In the past hundred years,


227
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,330
the Dark Nether Race has not used
the nether passageway.


228
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,210
Please give the order
to investigate this matter.


229
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Si Yuan.


230
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,130
[Song Yu, Master of Profound Heaven Alliance]
[Song Si Yuan]


231
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,730
You'll handle this.


232
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,540
Understood.


233
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,450
Has the Dark Nether Race been defeated?


234
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,450
Yes.


235
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,760
Xingyun Pavilion played a big part
in the victory.


236
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,810
Things should be quiet for now.


237
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,770
Once Master Mo Hai finishes the seal,


238
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,340
peaceful days will be assured.


239
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,940
Since the task has been taken care of,


240
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,740
why did you not return sooner?


241
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,740
You've dallied for a whole three months.


242
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,350
It was a grave battle.


243
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,450
There were matters I had to attend to.


244
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,330
Xie Jing Xuan, while she was handling
matters at Purple Mist Sea,


245
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,200
she never took more than three days


246
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,330
to get everything big and small settled.


247
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,160
It's because the master of
Xingyun Pavilion was killed. Thus...


248
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,180
So a master of the Bluestone Class died.


249
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,540
What is the fuss about that?


250
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,690
What did you do at Icestone City?


251
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,180
Why?


252
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,540
Did you think you could hide from me?


253
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,180
Speak.


254
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,970
Why did you do it?


255
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,130
I couldn't let others know


256
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,940
that the Soul Reaping Beast did not die
by my hands.


257
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,800
That only proves your uselessness.


258
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,910
When the daughter fails,


259
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,220
the father shares the shame.


260
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,690
I did it for your sake.


261
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:18,819
Insolence!


262
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,210
Aside from that Gong Mu Lie
that does not exist,


263
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,180
do you even care about me, your father?


264
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,369
I think you've lost your mind
from reading too many books!


265
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,130
Father!


266
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,340
Master,


267
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,730
please calm down.


268
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,060
When I was your age,


269
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,340
I've already attained the late
Fulfilment Realm.


270
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,610
But you're still stuck
at Netherpassage Realm.


271
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,250
Useless!


272
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,460
[Tomb of Xingyun Pavilion
Deputy Chief Du Hai Tian]


273
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,460
You disappeared without word
for three months.


274
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,060
Where have you been?


275
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,090
Master.


276
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,300
You saw me once before
when you were little.


277
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,220
After so many years,


278
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,460
you're still able to recognise me.


279
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,970
A good memory.


280
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,490
That's good.


281
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,210
I heard after you've taken over
Xingyun Pavilion,


282
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,370
you haven't paid much attention
to us Du family.


283
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,250
The boldness of the young.


284
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,730
If the Du family wishes
to regain power of Xingyun Pavilion,


285
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,660
you'll have to show some real strength.


286
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,410
Palace of Hell is still pursuing


287
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,940
the culprit who killed your father.


288
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,010
Don't worry.


289
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,820
As long as we don't find Qin Lie,


290
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,940
I will not stop.


291
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,730
I thank you on behalf of my late father.


292
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,610
What are your future plans?


293
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,940
None to speak of.


294
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,730
Help me with a task


295
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,490
and Xingyun Pavilion


296
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,650
will remain with the Du family.


297
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,890
What task?


298
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,370
Your room is still available for you.


299
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,480
Stay the night.


300
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,220
Tomorrow, you'll get moving.


301
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,400
Where to?


302
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,650
In a few days,


303
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,370
Artefact Forging Sect will have
its annual recruitment.


304
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,490
[You're leaving,]


305
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,770
[aren't you?]


306
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,700
I wish to stay with you.


307
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,820
Only a wish?


308
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,090
My heart had turned to ash.


309
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,130
It was you who saved me


310
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,010
and tended to my wounds.


311
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,660
You even revived my heart.


312
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,340
You helped me forget
about what had happened.


313
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,580
No.


314
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,660
You've been thinking about how
your father had wanted to cripple you.


315
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,820
You kept thinking


316
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,090
but couldn't find an answer.


317
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,000
My father wanted to remove my ascension.


318
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,010
I was find with that.


319
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,090
I had betrayed him


320
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,460
and let him down.


321
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,300
Now he is dead.


322
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,060
I can no longer face him,


323
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,170
but I still have to face myself.


324
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,580
Do you understand?


325
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,970
I don't want to understand,


326
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,340
but I get it.


327
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,010
I really wish to stay,


328
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,370
but I can't.


329
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,490
This is the path I must take.


330
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,130
No need to explain.


331
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
I get it, I do.


332
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,540
You should go.


333
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,660
No matter how long it takes,


334
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,820
I will wait for you.


335
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,130
Promise me, Si Qi.


336
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,080
Don't secretly tag along this time, okay?


337
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,490
This time,


338
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,420
do not help me.


339
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,570
Let me do it myself.


340
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,090
I won't say goodbye this time.


341
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,820
But if we meet again,


342
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,610
I will not leave you then.


343
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,860
Young Master.


344
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,700
Come in.


345
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,250
What are you doing?


346
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,370
Young Master.


347
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,850
I've packed my things.


348
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,420
I'll go with you to Artefact Forging Sect
first thing in the morning.


349
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,490
No.


350
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,770
I am no longer the young master


351
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,360
of Xingyun Pavilion that is served
with a silver spoon.


352
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
You're free to go as you please.


353
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,250
Or,


354
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,600
you could stay here and wait for me.


355
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,340
Perhaps one day, Xingyun Pavilion


356
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,820
would get a new master.


357
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,130
Do you mean...


358
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,730
Tend to my father's grave for me.


359
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,490
Yes.


360
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,610
I will wait for your return.


361
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,570
Hello, everybody.


362
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,060
Ouyang Qing. Pang Feng.


363
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,850
What are you two doing here?


364
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,120
Yu Xin?


365
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,370
Isn't this Yi Yuan, the young master
of Purple Mist City?


366
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,530
You came too.


367
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,890
Yi Yuan?


368
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,420
Yi Yuan.


369
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,360
Shouldn't you be guarding the gate
of Purple Mist Sea with your father?


370
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
[Pang Feng, Ouyang Qing]


371
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,850
Why are you here?


372
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,970
Pang Feng.


373
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,460
Can you not be so rude?


374
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,130
It's fine, Qing Qing.


375
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,370
It's because I did a bad job
guarding the gate,


376
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,850
that's why my father got angry
and kicked me out.


377
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,120
I had nothing better to do,


378
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,060
so I came to try my luck.


379
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,490
Isn't this Young Master Du
of Xingyun Pavilion?


380
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,610
You mean the former young master.


381
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,700
Young Master Du isn't at
his father's wake


382
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,300
but came to join the crowd.


383
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,210
I heard his father was blasted
to smithereens.


384
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,250
No point guarding an empty grave.


385
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Lian Rou!


386
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,690
Shut up.


387
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,340
She is the second senior
of Artefact Forging Sect.


388
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,130
Her name is not for you to call.


389
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,660
I'm sure everyone knows the rules.


390
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,370
I will not go into detail.


391
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,280
All applicants


392
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,290
must present a spirit stone
of the highest grade.


393
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,340
Whether or not you pass the test,


394
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,970
the spirit stone presented
will not be refunded.


395
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,540
If there are no questions,


396
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,210
please take turns to present
your spirit stones


397
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,010
and then follow me inside.


398
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,970
The Artefact Forging Sect


399
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,490
is the best artificer sect
in all of Chilan.


400
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,850
Apprentices have to undergo
strict training.


401
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
I'm Lian Rou.


402
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm this year's examiner.


403
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,090
Before you join the sect,


404
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,130
you must know what artefact forging is.


405
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,220
As its name implies,


406
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,300
it is to create artefacts by infusing
spirit materials with spiritual power.


407
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,650
But the key component
to a spirit artefact is not the material,


408
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,250
but the Spirit Diagrams
of your personal attributes.


409
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,090
Line up.


410
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,060
This is the first stage of the test.


411
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,580
By using the stone pillars
as stepping stones,


412
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,000
you will pass the test when you
successfully get across to the peak.


413
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,090
Who is first?


414
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Me!


415
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,730
Senior Lian, it's me.


416
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,970
So he's a student of fire and water.


417
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,090
The legendary Artefact Forging Sect exam


418
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,390
doesn't seem all that difficult.


419
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,560
As usual, rumours can't be trusted.


420
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,770
Let's go.


421
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,220
Did you not pay attention
to what I said just now?


422
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,370
Spirit artefacts are Spirit Diagrams.


423
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,180
If you can't even differentiate
basic Spirit Diagrams,


424
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
you can forget about joining the sect.


425
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,970
Spirit Diagrams?


426
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,460
So there are diagrams on the pillars.


427
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,660
If you step on a pillar
that doesn't match the diagram,


428
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,220
the pillar will break.


429
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,540
Next.


430
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,770
Who will it be?


431
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,130
That was a beautiful display.


432
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,580
And that's a beautiful mask. Who are you?


433
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm Qin Bing.


434
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,890
I'm the young master
of Purple Mist City, Yi Yuan.


435
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,050
An artificer has to be pure and calm
in heart to create great works.


436
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,560
[Cliff of Serenity]


437
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,820
Before you lies Cliff of Serenity.


438
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,000
Place your hand on the stone wall.


439
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,730
Those without distracting thoughts


440
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,460
will be blessed with a path to get across.


441
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,050
If you fail,


442
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,570
you may return from where you came.


443
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,730
There is a maze behind the mountain.


444
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,160
Only those who remain unperturbed


445
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,540
and without mental baggage


446
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,800
will find the way out of the maze


447
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,540
and proceed to the next stage.


448
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,730
So far, there has only been one person


449
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,060
who managed to pass within one day.


450
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,800
Even the most talented


451
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,060
required up to three days.


452
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,290
There have been cases


453
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,700
where they used a month.


454
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,850
But,


455
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,240
we will not be waiting around for a month.


456
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,890
I will go ahead and wait
on the other side.


457
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,050
Hopefully, I'll see you all there.


458
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,130
Good luck.


459
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,750
I'm going to wait for you guys over there.


460
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,130
Make sure you come.


461
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,180
[Best you leave it behind. Otherwise,]


462
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,490
[you won't be able to pass
the sect's test.]


463
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,659
You've learned to play truant now?


464
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,500
I can't calm myself down.


465
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,219
Are you thinking about
what happened that day?


466
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,610
Thinking about the past


467
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,530
is meaningless.


468
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,780
I'm thinking about the future.


469
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,500
What about the future?


470
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,179
How to kill Gao Yu.


471
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,320
That's easy. One stab is all it takes.


472
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,170
But I've never killed anyone.


473
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,780
I worry I might waver.


474
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,740
Senior,


475
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,260
what should I do?


476
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,810
Ask master.


477
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,020
To become great,


478
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,660
one most not hesitate
at the crucial moment


479
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,530
and be resolute.


480
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,420
You wish to know


481
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,370
how to accomplish that?


482
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,600
Hold the cup of water.


483
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,740
What do you see?


484
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I see


485
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,370
myself.


486
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,080
Is the person in the water you?


487
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,530
Yes.


488
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,330
The person in the water is you,


489
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,260
but also not you.


490
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,080
The past you, present you


491
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,050
and future you.


492
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,040
Which one of it is the real you?


493
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,420
It's you, but not you.


494
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,650
Because everything changes.


495
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,280
Humans are like duckweed chasing water.


496
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,360
One moment you're here,
another moment you're there.


497
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,800
There is no direction.


498
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,260
Only by finding your true self,


499
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,940
when you know who you are for sure,


500
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,360
you will know how to proceed.


501
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,980
I understand.


502
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,570
[This is the Eye of Frost.]


503
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,260
[With it,]


504
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,420
[you can go to any corner
of the vast world.]


505
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,900
[Ling Yu Juan]


506
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:50,090
[Ling Xiang Guan, Ling Cheng Yu]


507
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,090
Uncle Ling.


508
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,180
Elders.


509
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,020
I've come back to visit you.


510
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,500
Please forgive me
for not being able to stay.


511
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,980
There's something
that I must do out there.


512
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,480
[Ancestors' Memorial Tablet]


513
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,370
I will keep myself alive


514
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,420
so that I can come back
and see you all again.


515
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,830
Did you also just break out
from the cocoon?


516
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,220
It's me.


517
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,490
Qin Lie.


518
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,450
I knew you'd come to find me.


519
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,020
Yu Shi.


520
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,700
Have you been well?


521
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,250
I'm sorry.


522
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,460
I wasn't able to send Uncle Ling off.


523
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,330
The living


524
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,130
has to live with the loss.


525
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,800
But the pain will heal, right?


526
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,850
How have you been?


527
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,290
I'm good.


528
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,370
I went to the Artefact Forging Sect
as Qin Bing.


529
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,660
That's good.


530
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,560
But still, be careful.


531
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,940
You must not let others find out
who you are.


532
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,810
By the way,


533
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,600
have you seen Gao Yu?


534
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,300
No.


535
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,420
Why?


536
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,500
It's nothing.


537
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,020
I think...


538
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,570
he's gone back to Xingyun Pavilion.


539
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,370
Keep this note safe.


540
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,020
Open it and read it
only when you see Gao Yu.


541
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,530
Can I not read it now?


542
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,360
No,


543
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,740
and don't ask.


544
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,650
Trust me.


545
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,600
Okay.


546
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,500
Once I have news of Grandpa,


547
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,010
I will come to get you.


548
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,810
One more thing.


549
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,660
I asked you to marry me


550
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,810
but I didn't go through with it.


551
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,530
If there's a second chance,


552
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,180
will you still marry me?


553
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,660
Are promises necessary between us?


554
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,280
I swear with my life.


555
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,410
The Artefact Forging Sect


556
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,170
is a sect to learn forging skills.


557
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,420
Artefacts found in other sects
within Chilan


558
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,760
all came from artificers
that trained here.


559
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,940
This is why


560
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,680
powers of all shapes and sizes


561
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,090
have great respect for our sect.


562
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,330
The result this year
is the worst I've seen.


563
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
You four, identify yourselves.


564
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,280
Remember my name.


565
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
I'm Yi Yuan.


566
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,770
Stand back.


567
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,850
Pang Feng of Cloud Sky Mountain.


568
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,090
Ouyang Qing of Cangyu Assembly.


569
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,130
Du Shao Yang of the land far north.


570
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,890
This is the forge used by new apprentices.


571
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,890
Meaning this is where you'll train
for the year.


572
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,020
Looks like the last apprentice
made it in time.


573
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,420
Identify yourself.


574
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,090
Qin Bing.


575
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,330
Now, I'll explain to you
the rules of the sect.


576
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,600
Since when did you have rules?


577
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,370
Senior Lian is a soft-hearted enforcer.


578
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,520
You never punish those
that need to be punished.


579
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,490
You're the one needing rules.


580
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,500
But I'm different.


581
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,420
I'm cruel and ruthless.


582
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,740
I punish those who need to be punished,


583
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,460
as well as those who don't.


584
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,130
Greet Senior Tang.


585
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,330
Greetings, Senior Tang.


586
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,290
-Greetings, Senior Tang.
-Senior Tang.


587
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,930
You. Come with me.


588
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,660
Me?
