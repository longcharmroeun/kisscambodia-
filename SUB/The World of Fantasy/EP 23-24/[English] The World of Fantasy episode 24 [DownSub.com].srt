[Episode 24]


4
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,670
Master Mo,


5
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,450
the poison...


6
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,810
Xie Yi.


7
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,740
Get on your knees!


8
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,660
Slap yourself.


9
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,120
It's my fault.


10
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm sorry.


11
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,580
It's all my fault.


12
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,450
Rong'er.


13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,010
I


14
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,600
have avenged your death.


15
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,000
Get Du Shao Yang here right now!


16
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,180
Si Qi,


17
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,400
do you think I'm cruel


18
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,800
for doing this to your father?


19
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,960
Cruel?


20
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,640
Ask the victims he once hurt.


21
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,320
Ask them if you're cruel.


22
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,810
What's your plan now?


23
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,980
You're his only daughter.


24
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,450
Now that he's become like this,


25
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,500
you can take over


26
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,060
the Eight Extremes Temple Sanctuary.


27
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,110
Why must I do so?


28
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,190
I'd have to deal with Uncle Song if I do.


29
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,930
He's quite nice to me,


30
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,610
but look what happened to Song Ting Yu


31
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,520
who works for him.


32
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,000
You're not working for him,


33
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,810
but working with him instead.


34
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,250
Having equal footing


35
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,180
is not possible if I'm not as good as him.


36
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,510
To him


37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,600
as well as everyone around me,


38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,750
I'm just a junior.


39
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,390
Speaking of Song Yu and Song Ting Yu...


40
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,260
This isn't over yet.


41
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,140
Song Yu will realize that


42
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,360
he's eaten a drugged Lotus in no time.


43
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,730
Also, Shao Yang,


44
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,800
you must take control of the situation.


45
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,149
Okay.


46
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,470
Song Ting Yu


47
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,100
has been locked up by Song Yu.


48
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,410
What?


49
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,920
Little Ting Yu.


50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,220
Where have you been?


51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,540
I've been looking high and low for you.


52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,150
You're thinking of me


53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,180
even when you're in trouble?


54
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,890
You really are my sister.


55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm getting you out of here. Let's go.


56
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,800
How did you


57
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,030
get past the guards?


58
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,590
I couldn't do that.


59
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,159
Your father let me in.


60
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,380
Come on.


61
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,630
Shao Yang!


62
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,260
You have the audacity


63
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,690
to deceive my father?


64
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,010
Master Song is eager to meet Qin Lie.


65
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,630
So, I told him
that you're the only one who can do that.


66
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,530
Why not let Saintess Xie


67
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,770
pretend to save you


68
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,730
as you'll look for him after that?


69
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,960
Master Song


70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,280
agreed to the plan.


71
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,300
Don't get carried away.


72
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,430
Do you know where Qin Lie is?


73
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,120
Do you really expect me


74
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,870
to help you capture Qin Lie?


75
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,310
Ting Yu, please trust him this once.


76
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,590
You owe him your freedom.


77
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,170
Not me.


78
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,480
It was me.


79
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,210
Thank you, Master Mo Hai.


80
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,710
Go and meet up with Qin Lie.


81
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,500
My father must've sent someone
to spy on us.


82
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,680
Now, we...


83
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,490
We already dealt with that.


84
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,240
Shao Yang had someone disguised as you


85
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,350
and went southward
on a flying spirit beast.


86
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,590
But Qin Lie is at the north.


87
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,530
We just lured them away.


88
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,440
How do you know he'd be at the north?


89
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,250
Qin Lie mentioned about
the Eye of Frost before.


90
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,780
Since it's something frosty,


91
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,010
it'll be at the north.


92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,080
But do you have any idea
of its whereabouts?


93
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,420
When we were at the Abyss,


94
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,540
Qin Lie once told me


95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,640
that there's this place at the far north


96
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,420
where the heavenly ice won't melt.


97
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,260
An ancient man-eating beast
is trapped there.


98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,100
I think


99
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,659
I know where it is.


100
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,220
All of you can no longer
stay at Chilan Continent.


101
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,590
Your only way to survive
is use teleportation.


102
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,880
Song Yu's men are waiting for you
at the Herb Mountain.


103
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,290
You have to die fighting


104
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,610
to use teleportation.


105
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,630
Please lend us a hand.


106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,120
I believe the Soul Suppressing Orb
inside Qin Lie's mind


107
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,360
is the key to using teleportation.


108
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,510
And it was written in an ancient book


109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,360
that a space spirit stone is needed
to use teleportation


110
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,910
as it has an unusual formation.


111
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,530
The space spirit stone?


112
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,490
But there isn't many space spirit stone
at Chilan Continent.


113
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,500
I happened


114
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,650
to have one.


115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,600
Ting Yu,


116
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,330
give this to Qin Lie for me.


117
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,590
The space spirit stone is inside.


118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,290
But that's everything you have.


119
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,020
Are you leaving the Artefact Forging Sect?


120
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,850
Rong'er is no longer around.


121
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,460
There's nothing


122
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,050
stopping me from leaving the Sect.


123
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,980
I'm just an ordinary person.


124
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,470
I don't know why I love artefact forging


125
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,050
or


126
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,750
how I did it better than others.


127
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,510
And I became a master
before I even know it.


128
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,310
Ting Yu, hand Qin Lie the ring.


129
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,000
He has a promising future.


130
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,240
One day,


131
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,720
the Ring of Space


132
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,840
that might seem valuable to others


133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,990
may not be a big deal to him.


134
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,000
Consider it


135
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,150
a keepsake.


136
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,230
Where are you going, Master Mo Hai?


137
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,290
Since I'm alone, it doesn't matter


138
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,590
where I go.


139
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,040
Will I see you again?


140
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
Fate will bring us together.


141
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,010
You should go, Saintess Song.


142
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,820
Let's go.


143
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,500
You mean, we?


144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,710
The three of us.


145
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,990
Why must I go?


146
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm still with the Sect.


147
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,610
You're right.


148
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,680
We can't always
be a step backward than Qin Lie.


149
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,280
Then, I'll take Ting Yu to the formation


150
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,470
and come back soon.


151
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,640
No way.


152
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,040
Why is that?


153
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,600
Please let me go.


154
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,200
I won't be at ease if I don't see her off.


155
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,680
I don't want you to go.


156
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,210
I'll be right back.


157
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,570
Does this happen often?


158
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,980
He's impatient,


159
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,010
but never unreasonably ill-tempered.


160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,460
In the battle at Purple Mist Sea,


161
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,490
my late father
left a letter behind for him.


162
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,440
It said that Grandpa Qin Shan
left him at Ling Borough


163
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,360
to lessen the violent nature in him.


164
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,130
Ling Borough


165
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,200
was a peaceful village.


166
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,320
It was indeed a good place
to learn self-control.


167
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,560
Qin Lie.


168
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
Qin Lie.


169
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,880
What's wrong, Qin Lie?


170
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,550
Qin Lie.


171
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,910
His nape!


172
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,080
What's going on?


173
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,510
Let me out, Qin Lie!


174
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,040
What are you?


175
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,020
I'm Mang Wang


176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,730
of an ancient Titan Race.


177
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,740
They are all my people.


178
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,970
We used to devour
every life in this world.


179
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,570
Maybe we ate too much


180
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,240
that he got angry.


181
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,630
In the end, he attacked us.


182
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,050
He was too strong


183
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
that he defeated all of us


184
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,890
and had us bound here by ice.


185
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,720
Then, he took me away.


186
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,100
Who was that?


187
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,230
Was it my grandpa,


188
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,130
Qin Shan?


189
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,170
I have no idea.


190
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,920
To us,


191
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,920
all humans look alike.


192
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,360
It's only until recently that he freed me,


193
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,670
and ordered me to help you
obtain the power of thunder pool.


194
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,870
But?


195
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,780
You got hungry or what?


196
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,770
And you want to eat us?


197
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,810
I can feel my people here.


198
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,010
And I know that you're in huge trouble.


199
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,230
So, I'm here to make a deal.


200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,320
What is it?


201
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,830
Everyone at Chilan Continent
wants you dead.


202
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,760
Release my people.


203
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,020
We'll eat all those who want to kill you.


204
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
Is there a need to think twice?


205
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,840
They are treacherous,
and they killed the innocent.


206
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,040
We eat humans for survival.


207
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,750
And we'll stop and we have enough.


208
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,690
They're the cruel


209
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,630
and greedy ones.


210
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,540
If I'm right,


211
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,830
they're coming to eat you shortly!


212
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,000
Qin Lie.


213
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,370
I've only achieved Manifestation Realm.


214
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,900
How do you know I can help?


215
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,790
The essence of frost can bind
and unbind things with ice.


216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,670
Didn't the person who taught you this


217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,280
tell you?


218
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,120
I told you,


219
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,550
they're treacherous.


220
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,890
Why don't you smash the world,


221
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,960
and destroy this ruthless Chilan Continent


222
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,740
with your rage?


223
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,270
Give me the nod


224
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,760
and I'll make your dream come true.


225
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,290
Don't do as it asks.


226
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,880
Don't you dare, useless beast!


227
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,460
Qin Lie,


228
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,300
there are lots of monsters here.


229
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,940
How many people will they eat
before their hunger is satisfied?


230
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,970
If you free them,


231
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,590
they'll devour everyone
at Chilan Continent.


232
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,520
So what if they do?


233
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,780
The entire Chilan Continent wants us dead.


234
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,530
Why should we let them live?


235
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,340
Ancient Great God, please lend me a hand!


236
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,360
Qin Lie,


237
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,190
over my dead body before you kill them.


238
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,440
You want me to kill you?


239
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,880
Or you're going to kill me first?


240
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,310
I go against the entire Spirit Realm


241
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,250
and the Golden Class family for you.


242
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,860
Yet, you're betraying me?


243
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,660
I won't betray you.


244
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,830
All I want is stick with you
through thick and thin.


245
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,230
I don't believe that.


246
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,670
Liar.


247
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,530
You're all liars!


248
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,870
Qin Lie, come to your senses.


249
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,360
This isn't you.


250
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,510
This isn't you.


251
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,090
-[Let go.]
-[Calm down.]


252
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,290
-[Let go of me!]
-[Calm down, it's all right.]


253
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,470
-[Let go!]
-[It's all right.]


254
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,400
[Calm down. It's all right.]


255
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,230
[Calm down.]


256
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,800
It's all right.


257
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,750
It's all right now.


258
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,420
What happened to me?


259
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,920
Calm down.


260
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,570
Calm down.


261
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,310
What happened?


262
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,980
It's all right now.


263
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,740
You just lost control.


264
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,140
Fortunately,
Little Ting Yu calmed you down.


265
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,370
But of course,


266
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,250
you helped too, Yu Shi, thanks.


267
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,590
Don't be so talkative.


268
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,690
Qin Lie.


269
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,570
Qin Lie.


270
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,770
Shut up!


271
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,460
I know that your body
is still bound by ice.


272
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,500
And that
this is just what's left of your power.


273
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,460
Stop pretending to be powerful.


274
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
Get lost.


275
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,670
We need to get to Herb Mountain.


276
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,180
Master Mo Hai has taught me


277
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,850
how to use teleportation.


278
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,240
But


279
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,730
I've betrayed my father.


280
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,200
There's no place for me at Chilan anymore.


281
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,190
Come with us to the Abyss.


282
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,370
We can no longer escape.


283
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,330
Shao Yang?


284
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,660
Si Qi, come here.


285
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,450
Master Song has promised to forgive you.


286
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,550
You betrayed me?


287
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,660
Traitor.


288
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,770
Song Ting Yu,


289
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,710
you are the traitor of Chilan Continent.


290
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,380
Du Shao Yang.


291
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,890
I trusted you,


292
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,580
but I was wary of you too.


293
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,880
I tried to convince myself
that you're loyal to friends.


294
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,420
So you're talking about loyalty now?


295
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,800
I showed my loyalty to the Human Race.


296
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,020
But you,


297
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,640
to the Dark Nether Race!


298
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,410
No, what is


299
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,720
the Dark Nether Race to you?


300
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,360
You did this for a woman.


301
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,870
For Ling Yu Shi alone,


302
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,560
you betrayed Chilan Continent.


303
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,470
Why should I help you


304
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,820
or be loyal to you?


305
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,290
What did Song Yu promise you?


306
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,310
Stop it.


307
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,860
Qin Lie, stop talking.


308
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,230
Master Song, all of us
have known Qin Lie for a long time.


309
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,210
He will never betray Chilan Continent.


310
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,290
-He's just...
-Yi Yuan.


311
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,000
-You...
-Master Song,


312
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,250
he's just blinded by love.


313
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,020
He won't escape now.


314
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,520
Why don't we take him back and guide him?


315
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,520
What an unfilial son!


316
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,530
Yu Xin!


317
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,580
Are you all right, Yu Xin?


318
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,090
I'm not Yu Xin.


319
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,550
I'm Yi Yuan, Qin Lie.


320
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,430
Qin Lie,


321
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,840
you'd better yield.


322
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,020
Since you chose otherwise, then die.


323
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,380
Nine Suns Explosion!


324
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,050
Your Majesty!


325
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,670
Your Majesty.


326
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,980
Qin Lie.


327
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,740
No.


328
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,920
Let's go down together.


329
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,990
The Frost Master?


330
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,080
Qin Lie,


331
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,320
stop this.


332
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,080
Guys,


333
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,370
I'm Li Mu from Heavenly Sword Mountain.


334
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,590
Li Mu, the Sixth Sword Holder


335
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,270
of Heavenly Sword Mountain
at Heavenly Calamity Continent?


336
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,510
That's me.


337
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,370
I'm here


338
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,030
to stop the fight.


339
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,490
Do you think


340
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,670
the Dark Nether Race
will live peacefully with humans?


341
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,530
Why not?


342
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,380
The Frost Master is a wolf, you know?


343
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,770
And I can live with the wolves.


344
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,960
Ridiculous.
The Dark Nether Race kills humans.


345
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,900
You killed many of them too.


346
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,170
Both Human and Dark Nether Races


347
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,600
are right and wrong at the same time.


348
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,400
But I'm not here to lecture you.


349
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,050
It's only a matter of time


350
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,790
before the God Race is revived.


351
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,690
We'll talk about it later.


352
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,660
After I kill Qin Lie.


353
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,460
What if I won't let you?


354
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,430
This is the Chilan Continent.


355
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,980
Master Song.


356
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,100
I speak for the Heavenly Sword Mountain.


357
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,310
And I call the shots there.


358
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
Understood?


359
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,600
This...


360
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,780
Qin Lie,


361
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,770
I lose to you


362
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,080
once more.


363
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,500
Guys,


364
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,090
the God Race will return sooner or later.


365
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,130
What a shame.
Chilan has been peaceful for too long


366
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,200
that you've grown arrogant.


367
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,610
You even fight among yourselves.


368
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,900
I came here today


369
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,540
to pick some young talents


370
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,790
to be trained
at Heavenly Calamity Continent.


371
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,830
As there's nothing more you can gain


372
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,340
from the narrow-minded Chilan Continent.


373
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,780
This is the token of Heavenly Sword Sect.


374
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,560
Qin Lie,


375
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,010
will you come to
the Heavenly Calamity Continent with me


376
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,070
and further your horizon?


377
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,880
Uncle Li is a Sword Holder
of the Mountain?


378
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,000
I'll go.


379
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,320
Take it.


380
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,270
Ling Yu Shi,


381
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,900
what about you?


382
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,720
I will go to the end of the world with you


383
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,570
even if there are hardships,


384
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,030
but I can't abandon my people.


385
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,200
I have my responsibilities.


386
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,770
Song Ting Yu.


387
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,960
The brave and smart Saintess
of the Alliance.


388
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,370
Will you come?


389
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,280
Yes.


390
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,560
Xie Jing Xuan, the courageous and talented


391
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,440
Saintess of the Eight Extremes.


392
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,500
Will you come?


393
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,130
Yes.


394
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,690
Very well.


395
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,150
Follow me.


396
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,650
Uncle Li,


397
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,140
please bring Yi Yuan too.


398
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,820
I knew you're a great buddy.


399
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,360
Qin Lie, I'm touched.


400
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,830
What a loyal friend.


401
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,530
Permission granted.


402
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,080
Thank you. Thanks.


403
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,900
Unce Li,


404
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
there's one more person.


405
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,070
There's more?


406
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,960
You're not going for a vacation.


407
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,610
That's him.


408
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,090
Du Shao Yang.


409
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,430
What is this?


410
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,970
A humiliation?


411
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,180
I need a rival.


412
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,560
Without one,


413
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,790
there's no competition
or the will to compete.


414
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,850
And I can't become stronger


415
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,660
or go beyond my limits.


416
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,820
Du Shao Yang,


417
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,750
I dare you.


418
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,450
And I'm not afraid.


419
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,750
Ling Yu Shi,


420
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,250
the new Nether Queen,


421
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,360
return to the Abyss
and reorganize the Nether Tribe.


422
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,860
I hope there'll be a day


423
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,250
when humans and the Nether Tribe
can be friends.


424
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,730
Yes, sir.


425
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,230
You haven't left?


426
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,620
But you don't have any business here.


427
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,810
Let's go.


428
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,530
Why must we come
to the formation to use teleportation?


429
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,380
Can it


430
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,680
bring you back to the Abyss?


431
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,920
No.


432
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,910
But,


433
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,480
it can take us to our ancestral land,


434
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,760
the Realm of Ruined Souls.


435
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,550
It should look very much like my dream.


436
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,300
But what will happen to the others


437
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,130
after we go there?


438
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,330
Your Majesty,


439
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,570
it's a rare chance
that teleportation can be used.


440
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,320
We're only sending you there.


441
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,810
What?


442
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,070
No.


443
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,310
Your Majesty.


444
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,490
You either listen to me


445
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,980
or don't call me your queen.


446
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,660
It's been a long while


447
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,470
since they went home.


448
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,290
At least let us


449
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,180
take a look there.


450
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,850
Oh, Qin Lie.


451
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,980
Senior Li Mu


452
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,250
was one of the people
inside the Soul Suppressing Orb.


453
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,940
Uncle Li?


454
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,670
Remember,


455
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,790
you still have one question.


456
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,220
I remember that.


457
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,440
I know what you're going to ask.


458
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,420
Twenty years ago,


459
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,040
some of our Five Horned Warriors


460
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,140
were captured by humans.


461
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,010
Back then, I was young and aggressive.


462
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,510
Bringing only a team of warrior with me,
I tried to rescue them at Purple Mist Sea.


463
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,490
Unexpectedly, they were waiting for us.


464
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,120
Then, your grandpa came.


465
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,160
He defeated the humans easily


466
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,670
and saved us.


467
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,600
He gave us his word


468
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,470
that the nether passageway
will be opened one day


469
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,110
so that our people may go home.


470
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,380
Grandpa said that?


471
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,810
Why did he help you?


472
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,750
He didn't let me know.


473
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,530
At that time,


474
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,450
he was holding a baby boy in his arms.


475
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,440
He asked us


476
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,310
to help the boy


477
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,170
if he ever encounters danger one day.


478
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,860
He also told me


479
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,740
that the boy


480
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,320
was named Qin Lie.


481
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,330
I'll stay at the Abyss


482
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,500
and study the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


483
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,910
Maybe


484
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,380
I'll find a solution regarding the Orb.


485
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,790
Okay.


486
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,670
I understand why


487
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,430
you kept Du Shao Yang with you.


488
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,640
He's also crucial
in finding out who you are.


489
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,770
But,


490
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,430
it seems like he and Li Mu


491
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,350
don't know about their past.


492
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,410
Be careful.


493
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,730
Actually, it's not about the Orb.


494
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,820
Even if they're not related to it,


495
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,180
I'll still do that.


496
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,170
Why is that?


497
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,810
In the past,


498
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,420
he was just


499
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,650
an unscrupulous man to me.


500
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,470
But the more we joined forces,


501
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,200
the more I think


502
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,530
that we're like-minded.


503
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,750
Also, I think that...


504
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,160
His dissatisfaction


505
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,850
and infuriation


506
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,410
are towards you alone.


507
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,810
You should be friends.


508
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,670
Yet, you have to scheme
against each other.


509
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,090
As expected from you.


510
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,610
It's normal to envy


511
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,250
and compete with friends.


512
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,170
But when it comes to Du Shao Yang,


513
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,330
it's more like


514
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,760
resentment.


515
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,860
Exactly.


516
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,700
I wonder what happened
between us in the past.


517
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,820
When will we meet again


518
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,300
after we go our separate ways today?


519
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,360
Our love won't be hindered


520
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,550
or affected by distance.


521
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,940
I once said
my goal is a higher and further place.


522
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,260
Now I've finally taken the first step.


523
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,050
And it was all


524
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,790
because you were there for me.


525
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,790
It's my pleasure.


526
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,730
Take care.


527
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,850
Take care.


528
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,500
Although you're not my birth father,


529
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,440
you were the one who raised me up.


530
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,670
But somehow,


531
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,120
I couldn't


532
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,940
get close to you no matter what.


533
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,969
You're being thoughtful only because


534
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,370
you finally have someone to back you up.


535
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,770
Being mysterious
and exceptionally talented,


536
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,639
I should've known
that you'll fly high one day.


537
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,159
I've always wanted


538
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,530
to get along with you
like any other fathers and daughters.


539
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,600
After losing my wife,


540
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,040
I've wished


541
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,440
to seek comfort from you.


542
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,050
But I was too stupid.


543
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,240
The harsh treatment


544
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,900
was just so that
you could be the best among all.


545
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,950
Look, the path to cultivation


546
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,760
is unimaginably long.


547
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,070
If you slacken even for once,


548
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,050
all your efforts will go to waste.


549
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,160
I don't understand your heart,


550
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,150
as well as my own.


551
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,870
I'll make up for all the mistakes
I've done if we ever meet again.


552
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,310
Remember to cherish


553
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,160
the rare chance.


554
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,190
One day, you'll achieve something great.


555
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,510
You asked me


556
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,180
to stay here for 1000 years.


557
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,430
But this time,


558
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,320
I have to break my promise again.


559
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,810
Bu Li, give me a chance


560
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,670
to keep my word.


561
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,870
You chose to go against your word.


562
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,370
What else do you ask from me?


563
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,250
Should I just forgive you?


564
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,680
No.


565
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,060
I dare not ask for that.


566
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,890
Why don't you


567
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,990
come to the Heavenly Calamity Continent
with me?


568
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,390
If I was just a wolf
like how I used to be,


569
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,730
it doesn't matter where I go.


570
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,130
But I'm the Frost Master now.


571
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,180
And Mang Wang is already on the move.


572
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,190
Moreover, that Continent is too hot.


573
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,010
Forget it.


574
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,460
I'd rather stay here and be at ease.


575
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,620
You're right.


576
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,360
I can't have a northern king of wolf


577
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,790
becoming a dog because of the heat
at the Heavenly Calamity Continent.


578
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,490
I... I mean,


579
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,160
I'll turn into a hot dog there


580
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,040
and return here to be your housekeeper.


581
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,390
By then, Frost Master,


582
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,710
please don't give me the cold shoulder.


583
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,960
Yi Yuan.


584
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,070
Lian Rou, you're here to send me off?


585
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,490
Of course.


586
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,330
I thought you have left.


587
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,580
We're waiting for Qin Lie.


588
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,080
He's seeing Ling Yu Shi off.


589
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,340
Lian Rou, will you wait for me?


590
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,740
Yi Yuan,


591
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,100
if that's a nice place,


592
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,810
you don't have to come back.


593
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,160
We're different after all.


594
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,570
Your promising future is awaiting.


595
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,340
Just go.


596
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,140
What are you talking about, Lian Rou?


597
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,720
Why wouldn't I come back?


598
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,050
I'm serious about my feelings for you.


599
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,850
You are fond of me


600
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,310
because no one was nice to you before.


601
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,850
Since I was nice to you,


602
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,040
so you fell in love for me.


603
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,030
You don't love me, do you?


604
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,780
Just tell me. Don't give excuses.


605
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,220
It's not that I don't.


606
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,330
But I don't like waiting.


607
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,590
I'm afraid of waiting.


608
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,870
And I'm worried
that my wait would go in vain.


609
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,400
Our future is uncertain.


610
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,070
There's no need to make a promise.


611
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,460
If fate allows it,
then we'll see each other again.


612
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,870
Isn't that better?


613
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,780
Yi Yuan.


614
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,190
Leave now.


615
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,950
I'm going to cry.


616
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,390
But I don't you to see that.


617
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,000
Go home.


618
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,720
Go!


619
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,680
She's left.


620
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,460
She really left?


621
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,180
Just cry.


622
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,140
I want to cry too.


623
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,300
Qin Lie is back.


624
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,470
Guys,


625
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,310
are you ready?


626
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,210
-Yes.
-Yes.


627
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,370
Qin Lie,


628
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,400
the sky here is beautiful.


629
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,660
If only you're here too.


630
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,350
[Hush. Hush.]


631
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,020
-[It's all right.]
-[Let me go.]


632
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,570
-[Calm down.]
-[Let go!]


633
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,640
[It's all right.]


634
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,550
[Hush. It's okay.]


635
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,520
-[Let go!]
-[It's all right.]


636
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,690
[It's all right.]


637
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,390
It turns out that


638
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,750
the fierce battle


639
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,620
wasn't what that was between us.


640
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,820
It's just that


641
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,630
I'm not the one.
