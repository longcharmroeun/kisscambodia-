4
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,120
Kill anyone who gets close!


5
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,970
Qin Bing.


6
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,700
If you can illuminate
all twelve Spiritual Lines Pillars,


7
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,380
you can have my position
of the sect leader.


8
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,300
With such a talent,


9
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,050
the Artefact Forging Sect


10
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,100
will be the strongest power
in all of Chilan.


11
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,120
That's 11 pillars.


12
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,579
Sir, Palace of Hell
will not give up so easily.


13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
We are going on the offensive.


14
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,370
What do you propose?


15
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,770
You can decide.


16
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,310
As everyone knows,


17
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,400
throughout the years,
the five main sects


18
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,540
have not stopped trying to plant
spies in Artefact Forging Sect.


19
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,490
Today, we are forced to fight.


20
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,470
It is likely they will defect.


21
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,210
Attention, Bloody Spear Guards!


22
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,180
Yes!


23
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,140
Capture and interrogate apprentices
related to the five sects.


24
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,510
Together,


25
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,090
we will fend off the enemies.


26
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,060
Even if blood covers Spiritual Lines Hall,


27
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,790
we will ensure Qin Bing's safety.


28
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,810
The Palace of Hell


29
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,010
has done its job as the vanguard.


30
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,700
What now?


31
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,900
Are the sect leaders going to back down?


32
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,170
Such mediocrity!


33
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,050
We're not backing down.


34
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,170
Ying Xing Ran is known to be a coward.


35
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,030
Why why did he suddenly
become so ruthless this time?


36
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,820
Some shining pillars


37
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,980
are enough to drive him crazy.


38
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,140
He's crazy?


39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,250
Then Lang Xie is even crazier.


40
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,270
Our disciples are in there.


41
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,220
We can't abandon them.


42
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,920
Exactly because our men are inside,


43
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,500
so we must attack quickly!


44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,310
Your son


45
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,680
is in Artefact Forging Sect, right?


46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,030
How sure are you


47
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,360
that they won't harm your son?


48
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,760
Senior.


49
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,340
The Blood Fiend Array has been set.


50
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,670
Anyone who dares breach it will not live.


51
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,050
Do not underestimate Di Shi Jiu.


52
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,530
Shadow Tower's expertise
is in sneak attacks.


53
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,260
They hide in your shadow


54
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,380
and strike when you're unaware.


55
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't worry.


56
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,590
It's not our first time dealing
with Shadow Tower.


57
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,160
You are...


58
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,070
Cheng Yu of Purple Mist Sea.


59
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,830
Li Yi Shan of Cangyu Assembly.


60
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,170
Take them away.


61
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,400
Pang Feng of Cloud Sky Mountain.


62
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,640
Ouyang Qing.


63
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,750
Take them away.


64
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,910
Yi Yuan of Purple Mist Sea.


65
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,810
Yi Yuan of Purple Mist Sea!


66
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,610
Where is he?


67
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,070
He's escaped.


68
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,090
After him!


69
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,570
I am not deploying troops


70
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,230
because I'm trying to protect my son.


71
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,300
Fine.


72
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,050
Master Wu.


73
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,560
Master Jiang.


74
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,300
Granny Jiu.


75
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,320
You guys don't have sons in there, right?


76
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,540
Might as well let
Shadow Tower take the lead.


77
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,140
Others may fear Lang Xie,


78
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,690
but I do not.


79
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,170
Lang Xie and I will fight to the grave.


80
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,360
See that?


81
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,780
Shadow Tower of the Palace of Hell


82
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,410
is the true hero.


83
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,040
Dear sect leaders.


84
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,070
Seeing how Di Shi Jiu


85
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,480
is willing to risk his life like that


86
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,280
must make you shout with joy inside.


87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,430
You're being a little harsh, Master Yuan.


88
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,100
Putting aside the other sects


89
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,860
and just talking about Qisha Valley,


90
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,030
we are made up of mostly female disciples.


91
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,710
They are not made to go to battle.


92
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,130
The Bloody Spears are killing machines.


93
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,440
You can't expect them to take them on.


94
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,550
The Shadow Tower is happy
to do the dirty work.


95
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,390
But when the job is done


96
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,530
and it is time to be rewarded,


97
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,340
I hope everyone will behave
in a fair manner.


98
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,360
Otherwise,


99
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm sure you all know about


100
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,160
the rules of Shadow Tower.


101
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,550
Di Shi Jiu.


102
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,020
Are you confident?


103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,710
Considering my ill fate
with the Bloody Spears,


104
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,890
there is none more confident than me
in killing him.


105
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,970
Lord Wolf, Commander Feng.


106
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,300
We have swept the place.


107
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,370
All apprentices from other sects
have been rounded up.


108
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,840
Only Yi Yuan, young master of Purple
Mist Sea, is unaccounted for.


109
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Also...


110
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,370
Speak.


111
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,860
Senior Tang Si Qi


112
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,390
is also missing.


113
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,660
Get more men to search of Yi Yuan.


114
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,490
As for Tang Si Qi,


115
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,330
she should be able to protect herself.


116
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,850
Understood.


117
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,660
Senior.


118
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,550
Was that necessary?


119
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,400
Apprentices from other sects


120
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,950
have been dutifully learning here
without causing trouble.


121
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,520
Do you really believe


122
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,460
that the five sects did not plant spies


123
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,610
within the apprentices?


124
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,870
Feng Rong.


125
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
Seems like after you
got married to Mo Hai,


126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,940
you've absorbed some of his naivety


127
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,580
and detachment from the world.


128
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,610
Don't worry, Senior.


129
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,450
I will do what I need to do
without hesitation.

Who are you?


134
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,820
How did you get in here?


135
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,220
You must have triggered
all the line pillars.


136
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,950
One thousand years.


137
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,620
I've been locked away for 1000 years.


138
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,690
Now I can finally be free!


139
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,380
Well?


140
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,960
What's going on?


141
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,210
The Palace of Hell's deputy chief
led an attack.


142
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,130
They're after you for
what happened to its young master.


143
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,570
The chief has given order for
the Bloody Spear Guards to protect you.


144
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,620
The attackers have been apprehended.


145
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,380
Protect me?


146
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,070
You are the first person
in a thousand years


147
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,470
to fully comprehend 11 of
the Spiritual Lines Pillars.


148

Palace of Hell.


149
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,070
No.


150
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,010
There is no way Palace of Hell
would breach


151

Artefact Forging Sect alone.


152
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,400
Other sects must be involved.


153
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,220
Doesn't matter. Lang Xie is ready
to fight


154
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,450
and has cleared the scene


155
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,740
of suspicious outside apprentices
by capturing or killing


156
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,090
in order to keep you safe.


157
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,210
What about Yu Shi?


158
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,770
She is with Qisha Valley


159
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,950
and came with her senior.


160
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,980
Don't worry.


161
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,650
I knew they are your friends.


162
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,240
They're guests and are safe.


163
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm going to look for her.


164
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,790
Don't stop me.


165
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,480
I said they are safe.


166
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,030
These Spiritual Lines Pillars
hide a secret.


167
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
Each pillar corresponds
to the ways of the world.


168
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,230
I was able to quickly decipher the
Spirit Diagrams of the first few pillars.


169
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,770
But the later pillars


170
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,290
contain Spirit Diagrams that are
progressively harder to read.


171
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,480
Let me go.


172
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,190
Or else if I'm flustered,


173
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,270
I won't be able to comprehend
the 12th pillar.


174
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,260
Let him go.


175
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,650
Come back quickly.


176
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,650
If I were to compare,


177
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,990
a genius that has managed
to comprehend 11 pillars


178
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,970
to me, who only deciphered two,


179
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,130
I suddenly feel so insignificant.


180
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,820
Where is Ling Yu Shi?


181
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,200
She said she was going to find
a Shadow Tower assassin.


182
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,650
She beat us up and took off.


183
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,950
Shadow Tower assassin?


184
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,680
Gao Yu.


185
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,460
Senior.


186
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,810
All the exits have been sealed.


187
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,790
It's too quiet.


188
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,560
Yes.


189
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
It is very quiet.


190
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,150
I could almost smell the presence
of Shadow Tower.


191
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,830
I smell the smell of death too.


192
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,330
A smell similar to ours,


193
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,010
but different.


194
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,650
Reporting.


195
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,000
Someone from Hell Cliff
buckled and confessed.


196
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,630
There are indeed spies
from the five sects.


197
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,090
They've found the secret passage.


198
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,890
No wonder it's so quiet.
The secret passage.


199
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,500
Pass the order to get ready for battle.


200
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,590
Yes, sir.


201
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,660
Let's go.


202
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,650
Si Qi.


203
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,860
Si Qi!


204
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,940
Si Qi, where are you?


205
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,850
Si Qi!


206
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,170
Why are you yelling so loudly?


207
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,840
Are you trying to alert others?


208
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,710
Si Qi.


209
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,370
What's the matter, Si Qi?


210
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,190
The sect is in danger


211
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,950
and yet you're hollering for a woman.


212
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,300
Because we're in danger,


213
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,620
that's why I wanted to see you.


214
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,790
I don't know if I'll make it
through today.


215
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,000
Stay far away from me
if you don't wish to die.


216
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,370
From now on, we're on different paths.


217
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,340
Best that you leave this place now.


218
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,840
With your skills,


219
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,650
you're of no help to the sect.


220
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,330
I won't go.


221
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,390
I'm going to stay and fight to the end.


222
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,340
If you won't go,


223
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,620
I'll go.


224
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,740
Si Qi!


225
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,030
What is it you're afraid of?


226
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,130
Tell me.


227
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,010
Let us share the burden together.


228
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,910
You can't bear it.


229
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
This is bad.


230
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,400
They're about to breach.


231
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,750
Come with me.


232
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,180
Who's coming with you?


233
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,620
You can go by yourself.


234
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,000
You're useless, an idiot!


235
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,060
Listen to me.


236
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,380
I don't care why it is
you're purposely turning on me today,


237
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,850
but I'll only say three words.


238
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,390
Come with me.


239
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,470
The messenger spirit birds
used by the five sects.


240
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,170
Why are they here?


241
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,540
You guys return to the alliance first.


242
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,630
Okay.


243
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,069
Go!


244
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,000
Child's play.


245
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,580
Lang Xie!


246
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,570
I, Di Shi Jiu, is here! Come out!


247
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,010
Listen up.


248
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,800
Even if you have to flatten the place,


249
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,420
you'll find Lang Xie for me!


250
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,760
Attack!


251
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,620
Where is Qin Bing? Tell me.


252
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,580
I came to save you guys.


253
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,190
Where is Gao Yu?


254
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,570
Watch out!


255
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,030
Greetings, Saintess Xie.


256
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,150
Saintess Xie?


257
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,590
Who would've thought I'd meet you here,


258
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,930
Saintess Xie,


259
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,380
who was supposed to have died months ago.


260
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,630
You've got the wrong person.


261
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,030
Even if I couldn't remember the face,


262
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,030
I would not mistake
Saintess Xie's Fireworks Chakram.


263
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,860
There have been rumours


264
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,780
of you being spotted.


265
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,890
But I told them it was nonsense


266
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,600
and that Saintess Xie is dead.


267
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,070
But thinking about it again,


268
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,140
Saintess Xie most likely faked her death


269
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,680
in order to do covert work
for Eight Extremes Temple.


270
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,110
Of course,


271
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,920
she could've pretended to be dead
out of mischief.


272
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,630
I wonder which one is correct, Saintess.


273
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
Can you let me go?


274
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,370
Let you go?


275
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,540
That means,


276
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,150
you did pretend to be dead
out of mischief.


277
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,720
If your father,


278
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,830
the chief of Eight Extremes Temple,


279
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,100
knew you faked your own death
because it was fun,


280
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,640
how would he think?


281
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,100
I helped him find his beloved daughter.


282
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,200
That is an incredible merit.


283
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,880
Die!


284
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,840
Once I finish what I came here to do,


285
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,430
I'll take you back to your father.


286
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,580
Don't you run!


287
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,320
I now get why it is so hard to meet
the sect's eldest apprentice.


288
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,320
Turns out Senior Tang Si Qi


289
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,520
is Saintess Xie Jing Xuan.


290
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,240
I am Xie Jing Xuan.


291
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,080
Stop running away.


292
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,130
I don't want to go back!


293
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,670
Because of him?


294
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,160
You want to die?


295
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,830
She said she doesn't want to go,


296
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,940
so I won't let you take her.


297
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,410
If you die on her behalf,


298
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,820
I'll let her go.


299
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,840
Good.


300
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,720
Protect her well.


301
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,940
Let's go.


302
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,570
Saintess Xie.


303
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,910
Do I have to bow and greet you formally?


304
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,750
Were you really going to die just now?


305
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,820
She could've really killed you.


306
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,160
My life


307
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,200
was given by you.


308
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,620
You're being silly.


309
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,380
How did Saintess Xie


310
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,460
become Tang Si Qi?


311
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,460
Because I don't want to be a saintess.


312
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,430
I want to live a carefree life.


313
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,230
I want to find someone


314
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,360
whom I love.


315
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,780
A man that loves me,
who I can share my life with.


316
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,980
Is this why you, the most fearless person,


317
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,870
is so afraid of being hauled back?


318
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,830
I'm not afraid of being hauled back.


319
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,450
Since the beginning,


320
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,650
I've already expected this day to come.


321
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,110
I'm afraid.


322
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,040
There's no rush.


323
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,930
We can talk slowly.


324
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,370
Whoever dares intrude,


325
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,160
I'll kill them.


326
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,740
Or maybe


327
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,610
we'll charge out and kill them together.


328
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,240
If we survive this,


329
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,820
I'll use my whole life


330
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,820
to listen to you talk.


331
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,330
I do not care for power and authority.


332
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,030
I only want a sincere love.


333
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,660
I've gotten a taste of it.


334
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,350
I've found it.


335
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,020
But I didn't think it'd be so scary.


336
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,250
I'm not scared to die.


337
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm not afraid of being caught
and punished.


338
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,230
But I'm scared of never seeing you again,


339
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,620
putting you in danger.


340
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,960
I fear that when I go back,


341
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,420
I'll never be able to forget you.


342
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,590
Silly.


343
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm afraid too.


344
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,950
I'm afraid of not being able
to ever let you go.


345
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,190
If you dare lie to me,


346
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,560
I'll kill you.


347
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,650
Let's go.


348
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,400
We'll leave this place


349
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,860
and go somewhere that no one can find us.


350
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,900
We'll be together forever.


351
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,520
I won't go.


352
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,020
You're the man I love.


353
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,950
We should have lofty ambitions.


354
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,260
You are a Bloody Spear Guard.


355
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,230
I am the sect's eldest apprentice.


356
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,120
We will charge out
and annihilate everyone!


357
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,940
You're not scared?


358
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,560
Scared of what?


359
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,600
I have more artefacts than you can count.


360
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,830
What to do?


361
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,830
Don't worry. I told you.


362
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,820
I have plenty of artefacts.


363
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,540
What about me?


364
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,120
What?


365
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,690
I mean,


366
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,540
you're Saintess Xie.


367
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,900
I'm with you.


368
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,340
If we head out together


369
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,630
and people recognised us,


370
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,900
what should I do?


371
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,920
Guess we'll have to die together then.


372
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,910
Let's go.


373
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,130
Song Ting Yu, move aside.


374
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,610
Come with me.


375
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,130
Why should I go with you?


376
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,750
We'll go and see my father,


377
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,650
master of Profound Heaven Alliance,
Song Yu.


378
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,420
I'm looking for Yu Shi.


379
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,560
I have no time for you.


380
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,130
Don't you want to save
the Artefact Forging Sect?


381
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,460
What do you mean?


382
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,180
The five sects are out for blood.


383
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,860
You guys won't last very long.


384
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,940
Forget about your Ling Yu Shi,


385
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,100
the whole Artefact Forging Sect
would be destroyed.


386
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,740
Only my father can save you all.


387
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,720
Come with me to talk to my father.


388
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,340
That's the only way you'll live.


389
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,270
What are you scheming this time?


390
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,130
I'm just a mere sect apprentice.


391
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,300
I have no right to meet with
the Alliance master.


392
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,930
If it's to ask for a favour,


393
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,620
it should be our sect leader
doing the asking.


394
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,620
Ying Xing Ran may be the sect leader,


395
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,790
but he has always avoided conflict.


396
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,960
He's a weakling.


397
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,560
My father wouldn't bother with him.


398
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,130
He likes people with guts.


399
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,070
You dared to kill Du Hai Tian.


400
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,190
I'm sure he'll be willing to hear you out.


401
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,300
Only if you save the Artefact Forging Sect


402
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,310
can you and Yu Shi find a way out alive.


403
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,400
Let's go.


404
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,480
Keep up.


405
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,380
Stay focused.


406
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,150
Gao Yu!


407
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,210
Qin Lie.


408
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,180
Qin Lie!


409
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,740
Stop!


410
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,980
Where is Yu Shi?


411
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,410
You have no shame asking about her.


412
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,160
This is a perilous time


413
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,000
and you left her by herself.


414
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,870
I'm not like you.


415
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,440
I'll take her away from this battlefield.


416
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,430
Stop looking.


417
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,700
Gao Yu is probably not here.


418
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,410
We should find a place to hide.


419
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,220
What is it?


420
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,080
It's Gao Yu.


421
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,240
Where?


422
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,540
I can sense him.


423
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,100
How?


424
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,210
Since obtaining the Heavenly Water
Spirit Record,


425
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,250
I'm particularly sensitive to breath.


426
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,050
Gao Yu's evil aura,


427
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,880
I can sense it.


428
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,390
Yu Shi!


429
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,840
Yu Shi!


430
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,520
Yu Shi.


431
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,960
What happened? Stay still.


432
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,750
Who hurt you?


433
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,130
Where is Qin Lie?


434
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,330
How could he leave you alone?


435
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,110
It's none of your business.


436
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,730
Leave.


437
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,910
Yu Shi.


438
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,870
I know.


439
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,430
I was wrong.


440
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,550
I won't ever hurt you again.


441
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,990
Don't worry.


442
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,170
I'm here.


443
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,330
Don't be afraid.


444
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,560
That's right.


445
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,390
You're here.


446
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,000
No need to be afraid.


447
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,650
Shadow Tower is attacking.


448
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,510
I've guessed it.


449
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,310
You, the hidden dagger of Shadow Tower,
will surely appear.


450
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,380
I am devoted to you.


451
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,350
How could you lie to me?


452
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,070
Does devotion mean you could
do whatever without repercussion?


453
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,840
I'll kill you myself.


454
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,800
Yu Shi.


455
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,040
Are you alright?


456
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,739
This ring


457
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,030
is a sacred offering from


458
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,650
the alter of the Evil Nether God.


459
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,350
It's an item symbolising the god's


460
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,510
power and authority as the most evil.


461
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,240
It is of great value.


462
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,740
Evil Nether God?


463
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,920
The ring belongs to the Dark Nether Race?


464
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,650
But the Evil Nether God


465
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,420
died thousands of years ago.


466
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,490
The Soul Reaping Beast.


467
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,190
It ran from the nether world
to the far north.


468
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,350
Perhaps it's related to the ring.


469
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,580
But why is the ring


470
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,510
on him?


471
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,350
It seems suspicious.


472
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,650
In other words,


473
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,720
there might be a bigger conspiracy.


474
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,410
I will keep this ring for now.


475
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,040
Does this mean


476
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,930
what he's done


477
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,910
is all because of the ring?


478
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,340
What did he do?


479
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,480
What did you do to Ling Yu Shi?


480
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,460
It's none of your concern.


481
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,760
Let her kill me.


482
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,330
What I did to her


483
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,090
is beyond forgiving.


484
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,460
Even if you don't kill me,


485
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,650
I'll commit suicide.


486
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,940
Did you tarnish her?


487
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,250
I did not!


488
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,800
Stop your quibbling.


489
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,500
He told you that?


490
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,320
Yes.


491
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,830
Why did you say that?


492
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,920
Because I want Qin Lie to suffer.


493
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,920
I want him to suffer more than death.


494
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
You lied to me?


495
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,200
-You did not...
-Senior Lu saved me in time.


496
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,990
Let her go!


497
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,350
Scoundrel!


498
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,610
He didn't get his way,


499
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,500
but he slandered my innocence.


500
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,120
If I don't kill him,


501
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,030
I won't be able to live with myself.


502
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,430
You're truly despicable.


503
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,780
A woman cares most about her chastity.


504
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,170
Your careless words


505
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,250
will mean the death of an innocent girl.


506
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,780
No wonder she doesn't like you.
You deserve to die.


507
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,420
I should be the one to die.


508
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,260
I did it on purpose.


509
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,740
Senior.


510
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,430
What are you saying?


511
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,380
Yu Shi.


512
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,450
It was I who had a bad thought.


513
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,610
I had lured Gao Yu there.


514
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,610
I thought


515
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,590
if you had been violated by him,


516
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,470
senior would no longer
be interested in you.


517
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,960
But I couldn't follow through
with the wrong.


518
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,580
I couldn't stand watching the scoundrel


519
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,550
continue to take advantage of you.


520
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,670
That's why I stepped forward to help.


521
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,770
I had thought


522
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,410
I would feel relieved
from doing a good deed.


523
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,750
I didn't expect


524
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,060
to be trapped in the illusion
of Huanyu Beast.


525
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,600
I kept trying to avoid you.


526
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,670
Whenever I saw you,


527
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,900
I'd start trembling in fear.


528
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,170
Although


529
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,480
I extended help in time,


530
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,890
but


531
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,950
I've harboured evil intentions
since the beginning.


532
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm...


533
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,500
I'm sorry.


534
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,190
Senior.


535
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,930
He should be the one to die.


536
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,350
Let him go.


537
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,640
This scoundrel deserves to die.


538
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,200
But I won't let you kill him yet.


539
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,490
I need him to help me find


540
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,910
the truth behind
the Evil Nether God's ring.


541
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,630
As the commander-in-chief
of the Nether battlefield,


542
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,760
I will not condone any threats
from the Dark Nether Race on Chilan.


543
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,900
Once this is over,
even if you don't kill him,


544
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,570
I'll kill him myself.


545
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,010
This is a crucial matter.


546
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,270
Give me three months.


547
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,360
No way.


548
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,430
One month.


549
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,160
Fine, one month.


550
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,970
If you're still sheltering him then,


551
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,830
I don't care if you're the saintess.


552
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,330
I'll make you pay.


553
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,460
It's a deal.


554
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,000
Let him go.


555
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,830
Set your priorities straight.


556
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,780
Gao Yu will be incarcerated here.


557
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,780
The Artefact Forging Sect is in peril.


558
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,320
I need to discuss with Tang Si Qi
on how to proceed.


559
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,020
Ling Yu Shi is from the five sects.


560
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,140
It'd be troublesome
if the Bloody Spears find her.


561
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,700
I'm here to look after Yu Shi.


562
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,320
You need not fuss.


563
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,100
Yi Yuan.


564
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm here.


565
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,480
Over here.


566
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,850
Looks like this is the safest place.


567
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,380
No way. I don't want to become snake soup.


568
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,990
So what should we do?


569
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,000
How about handing me over to Lian Rou?


570
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,010
Okay.


571
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,430
Wish granted.
