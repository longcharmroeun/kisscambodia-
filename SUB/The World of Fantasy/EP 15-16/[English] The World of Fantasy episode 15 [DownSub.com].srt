[Episode 15]


4
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,630
You killed Yuan Xiao?


5
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
I didn't.


6
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,160
It was you.


7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
Gao Yu. It really is you.


8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,880
Scum!


9
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,760
He's dead?


10
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,920
How dare you, a new disciple,


11
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,590
kill the young master of Palace of Hell?


12
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,470
Believe it or not,


13
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't kill him.


14
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,120
[Cheng Ping]


15
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,270
You...


16
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,640
Elder Cheng.


17
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,140
Let's listen to what Saintess Song
has got to say first.


18
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,430
Greetings, Saintess Song.


19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,360
If Yuan Xiao didn't die,


20
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,120
there will be a bigger trouble.


21
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,430
How are you doing, Saintess Song?


22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,340
The pill made from Huanyu Beast's blood


23
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,310
is indeed extraordinary.


24
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,590
I have recovered.


25
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
Chief Elder,


26
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,860
Yuan Xiao and his men
waited at the exit of Secret Realm,


27
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,590
intending to kill us
and steal the treasure.


28
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,670
We were all wounded back then.


29
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,790
Yuan Xiao started this.


30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,430
If Qin Bing really killed him,


31
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,760
he was compelled to do so.


32
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,840
And if Yuan Tian Ya has a question,


33
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,720
tell him to come and ask me.


34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,310
I would like to know


35
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,640
will it be him blaming me
for his son's death


36
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,310
or I condemning him
for his son's murder attempt.


37
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,720
But...


38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,830
Ask all the disciples to stay back.


39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,470
We'll make a decision
when things are cleared.


40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,310
Sure.


41
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,079
My answer won't change
no matter how you ask.


42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,190
I don't know why
I wanted to kill Ling Yu Shi.


43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,560
The mirage shows


44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
the deepest desire in your heart.


45
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,110
And you dare to say
you never intended to kill her?


46
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,940
Yes, I don't hold any grudge against her.


47
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,190
Why would I want her dead?


48
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,920
Maybe it's another person
that you wanted dead.


49
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,350
When you tried to kill me,


50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,840
you said this.


51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,310
[Gong Mu Lie, leave that woman!]


52
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,590
[To you at that time,]


53
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,560
[Qin Lie was not himself,]


54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,470
[but another person.]


55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,670
So,


56
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,150
I wasn't Ling Yu Shi as well.


57
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,940
Qin Lie told me


58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,200
that you were obsessed with Gong Mu Lie.


59
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,150
But you took him as Gong Mu Lie?


60
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,110
And in the book,


61
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,190
I'm the person that is
always beside Gong Mu Lie


62
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,870
whom you loathe.


63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,710
I don't know.


64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,140
I really don't.


65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,709
If you don't believe me,


66
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
kill me now.


67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,480
I believe you.


68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,150
I believe Yu Shi.


69
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,590
Then, don't bring this up


70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,750
or ask about it anymore.


71
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,400
Save ourselves the headache.


72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,760
I know you didn't kill Yuan Xiao.


73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,830
But everyone thinks it was you.


74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm afraid whatever you say now


75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,980
won't do any help.


76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,150
That's why I'm not wasting my effort.


77
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,590
I'm more interested


78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,400
in knowing why he did that.


79
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,990
Since it's your problem,


80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,710
do something about it.


81
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,750
Yu Shi,


82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
why did you call Gao Yu a scum?


83
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,080
This is the note


84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,590
you left for me at Qisha Valley.


85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
You said to read it


86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,150
when I meet Gao Yu.


87
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,990
What is it that you know?


88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,270
Nothing.


89
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,200
It's just that when he
took me back to Ling Borough,


90
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,310
I felt like he was a different person.


91
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,150
Maybe the war at Purple Mist Sea
has dealt blow to him.


92
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,960
Anyway, I don't believe
a single word he said.


93
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,590
So, I was just reminding you.


94
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,400
The war at Purple Mist Sea


95
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,590
hit everybody hard.


96
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,150
But,


97
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,070
why only he changed?


98
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,430
I don't know.


99
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,400
When we meet again,


100
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,430
I'm going to make him tell me everything.


101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,150
You knew Du Shao Yang would kill me,


102
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,920
didn't you?


103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,870
Yu Shi.


104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,340
Why're you acting like


105
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,680
a different person too?


106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,100
You won't tell me anything.


107
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,480
Prophecies?


108
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,020
Warnings?


109
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,540
I dreamed about watching meteor
with you since young.


110
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,860
I thought that was just a dream.


111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
But then, I realized


112
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,909
that that could be a prophecy


113
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,360
or a warning.


114
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,800
In case staying by your side


115
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,240
would spell disaster for you,


116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,680
I decided to go to Qisha Valley.


117
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,520
But when you were cultivating there,


118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,080
you saw me getting eaten by a Fire Dragon


119
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,480
and someone trying to
kill me with a dagger?


120
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,550
The prophecies came true.


121
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm not sure


122
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,020
if he was Du Shao Yang.


123
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,080
Then,


124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
about being eaten by the Fire Dragon...


125
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
That could be a prophecy too.


126
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,710
It'll happen sooner or later.


127
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,990
Since grandpa left in quiet,


128
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,710
and my mind being concealed by
Soul Suppressing Orb,


129
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,710
my background became a mystery.


130
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,710
But all prophecies that you saw


131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
are about me.


132
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,310
Could you be part of the mystery
of my background?


133
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
If that's the case,


134
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,680
then it was not an accident
that your grandpa


135
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,580
left you at Ling Borough.


136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,350
I'm glad that's what happened.


137
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,200
You're the person I trust the most.


138
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,750
Having you share the mystery with me


139
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,980
is perfect.


140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
[The Mother of Land]


141
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,200
[and the son of God of War
can't fall in love.]


142
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,150
[If the evil people find it out,]


143
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,390
[before they can even
enjoy the relationship,]


144
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
[troubles have already been awaiting.]


145
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,230
[But now,]


146
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,310
[love is already born between you two.]


147
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,420
[You want a fierce battle]


148
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,300
[or you'll breakup?]


149
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,080
[It's your choice.]


150
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
The Mother of Land
and the son of God of War


151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,270
can't fall in love?


152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,360
Had this been a warning


153
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,080
about you and me,


154
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,990
we would end up


155
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,550
fighting a fierce battle.


156
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,270
Qin Lie,


157
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,550
I can't stay with you.


158
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,909
What? So for our sake,


159
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,350
that strange woman


160
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,309
put Forbidden Spell on us


161
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,960
to break us up easily?


162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,159
You're the Mother of Land?


163
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,960
What's that?


164
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,230
And I'm the son of God of War?


165
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,830
In my whole life,


166
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,590
I've never heard about any God of War.


167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,470
I think this is just an excuse.


168
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,470
Is this the time for a joke?


169
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,280
After Xingyun Pavilion's
disturbance at our wedding


170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,470
and your confession,


171
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,790
I kept asking myself


172
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,110
but still couldn't find the answer.


173
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,870
I think I'm fond of you.


174
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,860
I want to.


175
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
Or you wouldn't be the person


176
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,950
that I worry the most


177
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,990
at moments of life and death.


178
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,840
When I almost died at the Ice Land,


179
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,750
and when I was taking the Soul Reaping
Beast down with me at Silent Abyss.


180
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,350
Even the mirage in God Trapping Cave


181
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,670
was you.


182
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,190
But I feel like


183
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,960
there's an unknown power


184
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,040
that is stopping my feeling for you.


185
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Is that true?


186
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,040
It has always been in my heart.


187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
I... I dare not tell you.


188
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,900
And now that I do,


189
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,840
it's more like a heartless excuse.


190
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,670
No.


191
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm very happy.


192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
At least


193
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,190
you want to like me.


194
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,830
Even if we'll face
a fierce battle in the end,


195
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,710
I won't regret it.


196
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,960
I never believe in fate,


197
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,910
or the so-called destiny.


198
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,990
If the Gods want me dead,


199
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,340
I'll destroy them.


200
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,470
Yu Shi,


201
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,590
as long as we have the courage to face it,


202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,100
we can make a change.


203
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,620
[Spiritual Lines Pillars Plaza]


204
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,520
You already learned
about the Spiritual Herb.


205
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,070
Today, I'll be teaching you


206
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
the artefact forging skills.


207
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,110
To forge an artefact,
Spirit Diagram is the key.


208
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,600
An weapon without Spirit Diagram


209
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,340
is not a magical weapon.


210
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,350
To become a true armourer,


211
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,710
it's crucial to know
how to carve Spirit Diagram.


212
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,990
Since you've passed the test,


213
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,670
I believe you're all smart people.


214
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,430
Why don't we get started already?


215
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,550
All the best in forging


216
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,660
the magical weapon of your dreams.


217
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,400
You may leave now.


218
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,860
-Okay.
-Okay.


219
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,840
You finally show up.


220
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,990
Usually, you wouldn't
work with the weapons


221
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,220
even if I asked you to.


222
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,160
And you'd rather chat with others.


223
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,420
Do you join the Sect


224
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,470
to make friends
or learn artefact forging skills?


225
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm here to learn more about my grandpa.


226
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
Found anything?


227
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,390
The Master is retreating.


228
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,640
When he comes out,


229
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,270
get Master Mo Hai to ask him.


230
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,780
Why were you giggling just now?


231
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,630
I... I wasn't.


232
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,910
I was getting insight.


233
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,110
You were obviously thinking about a woman.


234
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,760
Yes, I was thinking about Lian Rou.
So, what?


235
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
It's perfectly normal for a man


236
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,630
to be attracted to a woman.


237
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,600
You think they're all
trying to understand the skill?


238
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,870
Maybe they're also thinking about women.


239
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,280
You won't think about Yu Shi?


240
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,540
How do you know that?


241
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,040
You both keep exchanging love glances.


242
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,600
Even a blind man would notice.


243
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,230
But the disciple of Artefact Forging Sect


244
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,760
becoming a couple
with the disciple of Qisha Valley


245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,600
could make a beautiful love story.


246
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,640
She and I


247
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,720
grew up together.


248
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,230
So, you're some childhood sweetheart.


249
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,150
A better story it is.


250
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,790
She...


251
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,640
What? A long story?


252
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,900
Make it short, then.


253
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,910
I think she's hiding something from me.


254
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
And she seems to be less dependent on me.


255
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,520
Meaning, in the past,


256
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,760
you always looked after her?


257
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,400
Of course.


258
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,080
Or she was the one looking after me?


259
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,270
I don't know too.


260
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,520
Fine.


261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,220
In conclusion,


262
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,340
a man


263
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,070
who doesn't even know


264
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,870
if he looked after his woman


265
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,470
or being looked after by her


266
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,990
is not trusted by the woman.


267
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,980
That actually makes sense.


268
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Good job.


269
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,470
Well done.


270
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,990
Although Shadow Tower
belongs to the Palace of Hell,


271
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,790
all these years,


272
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,550
Palace of Hell achieved success


273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,840
because of our brothers' sacrifice.


274
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,910
Even the Master treats us with respect.


275
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,710
But Yuan Xiao


276
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,520
dare to


277
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,430
boss us around because of his position.


278
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,040
He has lived long enough.


279
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,790
Yuan Xiao


280
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,110
was too arrogant.


281
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,110
He tried to steal the treasure,


282
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,160
disregarding even Saintess Song.


283
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,080
Someone like him


284
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,860
will be killed one day


285
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,160
even if it's not us.


286
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,900
Gao Yu, I like your fortitude.


287
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,300
The door of Shadow Tower is open for you.


288
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,280
The Shadow Tower is cunning,


289
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,670
while I'm cruel.


290
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,590
That's great.


291
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,280
After Yuan Xiao's death,
the five great sects


292
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,400
will lash it out
on the Artefact Forging Sect.


293
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,990
I will destroy the Sect


294
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,430
once and for all.


295
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,910
Since you're all silent,


296
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,270
I'll take my leave
as there are works to do


297
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,550
at Cloud Sky Mountain.


298
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,520
Why the rush, Master Wu Tuo?


299
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,960
How can we not avenge


300
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,750
Master Yuan's son?


301
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,520
[Wu Tuo, Master of Cloud Sky Mountain]


302
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,589
Nice.


303
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,230
You want me to owe you, huh?


304
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,790
[Yu Dai, Master of Purple Mist Sea]


305
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,109
My son's death


306
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,760
actually gave you an excuse
to eliminate the Artefact Forging Sect.


307
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,790
Those who are too cowardly to go


308
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,920
may get lost now.


309
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,560
A bunch of sect leaders


310
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,110
who want to save face.


311
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,110
I'll speak my mind, then.


312
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,430
The armourers and magical weapons
in the Sect


313
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,350
also belong to Qisha Valley.


314
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Grandma Jiu is straightforward.


315
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,710
How admirable.


316
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,710
Count the Purple Mist Sea in
in the event of eliminating the Sect.


317
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,760
I, Jiang Heng,
the master of Cangyu Assembly,


318
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,030
agree.


319
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,340
Jiu Liu Yu, Mistress of Qisha Valley,


320
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,040
agree.


321
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,520
Very well.


322
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,940
Since everyone has agreed,


323
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,760
we shall attack Firetop Mountain.


324
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,070
Attacking the Sect


325
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,640
is not an easy task.


326
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,680
We need the approval
of the two higher-ups.


327
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,400
I have


328
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,590
sent them the message.


329
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,160
Now,


330
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,980
all we need is their approval.


331
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,590
All of you


332
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,760
just focus on preparing for the battle.


333
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,920
You're scared?


334
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,870
Don't join Bloody Spear


335
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,280
if you're a coward.


336
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,830
Greetings, Master Lang Xie.


337
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,110
When the Sect was established
1000 years ago,


338
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,330
[Lang Xie, Bloody Spear Guard
of Artefact Forging Sect]


339
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,440
the blood pool was already here.


340
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,400
In order to become
an outstanding Bloody Spear warrior,


341
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,310
one must enter the pool


342
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,920
and be immersed in blood.


343
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
The water in the bloody pool


344
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,700
is made from the juice
of over 70 spiritual herbs.


345
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,160
It can strengthen your body quickly.


346
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,310
But the pain the you feel while in there


347
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,390
is not bearable by simply anybody.


348
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,270
Those who enter the blood pool


349
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,520
must endure unbelievable pain.


350
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,470
The physical pain,


351
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,750
when impregnated with blood demon,


352
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,940
may turn them into blood in an instant,


353
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,800
leaving no bone behind


354
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,150
the moment they get in the pool.


355
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,470
Du Shao Yang,


356
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,800
do you dare to enter the blood pool?


357
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,510
I do.


358
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,110
Du Shao Yang.


359
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,760
Where are you?


360
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Do you miss me?


361
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,230
Fine.


362
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,350
I do.


363
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,870
Where are you?


364
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,340
I won't tell you.


365
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,870
Listen,


366
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm in grave danger now.


367
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,440
In case something happens,


368
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,760
you won't see me again.


369
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,220
Don't worry.


370
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,160
The blood pool can't hurt you.


371
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,800
How do you know I'm in a blood pool?


372
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,190
Are you nearby?


373
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,190
Bad guy.


374
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,520
You tricked me.


375
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,680
You left as soon as


376
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,470
our lessons end every time.


377
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,710
Who are you dodging?


378
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,680
No one.


379
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,470
You hide away
whenever Saintess Song comes.


380
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,830
Are you avoiding her?


381
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,920
That's why you wouldn't show up


382
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,800
at the Secret Realm.


383
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,790
No, you're wrong.


384
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,040
At Purple Mist Sea,


385
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,160
you talked about Saintess Song


386
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,440
like you know her well.


387
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,640
I already suspected it back then.


388
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,710
Du Shao Yang, I'm warning you.


389
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,280
Don't make assumptions about me.


390
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,680
Also,


391
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,860
don't ever talk about other women with me.


392
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,760
Pass the test of blood pool


393
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,820
or get the heck out of the Sect. And...


394
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,910
And...


395
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,100
When are you coming back?


396
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,590
I miss you.


397
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,070
I'm not coming back.


398
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,110
So that you'll miss me more.


399
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
It's not funny.


400
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Si Qi.


401
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,100
[A man who doesn't even know]


402
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,860
[if he looked after his woman]


403
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,510
[or being looked after by her]


404
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,990
[is not trusted by the woman.]


405
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,950
[That actually makes sense.]


406
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,860
Who's there?


407
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,990
Gao Yu?


408
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,470
You're an assassin of Shadow Tower now?


409
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,510
What about Shadow Tower?


410
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,950
I think it's good.


411
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,430
You're now Qin Bing too, aren't you?


412
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,710
Shadow Tower is Palace of Hell's subject.


413
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,580
Why did you kill Yuan Xiao,
the young master of Palace of Hell?


414
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,340
It doesn't matter who I killed.


415
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,750
The thing is, the blame is on you.


416
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,920
I don't like it when you're doing well.


417
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,350
Why?


418
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,070
Your grandpa helped Ling Borough,


419
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,100
and they were extremely nice to you.


420
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,800
I was jealous.


421
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,390
You're a more talented cultivator
than I ever am.


422
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,400
I had to train hard for one year
to reach your one-month level.


423
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,320
That makes me more jealous.


424
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,040
Yu Shi loves you madly


425
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,470
to even notice me.


426
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,160
But I'm no longer jealous.


427
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,920
Because I'm going to destroy you.


428
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,070
I'm surprised


429
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,680
that you hate me so deeply.


430
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,700
I have hated you since young.


431
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,790
I just didn't notice that before.


432
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,310
Killing you would actually satisfy me.


433
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,640
What did you do to Yu Shi


434
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,440
that she's furious at you?


435
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,670
I love her.


436
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,230
When a man loves a woman,


437
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,920
what will he do?


438
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,520
I just did what I was supposed to do.


439
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,280
Why are you glaring at me?


440
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,950
You think I was wrong?


441
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,180
From the moment I got the insight,


442
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,320
I don't think I did anything wrong.


443
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,700
I was right.


444
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,670
You let her down.


445
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,160
She was in pain because of you.


446
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,940
Seeing her like that


447
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,470
made me more pain.


448
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,030
And the source of our pain


449
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,460
was your ruthlessness and arrogance.


450
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,860
I finally got it.


451
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,630
So,


452
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,500
I treated her nicely


453
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,870
in a more aggressive way.


454
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,320
What did you do to Yu Shi?


455
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,830
She didn't tell you that?


456
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
I knew she wouldn't.


457
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,400
Because you're not
worthy of her trust anymore.


458
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,920
That's why I came to see you.


459
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,160
Qin Lie,


460
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,230
she's already mine.


461
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,990
Although she didn't consent to that,


462
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,550
and was trying hard to fight back
while crying,


463
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,350
she belongs to me now,


464
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,990
and she'll realize how good I am


465
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,070
sooner or later.


466
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,350
What's the point of hitting me?


467
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Kill me.


468
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,460
Come on, kill your buddy.


469
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,680
What made you turn into this man?


470
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,350
If I spread words


471
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
that Qin Bing is actually Qin Lie,


472
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,950
countless of people will after you.


473
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,060
But I won't do that.


474
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,150
I'm going to torture you slowly


475
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,350
and have you tormented


476
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,110
before killing you.


477
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,190
Qin Lie,


478
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,980
put on your mask.


479
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,040
From now on,


480
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,510
live in the dark like I do.


481
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,670
What did you ask to see me


482
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,230
at this hour for?


483
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,710
You took off your mask?


484
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,860
What if someone recognizes you?


485
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Yu Shi,


486
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm a wanted man now.


487
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,950
A fugitive.


488
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,280
Will you be disgusted by me?


489
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,190
No matter what you are,


490
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,160
I won't despise you.


491
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,070
Marry me.


492
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,460
Sorry?


493
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,670
Marry me.


494
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,040
I'll leave the Artefact Forging Sect.


495
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,040
And you don't have to
return to Qisha Valley.


496
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,230
If you'll come with me,


497
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,870
let's travel the world together.


498
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,190
Or


499
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,980
we can find a quiet place


500
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,190
and live there.


501
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,710
Which one do you prefer?


502
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,820
What have you learned?


503
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,950
Was Gao Yu here?


504
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,180
I'm sorry, Yu Shi.


505
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,440
I didn't know
things would turn out like this.


506
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,070
I don't need your pity.


507
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,640
It's not pity,


508
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,870
-I'm...
-Do you love me?


509
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,670
Only the Moon knows my troubled mind.


510
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,110
There's moon only once in a year
in Ling Borough.


511
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,150
But it can be seen here every night,


512
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,830
shining very brightly.


513
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,040
Will you confess your love to me
before the moon?


514
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,320
You may lie to me,


515
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,350
as well as yourself.


516
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,870
But can you deceive the sky above you?


517
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,950
You're in this situation.


518
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,700
Yet, I was asking if you love me.


519
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,190
That must be annoying.


520
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,990
Don't blame yourself.


521
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,950
My love has always been one-sided.


522
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,230
You don't owe me anything.


523
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,040
Stay there.


524
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,040
Where are you going?


525
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,630
Out.


526
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Didn't you notice


527
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,590
the place isn't guarded?


528
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,800
So?


529
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,440
The Chief Elder wanted you
to run away badly.


530
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,040
I was ordered to stay here


531
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,540
and grab the chance to capture you


532
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,750
to be given to Palace of Hell.


533
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm on my way to the Palace too.


534
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,700
What are you going there for?


535
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,030
To apologize?


536
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,710
To look for someone.


537
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,190
Who?


538
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,800
I can't tell you.


539
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,820
You're boiling with anger.


540
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,440
What happened?


541
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,710
Do me a favour.


542
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,680
Let me go out.


543
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,680
You killed my father.


544
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,560
Yet you're asking me
to disobey Chief Elder and help you?


545
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,070
Why must I help?


546
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,870
Qin Lie!


547
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,680
I had a fight with him.


548
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,320
That's why he lost his temper
and insisted on going to the Palace.


549
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,070
-Come back with me.
-Let me go!


550
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,350
What can you do there?


551
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,510
Come back.


552
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,560
What's wrong with this couple?


553
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,700
You want to take Gao Yu's life?


554
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,640
Why didn't you do it
when he came to see you?


555
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,670
No!


556
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,590
I wanted to kill him then.


557
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,800
But I couldn't beat him.


558
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,560
He seemed to have learned
some evil technique.


559
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
In that case,


560
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,870
why did you insist to go?


561
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,400
It's like walking towards your death.


562
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,750
So what if I'm dead?


563
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
I'll take him down


564
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,230
even if that cost my life.


565
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,190
What about me


566
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,910
if you die?


567
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,230
My father is dead.


568
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,110
Xuan Xuan has gone missing.


569
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,990
I don't want anything to happen to you.


570
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,640
I don't know how to comfort you.


571
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,350
With his death,


572
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,590
-maybe...
-He can't escape it.


573
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,510
Calm down for the time being.


574
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,350
If you want to get back at him for me,


575
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,920
stay here and cultivate.


576
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,430
Become stronger.


577
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,680
If something ever happens to you,


578
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,800
that will only make me more painful.


579
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
Don't go back to Qisha Valley.


580
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,390
Stay here.


581
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,680
Stay with me so I can protect you.


582
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,440
I'll stay.


583
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,180
I'll be with you.


584
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,560
Whether you love me or not,


585
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,640
or if you'll be able to love me,


586
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,400
we can only


587
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,440
depend on each other now.


588
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,350
Promise me.


589
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
From now on,


590
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,980
don't keep anything from me.


591
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,590
Okay.


592
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,680
[Palace of Hell]


593
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,160
We've waited for so long.


594
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,400
What did the two higher-ups say?


595
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,160
They aren't responding.


596
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,040
That's their answer.


597
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,219
I'll head to the Sect


598
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,630
and have them hand over Qin Bing.


599
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,510
If they do,


600
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,040
what will you do?


601
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,199
Whatever they do,


602
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,600
the Sect must be made accountable.


603
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,639
Exactly.


604
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,550
Since he's a disciple of the Sect,


605
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,070
then his action
must've been instructed by the master.


606
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,600
So,


607
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,320
they must answer for it.


608
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,520
Master Yu, I heard


609
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,600
that your son's at the Sect.


610
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,469
Send him a message.


611
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,800
Father wants me to be the spy?


612
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,560
What spy, all of a sudden?


613
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,429
This is strange.


614
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,870
-Lian Rou?
-What's your problem?


615
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,420
Where are you hurt?


616
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,040
Move.


617
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,760
Don't try to take advantage of me.


618
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,430
I won't.


619
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,390
I'm just showing my concern.


620
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,800
Such a smooth-tongued.


621
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,280
The Chief Elder told me


622
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,880
to give you the Spiritual Herb Recipe.


623
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,230
Collect all the herbs.


624
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,980
Why were you


625
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,070
murmuring just now?


626
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,710
Are you troubled by something?


627
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,590
No, nothing.


628
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,630
I was just bored.


629
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,870
So, I walked around.


630
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,100
Oh,


631
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,800
I was training. Training.


632
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,270
Training?


633
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,140
-Is that true?
-Yes, it is.


634
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,430
Very true.


635
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,990
The Alliance Chief
wants you back immediately.


636
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,280
And you're told to stay out of
whatever you see on the road.


637
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,310
The magical weapon is not yet forged.


638
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,150
Why does he want me back now?


639
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,350
I have no idea


640
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,630
about the reason why.


641
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,660
What will I see along the way?


642
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,670
The Chief must have his reason
for saying that.


643
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,430
Saintess, we should


644
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,830
go now.


645
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,280
I think something is brewing.


646
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,830
What is going on in the Alliance lately?


647
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,230
Tell me everything.


648
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,670
[Everything in the world is ever-lasting.]


649
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,520
[Spirit Diagram is the key to all. ]


650
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,990
Master, the assistant master
of Palace of Hell wants Qin Bing.


651
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,660
Should we stop him, Master?


652
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,840
No need. Let him in.


653
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,600
Mo Hai,


654
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,520
what do you think?


655
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,230
Everything


656
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,190
must be a fair play.


657
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,750
The young master of Palace of Hell died.


658
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,770
[Ying Xing Ran,
Master of Artefact Forging Sect]


659
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,620
They want justice.


660
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,710
But they failed to stop him


661
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,800
from trying to murder
the saintess of the Alliance


662
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,590
and our disciples.


663
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,220
How should we settle this score?


664
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,950
Well...


665
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,710
Cao Xuan Rui,
the Assistant Master of Palace of Hell


666
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,510
[Cao Xuan Rui of Palace of Hell]


667
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,190
is here to greet Master Ying.


668
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,470
The Spiritual Lines Pillar!


669
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,600
Qin Bing has comprehended one Pillar.


670
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,800
Another Pillar.


671
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,640
Hey,


672
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,990
is he going to continue?


673
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,660
Cao Xuan Rui, you don't look like


674
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,150
you're here to see someone,


675
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,040
but to kill someone instead.


676
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,520
Is Palace of Hell an impolite place now?


677
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,670
Get lost, wench!


678
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,110
What if she doesn't?


679
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,520
Knock it off.


680
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,180
Ying Xing Ran,


681
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,560
you, a leader of the sect,


682
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
allowed your disciple to commit murder.


683
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,950
And when the victim came,


684
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,950
you refused to hand over the culprit?


685
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,600
Even Yuan Tian Ya


686
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,950
won't talk loudly to me.


687
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,760
Who do you think you are?


688
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,910
You're not handing him over, are you?


689
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,880
So, you will fall out
with the Palace of Hell


690
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,980
over a new disciple?


691
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,710
There's no need to
fall out with them, Master.


692
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,760
We won't hand him over.


693
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,880
You barged in. That's unacceptable.


694
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,880
Wanting us to hand him over
before investigation


695
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,760
is also unacceptable.


696
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,150
Saintess Song has left.


697
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,310
Without the witness,


698
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,380
how do we find out the truth?


699
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,790
Chief Elder, you're wrong.


700
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,550
The Artefact Forging Sect is independent.


701
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,800
When did we ever rely on an outsider?


702
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,360
Master Cao,


703
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,870
how about this?


704
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,660
I'll bring Qin Bing here.


705
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,360
We'll interrogate him.


706
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,040
If you wish to take my disciple away


707
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,320
without an interrogation,


708
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,840
you'll have Bloody Spear Guards
to deal with.


709
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,110
Fine, an interrogation it is.


710
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,040
I'd like to see how you do it.


711
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,910
Bring him here.


712
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,280
Oh, no!


713
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,880
This is amazing!


714
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,140
Qin Bing has comprehended three Pillars.


715
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,230
What?


716
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,550
Qin Bing has comprehended
three Pillars, Master.


717
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,150
Everyone saw that.


718
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,620
Three Pillars?


719
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,990
Great.


720
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,590
Let's take a look.


721
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,630
What?


722
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,390
You're leaving us here alone?


723
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,750
Let's go.


724
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,040
We'll take a look too.


725
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,880
One, two, three, four.


726
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,520
Seven, eight, nine.


727
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,710
Nine Spiritual Lines Pillars.


728
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,950
Since our establishment,


729
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,710
besides the founder,


730
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,900
the largest number of Pillars


731
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,270
comprehended was only four.


732
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,880
The Spirit Diagrams
from only the four Pillars


733
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,600
have brought about the Sect's


734
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,220
greatest achievement of all time.


735
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Nine Pillars


736
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,470
mean the number of
Spirit Diagrams we obtained


737
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,600
has more than doubled.


738
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,880
We can be on par


739
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,880
with Silver Class in term of strength.


740
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,950
What is going on?


741
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,440
Ten Pillars!


742
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Ten Pillars!


743
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,360
It's ten Pillars!


744
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,630
The 12 Spiritual Lines Pillars


745
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,800
were set up by our founder.


746
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,510
Those who comprehended the Pillars


747
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,620
would become remarkable armourers.


748
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,320
Throughout his life,
our founder managed to comprehend


749
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,900
ten Pillars
in the Spiritual Lines Formation.


750
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,190
And he gained nothing after that.


751
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,070
But Qin Bing


752
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,990
comprehended ten Pillars


753
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,030
so easily.


754
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,320
His future is very promising.


755
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,600
Qin Bing?


756
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,800
So, that's Qin Bing? Capture him.


757
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:09,910
You're too noisy.


758
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,990
What?


759
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,670
Are you asking for a fight?


760
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,220
Bloody Spear Guards, protect Qin Bing.


761
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,340
Yes, Master!


762
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,430
Attack!


763
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,280
Kill anyone who takes a step forward.
