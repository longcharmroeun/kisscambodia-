[The World of Fantasy]

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,990
[Episode 17]


4
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,990
You are the saintess of the
Eight Extremes Temple,


5
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,610
and they're your subordinates.


6
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,000
How could you kill them so happily?


7
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,620
Didn't you kill Di Shi Jiu, too?


8
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,260
But that was to save you.


9
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,860
You women are so annoying.


10
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,820
Still bickering at a time like this.


11
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,600
She started it.


12
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,870
Things aren't looking too good.


13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,290
At this rate,


14
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,140
you'll be exposed as the saintess.


15
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,120
Then


16
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,290
let's see how you will protect
your little boyfriend.


17
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,070
We'll discuss strategy later.


18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,490
Meet me by the Blood Pool.


19
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,570
Okay.


20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,490
Weren't you leaving?


21
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,750
Why are you back?


22
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,040
I saw the Five Great Sect's
messenger spirit bird on the way


23
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,240
and felt something was amiss,
so I came back.


24
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,490
Little did I expect


25
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,120
things would become like this.


26
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,590
If this ruckus goes on,


27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,620
our fathers might join the fray


28
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,790
and draw swords against each other.


29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,110
The Artefact Forging Sect will be doomed.


30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,350
No.


31
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,230
The Artefact Forging Sect
is my second home.


32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,550
In my heart,


33
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,960
the sect is far more important than
the Eight Extremes Temple.


34
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,060
I won't allow anyone to desecrate
the sect.


35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,980
The sect may not be the most
agreeable bunch,


36
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,390
but they're peaceful.


37
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,390
Besides, Master Mo Hai
has treated me kindly.


38
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,460
I don't want bad things to happen
to the sect.


39
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,340
Master, we've dealt with the
Shadow Tower assassin accordingly.


40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,310
Di Shi Jiu has been
brought to justice, too.


41
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,590
Good.


42
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,990
Good.


43
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,510
My lord,


44
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,030
leave this matter to me.


45
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,380
The Five Great Sects have always
stayed in their respective domains


46
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,790
and lived in harmony.


47
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,870
Now that Yuan Tian Ya's son is dead,


48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,260
the five sects may seek


49
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,140
recompense from the Artefact Forging Sect.


50
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,860
I think


51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,300
they're only using you as an excuse.


52
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,000
Their real target is the
Artefact Forging Sect.


53
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,700
No need to tell me.


54
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,580
I know I'm an excuse for them.


55
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,150
Commander Feng once told me,


56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,270
700 years ago,


57
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,260
A powerful abbot


58
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,520
warned the leaders
of the Chilan Continent


59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,400
not to cross the Artefact Forging Sect.


60
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,460
Hence, they never dared to transgress.


61
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,390
What makes the Artefact Forging Fact
so special?


62
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,060
Nobody knows.


63
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,190
It's not just recently
that the Five Great Sects


64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,950
set their sights
on the Artefact Forging Sect.


65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,760
But why do they strike now,


66
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,280
of all times?


67
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,300
700 years have passed,


68
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,300
but that abbot still has yet to show up.


69
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,900
It's bound to give somebody ideas.


70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,020
The Five Great Sects is divided
into two factions.


71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,909
Without the Profound Heaven Alliance
and the Eight Extremes Temple's approval,


72
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,620
who'd dare unleash such a bloodbath?


73
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm going to ask outright.


74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Are you two spies?


75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,620
Tang Si Qi definitely isn't.


76
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,460
As for Saintess Song,


77
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,150
I can't be too sure.


78
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,000
If I were a spy,


79
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,870
I could've whipped out
the Profound Heaven Seal,


80
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,580
and none of you could stop me.


81
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,310
The Artefact Forging Sect may have
the Bloody Spear


82
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,710
and generations worth of magical items.


83
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,460
But if the Five Great Sects team up


84
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,020
and fight us head-on,


85
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,140
we may very well perish.


86
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,740
Since the Five Great Sects
have the guts to attack,


87
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,020
they must've come prepared.


88
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,790
Armoury City,


89
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,310
Firetop Mountain and other escape routes


90
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,460
have probably been sealed off.


91
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,950
We can't fight, we can't escape.


92
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,510
What should we do?


93
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,140
If we can't fight,
we'll settle for a truce.


94
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,550
We'll lure the Five Great Sects'
kingpins over,


95
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,580
and use them as bargaining chips.


96
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,580
But we can't let Ying Xing Ran go.


97
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,920
Everyone knows


98
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,710
the Master is shifty and corrupt.


99
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,700
So I say we let the Chief Elder


100
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,020
negotiate the deal.


101
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,990
The Chief Elder is a coward.


102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,310
He'll give the leaders


103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,460
of the Five Great Sects
a sense of security.


104
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,270
This plan couldn't be easier.


105
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,140
Du Shao Yang and Qin Lie are so smart.


106
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,710
Nothing can go wrong.


107
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,040
As long as they follow the plan...


108
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,470
They won't.


109
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,950
Why not?


110
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,630
Because they're delinquents.


111
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,230
At least


112
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,830
Qin Lie isn't.


113
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,910
I don't believe you.


114
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,830
How about a bet, then?


115
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,740
Fine, I'll bet.


116
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,580
One stone coin, what do you say?


117
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,910
Alright. I'll wager for her, too.


118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
I have money.


119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,750
Money's beside the point.


120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,140
I'll win for sure.


121
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,240
An armistice?


122
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,820
Are you sure?


123
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,669
We may as well surrender.


124
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,750
What do you propose?


125
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,070
What do you think?


126
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,309
Kill them all.


127
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,140
Forget about their plans.


128
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,260
Listen to them


129
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,670
or not listen to them, who cares?


130
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,230
Ying Xing Ran, we,
the Five Great Sects stand before you.


131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,110
We have no time to chit-chat.


132
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,390
You have one hour


133
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,750
to submit the surrender document,
or else


134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
the Artefact Forging Sect gets decimated.


135
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:14,490
Kill them! Kill them!


136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,030
Master,


137
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,820
the Five Great Sects have gathered
at our doorstep.


138
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,940
The master of Cloud Sky Mountain,
Wu Tuo, has spoken.


139
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,110
They're awaiting a written surrender.


140
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,870
We have an hour to comply.


141
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,350
He's a jinx. A jinx!


142
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,230
Master, we can't let the sect's
thousands of years of accomplishments


143
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,020
go down the drain
just because of Qin Bing.


144
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,670
11 Spiritual Lines Pillars.


145
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,310
In the history of the sect,


146
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,940
no one was able to


147
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,310
master so many Spiritual Lines Pillars.


148
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,270
Qin Bing is the future
of the Artefact Forging Sect.


149
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,500
If I simply give him over,


150
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,700
how can I face


151
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,460
our ancestors?


152
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,230
He may be a genius,


153
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,870
but not a blessed genius.


154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,830
The heavens disdain his talent.


155
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,630
The gods will his death.


156
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,260
Master, cut him off


157
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,020
before it's too late!


158
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,700
Call him a blessed genius


159
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,510
or a cursed genius,


160
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,390
Qin Bing's fate is sealed.


161
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,030
Since it's the will of heaven,


162
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,350
Qin Bing's life or death


163
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,230
isn't up to us.


164
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,320
Master,


165
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,230
hand Qin Bing over.


166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,580
Qin Bing,


167
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,630
you're only one life, after all.


168
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,140
The sect must come first.


169
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,790
At this point,


170
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,740
I have no choice but to...


171
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,820
Master,


172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,580
how can you be so cruel?


173
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,000
Lang Xie,


174
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,500
seize Qing Bin.


175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,070
As you wish.


176
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,670
We did it.


177
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,550
Shao Yang said they did it.


178
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,230
I told you they'd listen to us.


179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,080
You speak too soon.


180
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,510
It's not over yet.


181
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,590
That's it. We're going in.


182
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,910
Pass the order.
Attack the Artefact Forging Sect!


183
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,670
Masters of the Five Great Sects,
you've come a long way.


184
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,510
Apologies for the lack of hospitality.


185
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,000
What a crowd.


186
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,070
Is there a wedding?


187
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,260
There sure isn't one in our sect.


188
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,870
Not weddings,


189
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,500
but funerals.


190
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,510
Are you here to surrender?


191
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,460
Not a surrender.


192
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,470
An armistice.


193
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,430
If you want to beg for mercy,


194
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,820
just say so.


195
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,550
They have brains, or rather,


196
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,190
backbone.


197
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,380
But today,


198
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,550
we have your city surrounded.


199
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,630
On what grounds do you demand
an armistice?


200
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,430
We're a long-standing sect.


201
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,140
And with that abbot's warning


202
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,760
700 years ago,


203
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,790
I must admit we've grown prideful


204
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,020
and careless.


205
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,790
Your presence here today


206
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
is indeed a rude awakening for us.


207
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,020
I apologise for any disrespect.


208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,310
Why don't we sit down and talk?


209
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,270
Why cross swords?


210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,550
We're all Chilan people, after all.
We should unite.


211
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,630
That's correct.


212
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,200
Trying to lord it over us
with a 700-year-old story?


213
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,580
Very smart.


214
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,390
Too bad we're not buying it.


215
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,190
If you defeat us,


216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,000
we'll sit down and talk.


217
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,260
If you lose,


218
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,310
you'll kneel before us.


219
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,750
You act barbarously, raising your army


220
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,140
to intimidate us.


221
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,790
I admit, we're no match for you.


222
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,140
But does that mean we must
incinerate the jade with the rocks?


223
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,500
If we call a truce,


224
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,340
you'll get what you want.


225
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,550
If we don't,


226
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,260
you'll get nothing.


227
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,700
Master Mo Hai,


228
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,020
we should be sincere during peace talks.


229
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,390
We can have backbone,


230
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,870
but we can't be arrogant.


231
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,670
That is true, Chief Elder.


232
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,640
At first, it was only a tiff
with the Palace of Hell.


233
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,140
Who knew everyone would join the fray?


234
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,750
Isn't it because


235
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,500
you want to destroy our sect,
steal our magical items


236
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,820
and enslave our armourers


237
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,260
to your cause?


238
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,700
Nonsense.


239
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,110
Let's not pretend anymore.


240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,910
Armourers require morale.


241
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,060
If you enslave them and take away


242
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,180
their freedom,


243
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,430
their morale will be gone.


244
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,870
Without morale, what can they produce?


245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,380
You'll end up with a bunch of useless men.


246
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,820
Too expensive to be killed,


247
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,680
too worthless to be kept.


248
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,340
Wouldn't that be a dilemma?


249
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,500
Master Yuan,


250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,990
this whole thing started with
the Palace of Hell.


251
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,460
Say something.


252
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,140
Negotiate?


253
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,020
Or fight?


254
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,950
How do you intend to talk?


255
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,230
Go inside, sit down


256
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,350
and negotiate calmly.


257
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,900
Why don't Ying Xing Ran


258
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,700
come out himself?


259
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,460
We may be sincere in our negotiation,


260
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,140
but we can't let our guard down, can we?


261
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,700
I don't trust Ying Xing Ran.


262
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,940
Even less so Mo Hai.


263
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,380
Exactly.


264
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,140
What do you say, Chief Elder?


265
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,380
We're sincere about this.


266
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,990
You won't let your guard down,


267
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,430
neither will we.


268
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,030
Send the Assistant Master instead.


269
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,020
At this time,


270
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,430
according to our plan,


271
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,240
Mo Hai and Chief Elder


272
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,190
should have engaged the Five Great Sects.


273
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,870
The five masters aren't easily fooled.


274
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,030
But for Master Mo Hai,


275
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,560
luring five Assistant Masters
to become hostages


276
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,230
should be a cinch.


277
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,500
We don't want the Assistant Masters.


278
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,580
We want the Masters.


279
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,900
Mo Hai, what are you up to?


280
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,940
Chief Elder,


281
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,700
I was thinking,


282
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,870
this negotiation concerns the fates


283
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,990
of both parties


284
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,270
for at least the next hundred years.


285
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,580
It's a monumental decision.


286
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,630
Can five Assistant Masters


287
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,700
make the call?


288
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,190
Yes.


289
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,070
They will mediate between us.


290
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,180
In that case,


291
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,820
how long will it take to reach
an understanding?


292
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,870
Three days? Five days?


293
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,380
Three months? Five months?


294
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,500
Tell you what,


295
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,700
since the Chief Elder


296
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,830
is on speaking terms
with the Five Great Sects,


297
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,140
he will choose a trustworthy candidate


298
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,020
to participate in the talks.


299
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,000
Master Yu.


300
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,109
Okay. Then Master Yu


301
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,220
will come in
on the Five Great Sects' behalf


302
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,980
and decide on the power-split
for the next hundred years.


303
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,069
Hold on.


304
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
Why him?


305
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,960
Why not me?


306
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,069
This is a big matter


307
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,430
concerning everyone's interests
for hundreds of years to come.


308
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,500
How can you alone decide?


309
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,710
Exactly.


310
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,470
If you go in and negotiate,


311
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,950
and claim all the advantages,


312
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,380
what will be left for us?


313
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,910
At the end,


314
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,470
you're just scared I'll short-change you.


315
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,220
You mean


316
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,100
you won't?


317
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,420
We've all been alive


318
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,620
for over a thousand years.


319
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,470
We're no fools.


320
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,990
If it were me,


321
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,430
I'd do what's best for my faction, too.


322
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,620
That's right.


323
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,620
If you're going,


324
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,980
-we're going.
-After you.


325
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,100
Qin Bing, why are you here?


326
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,440
Who let you out?


327
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,220
Qin Lie!


328
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,470
Master Yuan, you got the wrong guy.


329
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,070
He's Qin Bing.


330
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,030
I get it.


331
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,380
You're both Qin Lie and Qin Bing!


332
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,980
Qin Lie?


333
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,190
The man who killed Master Du
of Xingyun Pavilion?


334
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,220
How could you give him refuge?


335
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,910
I...


336
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,900
What are you waiting for?


337
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,790
Blood Progenitor.


338
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,950
What's going on here?


339
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,260
I knew it. An ambush.


340
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,550
Are you Qin Bing or Qin Lie?


341
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,100
Qin Lie.


342
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,260
You killed the master of Xingyun Pavilion?


343
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,180
Du Hai Tian set up the Ling family


344
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,500
during the battle of Purple Mist Sea.


345
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,140
No one sought justice.


346
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,660
I killed Du Hai Tian to avenge
the Ling family,


347
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,670
yet became every faction's fugitive.


348
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,830
Is there justice in Chilan Continent?


349
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,430
Du Shao Yang, tell us.


350
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,190
Was the Ling family massacre


351
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,670
a set-up by your father?


352
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,660
If Qin Lie is slandering him,


353
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,740
we'll punish him accordingly.


354
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,150
Alright. We'll come back to it later.


355
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,180
Qin Lie,


356
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,860
who is this man?


357
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,230
And what are you plotting?


358
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,200
There is no plot.


359
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,830
I was outnumbered,


360
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,470
so I used my wits


361
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,430
to capture the five masters


362
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,310
in order to force a retreat.


363
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,620
Master,


364
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,550
me and Qin Bing...


365
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,100
I mean Qin Lie,


366
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,550
planned this.


367
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,630
If anyone were to be blamed,


368
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,260
let it be me.


369
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,550
I was part of it, too.


370
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,190
I should take responsibility, too.


371
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,480
And us.


372
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,710
Why didn't you discuss with us


373
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,740
instead of feigning armistice?


374
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,080
There was no time.


375
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,790
We were worried we might not
convince you and Chief Elder.


376
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,670
That's why we resorted to this.


377
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,070
You people


378
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,310
have committed treason, then?


379
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,710
Not treason,


380
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,220
but protecting the lives
of the Five Great Sects


381
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,430
by unconventional means.


382
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,620
Qin Lie,


383
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,180
you said you could


384
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,950
use the power
of the Spiritual Lines Pillars


385
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,670
to overmaster the Five Great Sects.


386
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,500
We trusted you.


387
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,960
But you never mentioned this man.


388
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,830
May I ask who you are?


389
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,950
The spiritual energy emanating
from your body


390
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,220
tells me you're a Bloody Spear.


391
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,350
What is the Bloody Spear?


392
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,910
They call themselves a faction?


393
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,590
Kid,


394
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,950
don't you point at me.


395
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm your ancestor, the Blood Ancestor.


396
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,550
Blood Ancestor?


397
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,910
That's right.


398
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,440
They call me the Blood Progenitor.


399
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,100
10,000 years ago,


400
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,020
I was the master of the Blood Fiend Sect
that ruled Heaven Calamity Continent.


401
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,070
All the Blood Fiend Spirit Arts


402
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,620
were created by me.


403
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,140
If I'm not mistaken,


404
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,430
your so-called Bloody Spear


405
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,350
is an illegitimate offshoot


406
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,030
founded by a heretic


407
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,190
of the Blood Fiend Sect.


408
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,320
Based on seniority,


409
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,380
shouldn't you address me as your superior?


410
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,270
But


411
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,150
why are you trapped
in the Spiritual Lines Pillar?


412
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,190
1,000 years ago,


413
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,900
the Blood Progenitor was betrayed


414
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,190
and banished inside
the Spiritual Lines Pillar.


415
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,220
The 12 Spiritual Lines Pillar


416
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,980
fell into the hands
of the Heavenly Armament Sect,


417
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,710
and was later stolen by a defector,


418
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,790
who brought it to Chilan Continent


419
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,550
and founded the Artefact Forging Sect.


420
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,030
When I tapped into the pillars,


421
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,680
I felt the Blood Progenitor's presence


422
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,740
and struck a deal with him.


423
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,550
You want to get out?


424
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,830
Name your terms.


425
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
Fend off my enemies,


426
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,020
and I'll release you.


427
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,620
You said you were betrayed.


428
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,480
By whom?


429
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,990
It happened 1,000 years ago.


430
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,380
Even if I tell you, would you know
who he is?


431
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,070
By the way,


432
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,710
kid,


433
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,870
by the tone of your voice,


434
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,550
it sounded as if you were going
to punish Qin Lie?


435
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,950
If anyone lays a finger on him,


436
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,080
I'll kill him.


437
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,070
Qin Lie,


438
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,220
you created this mess.


439
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,070
How do you intend to clean it up?


440
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
That depends


441
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,590
on the Five Great Masters.


442
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,140
Master.


443
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,670
What is it again?


444
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,950
It's...


445
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,030
I know.


446
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,140
Qin Bing.


447
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,860
Yi Yuan,


448
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,270
his real name is Qin Lie.


449
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,430
I don't care.


450
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,500
Just spare my father.


451
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,830
You told him everything?


452
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,380
Get up.


453
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,670
Not until you promise me.


454
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,980
If they belay the siege,


455
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,860
I won't hurt them.


456
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,310
Otherwise,


457
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,430
I can only promise


458
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,680
to spare your father's life.


459
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,470
But first,


460
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,860
I need to borrow his fingerprint.


461
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,080
I'll do it instead.


462
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
Is that okay?


463
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,740
Greetings, Masters.


464
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
Qin Lie.


465
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,190
Where's Yu Shi?


466
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,790
What have you done to her?


467
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,020
She's alive and well.


468
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,630
Recall your troops.


469
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,720
And our master


470
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,220
will have the Eight Extremes Temple
and Profound Heaven Alliance


471
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,790
redress the scales.


472
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,500
You think we would attack Firetop Mountain


473
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,900
without their approval?


474
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,430
I guessed as much.


475
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,740
Then I'd like to invite Master Song
of the Profound Heaven Alliance


476
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,670
and Master Xie
of the Eight Extremes Temple


477
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,390
to delegate with us,


478
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,790
so that you may recall your troops.


479
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,190
Dream on!


480
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,670
Shao Yang.


481
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,350
He's tough.


482
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,430
Too bad he's a scoundrel.


483
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,860
Lord Lang Xie,


484
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,220
free Jiu Liu Yu and Yu Dai.


485
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,760
Let them show their people


486
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,430
their fingers.


487
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,910
If they don't retreat, next time,


488
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,020
it'll be their heads.


489
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,100
Why them?


490
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,620
Yi Yuan is Master Yu's son.


491
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,380
He didn't betray the sect.


492
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,620
I promised him


493
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll spare his father's life.


494
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,550
As for Jiu Liu Yu,


495
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,430
she's outlived her time.


496
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,100
You sound so righteous.


497
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,030
At the end, it's because that old granny


498
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,590
was your good friend's master.


499
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,670
What if she was?


500
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,950
If you were my friend's master,


501
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,670
I'd let you off, too.


502
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,230
This is...


503
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,830
Those fiends.


504
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,480
Let's get them!


505
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,550
-Get them!
-Get them!


506
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,830
No.


507
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,430
Don't.


508
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,860
They're still inside.


509
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,350
The armistice fell through.


510
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
What happened? What went wrong?


511
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,430
Qin Lie and Du Shao Yang got too ambitious


512
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,320
and asked for the Masters instead
of the Assistant Masters.


513
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,860
They even ordered their fingers cut off


514
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,500
and forced them to draw back.


515
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,500
They actually went against our plan.


516
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,870
Men who don't listen to orders


517
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,500
are real men.


518
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,260
Your man...


519
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,100
Your men gave the orders,


520
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,100
my man carried it out.


521
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,550
Can you get your head together?


522
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,900
The Profound Heaven Alliance


523
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,990
and the Eight Extremes Temple


524
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,190
could strike any moment.


525
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,500
Then we'll see how you and your man die.


526
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,100
What's so bad about dying?


527
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,940
Dying with the man you love


528
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,260
is nothing to be afraid of.


529
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,230
You dying in your lover's arms


530
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,480
is one thing.


531
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,620
But


532
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,300
if you expect the entire sect


533
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,620
and myself to go down with you,


534
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,020
think again.


535
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,590
What do you propose, then?


536
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,860
You're the genius here. You tell me.


537
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,430
I may be good at fighting,


538
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,680
but when it comes to strategy,
you're better.


539
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,550
You come up with the plan.


540
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,510
Make Qin Lie the master
of the Artefact Forging Sect.


541
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,110
Qin Lie is too headstrong.


542
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,980
If this carries on,
both parties will perish.


543
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,720
Only by making him the sect master


544
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,990
will his thinking change


545
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,230
to fit his new role


546
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,590
and responsibilities.


547
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,380
He'll think of the greater good


548
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,950
instead of being impulsive.


549
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,350
Only then will the situation be remedied.


550
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,150
Du Shao Yang,


551
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,750
some nerve you have!


552
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,860
Si Qi.


553
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,590
Cut it out.


554
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,080
Everyone's looking. Let go.


555
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,470
Get it out of your system.


556
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,790
Then we can focus on the real issue.


557
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,260
You've lost.


558
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,830
Take it.


559
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,590
You girls


560
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,220
were betting on me?


561
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,350
So, did you win?


562
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,590
Of course.


563
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,560
Extra dinner tonight.


564
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,790
Great.


565
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,310
The Profound Heaven Alliance
and Eight Extremes Temple


566
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,740
have deployed.


567
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,100
By order of the Profound Heaven
Alliance's Master


568
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,320
[Zhan Tian Yi, Song Si Yuan]


569
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,910
and the Eight Extremes Temple's Master,


570
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,790
we beseech you, Ying Xing Ran,


571
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,060
to release


572
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,790
the three masters and surrender
by daybreak.


573
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,390
If you disobey,


574
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,980
you will be killed.


575
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,950
Are you happy now?


576
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,380
How would I know they'd arrive so soon?


577
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,560
We still have three masters.


578
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,380
To our father,


579
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,620
their lives are worth nothing.


580
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,220
What about Saintess Song's life?


581
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,100
Qin Lie,


582
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,710
what are you planning to do?


583
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,860
You could've stayed out of this,


584
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,590
yet you came back.


585
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,860
You said you'd take me to your father.


586
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,910
This unholy battle


587
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,740
wouldn't have happened
without his consent.


588
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,670
What is your motive?


589
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,980
I did lie to you.


590
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,790
The Five Great Sects was primed
for an assault.


591
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,860
When I saw the messenger spirit bird,


592
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,790
I knew they'd strike.


593
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,020
I didn't want you to die,


594
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,710
so I tried to persuade you to leave.


595
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,950
Why?


596
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,480
You fell in love with me?


597
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,830
You're shameless.


598
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,100
If you don't want to tell me, fine.


599
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,630
You're full of lies anyway.


600
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,500
I wouldn't believe anything you say.


601
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,110
When you tried to help


602
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,680
the Artefact Forging Sect,


603
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,380
I kept my peace.


604
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,320
But things are different now.


605
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,909
Do you think I should release you


606
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,310
and have another enemy,


607
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,179
or use you as hostage


608
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,670
to force back the
Profound Heaven Alliance?


609
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,110
Xie Jing Xuan!


610
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,699
I've cut off ties with the Eight Extremes,


611
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,060
you guys know that.


612
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,500
I've been meaning to take her
as hostage.


613
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,590
Go now.


614
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,780
Before Ying Xing Ruan
and those spineless oafs


615
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,980
surrender our sect on a silver platter.


616
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,739
I believe her.


617
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,790
Go.


618
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,710
Let's go.


619
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,270
Wait.


620
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,940
Qin Lie, back in Qisha Valley,


621
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,460
my master told me


622
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,420
in the ranks of the Artefact Forging Sect,
Master Mo Hai is the most respected.


623
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,870
What does that mean?


624
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,740
Those who follow Master Mo Hai


625
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,980
all value freedom.


626
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,830
Which means they'd rather take up arms
than to submit.


627
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,070
Why haven't you freed her?


628
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,870
You're smarter than you look.


629
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,600
You saw right through it.


630
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,700
Although we've been fighting for decades,


631
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,870
we were still childhood friends.


632
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,740
Not even Shao Yang saw through me,


633
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,630
but you did.


634
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,230
Since you wanted to play,


635
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,830
I played along.


636
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,150
I only resorted to such tactics


637
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,150
so they'd leave.


638
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,070
How could I let you fight
among yourselves?


639
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,460
When did those two


640
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,590
become so ballsy?


641
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,110
Striking me out of the blue.


642
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,630
You're smart.


643
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,630
Very smart.


644
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,080
If Qin Lie becomes the master,


645
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,070
the sect will protect him.


646
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,560
I did it out of personal interest,


647
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,830
but also for the greater good.


648
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,110
Besides,


649
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,700
you two agreed to it.


650
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,740
So where should we start?


651
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,070
Ying Xing Ran and Cheng Ping, naturally.


652
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,020
So it's my time to shine?


653
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,420
Why are you two


654
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,150
back this late?


655
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,110
On our way back,


656
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,660
we saw the Profound Heaven Alliance
and Eight Extremes Temple


657
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,350
in the sky, demanding a surrender.


658
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,070
So we went to a quiet place


659
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,630
to recalibrate calmly.


660
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,260
Have you come up with a plan?


661
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,510
That depends on whether you wish
to fight or yield.


662
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,780
At this time,


663
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,870
you have the gall to push
the responsibility to Master?


664
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,790
This is all your fault.


665
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,590
It's no secret that the Five Great Sects


666
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,940
have been eyeing our sect.


667
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,550
I'm only an excuse to initiate war.


668
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,830
Do you really think


669
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,500
killing me would make them retreat?


670
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,700
If it weren't for our retaliation plan,


671
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,180
this sect would've long
become their back garden.


672
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,070
What's there to die
for the sake of the sect?


673
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,500
Are you scared of dying?


674
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,920
And you're not?


675
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,150
You'd be nowhere
without the Blood Progenitor,


676
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,640
what with your half-baked cultivation...


677
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,790
Chief Elder,


678
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,940
on the grounds of your seniority,


679
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,700
I won't argue with you.


680
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,870
But don't think my patience is infinite.


681
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,880
Qin Lie!


682
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,390
I'm obligated to our ancestors


683
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,980
to ensure this sect's survival.


684
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,160
I've always been impartial.


685
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,300
When you lit up the
11 Spiritual Lines Pillars,


686
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,910
I saw you as a rare talent.


687
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,910
That is why I've tolerated
your shenanigans.


688
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,310
But today,


689
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,300
you've overstepped your bounds!


690
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,390
Master,


691
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,020
I don't know what boundaries are.


692
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,460
All I know is,


693
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,390
Xingyun Pavilion killed Ling Borough.


694
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,670
I sought justice,


695
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,400
but was unjustly demonised.


696
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,870
The Five Great Sects declared war
against this sect


697
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,420
for immoral reasons.


698
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,020
Against such injustice,


699
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,420
one either dies a hero


700
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,220
or lives as a coward.


701
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,350
You're the one who's
indecisive and weak...


702
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,740
Insolence!


703
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,550
Take Qin Lie away.


704
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,460
What's the matter?


705
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,310
Are all of you going to disobey me?


706
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,110
May I ask,


707
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,460
do you mean to surrender


708
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,460
by seizing Qin Lie?


709
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,020
I'm only surrendering


710
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,950
because I have no choice.


711
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,190
It's for the good of the sect.


712
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,660
Can you really speak for the entire sect?


713
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,420
Can you?


714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,400
Well said!


715
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,220
Chief Elder,


716
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,700
can you speak for the sect?


717
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,430
Master Mo Hai, can you?


718
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,830
I can't.


719
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,940
Since no one can speak for the sect,


720
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,910
why not let all the disciples speak
for themselves?


721
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,870
Mo Hai.


722
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,360
This is an outrage.


723
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,390
It's an outrage indeed.


724
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,660
Such blatant coercion.


725
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,120
Is there no respect for rules
in this sect?


726
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,700
Master, this is important.


727
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,660
You should be trying to figure out
a solution.


728
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,630
Master, you finally got fired up?


729
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,110
Master, you ought to be fired up.


730
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,220
To think a small fry like Qin Lie
would disrespect you.


731
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,660
How are you supposed to secure
your seat as the sect master?


732
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,390
Forget about the seat.


733
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,750
Master, at this stage,


734
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,660
things have gotten beyond control.


735
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,390
If the ruckus continues,


736
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,700
there will be chaos inside and out.


737
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,500
As the sect master,


738
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,910
you won't escape blame.


739
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,980
Why not let Qin Lie take the brunt?


740
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,390
Why do you mean?


741
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,710
That's right!


742
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,790
Make Qin Lie the scapegoat.


743
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,640
Once the dust has settled,
you'll pick up the pieces.


744
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,420
The seat of the sect leader
will still belong to you.


745
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,920
Your wisdom knows no limit, Chief Elder.


746
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,980
Round up the disciples.


747
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,020
Everyone,


748
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,590
today,


749
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,460
our sect's survival


750
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,630
hangs on the balance.


751
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,870
The Profound Heaven Alliance
and Eight Extremes Temple have spoken.


752
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,220
If we don't surrender by daybreak,


753
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,940
they'll slaughter every one of us.


754
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,630
I thought


755
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,030
I could provide a safe haven for you


756
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,870
to pursue the craft of armoury.


757
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,180
But in the end,


758
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,880
we were unable to evade our predators.


759
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,510
Though I'm the master of the
Artefact Forging Sect,


760
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,800
I can't speak for every disciple.


761
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,700
Should we fight or yield?


762
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,700
Please decide for yourselves.
