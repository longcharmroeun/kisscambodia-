[The World of Fantasy]

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,960
[Episode 18]


4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,759
Although I'm
the master of Artefact Forging Sect,


5
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,920
I can't decide for the entire Sect.


6
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,729
Whether we fight or surrender,


7
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,870
you decide.


8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,360
Those who want to surrender,


9
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,520
stay where you are.


10
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,860
Those who'd fight till the end,


11
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,009
please step forward.


12
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,940
Disciples who want to surrender


13
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,030
may leave.


14
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,140
Others are forbidden to stop them.


15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,810
And if you won't surrender, let's fight!


16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,060
I'm the master of the Sect,


17
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
but I don't have what it takes


18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,910
to protect all of you.


19
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,160
Fortunately, Qin Lie is one of us.


20
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
He's extremely talented.


21
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,090
He has lighted 11 Spiritual Lines Pillars.


22
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,400
Besides being brave and smart,
he has the help from the strong one.


23
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,420
I hereby announce


24
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,170
that I, Ying Xing Ran,


25
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,270
will hand over the position of master


26
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,310
to Qin Lie.


27
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:30,730
-We'll never surrender!
-We'll never surrender!


28
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,070
I'm sorry, everyone.


29
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,240
I kept you waited.


30
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,030
It takes time to put the clothes on.


31
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,170
Greetings, Master Xie.


32
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,950
Skip the formalities. Hey, you.


33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,950
What have you been eating in secret?


34
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,460
It's all thanks to you.


35
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,030
The master of Eight Extremes Temple
Sanctuary personally joins the war.


36
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,700
It's worth the wait.


37
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,110
My, my. Song.


38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,820
I love talking to you the most.


39
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,180
So?


40
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,690
Are the Artefact Forging guys


41
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,930
defeated?


42
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,450
They're still alive
but they won't surrender.


43
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,000
Why aren't we attacking


44
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,360
and eliminating them yet?


45
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,240
Never mind.


46
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,740
Let's wait till tomorrow morning.


47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,589
It's okay.


48
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,149
Just attack.


49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,120
We wait.


50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,140
We attack.


51
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,600
We wait.


52
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,040
Fine.


53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,450
Your life is miserable enough
after losing your wife.


54
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,930
I'll let you make the call this time.


55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,420
Your life is miserable too


56
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,690
as you have lost your daughter.


57
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,920
Fine.


58
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,350
Let's wait.


59
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,910
He sure knows


60
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,070
when to step down.


61
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,530
Yeah, what a cunning old man.


62
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,710
Qin Lie,


63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,690
those who would fight are waiting.


64
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,580
Do you dare take up the position
and be the master?


65
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,430
As a newly joined disciple,


66
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,740
I'm surprised to become the master
all of a sudden.


67
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,080
Cut the crap, kid.


68
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,450
Come on, do you dare or do you not?


69
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,270
But if you dare say no...


70
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,340
There's no need to threaten me.


71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm not afraid of anything.


72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,610
Guys,


73
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,500
I'll be the master for now.


74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,760
After the problem is resolved,


75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
anyone


76
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,830
can take this seat.


77
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,980
That is a dream position to many people.


78
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,830
Stop pretending.


79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,210
Du Shao Yang,


80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,680
becoming the master
of Artefact Forging Sect


81
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,550
doesn't mean one has reached
the highest and furthest place.


82
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,030
You're right, Master.


83
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,640
Looks like we can't be friends
no matter what.


84
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,390
Who was it that told me


85
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,060
that he'll never be my friend?


86
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,480
If you're going to catch up,


87
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,670
move aside!


88
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,840
Dawn is coming soon, Master.


89
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,830
Please decide what we will do.


90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,220
Blood Progenitor.


91
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,030
The Spiritual Lines Pillars.


92
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,810
Spiritual Lines Pillars?


93
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,120
Yes.


94
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,490
It has been binding me for a millennium.


95
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,500
With its great power,


96
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,050
of course it can bind others too.


97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,660
Since you've comprehended all Pillars,


98
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,340
you'll be able to do that.


99
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,890
You want me


100
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,820
to create a binding formation


101
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,330
using the 12 Pillars?


102
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,070
Exactly.


103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,740
But you're unable to do that yet.


104
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,910
In order to create
an ancient formation with the Pillars,


105
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,820
one needs to at least achieve
Fragmentation Realm


106
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,800
before he can get started.


107
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,940
But you're a useless junk.


108
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,090
Is there anything else we can do?


109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,810
Yes.


110
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,930
Fight with full force.


111
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,370
Fight with full force?


112
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,240
You're scared?


113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,780
I'd rather fight hard using wisdom


114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,540
than die because of my stupidity.


115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,560
Everyone, if we're going to fight,


116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,970
we need a plan.


117
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,409
If we're meant to die on the battlefield,


118
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,850
let's make our death worth it.


119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,770
I have an idea.


120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,810
Tell me the ingredients to make
Terminator Profound Bomb.


121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,650
I need one day.


122
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,810
Please buy me the time.


123
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,670
Where's Song Ting Yu?


124
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,130
She left.


125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,610
Left?


126
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,100
Why would she stay?


127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,170
To be your hostage?


128
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,080
You captured Song Ting Yu


129
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,000
to help her escape?


130
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,270
Yes.


131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,570
And it's your and Song Ting Yu's plan


132
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,190
to make me the master?


133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,760
Yes. So?


134
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,960
Ying Xing Ran will surrender.


135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,690
Going against him


136
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,220
will make you a traitor.


137
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,520
And that gives everyone in the world


138
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,790
the reasons to kill you.


139
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,760
It's better if you're the master.


140
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,790
That was my idea.


141
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,990
Women,


142
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,370
can you tell me your plan
to my face next time?


143
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,020
We've had the plan


144
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,620
for negotiation,


145
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,090
but you men were scheming against us.


146
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,280
That's enough!


147
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,960
It's ridiculous to fight about genders


148
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,320
when the sect is facing a war.


149
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,020
Master Qin,


150
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,120
I heard that in order to buy
Master Mo a day,


151
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,660
you've sent someone to Song Yu,


152
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,630
pretending that we're trying our best


153
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,000
to persuade everyone


154
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,720
to submit to Profound Heaven Alliance.


155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,800
One day is a short time.


156
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,740
And the Sect's future is at stake.


157
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Since you're busy, Master Qin,


158
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,160
why don't you go and handle
the sect's affairs first?


159
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
Shao Yang should stay here.


160
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,280
He and I need to talk.


161
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,700
Don't worry.


162
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,340
I won't hurt a woman.


163
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,740
The resentment between men


164
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,090
shouldn't involve their families.


165
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,680
Don't worry.


166
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,330
I can take care of myself.


167
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,480
Furthermore,


168
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,310
I trust Saintess Xie.


169
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,660
I know that you're unhappy.


170
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,680
But we were comrades once,


171
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,570
and we're now facing the same enemy.


172
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,600
We still fight alongside each other.


173
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,570
I'll take a look out there.


174
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,040
What else do you want to say to me?


175
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,490
Words of apology?


176
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,950
Why should I apologize?


177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,430
Because I let another man


178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,800
leads my own man temporarily?


179
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,420
Shao Yang,


180
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,980
I'm leaving.


181
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,150
Where are you going?


182
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm going out.


183
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
You guys work for a strategy inside,


184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,620
while I'll make a plan outside.


185
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,460
What do you plan to do?


186
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,660
Don't ask me.


187
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,380
You can't help.


188
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,030
Yes, you're right.


189
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,350
I can't be of any help.


190
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,180
Shao Yang,


191
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,100
we've gone through a lot together.


192
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,250
You know the pain of losing your family.


193
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,060
But you're being sarcastic to me


194
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,680
over some disappointment?


195
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm sorry, Si Qi.


196
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,710
I know you're not leaving
so that you can make a plan,


197
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,710
but because your father is here.


198
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,060
You're afraid that he'll find this out


199
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,430
and I'll be implicated.


200
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,680
You're imagining things.


201
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,260
I'm really going out


202
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,830
to see what I can do to help.


203
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,890
Will we


204
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,990
meet again?


205
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,580
Maybe we will.


206
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,700
It'll be dawn soon.


207
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,590
If both of us survive the night,


208
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,540
can we still see each other?


209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,220
Maybe we can.


210
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,490
Why the uncertain answer?


211
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,680
Stop asking.


212
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,760
I'll be leaving


213
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,810
as soon as I'm done here.


214
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,210
Does that mean


215
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,620
we'll never meet again?


216
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,530
If we're still alive after tonight,


217
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,010
let's meet again.


218
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,410
Go.


219
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,800
Go now.


220
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,410
He's left.


221
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,260
Are you sure


222
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,460
the momentary happiness


223
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,840
worth


224
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,570
the pain of parting?


225
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,760
You're not coming with me?


226
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,930
I want to stay and protect Qin Lie.


227
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,320
So, you do like him.


228
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,980
This is the Profound Heaven Badge.


229
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,910
It'll take you to my father.


230
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,020
Stay alive. See you.


231
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,930
Be careful not to bump into your father.


232
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,640
Brother,


233
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,140
I can sneak into the Sect


234
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,460
and save Ting Yu.


235
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,830
Don't worry about her.


236
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,630
I'm not.


237
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,150
But I am.


238
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,080
If she can't even protect herself


239
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,560
and accomplish the mission
entrusted to her,


240
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,140
then she's not worthy of my daughter.


241
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,450
I'm worried about Xie Yi.


242
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,320
He's an unpredictable lunatic.


243
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,130
Greetings, Master Xie.


244
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,410
The Sect sent someone to talk to Song Yu.


245
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,980
They're asking for another day
to persuade their disciples.


246
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,300
Song Yu has agreed to that.


247
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,680
Song really cares about his reputation.


248
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,730
He'd say yes when someone begs him.


249
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,130
What an idiot.


250
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,430
What should we do, Master?


251
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,690
You have two hours.


252
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,350
After that,


253
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,310
I'll attack personally.


254
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,360
Terminator Profound Bomb


255
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,770
is a good stuff


256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,520
from the Heavenly Calamity Continent.


257
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,340
It's very powerful.


258
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,210
I've never seen one.


259
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,460
When they're ready to be used,


260
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,690
you'll get to see it.


261
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,430
Promise?


262
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,690
Yes.


263
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,950
You're not wearing your armour.


264
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,030
What's the point of wearing it at home?


265
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,110
Furthermore, even without it,


266
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,740
I can still protect my home.


267
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,570
It doesn't matter if you fail.


268
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,930
The world is large.


269
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
Be it in the clouds or on the cliff,


270
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,150
where there are you, there is home.


271
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,390
However, we have our responsibilities.


272
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,630
I wonder


273
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,580
when can we let go of the burden


274
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,040
and travel the Spirit Realm happily.


275
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,170
The rumoured land
with Central Golden Holy Light


276
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,069
where the Holy Lights of Supreme Lords
are shining down.


277
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,900
When can we see that?


278
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,619
As long as both of us are alive,


279
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,480
there's no rush.


280
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,270
Aren't you going on patrol?


281
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,359
The Sect


282
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,020
is well guarded by Bloody Spear Guard.


283
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,740
We're counting on you to win the war.


284
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,790
I'll guard you.


285
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,620
Rong'er,


286
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,240
I'm hungry.


287
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,740
What do you want to eat?


288
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,390
Braised meat.


289
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,350
Okay, I'll make braised meat.


290
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,800
We can have meat after the war.


291
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,870
Okay.


292
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,330
[Ling Ye Palace]


293
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,970
Stay there.


294
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,090
Tang Si Qi wishes to meet Master Song.


295
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,890
Jing Xuan?


296
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,260
It's me, Uncle Song.


297
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,850
Your father is unpredictable.


298
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,610
And you're unruly since young.


299
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,040
Regarding you faking your death,


300
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,030
whether it's your father's order


301
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
or your own idea,


302
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,610
it doesn't surprise me.


303
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,120
You've misunderstood, Uncle.


304
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,870
It's just because
I yearned for the freedom of an armourer.


305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
My father didn't give that order.


306
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,150
Stand up and talk.


307
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,580
Yes, Uncle.


308
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,170
Is this from Ting Yu?


309
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,570
Yes.


310
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,510
She's still in the Sect,


311
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,420
carrying out the mission you gave her


312
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,430
to bring Qin Lie here to you.


313
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,530
And why are you here?


314
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
I heard that you and my father


315
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,250
plan to attack the Sect.


316
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,980
Ting Yu and I dare not stop you.


317
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,830
But I'm worried.


318
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,770
About what?


319
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,860
Seven hundred years ago,


320
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,780
the abbot has warned us


321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,710
not to attack the Sect.


322
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,630
That is a 700-year-old story.


323
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,400
Chilan Continent
was having a civil war back then.


324
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,260
A high-ranking abbot


325
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,140
stopped the human race


326
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,310
from killing each other
with his own power.


327
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,070
All humans feared and respected him.


328
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,390
Before he left, he said that


329
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,180
no matter what happened


330
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,890
the Artefact Forging Sect
shall not be touched.


331
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,450
Then, do you know


332
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,700
why he protected the Sect?


333
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,020
He didn't say anything about that.


334
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,750
He didn't say the reason,


335
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,710
but what about the consequence?


336
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,940
There's no consequence?


337
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,220
The abbot's words
must have another meaning.


338
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,930
Aren't you worried about the consequences?


339
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,360
Before I allowed the five great sects
to attack the Sect,


340
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,770
the abbot's words came to my mind.


341
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,840
And I tried to contact him using


342
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
like our predecessors did,


343
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,080
but to no avail.


344
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,480
Maybe


345
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,180
it was just something he blurted out.


346
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,240
He might have forgotten
about Chilan Continent.


347
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,470
Why would an abbot blurt something out?


348
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,270
Please try again, Uncle.


349
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,920
Since it didn't work,


350
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,320
I won't try again.


351
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,980
Let me try.


352
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,740
You do love


353
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,740
the Sect very much, huh?


354
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,230
I'm just worried


355
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,800
that the consequence is unbearable.


356
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,660
The Saintess of Eight Extremes
Temple Sanctuary is a smart girl.


357
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,380
I don't think


358
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,860
it's as simple as this.


359
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,060
I don't want the people to suffer anymore.


360
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,070
Even if hope is faint,


361
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,200
I'll still do my best and give it a try.


362
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,560
Please be like that too, Uncle.


363
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Okay.


364
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,930
You may try.


365
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,110
But until you get in touch with the abbot,


366
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,530
I won't stop the attack.


367
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,810
Thank you, Uncle.


368
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,620
Does your father know
that you're still alive?


369
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,120
That depends on you.


370
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,720
The Artefact Forging Sect
is on the verge of destruction.


371
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,420
Please come forth, Abbot.


372
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,530
Song Ting Yu?


373
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,490
Didn't you escape?


374
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,050
This is not the time to argue.


375
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,270
Elder Mo Hai might be in danger.


376
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,190
Why?


377
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,850
My father will give you another day


378
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,140
as promised.


379
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,740
But Xie Yi is a lunatic.


380
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,240
He won't wait any longer,


381
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,000
let alone one whole day.


382
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,310
He'll attack before my father does.


383
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,920
What will he do?


384
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,690
Of all the people in the Sect,


385
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,980
he fears only Elder Mo Hai.


386
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,120
If he's making a move,


387
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,030
Elder Mo Hai will be the target.


388
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,560
Commander Feng is with him.


389
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,660
That's why Zhan Tian Yi will come.


390
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,460
He's the only one who matches Feng Rong.


391
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,040
I can't show myself.


392
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,170
You're their only hope.


393
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,950
Okay, I'll go now.


394
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,350
Rong'er!


395
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,220
Master Mo Hai.


396
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,660
What a loyal and loving wife you have.


397
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,790
You two really make a perfect match.


398
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,010
Don't mind me.


399
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,450
Focus on forging!


400
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,540
Fine, then.


401
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,410
A Manifestation Realm achiever?


402
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,730
I'll settle you first, kid.


403
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,100
Mo Hai,


404
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,600
since you won't listen to me,


405
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,480
don't blame me, then.


406
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,010
Zhan Tian Yi,


407
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,110
let her go


408
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
and take the Terminator Profound Bomb,


409
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,120
or get bombed into pieces!


410
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,360
Fine.


411
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
Okay!


412
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,530
Take it.


413
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,930
The Terminator Profound Bomb.


414
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,670
What a fancy finding.


415
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,320
Rong'er.


416
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,590
Mo Hai.


417
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,150
Mo Hai.


418
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,000
In the future,


419
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,420
take good care of yourself.


420
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,460
Don't be too obsessed with forging.


421
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,220
Don't forget to eat.


422
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,110
Also,


423
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,500
remember to cultivate.


424
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,760
Otherwise,


425
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,440
you'll grow old.


426
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,910
Anything unusual?


427
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,160
No.


428
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,220
Here I am!


429
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,480
Xie Yi?


430
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,470
Xie Yi's here.


431
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,180
The lunatic has finally come.


432
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,850
Qin Lie.


433
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,500
Wait for me.


434
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,970
You broke your promise, Xie Yi!


435
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,470
I'm not here to talk,


436
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,750
but to kill.


437
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,650
Formation!


438
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,790
Palm of Great God!


439
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,780
Again!


440
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,020
Essence of Frost!


441
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,430
Not bad, kid.


442
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,620
You've got skills.


443
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,790
Let's see how long you can hold on.


444
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,500
Master Lang Xie,


445
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,190
get him to Spiritual Lines Hall.


446
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,510
You want to bind him
with the Pillars' formation?


447
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,380
But the Blood Progenitor said you can't.


448
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,040
I have no choice,


449
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,890
but to go all out!


450
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,000
Okay.


451
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,500
If I'm going to die either way,


452
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,040
let's give it a go!


453
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,490
If I manage to
create the binding formation


454
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,130
with the 12 Pillars,


455
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,330
you must leave the plaza at once.


456
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,200
Retreat to the plaza!


457
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,330
Yes, sir!


458
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,050
Ouch, it hurts.


459
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't go.


460
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,210
Fine, run faster.


461
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm catching up.


462
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,460
Hurry up, Qin Lie!


463
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,830
Help me, Grandpa.


464
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,990
So, these are the Spiritual Lines Pillars?


465
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,790
What's he doing?


466
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,350
Netherworld's demon aura?


467
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,670
Hold your breath and leave the plaza.


468
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,530
Qin Lie, this is a nether passageway.


469
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,960
Opening it up


470
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,270
and releasing the Dark Nether Race
will endanger the Chilan human race.


471
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,300
Leave now!


472
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,860
I'm at my limit.


473
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,610
-Let's go.
-Let's go.


474
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,540
Hurry.


475
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,430
Why is there Netherworld demon aura here?


476
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,760
Retreat.


477
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,390
-Come on.
-Let's go.


478
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,110
Leave me. Run!


479
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,080
Come on.


480
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,240
Let's go.


481
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,470
Qin Lie!


482
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,190
Flowing Cloud Rainbow Butterfly.


483
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,990
Yu Shi!


484
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,330
Qin Lie, take the Demon Cleansing Pill!


485
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,910
Demon aura from Netherworld?


486
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,710
Demon aura from Netherworld?


487
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,650
Why is the demon aura here?


488
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,750
Use Demon Cleansing Pill


489
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,980
to purify it now.


490
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,890
What's happening out there?


491
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,990
Why is there demon aura?


492
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,220
Xie Yi attacked us.


493
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,150
Qin Lie wanted to fight him using


494
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,300
the 12 Pillars formation.


495
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,930
But who knew, under the Hall


496
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,600
was a nether passageway.


497
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,750
As it opened,


498
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,340
the demon aura and
countless nether beasts roared up.


499
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,450
What?


500
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,960
There's a nether passageway
under the Spiritual Lines Hall?


501
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,650
So, the 12 Pillars were actually


502
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,890
used to seal off the nether passageway.


503
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,000
How is everyone doing?


504
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,950
I already asked them to retreat,


505
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,740
and they're given Demon Cleansing Pills.


506
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,160
With Demon Cleansing Pills


507
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,440
made from Demon Purifying Grass,


508
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,160
our disciples are fine for now.


509
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,630
But Purple Mist Sea is very far from here.


510
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,150
Without anyone guarding there


511
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,850
or Demon Purifying Grass,


512
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,000
and there's only that many Pills we have,


513
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,320
I'm afraid that


514
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,660
the areas around here


515
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,520
will be tarnished
by demon aura in a few days.


516
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,530
The Dark Nether Race's troop
may invade us.


517
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,780
The five great sects,


518
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,720
Profound Heaven Alliance
and Eight Extremes Temple Sanctuary,


519
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,600
you caused this calamity.


520
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,120
If I'm lucky enough to survive this,


521
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,630
I'll never for give you all!


522
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,720
Qin Lie? It's him again!


523
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,030
Why did he remove
the Pillars all of a sudden?


524
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,260
It's all his fault.


525
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,780
Where's Qin Lie now?


526
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,510
The Hall went into chaos.


527
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,950
Qin Lie and Saintess Song
as well as Ling Yu Shi


528
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,170
dropped into the nether passageway
and went missing.


529
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,420
There's a total of
12 Spiritual Lines Pillars.


530
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,200
Since establishment,


531
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,840
Qin Lie's the only one
who could comprehend all of them.


532
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,940
If he died just like that...


533
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,700
So what if he dies?


534
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,660
He caused all the troubles.


535
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,310
I won't be satisfied


536
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,170
no matter how many times he dies.


537
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,130
Knock it off!


538
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,550
Everything Qin Lie did
was for the sake of our sect.


539
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,700
No wonder the abbot warned everyone


540
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,810
not to attack the Sect 700 years ago.


541
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,450
It turned out that he knew


542
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,950
the Spiritual Lines Hall


543
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,450
was sealing the nether passageway off.


544
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,110
Why didn't I think of that?


545
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,450
Even if you did,


546
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,970
who would believe you?


547
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,940
So, are we going to fight or not now?


548
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,710
We need the master's order.


549
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,620
Qin Lie...


550
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,520
Qin Lie brought the disaster upon us.


551
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,570
Will he have the nerve to be the master?


552
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,150
Please give us order, Master.


553
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,420
Where are Elder Mo and Commander Feng?


554
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,630
Feng Rong...


555
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,920
It was Zhan Tian Yi.


556
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,360
I'll kill him!


557
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,650
No need.


558
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,140
He's being bombed into pieces.


559
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
And the five great sects' men


560
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,300
have all absorbed the demon aura.


561
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,010
They're having a hard time themselves.
