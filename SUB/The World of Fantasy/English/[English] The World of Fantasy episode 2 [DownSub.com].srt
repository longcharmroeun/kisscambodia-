00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,930
[Episode 2]


4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,550
Young Master,


5
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,650
all the people of Ling Family
are ungrateful.


6
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,050
I think we should save
the window dressing.


7
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,370
Just arrest all of them.


8
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,690
They will have to submit to us.


9
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,180
If they still refuse to submit to us,


10
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,650
what do we do?


11
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,900
How is that possible?


12
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,140
When you stepped in just now,


13
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,900
how did they react?


14
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,930
Du Fei,


15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,380
Ling Borough


16
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,420
is located in the extreme north
of Chilan Continent.


17
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,180
It lacks supplies


18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,900
and is under the threat of spirit beasts.


19
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,050
The villagers here
do not have high qualification,


20
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,170
most of them are humans


21
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,260
with no talent for cultivation.


22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,500
This kind of people


23
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,079
have nothing to lose.


24
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,040
When they're under extreme stress,


25
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,970
they'll risk it all.


26
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,060
If you fight with them,


27
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,650
both sides will end up in destruction.


28
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,150
I was wrong.


29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,340
Qin Lie must die,


30
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,310
whether or not he's the murderer
who massacred the villages.


31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,950
You should know very well


32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,060
that you are a pawn which means nothing.


33
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,500
For the sake of winning Ling Family over,


34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,450
Du Shao Yang will keep you.


35
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,530
But the village massacres


36
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,090
definitely need a closure.


37
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,170
Du Shao Yang
will turn his back on you too.


38
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,370
You're so annoying.


39
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,580
So will they keep me or cast me aside?


40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,430
-You...
-Stand right there.


41
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm here to deliver food.


42
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,580
Let her in.


43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,329
I'm doing you this favour


44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,210
because you're the daughter
of the chief of Ling Family.


45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,700
Silly boy,


46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,780
keep in mind that you owe me a favour.


47
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,300
Go ahead.


48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,240
Are you hungry?


49
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,490
Here.


50
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,450
Has the moon come up?


51
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,329
The moon comes up very late this year.


52
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,610
Maybe it is also waiting for you.


53
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,820
Come,


54
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,140
give me your hand.


55
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,970
Burn it for me.


56
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,700
No.


57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,060
Father is figuring a way out.


58
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,720
You will get out of here.


59
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,020
Burn it yourself.


60
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,660
What if I can't get out?


61
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,140
Just listen to me.


62
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,079
How are things out there?


63
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,530
Du Shao Yang doesn't seem
concerned at all.


64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,460
He is at ease


65
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,860
with letting the Zhuos guard you.


66
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,420
The Zhuos


67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,370
actually sent two people
to monitor Du Shao Yang.


68
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,490
But those two people


69
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,920
have disappeared into thin air.


70
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,900
What is Du Shao Yang doing right now?


71
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,810
He and his subordinates


72
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,300
are taking a rest now.


73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,210
Are you trying to say...


74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,570
Go find Yu Xin.


75
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,180
Tell him not to act rashly.


76
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,220
Go there right now.


77
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,080
Tell him I'll figure out a way
to resolve this crisis.


78
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,900
Do you remember what I said


79
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,930
when I was carrying you
on the snowy field?


80
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,490
You said it's useless to worry.


81
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,460
Alright,


82
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,970
I'll listen to you.


83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,300
Qin Lie,


84
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,020
if striking can't stun you,
I'll beat you till you pass out.


85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,409
Ye, come over here.


86
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,930
Have you figured it out?


87
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,300
You don't want to die any more
after seeing your loved one, right?


88
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,580
That is exactly why I let her see you.


89
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,090
I guess you came
from early Natal Opening Realm,


90
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,460
you're not even that skilled.


91
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,740
If you don't wish to die,


92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,420
take your men and leave immediately.


93
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,680
The two warriors you asked
to guard the Du Family


94
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,410
have been killed by Du Shao Yang.


95
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
What are you talking about?


96
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,970
So these people were killed by me,


97
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,290
right?


98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,400
Yes.


99
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,650
They were killed by your Thunderbolt.


100
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,140
You're suspecting me


101
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,290
for the massacres of the 33 villages.


102
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,250
Now you come to Ling Borough
to arrest me.


103
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,530
That makes sense.


104
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,200
I know the power struggle of
Xingyun Pavilion is involved.


105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,650
But I still can't figure out


106
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,810
what you have up your sleeve.


107
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,090
Have you figured it out now?


108
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,010
Arresting a suspect for interrogation


109
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,180
will not do you any good.


110
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,810
But a Ling killed a Ye.


111
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,740
The Yes will definitely
condemn them for it.


112
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,690
In order to stop the Ling Family
from submitting to the Du Family,


113
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,010
the Ye Family will take the opportunity


114
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,200
to demolish Ling Borough.


115
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,050
The only family
who can take Ling Family under its wing


116
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,580
is Du Family.


117
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,180
That is why Ling Borough


118
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,820
has no choice but to submit to
the Du Family.


119
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,970
Not only can they force
Ling Borough to yield,


120
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,180
they can also get rid of Zhuo Qian


121
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,080
and deflate the Ye Family.


122
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,360
Should I say that you are despicable


123
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,700
or compliment you for being wise?


124
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,020
I do not want Xingyun Pavilion.


125
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,970
This is only my first step


126
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,040
to help my father
win the position of master.


127
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,900
So what if I was despicable


128
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,770
or wise?


129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,580
Does that mean anything?


130
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,640
This is only your first step.


131
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,860
Does that mean you'll be fair and square
in the future?


132
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,180
Qin Lie!


133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,770
What are you doing here?


134
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,140
What is happening?


135
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,970
They killed a Ye member.


136
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,800
Now they're trying to pin it on me.


137
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
Du Fei!


138
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,530
Qin Lie, run!


139
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,370
Find Gao Yu.


140
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,600
Let...


141
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,100
Let him go.


142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,730
Just leave already.


143
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,850
I don't want you to die here either.


144
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,900
I want you to die outside,


145
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,780
die on the vast snow field


146
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,500
till your remains perish.


147
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,290
Will you leave or not?


148
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
If you don't leave,


149
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
I'll kill him right now.


150
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,930
No!


151
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,450
Qin Lie, run!


152
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,900
Qin Lie, run!


153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,630
No!


154
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,660
I'll leave, I'll leave.


155
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,160
Young Master,


156
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,490
why didn't you kill Qin Lie
to cover it up?


157
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,140
Instead of killing him
and leaving no evidence,


158
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,540
we'll accuse him of fleeing.


159
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,850
He's badly injured.


160
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,850
He won't be able to make it anyway.


161
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,460
In that case,


162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,290
I will inform the Ling Family right away.


163
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,900
Wait for a little longer.


164
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,100
Yu Shi.


165
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Where is Yu Xin?


166
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,460
Don't worry.


167
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,050
He's an adult.
Do you think he'd get lost?


168
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,020
Does this


169
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,100
belong to Qin Lie?


170
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,420
Let me see.


171
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,480
I just want to see


172
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,540
what Qin Lie wrote in it.


173
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,610
Only the moon knows what you want.


174
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,050
Fine, fine,


175
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll find Yu Xin.


176
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,250
Yu Shi,


177
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
are you really not curious


178
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,020
about what Qin Lie wrote?


179
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Qin Lie,


180
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,730
the moon has come up.


181
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,790
[I'm as insignificant as a speck of dust,
they hardly spared me a glance.]


182
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,980
[I'll get to the highest, furthest, look
into their eyes, they'll look into mine.]


183
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,930
Bad news!


184
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,370
Bad news, Father!


185
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,540
Bad news.


186
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,340
Father, bad news.


187
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,810
Something happened to Qin Lie.


188
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,050
-Qin Lie!
-Qin Lie!


189
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,290
-Qin Lie!
-Qin Lie!


190
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,660
-Where are you, Qin Lie?
-Qin Lie!


191
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,170
-Qin Lie!
-Qin Lie!


192
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,540
-Qin Lie!
-Qin Lie!


193
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,040
-Yu Shi.
-Yu Shi.


194
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,860
Qin Lie!


195
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,660
Her Fire Poison has flared up.


196
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,170
Let's take her back first.


197
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,250
No.


198
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,730
That day I already knew


199
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,660
he must have noticed something.


200
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,490
I already knew


201
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,050
that he purposely sent me away.


202
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,900
But I still left.


203
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,810
Du Shao Yang intended to frame Qin Lie.


204
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,580
Even if you had stayed,


205
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,220
both of us could've only watched
him being hurt.


206
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,490
Yu Shi,


207
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,490
you haven't rested for two days.


208
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,160
Your body won't be able to take it.


209
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,540
How about this? Ling Ying
and Ling Xin will take you home first.


210
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,930
Yu Xin and I will continue searching.


211
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,970
We will find him no matter what,


212
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,250
alive,


213
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,250
or dead.


214
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,170
No.


215
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,560
The first group who went out to search
last night came back and said


216
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,290
that they saw a corpse
beside the snow cliff.


217
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,840
I must go and see.


218
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,850
-Yu Shi!
-Yu Shi!


219
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,240
Yu Shi.


220
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,730
Last night, I really hated to disturb


221
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,160
your annual moon viewing event.


222
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,850
Hence, I waited until the moon went down


223
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,370
before I asked my subordinate


224
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,290
to announce Qin Lie's murder and escape.


225
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,250
Now that the sky has turned bright.


226
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,100
Do you have any result


227
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,370
after a long night of discussion?


228
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,580
The people of the borough


229
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,800
have all set out to look for Qin Lie.


230
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,790
We will be informed once they find him.


231
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,650
So what will happen


232
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,339
if they can't find him?


233
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,800
Qin Lie will never murder anyone.


234
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,380
If he hadn't killed anyone,
why would he escape?


235
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
That's because you wanted to kill him!


236
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,579
Then who is dead now?


237
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,130
Last night, Hua Yu Xin testified


238
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,770
and said he saw Qin Lie kill Du Fei
with his own eyes.


239
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,700
Hua Yu Xin also said


240
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,500
that he did not see


241
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,130
Qin Lie kill Ye Family with his own eyes.


242
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,580
Instead, it was you


243
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,460
who threatened Qin Lie with his life
to force him to leave.


244
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,210
Hua Yu Xin is Qin Lie's best friend.


245
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,700
If he wants to clear his name,


246
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,260
he will naturally make excuses.


247
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,380
I believe all of you have witnessed


248
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,740
how the Ye Family died.


249
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,740
In the entire Ling Borough,
other than Qin Lie,


250
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,740
who else is familiar
with thunder technique?


251
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,770
If no one else in Ling Borough knows,
can you guarantee there's no one out there


252
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,460
or even your people know it?


253
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,010
So you'd rather have
the whole Ling Borough destroyed


254
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,980
to protect Qin Lie.


255
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,350
I will not mention how much Mr Qin


256
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,800
has contributed to Ling Borough,


257
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,050
let's just talk about Qin Lie.


258
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,640
He is frank and upright.


259
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,650
Even if he has really killed them,


260
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,040
I believe


261
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,260
that he was definitely forced to do so.


262
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,410
If Qin Lie can't make it out alive,


263
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,380
the only people who knows the truth


264
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,460
is you, Young Master Du,


265
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,090
right?


266
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,880
The truth is


267
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,700
the Ye member was killed
by thunder technique.


268
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,770
But Qin Lie was the only person there.


269
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,370
As you see it,


270
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,950
what would the Ye Family think?


271
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,460
Then what do we do?


272
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,580
One of our family members


273
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,430
had died too.


274
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,860
I will not hold anyone to account.


275
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,530
But the Ye member
died at the Ling Family.


276
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,010
That's a hard nut to crack.


277
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,160
Even if I wish to stand surety
for the Ling Family,


278
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,250
there are also some difficulties.


279
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,500
Young Master Du, do you have any idea?


280
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,130
Just tell us.


281
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,530
If there's a matrimonial alliance
between the Du and Ling families,


282
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,770
perhaps


283
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,050
it won't be that difficult.


284
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,020
[Land of Frost]


285
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,930
We've inspected this area.


286
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,970
-You may leave now.
-Yes, sir.


287
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,650
Saintess,


288
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,880
my subordinates have inspected this area.


289
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,410
So far everything is fine.


290
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,620
[Song Ting Yu,
Saintess of Profound Heaven Alliance]


291
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,940
[Xie Jing Xuan,
Saintess of Eight Extremes Temple]


292
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,800
Saintess, he's come round.


293
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,760
That leaf is mine.


294
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,890
Give it back to me!


295
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Get him up.


296
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,860
This leaf is a spirit herb.


297
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,170
So you're from Ling Borough.


298
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,260
Who are you?


299
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,860
We are...


300
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,210
Don't tell him.


301
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,460
But I want to tell him.


302
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,410
What is this place?


303
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,930
This place


304
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,890
should be Ice Cliff Forest.


305
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,650
How far is this place
from Snow God Valley?


306
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,530
Snow God Valley?


307
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,450
If you're going to Snow God Valley,


308
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,930
then you've taken the wrong road.


309
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,070
You've been there?


310
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,740
Of course he has, that's how
he knows we've taken the wrong road.


311
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,220
I've never been there,


312
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,330
but I've heard about it.


313
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,580
Snow God Valley is in the North.


314
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,650
But you're heading towards the West.


315
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,500
Since you know,


316
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,890
then you will lead the way.


317
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,380
Why should I?


318
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,810
Because we're here
to capture Soul Reaping Beast.


319
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,340
Soul Reaping Beast is the most evil
spirit beast in the Netherworld.


320
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,800
It devours everything
to enhance its strength.


321
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,170
Ordinary blade and sword skills


322
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,700
can't do anything to it.


323
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,850
Only Thunderbolt can harm it.


324
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,620
Thunderbolt?


325
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,980
Do you guys know Thunderbolt?


326
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,790
How about you?


327
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,090
If you know, I'll take you there too.


328
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,740
Can you stop talking nonsense?


329
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,430
I can lead you there,


330
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,720
but you have to do me a favour.


331
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,880
Ling Borough is in trouble.


332
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,460
You have to help me
save Ling Borough first.


333
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,260
They're just ordinary people.


334
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,340
They all go through birth, ageing,
sickness and death.


335
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,100
So what if they're sacrificed?


336
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,820
But if we don't hunt down
Soul Reaping Beast,


337
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,460
not only Ling Borough,


338
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,620
the entire Chilan Continent
will suffer as well.


339
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,530
Take us to Snow God Valley
to kill Soul Reaping Best first.


340
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,810
Ling Borough
is on the verge of destruction!


341
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm killing the spirit beast
for the overall interest.


342
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,610
You just want to make your father happy.


343
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,860
One more word


344
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,170
and I will kill you first.


345
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,260
You're scaring me.


346
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,270
Will you go or not?


347
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm badly injured.


348
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,380
I can't walk.


349
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,380
I can heal you anytime,


350
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,100
but I can also take your life anytime.


351
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,430
Lead the way.


352
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,620
Alright.


353
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,740
I'll lead you there,


354
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,890
but you have to return the leaf
to me first.


355
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,090
Let's set out.


356
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,770
I want to marry his daughter,


357
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,980
but he seemed troubled.


358
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,540
Young Master, don't worry.


359
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,700
I've spread the word


360
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,770
regarding Du Family's marriage proposal
to the Lings.


361
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,500
Let his kin pressure him,


362
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,930
then he'll have no choice


363
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,130
but to marry his daughter off.


364
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Sir, may I know your name?


365
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,210
Liang Zhong.


366
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,460
[Liang Zhong, Profound Heaven Alliance]


367
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,190
Mr Liang.


368
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,420
I heard
that you address them as Saintess.


369
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,980
What are you trying to ask?


370
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,860
You better don't try anything funny.


371
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,000
I just want to find out their background.


372
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,260
Where are you from?


373
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,250
I came here with Saintess Song.


374
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,330
The fierce one?


375
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,210
Both of them


376
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,930
don't even know the direction.


377
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,600
Can they even


378
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,500
capture Soul Reaping Beast?


379
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,490
Saintess Song has profound spiritual power
and exquisite art of war.


380
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,930
No one dares to go against her order.


381
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,110
As for Saintess Xie...


382
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,450
I'll remind you something.


383
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,880
If you offend her,


384
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,960
I guarantee
that you will end up miserably.


385
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,220
Yu Shi, I'm back.


386
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,530
Do you feel better?


387
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,000
Did you find him?


388
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,290
We eventually got to Snow Cliff.


389
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,670
There was indeed a corpse there,


390
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,160
but it wasn't Qin Lie.


391
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,410
We wanted to continue searching,


392
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,120
but Yu Xin was freezing,


393
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,910
so we came back first.


394
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,320
But Yu Shi, don't worry.


395
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,100
That corpse really isn't Qin Lie.


396
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,600
Qin Lie is certainly still alive.


397
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,030
The snowy field is freezing,


398
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,130
spirit beasts are raging,


399
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,130
whereas Qin Lie is badly injured.


400
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,160
There's a slim chance that he'll survive.


401
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,210
Xuan Xuan,


402
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,580
deep down,
you have the same thought as well,


403
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,140
haven't you?


404
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,000
When I just arrived,


405
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,380
I realised the borough was deathly quiet.


406
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,280
I am afraid that the tide has turned.


407
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,910
Go and check it out.


408
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,980
I'll go right now.


409
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,740
How dare you run away from us!


410
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,170
Back then, it was you


411
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,580
who massacred the 33 villages.


412
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,620
While we're on our way
to hunt down Soul Reaping Beast,


413
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,340
we passed by mountains and villages.


414
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,010
No matter where we go,


415
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,770
it's inevitable
for the innocents to suffer.


416
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,510
Can you show some emotion when you speak?


417
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,220
So many people have died
but you're still unconcerned.


418
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,860
Qin Lie,


419
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,250
we brought a total of 3,510 people


420
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,290
to kill Soul Reaping Beast.


421
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,910
After several fierce battles,


422
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,280
these people are what we have left.


423
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,130
After going through
several fierce battles,


424
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,460
the saintesses are also suffering
from severe injuries.


425
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,920
Now they haven't recovered yet.


426
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,880
Is Soul Reaping Beast in Snow God Valley?


427
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,160
We dispatched a troop there.


428
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,290
Those who were alive reported


429
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,040
that Snow God Valley is the place
where Soul Reaping Beast recuperates.


430
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,080
I can lead you there.


431
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,720
I can also help you
hunt Soul Reaping Beast down.


432
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,510
Apart from that,


433
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,760
I also practice thunder technique.


434
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,520
But I have one condition.


435
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,670
Back then, you accidentally killed


436
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,520
thirty three villages.


437
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,530
But now, Xingyun Pavilion
is condemning Ling Borough for this.


438
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,350
Send someone over


439
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,200
to clear Ling Borough's name first.


440
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,350
No.


441
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,990
Hunting down Soul Reaping Beast
is an important matter.


442
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,160
If I have one less person,
I'll have less strength.


443
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
So I can't lose any of them.


444
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,800
You...


445
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,830
The strong ones are ruthless.


446
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,680
It is true indeed.


447
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,990
Let's go.


448
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,590
They said they'll arrest those
who practice thunder technique.


449
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,070
In fact,


450
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,040
they're coming for us Lings.


451
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,230
In order to win the position of master,


452
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,040
Ye and Du have been
in secret power struggle for years.


453
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,400
Now Du Shao Yang is threatening us
with matrimonial alliance


454
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,710
because he is trying


455
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,570
to make us side with the Du Family.


456
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,160
They said Qin Lie is a murderer.


457
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,750
Who would buy that?


458
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,590
I don't even need to think to know


459
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,040
that it was Du Shao Yang
who hid some men with thunder technique,


460
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,070
killed the people
and pinned it on Qin Lie.


461
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,750
Now he's threatening us.


462
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,040
But so what?


463
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,400
Does he have any proof?


464
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,200
The three of you, get this done for me.


465
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,530
Cover me from the spies of Du Shao Yang.


466
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,750
I'm leaving to meet Ye Yang Qiu.


467
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,060
What?


468
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,830
Since we can't run away from this trouble,


469
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,110
then we should get involved in it.


470
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,240
The Du Family wants to rope us in,


471
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,070
so does the Ye Family.


472
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,160
Cheng Ye,


473
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
are you out of your mind?


474
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,150
I bet you have a hidden agenda.


475
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,680
You just want to protect your daughter.


476
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,400
I just want to protect
the pride of the Ling Family.


477
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,470
Our Ling Family


478
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,350
is at the extreme north.


479
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,230
The life we live here is the toughest.


480
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,560
But for over 20,000 years,


481
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,350
our kins


482
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,440
have shielded us from all the troubles.


483
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,750
That's how we came this far.


484
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,950
Think properly.


485
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,440
Since when have we chosen
to not fight back?


486
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,870
Since when have we chosen
to await our doom?


487
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,230
If we were to submit,


488
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,570
we would make the call


489
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,470
as to who we submit to.


490
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,230
Now the Du Family shows us no mercy.


491
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,950
Then we should bring them down first.


492
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,230
Du Hai Tian is a ruthless man.


493
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,860
If he finds out,


494
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,710
Ling Borough will have no choice
but to die.


495
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,230
As for Ye Yang Qiu, the chief of
Ye Family is a wolf in sheep's clothing.


496
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,200
If we rely on him,


497
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,870
it will do no good as well.


498
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,040
You're out of your mind.


499
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,350
You're totally out of your mind!


500
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,470
Chief, why are you
making a big deal out of it?


501
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,280
Isn't marrying your daughter to them
a good thing?


502
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,950
You'll be so proud.


503
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,350
Chief!


504
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
You are...


505
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,440
Chief,


506
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,590
we've heard
about the matrimonial alliance.


507
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,920
What's your plan?


508
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,080
As long as you give us an order,


509
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,410
we will stand by you.


510
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,640
Even if we have to fight it out
with the Du Family,


511
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,040
we won't have second thoughts.


512
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,420
Yes, we won't have second thoughts!


513
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,030
But if you're marrying your daughter off,


514
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,400
Yu Shi has to agree first.


515
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,140
Exactly. Ling Borough
will not be threatened by the Dus.


516
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,120
That's right.


517
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,450
As the saying goes, daughter should
be married to a eligible man.


518
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,070
Even if we're marrying off our daughter,


519
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,230
we should walk tall.


520
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,160
Yes, we shouldn't be bullied by the Dus!


521
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,680
Alright, alright.


522
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,440
Folks, I'm very grateful


523
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,640
for all your support.


524
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,950
Thank you.


525
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,950
Thank you to all of you.


526
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,520
[How far can they go?]


527
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,640
[How far do you want them to go?]


528
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,080
Yu Shi.


529
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,080
Yu Shi.


530
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,360
Yu Shi.


531
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
Xingyun Pavilion is here to force me
to get married.


532
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,110
Yu Shi, you knew.


533
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,520
Are you giving up?


534
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,470
Qin Lie might still be alive.


535
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
He will come back.


536
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,830
Xingyun Pavilion is on the warpath.


537
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,230
I can't wait until he comes back.


538
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,990
Hold on.


539
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,350
What's the matter?


540
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,870
Something's wrong with this lake.


541
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,530
You guys, go check it out over there.


542
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,520
-Yes.
-Yes.


543
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,550
This is Hanji Lake.


544
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,719
Wait for order here. Do not go in rashly.


545
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,150
Qin Lie,


546
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,550
what is going on?


547
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,310
There's a Gold Devouring Black Tortoise
in the lake.


548
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,350
What is that?


549
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,860
Gold Devouring Black Tortoise
wakes up every six months


550
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,580
and goes to sleep every six months.


551
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,400
It is spring now.


552
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,790
It should be still asleep now.


553
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,280
How can it eat humans if it's asleep?


554
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,200
I heard about it from someone else.


555
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,970
Gold Devouring Black Tortoise
loves eating metal.


556
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,870
Even when it's asleep,


557
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,110
it can still exude suction to metal.


558
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,000
All of you are wearing iron armours.


559
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,450
Once you step on the ice,


560
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,570
you'll naturally be sucked
by Gold Devouring Black Tortoise.


561
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,000
Remove your armour.


562
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,990
Cross the lake.


563
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Those two weak girls


564
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,720
don't even say a word
although they're freezing.


565
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,960
Weak girls?


566
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,400
What are you doing?


567
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,400
I want to let him know
that we're not weak girls.


568
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,030
Go get it!


569
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,190
Now!


570
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,600
You...


571
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,240
You're already injured.


572
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,350
The lake is freezing.
You won't be able to take it.


573
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,770
How could you mess with her
when you knew she's injured?


574
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,960
Jump in and save her!


575
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Why don't you do it?


576
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,300
It's none of my business.


577
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,700
You're the one who should do it.


578
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,110
Leaving someone for dead
isn't something a gentleman should do.


579
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,710
Saintess.


580
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,210
Saintess. Help her up.


581
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,950
Saintess, the box...


582
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,510
Don't mention the box ever again.


583
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,710
Let's set out.


584
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,750
Set out!


585
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,490
Pervert.
