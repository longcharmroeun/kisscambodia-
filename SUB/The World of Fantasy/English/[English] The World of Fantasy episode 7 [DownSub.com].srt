[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 7]


4
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,610
Qin Lie.


5
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,930
I brought you some food.


6
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,190
I'm not hungry.


7
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,990
I'll stay with you.


8
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,310
No need.


9
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,579
After my sister married Du Hai Tian,


10
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,160
she brought me to Xingyun Pavilion.


11
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,140
But,


12
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,430
I'd still spend a few days
in Ling Borough every month.


13
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,940
And I was so absorbed
in cultivation everyday


14
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,430
that I forgot to take a break.


15
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,190
While you


16
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,130
would cook for me everyday.


17
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,930
It's nothing.


18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,430
The food may be nothing,


19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,500
but it was about


20
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,350
our friendship.


21
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,650
[You're all the same.]


22
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,810
[You forgot to eat
once you start cultivating.]


23
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,350
[I bet]


24
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,710
[you'll starve to death one day.]


25
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,040
[The unfair life in Xingyun Pavilion]


26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,240
[brought you back to Ling Borough
for a breath of fresh air, isn't it?]


27
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,360
[You're imagining things.]


28
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,540
[Looks like there's not much fun
in becoming a young master there.]


29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,360
[Did they talk about
the patronage you got at your back,]


30
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,940
[and despise you?]


31
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,410
[I told you,]


32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,480
[you're imagining things.]


33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,829
[Don't give me that.]


34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,079
[Everyone needs someone to rely on.]


35
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,320
[Qin Lie is your close friend.]


36
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,440
[You can talk to him.]


37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
[He doesn't need to know
what's in my mind.]


38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
[I just need you to know that.]


39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,930
[Whenever I have nowhere]


40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,690
to pour out the sorrow in my heart,


41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,770
you're the only one
who understands how I feel.


42
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,550
And you're the only one


43
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,090
who would lend me a shoulder.


44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,770
I've never forgotten


45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,760
what you did for me.


46
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,930
Now that


47
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,140
Qin Lie's no longer around...


48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,550
He's still alive.


49
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,270
He'll be back.


50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,600
He promised to stay with me till the end.


51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,090
There's no way he'll break it.


52
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,450
That was my promise.


53
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,790
Everything Qin Lie confessed to you


54
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,339
was my thought.


55
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,550
I wrote


56
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,190
every word of it.


57
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,860
So,


58
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,800
this was what happened.


59
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,760
Yes.


60
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,480
The same words,


61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,640
when spoken by another person,


62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,080
made a great difference.


63
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,290
Since you're going to wait for him,


64
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,840
then the more
you should take care of yourself.


65
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,730
It is true


66
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,180
that I have thought


67
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,470
about replacing Qin Lie one day.


68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,100
But I also know that


69
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,080
I won't get the chance from you.


70
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,490
You'll wait for him


71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,830
no matter how long it will be, right?


72
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,160
I will always wait for him.


73
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,460
-So, Gao Yu, please stop...
-Don't stop me...


74
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,409
From waiting for my buddy.


75
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,900
Come on.


76
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,920
Let's grab a bite first.


77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,650
I, the young master of Xingyun Pavilion,


78
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,610
have actually become an abandoned pawn.


79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,110
In order to make my father


80
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,870
the Master,


81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,570
I sacrificed all the people
of Ling Borough.


82
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,830
Yet in the end, everyone hates me.


83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,030
The Master knows that you've suffered.


84
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,670
However,
the Profound Heaven Emissary is here.


85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,910
He has to focus on the bigger picture.


86
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,560
Qin Lie was right.


87
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,300
I am a very calculating man.


88
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,260
He chose Ling Borough


89
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,590
and became a hero.


90
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,970
I chose Song Ting Yu...


91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,820
You're a man who aims high.


92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,060
Of course you'd choose Saintess Song
over Ling Borough.


93
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,780
You're not calculating.


94
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,720
You're just decisive enough


95
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,260
to survive in this world.


96
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,990
Saintess Song is like that.


97
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,840
You, too.


98
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,909
That's bullshit.


99
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,460
We're just plotting against each other


100
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,260
for our own agenda.


101
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,340
I am like this.


102
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,480
So is Song Ting Yu.


103
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,860
In order to not offend the Master of Gelid


104
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,080
and please Ling Borough,


105
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,810
she punished me.


106
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,960
How shameful.


107
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,560
How shameful!


108
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,000
I hate Song Ting Yu.


109
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,630
And I loathe Qin Lie!


110
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,360
How is he better than me?


111
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,950
Get him here.


112
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,430
I'll settle the score with him.


113
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,170
Young Master, you're drunk.


114
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,409
Qin Lie died in Silent Abyss.


115
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,400
Qin Lie died?


116
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,230
Qin Lie is dead?


117
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,060
He became a great hero


118
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,360
no one can ever surpass.


119
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,150
I'll never be able to beat him,


120
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,830
as


121
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,800
I can't compete with a dead man.


122
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,880
There's no more wine. Get me some wine.


123
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,280
You've drunk all the wine here,
Young Master.


124
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,470
Let's go back.


125
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,060
I want wine. Get me more wine.


126
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,570
Hurry up!


127
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Yes, Young Master.


128
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,320
Qin Lie is dead.
Who else can be my competitor?


129
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,360
Song Ting Yu?


130
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,700
-That wench...
-Stop following me.


131
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,850
-Qi Qi. Qi Qi.
-Stop following me around.


132
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,080
Don't go.


133
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,640
Stop there.


134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,290
I swear I'm fond of you.


135
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,360
It's over between us, okay?


136
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,290
It's not okay, Qi Qi.


137
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,450
You hit on me first.


138
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,740
And now you're telling me
that you no longer like me


139
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,040
before I even get to look at your face.


140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,300
Why, Qi Qi?


141
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,620
Don't call me Qi Qi.


142
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,870
How'd you like me to call you?


143
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,980
Tang Tang? Si Si?


144
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,200
Qi Qi,


145
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,710
tell me. I'll change it.


146
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,950
Are you going to let go of me?


147
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,400
Never!


148
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,750
Get up.


149
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,590
Get up and talk.


150
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,620
Wipe away your tears.


151
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,590
Wailing baby, are you even a man?


152
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,210
Why are you pestering me
when I no longer like you?


153
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,330
Such submission to a woman...


154
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,510
If all men are as useless as you,


155
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,310
women would be doomed to die alone.


156
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,470
Get lost!


157
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
Qi Qi. Qi Qi!


158
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,120
Why are you following me?


159
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,050
Are you


160
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,800
charmed by me too?


161
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,140
-This is on behalf of that man!
-One for you too!


162
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,130
How dare you slap me.


163
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,620
How dare you smack me!


164
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,490
Young Master!


165
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,990
Young Master.


166
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,160
An assumed well-dressed beast


167
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,550
turned out to be a sad man.


168
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,760
He actually had the nerve to slap me.


169
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,100
Father!


170
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,080
Xuan Xuan.


171
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,320
Father.


172
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,530
-I missed you a lot.
-Luckily.


173
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,210
I've grown stronger, Father.


174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,160
They are...


175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,030
I'm Li Zhong Zheng,


176
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,700
a disciple of Qisha Valley.


177
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,520
This is my sister in the Valley, Lu Li.


178
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,940
I was travelling around as instructed,


179
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,280
and met your daughter
whom I wished to recruit.


180
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,970
Xuan Xuan was given a chance
to cultivate at Qisha Valley,


181
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,360
but there was news about
bad things happening in Ling Borough.


182
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,960
Xuan Xuan's negative thought might be
an obstacle in her path to ascend,


183
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,360
so, my master told us


184
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,210
to come back with Xuan Xuan.


185
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,120
But we were too late.


186
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,790
All of us in Ling Borough


187
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,870
are grateful to your master
for his kindness.


188
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,960
Xuan Xuan is indeed lucky to be able


189
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,610
to join Qisha Valley.


190
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,950
She came back


191
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,620
more mature and calm.


192
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,160
That's good news.


193
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,550
Exactly.


194
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,430
Xuan Xuan's been long stuck
in mid-Kaiyuan Realm.


195
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,970
But in less than a month,


196
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,050
she has almost conquered it.


197
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,570
As expected from Qisha Valley.


198
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,200
Thank you.


199
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,430
There aren't many people left
in Ling Borough,


200
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,030
but we do have talented people.


201
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,290
Maybe you could pick one or two of them


202
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,280
to receive your guidance at Qisha Valley.


203
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,020
Not having many people,
but not short of talented ones.


204
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,660
I'm surprised to learn
that Ling Borough in this arid land


205
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,640
has a wealth of talents.


206
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,490
Lu Li.


207
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,530
You must be


208
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,680
Xuan Xuan's older sister, Yu Shi,


209
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,610
[Qisha Valley, Li Zhong Zheng]


210
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
whom she kept mentioning.


211
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,240
Yes, I am.


212
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,840
Are you suffering from a poisoned wound,
Miss Yu Shi?


213
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,520
I grew up with Fire Poison inside of me.


214
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,900
We couldn't find a cure all this years.


215
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,840
May I check it?


216
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,140
What a strange Fire Poison.


217
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,860
I've never seen it.


218
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,800
But there's a spirit skill in Qisha Valley


219
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,960
that can revive one's energy with spirit.


220
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,810
As water can be turned into
Heavenly Water,


221
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,270
one can cleanse everything
if she can cleanse herself.


222
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,040
Why don't you come to Qisha Valley with me


223
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,760
after we're done here?


224
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,570
Maybe practising the spirit skills
of Water Valley


225
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,820
will help relieve your condition.


226
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,440
I heard that in Qisha Valley,
skies are blue


227
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,200
and clouds are white.


228
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,410
If it's such a beautiful place,
you have to go there.


229
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,530
But if I do,


230
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,640
you'll be left alone, Father.


231
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,670
In the past
when Mr Qin Shan was still around,


232
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,350
he could use his Heavenly Power


233
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,370
to restrain the Fire Poison in you.


234
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,500
But his whereabouts is unknown now,


235
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,180
and your poison has been attacking.


236
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,470
-If you're not treated...
-If I'm not treated,


237
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,190
I'll die.


238
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,620
That's why I'm going to Qisha Valley,


239
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,040
not only to be treated,


240
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,690
but also to become stronger.


241
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,370
By the time I return,


242
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,620
I'll be able to protect Ling Borough.


243
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,440
Don't do it for Ling Borough.


244
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,470
Do it for yourself.


245
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,710
Yu Shi,


246
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,580
I know that you're a good daughter.


247
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,520
But seeing you struggling


248
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,100
and forcing yourself


249
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,100
pains my heart as a father.


250
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm your eldest daughter.


251
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,980
It's only right


252
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,650
that I do all this.


253
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,940
In that case,


254
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,540
why did you hesitate?


255
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,510
I don't think Qin Lie is dead.


256
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,490
If he comes back


257
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,160
and I'm not around...


258
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,700
Actually, if you're in his heart,


259
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,900
he'll come for you.


260
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,500
But if there's not your room
in his heart,


261
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,480
it makes no difference


262
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,020
whether you meet each other or not.


263
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,800
There was once Xuan Xuan


264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,340
left Yu Xin in pain.


265
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,980
She is finally back,


266
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,960
but just to find out she's lost him.


267
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,880
You've never had Qin Lie.


268
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,550
You can't call this losing.


269
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,210
Don't stay back


270
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,240
or leave for anyone's sake.


271
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,260
Whatever decision you make,


272
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,150
make it for yourself.


273
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,849
Just go.


274
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,579
Be a better you,


275
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,089
and become someone you'll like.


276
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,440
Uncle Hua, please open the door.


277
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,820
Just go home.


278
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,550
Yu Xin is dead.


279
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,100
There's no use kneeling here.


280
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,260
The Fire Poison is extremely strange.


281
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,680
Rather than a poisoned wound,


282
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,880
it's more like a...


283
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,600
A what?


284
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,280
A pure energy.


285
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,130
A peculiar power of the fire spirit.


286
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,980
It's complicated.


287
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,010
As if something is sealed inside.


288
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,990
Why is there such a seal?


289
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,020
A seal made from spiritual power?


290
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,700
That's impossible.


291
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,030
Such seal only exists


292
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,710
in the Golden Central Land.


293
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,420
The Golden Central Land?


294
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,390
In my years of cultivation,


295
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,900
I've been travelling a lot,


296
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,660
but I never made it out of
Chilan Continent.


297
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,300
I wouldn't even dare to think about


298
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,720
bathing in the Golden Holy Light.


299
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,950
Chilan Continent


300
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,610
is just an isolated land
at the edge of the world.


301
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,820
Why is such spiritual power found here?


302
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,570
Upon passing by their medicine garden,


303
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,250
I noticed a spiritual herb
that's almost impossible to grow.


304
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,630
But in this arid land,


305
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,170
it is growing abundantly.


306
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,040
That blind lady from Wood Valley
who's reached the peak of Ruyi Realm


307
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,060
has been growing spiritual herbs
for 2000 years.


308
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,130
Even she can't do that.


309
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,140
But this Kaiyuan Realm beginner,
Ling Yu Shi, did it.


310
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,560
Are you sure it was Ling Yu Shi?


311
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,840
I've asked a lot of people along the way.


312
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,220
I won't be mistaken.


313
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,620
Are you sure it's not because
she's pretty?


314
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,880
No matter how pretty she is,


315
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,590
you're still better-looking.


316
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,850
As if I'll believe that.


317
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,710
Xuan Xuan,


318
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,380
go back and take a rest.


319
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,680
You're weak.


320
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,440
You should go back first.


321
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,500
I'll stay here.


322
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,390
This changes nothing.


323
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,900
I'll kneel with you.


324
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,810
Maybe Uncle Hua will soften


325
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,390
and open the door.


326
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,820
I was reckless. I left,


327
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,690
instead of staying back
and protect Ling Borough


328
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,030
and Yu Xin.


329
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,630
I deserve the punishment.


330
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
You didn't just leave.


331
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,190
You were looking for a solution
for Ling Borough.


332
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,080
And where


333
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,530
is the solution?


334
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,770
It's in our hands,


335
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,620
as well as our hearts.


336
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,430
Yu Shi,


337
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,050
you don't think Qin Lie is dead?


338
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,700
His body isn't found.


339
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,940
Why should I believe he's dead?


340
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,450
I, too, will not believe Yu Xin's dead


341
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,570
before I see his dead body.


342
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,590
Qin Lie has returned.


343
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,770
It was all my fault.


344
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,370
I was tricked by the Soul Reaping Beast,


345
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,190
and mistook Yu Shi as the Beast,


346
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,780
causing so many lives.


347
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,430
Yu Shi was hurt as well.


348
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,950
Qin Lie,


349
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,900
are you a man of Ling Borough?


350
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,790
I am.


351
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,730
Then, don't be on your knees.


352
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,630
You killed the Soul Reaping Beast


353
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,260
and avenged the villagers.


354
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,990
All of us


355
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,220
-owe you our lives.
-That's right.


356
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,940
-You saved our lives.
-Absolutely.


357
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,480
Qin Lie, you did a good job.


358
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,860
Yeah, well done.


359
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:36,180
-Well done!
-Well done!


360
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,610
Come on.


361
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,110
Qin Lie.


362
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,820
Where's Yu Xin?


363
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,220
Where's Yu Xin?


364
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,170
[Ancestral Tablet]


365
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,250
It's all thanks to our ancestors


366
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,350
that you survived the grave danger.


367
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,930
Uncle Ling,


368
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,870
as for Yu Xin...


369
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,730
I couldn't bring him back.


370
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,760
You're not to blame.


371
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,750
Tell me what happened back then.


372
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,310
All I remember is
when the thunder struck,


373
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,950
Yu Xin threw himself at me
and took it in my place.


374
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,760
Silent Abyss was surrounded
by Thunderbolts.


375
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,670
What was he, an outlander, doing there?


376
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,260
That was a deep abyss.


377
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,680
Anyone would be smashed to pieces
from the jump.


378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,590
But he managed to land on me and saved me.


379
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,300
This is indeed strange.


380
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,490
Furthermore,


381
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,730
when I woke up,


382
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,460
I vaguely saw a weird person


383
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,650
beside me.


384
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
He was an old man.


385
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,680
Could it be


386
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,540
that Mr Qin Shan has returned?


387
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,890
I was heavily wounded.


388
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,110
Although I didn't see his face clearly,


389
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,270
I'm certain he is someone familiar.


390
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,780
Maybe...


391
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,570
No.


392
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,060
It can't be him.


393
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,520
But I'm sure


394
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,120
that he wasn't my grandpa.


395
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,220
Then,


396
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,640
after God knows how long,


397
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,930
by the time I woke up again,


398
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,130
I found myself
at the gate of Ling Borough.


399
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,420
Don't exhaust your mind.


400
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,930
You're home now. Take a good rest.


401
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,090
Ling Borough


402
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,670
is counting on you from now on.


403
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,210
This is my home.


404
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,530
I'll do my best.


405
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,540
Where's Song Ting Yu?


406
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,010
She left


407
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,360
with Xingyun Pavilion's men the other day.


408
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,510
But, I heard that


409
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,640
she had someone stayed back
to look after the Pavilion.


410
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,200
Stayed back to look after
Xingyun Pavilion?


411
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,680
Song Ting Yu wants us dead?


412
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,250
Don't think too much. Get a good rest.


413
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,800
We can't afford
to pick on Xingyun Pavilion,


414
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,930
what's more Saintess Song.


415
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,820
Qin Lie.


416
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,370
Gao Yu!


417
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,100
[The Mother of Land]


418
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,520
[and the son of the God of War
can't fall in love.]


419
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,500
[If the evil people find it out,]


420
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,790
[before they can even
enjoy the relationship,]


421
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,410
[troubles have already been awaiting.]


422
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,970
[But now,]


423
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,180
[love is already born between you two.]


424
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,250
[You want a fierce battle]


425
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,180
[or you'll breakup?]


426
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,120
[It's your choice.]


427
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,850
Who was the Mother of Land?


428
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,310
And who was that son of God of War?


429
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,080
Was it me?


430
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,590
Or was it him?


431
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,990
A fierce battle?


432
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,280
A breakup?


433
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,340
What does that mean?


434
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,660
Yu Shi.


435
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,240
What are you doing here?


436
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,900
Look at you mumbling.


437
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,830
Are you trying to apologize?


438
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,520
I thought the Soul Reaping Beast got you.


439
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,580
That's why I proposed marriage
from the Chief


440
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,560
as an arrangement to kill the Beast.


441
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,930
So, I...


442
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,120
I've forgiven you.


443
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,100
At least


444
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,260
I get to marry you as I wished.


445
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,800
Yu Shi.


446
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,920
What? You want to break your promise?


447
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,930
That's not it.


448
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,420
The marriage...


449
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,490
I was just kidding.


450
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,940
Since it was a strategy,


451
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,020
then we can't take the marriage seriously.


452
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,460
I haven't finished yet.


453
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,690
Actually, when I decided to take the beast
down with me at Silent Abyss,


454
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,680
-the last thing in my mind was...
-I've decided to cultivate at Qisha Valley.


455
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,840
Why the sudden decision?


456
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,820
Was it your Fire Poison?


457
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,530
No,


458
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,340
but it must be eliminated eventually.


459
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,100
Curing it


460
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,120
may help me cultivate.


461
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,260
Can it really be cured?


462
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,090
Awesome.


463
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,410
I used to think


464
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,340
that when I'm as powerful as my grandpa,


465
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,230
I'll restrain the Fire Poison for you too.


466
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,160
I was worried
that my progress was too slow.


467
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,570
Lucky for us.


468
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,890
If you can recover fully,


469
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,830
I'll be extremely relieved.


470
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,910
From now on, I can share the burden


471
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,110
of Ling Borough with you.


472
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,910
Okay.


473
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,730
I'll teach you Qin family's
Thunder Incantation by then.


474
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,220
When you can conjure thunder,


475
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,070
I guarantee everything's bearable for you.


476
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,870
Who cares to learn
your Thunder Incantation?


477
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,810
Why, you're eager to be my master?


478
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,840
Of course.


479
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,380
If I'm your master,


480
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,540
I won't have to feel indebted to you
for all the food.


481
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,960
In case I'll feel guilty and ashamed


482
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,910
when you mock me with it in the future.


483
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,690
As a man,


484
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,320
dignity matters a lot.


485
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,830
Nonsense.


486
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,600
Did you treat Xuan Xuan like a girl


487
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,230
after swallowing the food she made?


488
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,990
Is that even food?


489
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,200
With her temper and cooking skills,


490
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,520
only Yu Xin


491
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,790
can control her.


492
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,140
Uncle Hua.


493
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,250
You're back?


494
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,970
Uncle Hua,


495
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,740
I'll take care of you from now on.


496
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,250
You're my father now.


497
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,210
The ground is cold.


498
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,970
You should sleep on the bed.


499
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,510
Come on.


500
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,420
Did you memorize the images?


501
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,400
What?


502
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,470
The images in your mind.


503
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,800
How did you know about that?


504
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,930
Did Yu Xin tell you before?


505
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,390
Memorize them when you're dreaming,


506
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,990
and draw them out after you woke up.


507
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,750
Try to remember as much as you can.


508
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,090
Draw them out everyday,
and practise every night.


509
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,680
You tend to become violent easily.


510
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,570
Practising that


511
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,900
is good for you.


512
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,490
Did those words come from you


513
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,600
or someone is telling me through you?


514
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,870
Uncle Hua.


515
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,670
Uncle Hua.


516
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,260
Uncle Hua!


517
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,800
What are you doing?


518
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,260
What exactly are those four images?


519
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,150
What image?


520
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,180
Who asked you


521
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,720
to tell me all this?


522
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,180
Qin Shan.


523
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,540
Grandpa?


524
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,170
Grandpa was here?


525
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,730
In my dream. He told me that in my dream.


526
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,240
In your dream?


527
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,270
Yes.


528
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,730
In my dream.


529
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,380
Du Shao Yang is here.


530
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,110
-He has the guts to show up?
-Yeah.


531
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,290
How dare you come here!


532
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,450
Du Shao Yang, how dare you show up here!


533
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,030
I'm here this time


534
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,920
to apologize.


535
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,890
May I see Chief Ling?


536
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,450
-Why should we let you?
-Why?


537
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,940
Who do you think you are?


538
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,490
You want to see the Chief?


539
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,340
Take my punch first.


540
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,660
So, can I see him now?


541
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,620
Chief. Elders.


542
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,850
Du Shao Yang came with a gift,


543
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,170
saying he's here to apologize.


544
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,820
Let him come in.


545
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,600
You guard the door.


546
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,610
Okay.


547
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,860
Let them in.


548
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,880
We'll wait here


549
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,820
and see what he's got up his sleeve.


550
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,110
Chief Ling,


551
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,699
my Young Master is here


552
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,110
in order for Du and Ling families
to be reconciled.


553
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,310
Here's a treasure from Xingyun Pavilion


554
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,460
to show our sincerity.


555
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,960
The first time this Du guy came,


556
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,949
he was swollen with arrogance,
wanting to kill Qin Lie.


557
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,449
He even kidnapped Yu Shi.


558
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,909
For the second time,


559
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,889
he showed up in a magnificent appearance,


560
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,790
and many villagers in Ling Borough
died or were wounded.


561
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,580
As for the third time,


562
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,070
what will he do?


563
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,449
Kill the entire village?


564
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,429
Or getting himself killed?


565
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,070
You don't have to seek death from us.


566
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,840
Saintess Song may do it herself.


567
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,070
That's right.


568
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,290
Saintess Song
wanted to kill him back then.


569
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,100
But Yu Shi was too nice


570
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,550
and let him go.


571
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,450
His life is being controlled by women.


572
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,480
What did he come to us for?


573
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,780
He's our guest.


574
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,120
Don't be angry, Young Master Du.


575
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,030
Looks like I've underestimated Chief Ling.


576
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,140
I thought you're a polite and honest man.


577
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,770
Turns out you're cunning.


578
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,020
For stepping up only after


579
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,340
they're done cursing me.


580
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,500
You won't die from all the harsh words.


581
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,890
The Ling Borough
has suffered a great loss.


582
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,100
It's only right
to let them vent their anger.


583
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,350
What can you get from an argument?


584
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,060
At the end of the day,


585
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,000
we're still nothing but pawns.


586
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,420
What brings you here?


587
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,020
The instruction of
the Profound Heaven Emissary


588
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,190
to restore the relationship
with Ling family with a gift.


589
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,980
It's up to all of you
whether Ling and Du families


590
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,750
will be abandoned or supported this time.


591
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,610
Many of us have died or wounded.


592
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,110
Ling Borough is almost destroyed.


593
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,970
We're too busy thinking about


594
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,090
rebuilding our home


595
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,540
to be occupied by other matters.


596
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,780
So, you don't mind us?


597
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,980
It's not that
I don't want to care about you.


598
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,360
Go and ask them


599
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,920
whether I should accept the gift.


600
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,560
I'll leave it here.


601
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,860
Good bye.


602
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,990
Get the heck out of here.


603
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,130
You're not welcomed here.


604
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,670
Leave!


605
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,880
-Leave!
-Get out of here.


606
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
-Get out of here.
-Leave!


607
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,060
-Get lost!
-Leave!


608
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,080
-You're not welcomed here.
-Leave, get out of here.


609
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,580
-Nice!
-Good job!


610
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,720
Good job!


611
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,040
What is this?


612
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,110
He lost his wife and son because of you.


613
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,920
What do you think that means?
Get out of here now!


614
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,210
-Get out of here!
-Get out of here!


615
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,340
Let's go.


616
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,780
-Get lost!
-Get lost!


617
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,630
Ling Xin, take care of Mr Hua.


618
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,810
Yes, Chief.


619
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,830
Come.


620
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,440
I'll kill all of them one day.


621
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,480
Come.


622
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,190
Surround them.


623
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,400
Trying to escape after murdering someone?


624
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,370
I've been kneeling here.


625
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,930
There was no noise.


626
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,170
Uncle Hua.


627
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,450
Someone broke Uncle Hua's skull


628
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,800
and killed him with this wooden pail.


629
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,460
-Did they get Du Shao Yang?
-No.


630
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,060
Qin Lie?


631
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,460
You're alive?


632
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,890
I stayed alive


633
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,180
to take your life.


634
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,640
Du Shao Yang,


635
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,060
I thought you were just a dirty dog.


636
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,730
Little did I know


637
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,800
that you're dirtier than a dog.


638
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,040
Du Shao Yang,


639
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,460
I shouldn't have let you live.


640
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,740
Du Shao Yang!


641
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,600
How ruthless you are!


642
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,580
He only splashed dung all over you,


643
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
but you took his life?


644
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,690
No one would believe me if I deny it.


645
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,060
If I was really going to kill him,


646
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,090
I wouldn't use


647
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,290
that filthy pail.


648
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,190
Many of you


649
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,700
saw us walking out of the south gate.


650
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,960
We didn't have the time to kill him.


651
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,430
You didn't?


652
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,320
With his capabilities,


653
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,300
it'd only take a moment to sneak back


654
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,750
and kill an outlander.


655
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,980
Do you have a witness?


656
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,480
Did anyone see that?


657
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,680
Who found the body?


658
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,870
It was me.


659
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,570
Maybe you killed him


660
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,890
and shift the blame to my young master.


661
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,080
Enough, Du Jun.


662
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,370
Since they've jumped to conclusions,


663
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,220
explanations won't help.


664
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,130
Looks like there's no way


665
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,160
I can step out of Ling Borough today.


666
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,170
Du Shao Yang!


667
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,170
Xuan Xuan,


668
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,420
mind your manners.


669
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,030
I see, you have someone behind you.


670
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,250
Qisha Valley is a Black Iron,


671
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,050
but the snowfield at far north


672
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,080
is under Palace of Hell's jurisdiction.


673
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,530
Zhong Zheng,


674
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,120
are you sure you want to intervene?


675
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,950
Qisha Valley seeks the truth with reasons.


676
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,550
We don't simply back anybody up,


677
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,970
let alone sticking our noses
into others' businesses.


678
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,080
However, we won't sit by idly too


679
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,970
when there's a bullying situation.


680
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,440
I heard that
the Palace of Hell's warrior, Pu Jiao,


681
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,890
is at Xingyun Pavilion.


682
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,630
Why don't we let him be the judge?


683
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,130
Any objection?


684
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,270
Okay.


685
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,770
I have Master of Gelid at my back.


686
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,440
They dare not do anything to me.


687
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,330
In fact, they'll be constrained.


688
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,840
Chief,


689
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,070
let me go.


690
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,790
We'll show them


691
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,380
that Ling Borough is also
backed by someone great.


692
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,660
I'm going too.


693
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,240
Although I'm a young master
at Xingyun Pavilion's,


694
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,910
I'm also one of Ling Borough.


695
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,010
I have a feeling that


696
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,750
there's more to this matter
than what we saw.


697
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,680
We'll deal with it carefully.


698
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,690
I'll go to Xingyun Pavilion
with you two tomorrow.


699
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,240
No.


700
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,320
I'll be worried if you go alone.


701
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,030
Gao Yu is with me.


702
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,510
He


703
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,150
is a member of Xingyun Pavilion,
after all.


704
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,330
He's also a member of Ling Borough.


705
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,690
He won't beset me.


706
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,280
Yes, he won't.


707
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,960
But do you want him


708
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,280
to be caught in the middle?


709
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,670
Yu Shi treats me best.


710
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,140
I'm going no matter what you say.


711
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,640
You can't stop me.


712
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,710
Let her go.


713
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,040
One more person


714
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,210
means more perspectives.


715
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,940
Maybe you'll gain something different.
