[Li Mu,
Sword Holder of Mount Heavenly Sword]


6
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,250
I am Li Mu,

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,290
asking for permission
to meet The Master of Frost.


8
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,660
I am friends with the Frostwolf tribe


9
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,170
as well as The Master of Frost.


10
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,400
Guys,


11
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,690
can't you feel that?


12
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,580
Did your master


13
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,140
want you to stop me


14
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,490
or attack me?


15
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,300
If I take another step further,


16
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,020
are you two going to attack?

How dare you kill my Frostwolf Guards!


21

The Sword of Wine


22
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,090
will not kill.


23
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,420
They're only drunk.


24
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,090
You came to meet me mad with rage.


25
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,700
I had no choice.


26
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,490
I must greet


27
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,220
an honoured guest from afar properly.


28
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,320
I dare you to stay

in the Frost Land for another 1000 years!


30
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,890
Are you trying to keep me


31
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,370
or trap me here?


32
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,290
Are you really going to be this cruel?


33
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,850

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,890
What on earth is that?


37
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,730
Yu Shi!


38
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,610
Yu Shi.


39
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,290
Qin Lie!


40
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,970
Young Master!


41
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,260
Bu Li.


42
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,450
You came back


43
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,220
after you chose to leave.


44
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,860
How shameless.


45
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,850
There was a time


46
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,180
I trained in the Mountains of Frost
as a young man.


47
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,420
Back then,


48
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,620
you were an ordinary Frostwolf.


49
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
We met each other,


50
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,170
and our minds were in sync,


51
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,540
as if we had known each other
for a long time.


52
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,560
So, I kept you by my side


53
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,120
as my companion.


54
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,410
Then,


55
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,730
you abandoned me.


56
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,920
I had to leave.


57
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,740
I couldn't


58
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,890
ascend to a new Realm.


59
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,890
So, I must leave.


60
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,780
I promised you


61
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,740
that I will be back.


62
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,000
All these years,


63
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,060
I have been travelling the world


64
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,130
and experienced numerous dangers


65
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,770
that I almost got to


66
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,360
bath in the rumoured
Central Golden Holy Light.


67
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,630
I've finally achieved something.


68
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,170
As a fulfilment of promise,
I came back for you.


69
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,540
To my surprise,


70
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,660
I'm not the only one who's
made some achievement.


71
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,180
You have become


72
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,530
the lord of Mountains of Frost.


73
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,890
Both of us


74
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,980
have walked our own promising paths.


75
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,620
However,


76
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,490
you can no longer
go beyond your current cultivation.


77
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,090
Am I right?


78
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,300
A spirit beast is still a beast,
after all.


79
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,890
There's just so much you can understand.


80
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,690
Although you've transformed
into human form,


81
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,010

82
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,810

83
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,420
make it impossible


84
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,860
for you to understand
the things a human could.


85
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,060
Why don't you come with me?


86
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,730
Let's stay close to each other


87
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,780
like we did back then.


88
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,740
On one condition.

[On the street of Xingyun Pavilion]


90
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,010
Hero!


91
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
Oh,


92
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,490
it was you
who killed the Soul Reaping Beast?


93
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,360
Nice to meet you.


94
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,420
Nice to meet you too.


95
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,050
What a pleasure.


96
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,250
I heard that Qisha Valley


97
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,020
is a well-hidden


98
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,780
peaceful and undisturbed valley


99
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,040
that pays no attention to others.


100
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,340
The disciples are only busy practising


101
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,700
fire and water skills
at the bottom of the valley.


102
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,810
That's really relaxing.


103
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,140
It's said that the Palace of Hell


104
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,920
is located within a black stone


105
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,050
with dull environment
and oppressive atmosphere.


106
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,730
The disciples are so combative


107
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,900
that they poke their noses


108
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,490
into whatever battle there is.


109
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,020
When there isn't one,


110
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,720
they create troubles everywhere.


111
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,930
Have a seat.


112
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
You're the Profound Heaven Emissary.
You take the seat.


113
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,780
Thanks.


114
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,050
No problem.


115
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,410
Zhong Zheng,


116
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,790
you be the judge.


117
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
No.


118
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,580
You're the judge, I'll just watch


119
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,900
without interfering, unless...


120
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,360
Unless there's a need to do so.


121
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,050
And when will there be a need for that?


122
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,900
When you need help


123
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,370
or give the order.


124
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,980
That's when there is this need.


125
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,410
For the murder case in Ling Borough,


126
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,700
Du Shao Yang,


127
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,020
what do you have to say?


128
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,930
I didn't kill him.


129
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,900
Who else if not you?


130
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Shut up!


131
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,770
Du Shao Yang is a suspect,


132
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,220
but he's still
Xingyun Pavilion's young master.


133
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,610
Qin Lie,


134
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,020
Ling Borough is a dependency
of Xingyun Pavilion.


135
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,610
Shouting at him


136
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,890
is an act of disrespecting your superior.


137
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,530
-You...
-What?


138
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,540
You're just an insignificant kid.


139
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,930
Ridiculous!


140
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,690
Qin Lie killed the Soul Reaping Beast
with his thunder.


141
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,290
He's a hero to the far north


142
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,110
and even the entire Chilan Continent.


143
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,700
One should respect and look up to him.


144
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,290
Du Shao Yang,


145
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,410
besides disrespecting the hero,


146
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,650
you were also evoking public wrath.


147
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,810
-You...
-What?


148
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,340
I'm the hero, and you're not.


149
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,360
Lord Pu Jiao is being fair


150
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,100
without favouritism. How admirable.


151
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,410
That's my job.


152
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,290
Lord Pu Jiao,


153
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,050
Blacksmith Hua's death is suspicious.


154
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,900
The thing is, there is not a witness.


155
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,660
Even if there is one,


156
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,900
he's from Ling Borough.


157
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,570
Zhong Zheng


158
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,720
has personally


159
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,770
inspected the scene and the body,


160
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,460
and I believe he'll act impartially,


161
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,480
but,


162
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,200
he came here with someone


163
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,780
from Ling Borough after all.


164
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,370
They might improperly influenced him,


165
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,140
giving him a wrong first impression.


166
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,810
Master Du was right.


167
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,920
I might be prejudiced.


168
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,490
Zhong Zheng,


169
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,490
my son's reputation and life is at stake.


170
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,780
I'm sorry.


171
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,100
It's okay.


172
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,140
Lord Pu Jiao,


173
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,140
in my opinion,


174
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,370
someone from Xingyun Pavilion


175
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,930
or Palace of Hell


176
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,900
should inspect the scene first
before we make any decisions.


177
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,660
I was thinking about that too.


178
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,660
The reason why I'm here


179
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,360
is to see Ling and Du families
be reconciled.


180
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,050
Qin Lie, you have to understand.


181
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,050
Du Shao Yang is the young master
of the far north.


182
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,340
Du Shao Yang, keep in mind


183
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,100
that Qin Lie is the hero
who killed the Soul Reaping Beast.


184
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,140
Before the case comes to a conclusion,


185
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,780
you have to respect
and be nice to each other.


186
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,290
Yu Xin,


187
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,050
from today on, I'll drink with you


188
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,810
by the window everyday


189
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,020
no matter the time and place.


190
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,730
Yu Shi,


191
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,930
at the hall today,


192
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,050
you seemed like
you were going to collapse.


193
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,090
Are you okay?


194
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,980
I'm fine.


195
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,140
Good, then.


196
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,810
Uncle Hua told me
to draw these images everyday


197
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,170
as my grandpa instructed it in his dream.


198
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,220
Do you believe that?


199
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,630
Those were Uncle Hua's last words


200
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,740
before he was killed.


201
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,700
This is bizarre.


202
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,380
These words seem more important now.


203
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,410
The words he left behind


204
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,260
confused me even more.


205
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,930
The Silent Abyss is a deep gorge.


206
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,250
How did Yu Xin, an outlander,


207
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,130
make it there?


208
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,530
After the Heavenly Thunder struck,


209
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,460
I was half awake,


210
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,580
but I caught a glimpse of my saviour.
It was Uncle Hua.


211
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,320
It was like


212
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,410
they were there just to save me.


213
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,050
Are all this


214
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,810
related to my grandpa?


215
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,980
Who am I?


216
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,710
Why is this amazing thing


217
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,440
in my memory?


218
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,860
Why did the Master of Frost save me?


219
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,220
How did I push past


220
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,890
my own limits every time?


221
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,170
I'm afraid all the mysteries


222
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,980
can only be solved
after we found my grandpa.


223
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,770
Your grandpa drove off
the spirit tide for us


224
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,930
and left strange formations
on Herb Mountain back then.


225
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,530
Surprisingly, the eight pillars


226
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,700
could channel thunder
and kill the Soul Reaping Beast.


227
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,580
He's obviously not a mortal.


228
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,130
Maybe


229
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,620
he's deliberately hiding


230
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,050
his whereabouts from you.


231
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,890
I know that.


232
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,340
But I can't just sit back and wait.


233
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,290
That's why I want to learn
artefact forging skills.


234
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,500
You want to join the Artefact Forging Sect


235
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,410
and learn more about your grandpa?


236
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,760
Yes.


237
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,220
Young Master.


238
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,620
Young Master,


239
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,770
stop drinking.


240
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,980
You're already drunk.


241
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,050
Let go.


242
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,130
Young Master, this is it!


243
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,580
If Master finds this out,


244
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,170
he'll be furious.


245
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,260
Young Master.


246
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
-Young Master, don't...
-Let him go.


247
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,570
Master.


248
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,620
Look at you.


249
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,700
All it takes is some minor problem


250
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,580
to break your spirit.


251
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,770
Are you even the son of Du family?


252
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,260
You have the nerve to go out?


253
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,290
Young Master,


254
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,520
please listen to Master.


255
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,010
He wants the best for you.


256
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
Get lost!


257
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,010
Young Master!


258
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,360
If you take one step out,


259
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,700
don't you dare call yourself my son!


260
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,570
[Xingyun Pavilion]


261
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,650
Don't be angry, Master.


262
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,340
Hurry up and get him back.


263
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,370
Yes, Master.


264
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,290
Young Master!


265
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,010
Young Master.


266
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,920
Keep your mouth shut


267
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,100
or get lost.


268
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,340
Get me wine.


269
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,530
What are you doing here?


270
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,460
I heard you're a regular drinker here.


271
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,260
So, I see it as my job to serve you.


272
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,500
Shop owner!


273
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,770
Where are you?


274
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,700
Why are you looking for the owner?


275
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,130
To have you fired.


276
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,340
Too bad.


277
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,290
I'm the owner.


278
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,100
Du Jun, let's go to the next restaurant.


279
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,220
Oops.


280
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,880
I already bought all the restaurants


281
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,530
in Icestone City.


282
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,460
You can duplicate yourself?


283
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,500
No.


284
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,460
Can you keep up with me


285
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,130
if I visit another restaurant?


286
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,770
I just can.


287
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,620
Do you think I can do that?


288
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,000
Who exactly are you?


289
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,170
Why won't you leave
my young master alone?


290
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,100
I'm Tang Si Qi.


291
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,040
Let's cut to the chase.


292
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,800
I like you,


293
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,450
and I wish to have
a proper relationship with you.


294
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Ridiculous!


295
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,400
I happen to be boring


296
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,490
and in need of a companion.


297
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,890
You go back first.


298
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,260
But, Young Master...


299
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,440
You think I can't


300
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,700
even handle a woman?


301
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,740
Leave.


302
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,400
Yes.


303
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Let's go.


304
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,490
Cheers.


305
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,050
I don't know who you are.


306
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,450
How do I know


307
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,130
if the wine isn't poisoned?


308
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,130
Should I call you bold and unconstrained


309
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,170
or just lewd?


310
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,930
I lack the courage
to put my thought into action.


311
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,340
So, what will you call me?


312
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,220
You're just all bark and no bite then.


313
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,810
Coward.


314
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,930
I like your glibness.


315
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,980
All style but indecisive.


316
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,570
Indecisive, you said?


317
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,860
Although having more advantage
in everything,


318
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,850
you're always losing.


319
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,700
You're unhappy with the defeat,


320
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,410
but you couldn't achieve anything.


321
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,930
Who on earth are you?


322
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,980
I'm just an ordinary lady.


323
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,730
You have a striking appearance,


324
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,220
but your eyes are full of sorrows.


325
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,410
So, I made a wild guess.


326
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,260
Did I get it right?


327
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,860
If you don't like the defeat,
then challenge him to a fight.


328
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,890
Winning or losing doesn't matter.


329
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,100
Living is all about
accepting what's happened.


330
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,170
When you're finally convinced,


331
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,620
then only will you be contented.


332
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,100
Are you hideous in appearance?


333
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,050
My beauty has no parallel.


334
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,810
Then why are you wearing a veil?


335
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,050
Take it off.


336
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,050
I won't


337
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,740
do as you say.


338
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,260
You just said


339
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,250
that you want to fall in love with me.


340
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,700
But you won't even show me your face.


341
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,650
How can I love you?


342
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,340
Unlike my heart that matters,
appearance doesn't.


343
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,460
You have enough pretty ladies around you,


344
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,920
Young Master of Xingyun Pavilion.


345
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,260
What you need


346
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,410
is a lady who knows understands you.


347
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,860
She who understands me


348
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,810
must be beautiful as well.


349
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,050
I don't like ugly women.


350
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,410
Nice moves.


351
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,620
Are you sure you want to see my face?


352
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,700
Listen, it's dangerous to do so.


353
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,930
I'm afraid of everything


354
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,860
but danger.


355
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,650
I'll take it off now.


356
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,930
Yes, please do.


357
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,130
I told you it's dangerous.


358
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,050
I'll kill you.


359
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Young Master.


360
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,530
Young Master,


361
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,770
are you all right?


362
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,170
Qin Lie intends to kill
Du Shao Yang already.


363
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,840
Are you sure?


364
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,050
His Realm Mark appeared.


365
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,260
I'm certain.


366
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,410
Originally,


367
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,620
everything was under my control.


368
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,010
But Li Zhong Zheng showed up
and got in my way.


369
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,010
And while I don't know what to do next,


370
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,050
Qin Lie actually rushed into the picture
and gave me a hand.


371
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,650
Good.


372
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,250
Very good.


373
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,620
The moonlight in Icestone City is dim,


374
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,410
but Ling Borough envies them
for having it.


375
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,010
However, the most enviable things


376
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,690
are the Luminous Pillars.


377
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,930
Three hundred years ago,


378
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,700
the Profound Heaven Alliance
sent the strong ones


379
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,340
to build Icestone City
and Xingyun Pavilion here


380
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,410
and govern the disunited people
at the far north.


381
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,980
The most outstanding among them
were chosen


382
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,450
to reside in Icestone City.


383
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,530
After the work is done,


384
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,930
the strong ones stared at the dark sky.


385
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,890
It troubled them


386
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,890
to see the people of Icestone City


387
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,380
walking in the dark at night.


388
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,500
So, they made the Luminous Pillars.


389
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,930
By drawing forth starlight
behind the clouds,


390
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,530
the Luminous Pillars
light up the people's way home.


391
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,980
There's a hazy moon in Icestone City,


392
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,290
but starlight still can't reach here.


393
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,610
The Luminous Pillars
brighten the dark night sky.


394
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,500
Three hundred years ago,


395
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,620
the strong ones' love for the people


396
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,810
were touching.


397
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,930
Did I put up a good show


398
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,460
at the hall today?


399
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,860
You did well.


400
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,340
And so did I.


401
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,970
[Why did you ask me out in secret?]


402
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,160
[What do you think about the incident]


403
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
[at the snowfield?]


404
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,860
[I was going to ask you that.]


405
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,410
[I've never seen
such big snowflakes before.]


406
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,500
[The only person
who can create such snow power]


407
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,170
[is The Master of Frost.]


408
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,100
[Maybe]


409
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,290
[she wanted to kill me for you.]


410
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,260
[I almost died too.]


411
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,580
[Moreover,]


412
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,810
[I don't know the Master of Frost.]


413
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,650
[We never even met once.]


414
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,980
[So, you called me out at night]


415
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,000
[to discuss the huge snowflake?]


416
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
[You]


417
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,500
[didn't kill Uncle Hua.]


418
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,290
[If I'm not mistaken,]


419
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,530
[someone is trying
to come between our families]


420
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,450
[and make us get hurt]


421
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,210
[by fighting each other.]


422
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,460
[Even if that's true,]


423
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,490
[Ling Borough]


424
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,530
[has only some old people
and children left.]


425
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,620
[Why do you think both families
will get hurt from the fight?]


426
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,050
[The culprit has had things planned out.]


427
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,100
[Having able to eliminate Ling Borough,]


428
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,340
[means he can do the same
to Xingyun Pavilion.]


429
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,980
[It's just that they're trying to
keep a low-profile.]


430
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,130
[Song Ting Yu?]


431
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,860
[In order to kill the Soul Reaping Beast,]


432
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,860
[Song Ting Yu ignored the
northern people's lives.]


433
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,220
[But in the end,]


434
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,610
[she didn't manage
to kill the Beast herself.]


435
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,530
[That woman is domineering]


436
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,220
[and she values her reputation a lot.]


437
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,220
[If someone learns about this,]


438
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,340
[she'll lose her reputation,]


439
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,650
[and maybe got held accountable for it.]


440
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,500
[Are you happy to be at others' mercy?]


441
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,100
[You really believed
that I didn't kill Mr Hua?]


442
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,700
[When someone spills dung all over you,
revenge is a must.]


443
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,860
[But given who you are,]


444
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,130
[you won't kill only an old man]


445
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,740
[but rather the entire Ling Borough.]


446
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,580
[Will you await your doom]


447
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,530
[or resist with me?]


448
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,170
[How can we resist?]


449
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,500
[If the person behind this
really is Song Ting Yu,]


450
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,260
[the Saintess of
Profound Heaven Alliance,]


451
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,340
[not only are we
not her match in a fight,]


452
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,100
[we don't even know where we can go]


453
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,860
[to seek justice.]


454
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,010
[The Profound Heaven Alliance
is on Lofty Cliff.]


455
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,850
[How do we get to that height?]


456
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,010
[By flying?]


457
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,860
[Ling Borough]


458
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,220
[and Xingyun Pavilion]


459
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,650
[are just two dusts
in the land of far north.]


460
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,500
[We can't reach that height.]


461
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,690
[In a fight,]


462
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,260
[of course we'll lose.]


463
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,460
[As for seeking for justice,]


464
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,650
[based on our current capabilities,]


465
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,330
[that's impractical.]


466
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,850
[But it's not in our nature
to do nothing.]


467
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,380
[At least show her]


468
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,290
[that we're no pushover.]


469
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,000
[Maybe]


470
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,170
[we can negotiate with her.]


471
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,770
[Negotiate?]


472
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,860
[What do you want?]


473
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,340
[The right question is,
where do I want to go.]


474
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,860
[The Artefact Forging Sect?]


475
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,370
I was right.


476
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,450
Pu Jiao is here
to cause dispute between us.


477
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,700
Indeed.


478
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,700
He was provoking us with his words.


479
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,860
How obvious.


480
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,340
Why would Song Ting Yu send


481
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,580
a frivolous man for the plan?


482
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,580
A woman's decision...


483
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,890
Qin Lie,


484
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,580
when Song Ting Yu
tried to eliminate Ling Borough,


485
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,980
I sided with her.


486
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,980
Do you really trust me?


487
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,050
Someone wants both our families dead.


488
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,890
We're in the same boat.


489
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,770
Why can't we trust you?


490
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,130
Pu Jiao's sending people


491
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,700
to investigate in Ling Borough


492
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,650
is just a show.


493
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,010
What's next in your plan?


494
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,650
We in the north


495
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,460
love to wear feathered beast fur cloak.


496
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,980
In order to kill
the cunning Feathered Beast,


497
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,220
one must trick it into showing its tail


498
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,620
where its vitality lies.


499
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,050
That's simple.


500
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,170
Shao Yang,
have someone keep an eye on them.


501
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,889
It's an easy task.


502
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,850
Xingyun Pavilion is my territory.


503
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,850
But my father may see through it.


504
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,940
No worries.


505
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,699
We'll join hands


506
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,969
and cover each other's back.


507
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,489
Won't there be more problems
if we take so much time?


508
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,650
You have any idea?


509
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,780
No.


510
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,000
Yu Shi,


511
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,090
lately,


512
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,170
you sometimes look pale,


513
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,120
but other times
your face turns rosy unusually.


514
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,570
Is it because of the Fire Poison?


515
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,400
Don't lie to me.


516
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,220
When did I ever lie to you?


517
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,220
But why do you suddenly
care so much about me?


518
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,170
Did someone teach you that?


519
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,500
No!


520
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,220
I was just teasing you


521
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,540
as you look worried.


522
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,890
I'm fine.


523
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,930
I'm just exhausted from all the things


524
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,570
that have been happening lately.


525
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,820
Are you all right?


526
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,570
Even if I'm not, I can still count on you.


527
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,820
By the way,


528
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,880
any clues on the images


529
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,130
in your dream?


530
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,170
No.


531
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,570
I heard there's
a Spiritual Herb Street in Icestone City.


532
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,300
Even the low-level herbs sold there


533
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,460
are way better than those in Ling Borough.


534
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,090
You can take a look there tomorrow.


535
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,540
Seriously?


536
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,090
Let's go tomorrow.


537
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,500
I thought you're worried about my health?


538
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,330
I'll take a good rest tomorrow


539
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,820
and not go with you.


540
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,220
Okay.


541
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,740
Go and rest now.


542
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,680
[Xingyun Pavilion]


543
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,610
Saintess Song asks for you.


544
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,290
Saintess Song?


545
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,410
Where?


546
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,060
At the place where you guys secretly
planned to rebel just a while ago.


547
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,130
Saintess Song.


548
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,020
The star and cloud were close once.


549
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
The light could break
the sincerest friendship.


550
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,610
That's the ancestral teaching
of Icestone City.


551
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,020
Do you know the meaning behind?


552
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,820
In Icestone City,


553
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,370
the Luminous Pillars are a wonderful view.


554
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,820
It's rumoured that
the light leads the way home.


555
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,020
But apart from Xingyun Masters
throughout the ages,


556
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,610
no one knew


557
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,740
that there's a huge secret behind it.


558
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,780
I'm all ears.


559
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,060
Three hundred years ago,


560
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,610
seeing the people here
being disunited without a leader,


561
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,330
and are threatened by spirit beasts,


562
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,650
the Profound Heaven Alliance sent
the strong ones to build Icestone City,


563
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,260
and made a treaty
with the Master of Frost


564
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,020
to give the people
their peaceful life back.


565
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,700
I know that.


566
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,460
The strong ones built
Luminous Pillars at Xingyun Pavilion


567
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,260
to lead the people back home
with starlight drawn.


568
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,460
To prevent the evil tribe from returning,


569
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,400
the strong ones infused


570
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,490
a great power into the Pillars.


571
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,740
Had the the evil tribe
invaded the far north successfully,


572
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,320
the power inside can be used.


573
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,330
What kind of power is that?


574
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,820
It's a secret


575
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,650
passed down to all Masters.


576
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,850
The strong ones spared no effort


577
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,700
to prevent unchangable tyranny.


578
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,640
So, to activate the Luminous Pillars,


579
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,220
we need the powers of both


580
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,980
Thunder and Starlight.


581
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,980
The Master will succeed a Luminous Bead,


582
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,460
and a strong thunder technique user
will be the Vice Master.


583
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,220
The Luminous Pillars can only be activated


584
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,330
with both their permission.


585
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,700
So, "The star and cloud
were close once" indicates


586
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,970
the two powers to activate the Pillars


587
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,460
as well as the Master and the Vice Master


588
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,850
who protect Icestone City
while keeping this secret.


589
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,930
Then,


590
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,300
what about "The light could break
the sincerest friendship"?


591
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,330
The Luminous Bead?


592
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,500
The Bead is supposed to be
held by the Master.


593
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,170
But for some unknown reasons,


594
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,600
it's always been with
the Profound Heaven Alliance.


595
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,410
After so many years,


596
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,770
even the current master
of Xingyun Pavilion


597
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,610
has no idea about
the secret to activating the Pillars.


598
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,010
You only


599
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,820
speak half the truth.


600
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,410
Why?


601
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,730
You


602
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,090
and Qin Lie...


603
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,610
That was a nice show.


604
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,780
Even Pu Jiao


605
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,500
was deceived.


606
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,920
So, it's true.


607
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,930
You sent Pu Jiao
to kill Du and Ling families.


608
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,460
The one I want to kill is Qin Lie.


609
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,060
As for you...


610
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,020
I have another plan for you.


611
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,850
What's that?


612
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,210
I mentioned about the mysterious power


613
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,080
inside the Luminous Pillars.


614
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,840
The person


615
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,850
who obtains it can ascend high
by skipping Realms.


616
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,500
Skipping Realms?


617
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,500
To which Realm will he achieve?


618
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,730
Straight to the Netherpassage Realm.


619
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,250
That being said,


620
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,850
second only to me.


621
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,850
Du Shao Yang,


622
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,890
I want to train you.


623
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,980
What do you know


624
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,850
about the evil tribe?


625
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,540
They live in the Netherworld


626
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,780
and have been in war
with our tribe for thousands of years.


627
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,370
It's said that the most recent Nether War


628
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,930
was 17 years ago.


629
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,700
The human tribe obtained a miserable
victory after suffering a great loss.


630
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,690
The Nether War


631
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,700
happened once every 30 years.


632
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,640
The Profound Heaven Alliance and


633
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,700
Eight Extremes Temple Sanctuary
take turn to supervise the war.


634
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,890
In recent years,


635
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,220
it's Xie Jing Xuan, the Saintess
of the Sanctuary's turn to supervise.


636
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,980
Now that she's dead,


637
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,370
the responsibility falls back on me.


638
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,780
I need an assistant.


639
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,460
You have many capable men.


640
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,020
But none as good as you.


641
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,690
You're telling me to betray Qin Lie?


642
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,410
Betray?


643
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,260
You and Qin Lie


644
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,410
are buddies now?


645
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,890
Why me


646
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,730
instead of Qin Lie?


647
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,570
He's done great thing
by killing the Soul Reaping Beast.


648
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,300
People of Ling Borough
have been living too freely.


649
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,780
And Qin Lie is too unruly.


650
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,260
If you were me,


651
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,540
who would you pick?


652
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,160
Saintess,


653
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,540
will this plan work?


654
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,500
It must work.


655
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,780
But many others
are going to be sacrificed too.


656
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,540
Qin Lie and Du Shao Yang


657
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,020
are heroes
who killed the Soul Reaping Beast.


658
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,740
The entire Icestone City
has learned about that.


659
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,360
Xie Jing Xuan and I


660
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
hunted the Beast under order.


661
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,060
She's dead, but I'm alive.


662
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,650
If the Master of the Sanctuary
learns about this,


663
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,210
he'll vent his anger on me.


664
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,640
And if my father learns that


665
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,670
I didn't kill the Beast,


666
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,700
guess what will he do to me?


667
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,260
So, I must seize the chance


668
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,260
to cover the truth.


669
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,360
Done.


670
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,220
I've figured out the name of the shop.


671
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,980
Let's call it Li Ji.


672
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,970
But I really don't get it.


673
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,700
Why must we


674
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,300
open our shop here?


675
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,610
I have my own reasons.


676
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,060
But I don't understand


677
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,650
the reason why I must wear this.


678
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,220
To blend in.


679
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,370
Blend in?


680
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,410
Well...


681
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,410
The greatest hermit
will retreat into the noisiest place.


682
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,400
It's all about retreating.


683
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,600
Look, my Master of Frost


684
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,930
is exceptionally pretty and elegant.


685
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,460
If she shows up at a place like this,
it'll be


686
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,130
too shocking.


687
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,020
Too shocking.


688
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,960
[Li Ji]


689
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,640
[Li Ji]


690
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,020
Not bad.


691
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,260
So, you didn't forget a single character


692
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,650
that I taught you.


693
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,460
I wrote "Li Ji".


694
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,290
And you intend to write "Shop".


695
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,820
Awesome.


696
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,540
This is great,
I'll write the remaining word later.


697
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,740
Ms Ling, what are you doing here?


698
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,010
You killed Uncle Hua.


699
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,970
As you want to make
Ling and Du families kill each other.


700
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,220
How dare you!


701
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,810
You're falsely accusing me?


702
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,400
Where's your evidence?


703
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,090
I won't come to see you if I have one.


704
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,360
I'm here to warn you.


705
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,370
You'd better stop now.


706
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,500
Why you


707
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,460
and not Qin Lie?


708
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,610
He doesn't believe me.


709
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,650
Instead, he believes the Palace of Hell


710
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,210
will find out the truth.


711
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,650
Ridiculous.


712
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:41,700
You're the ridiculous one.


713
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,930
You women are full of suspicion


714
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,740
and you love being paranoid.


715
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,170
Really?


716
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,130
I'll get the evidence


717
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,930
and hand it
to the Master of Xingyun Pavilion.


718
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,930
You won't have things your way.


719
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,650
But first of all,


720
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,170
you need available evidences.


721
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,170
Before I expose you with evidence,


722
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,220
there's one thing I want to do first.


723
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,050
What is that?
