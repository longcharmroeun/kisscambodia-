So I went to see her.


36
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,480
I learned that her father and brother

to cure her illness.


39
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,360
Unfortunately,

I was too late.


41
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,130
She's so silly.


42
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,270
She could've just told us
she needed the beast core.


43

We'll get it for her.


44

Yao Yao is an outlander.


45
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,880
She's prideful


46
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,350

Don't cry.


51

If you cry,


52
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,240
it means you're
resigning yourself to fate.

from the fire poison yet.

standing in front of that palace again?


80

And there were also those
four puzzling paintings?


81
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,440
The book says

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,720
you're having this dream


83
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,090
because you're thinking of moving
into a new house.


84
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,120
The last book said


85
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,800
I was thinking of women.

stop reading that claptrap.


90
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,530
It's messing with your head.


91
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,680
Qin Lie,


92
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,850
do you think maybe your dream


93
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,000
has something to do with


94
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,960
the Soul Suppressing Orb in your head?


95
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,600
This Soul Suppressing Orb is sealing


96
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,120
my memories from before I was ten.


97
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,290
I have no idea who put it in my head.


98
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,620
I need to practise my
artefact forging skill.


99
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,070
And find out


100
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,180
how to seal the orb.


101
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,770
Then I'll use Thunderbolt


102
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,640
to crack it open.

In each new realm,
one faces a thunder tribulation.


105
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,050
Surviving the thunder tribulation
is one thing.


106
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,380
But with the Soul Suppressing Orb
sealed inside your head,


107
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,880
you might miss it


108
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,510
and strike yourself dead instead.


109
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,050
If I can crack the orb open


110
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,110
before it kills me,


111
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,700
then at least I'll die with my memories.


112
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,930
It's worth it.


113
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,980
You have your reasons,


114
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,450

to kill yourself, have it your way.

There's a peddler in town.


132

The Feathered Beast fur cloak he's
selling can keep out the cold and dust.

I really like it.


134

But Sister said


135
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,250
you've spent all the money
on the Thunder Storage Jade Plate.


136
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,290
Even so, you should help me
to hunt down the Feathered Beast.


137

for the Moon Ritual tonight.

gave you is really amazing.

00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,940
forget it.


188
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Here, you must be hungry.


189
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,530
What do we have today?


190
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,340
All your favourite dishes.


191
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,550
Did you have that dream again last night?


192
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,150
The same dream.


193
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,320
That dream has been haunting
you for ten years.


194
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,170
And you've been cultivating
for ten years.


195
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,630
Since I've improved my Thunderbolt skill,


196
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,610
I must improve
my artefact forging skill, too.


197
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,240
I need to open the Soul Suppressing Orb


198
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,870
to find out who I am


199
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,510
and everything that occurred in my dream.


200
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,980
Most importantly,


201
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,370
I need to find my grandfather.


202
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,490
You want to leave Ling Borough that badly?


203
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,470
I must keep cultivating.


204
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,240
I must go higher and farther.


205
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,780
For example,


206
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,280
the Artefact Forging Sect.


207
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,730
So


208
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,980
there is


209
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,630
nothing in Ling Borough


210
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,310
that's worth staying for?


211
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,600
By the way,


212
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,170
do you still have the Yixin
leaf I gave you last year?


213
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,990
I used it up last night.


214
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,260
So I threw it away.


215
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,980
I'm sure you have more.


216
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,240
Your Yixin leaves only last a year.


217
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,450
Why don't you grow leaves


218
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,150
that can last a lifetime?


219
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,100
A lifetime is very long.


220
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,380
It's not that easy to grow
something like that.


221
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,980
At least grow something
that lasts ten years.


222
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,610
By the way, Yu Shi,


223
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,340
it'll be lively
at the town tonight.


224
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,420
Today is the Moon Ritual.
Of course it'll be lively.


225
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,110
After all, Ling Borough only gets


226
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,980
to see the moon once a year.


227
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,140
Have you written it?


228
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,650
I have. You?


229
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,490
I've written mine too.


230
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,690
What did you write?


231
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,599
Only the moon knows it.


232
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,490
But


233
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,869
don't you want to find out what I wrote?


234
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,819
Only the moon knows it.


235
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm not finished yet.


236
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,960
You've eaten enough.


237
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,400
You'll be overstuffed if I don't stop you.


238
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,280
If you want to hug him, just do it.


239
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,600
Run to him


240
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,830
and hug him.


241
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,730
The Yixin leaf's spirit fire


242
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,060
burns as brightly as a certain
someone's infatuation.


243
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,340
But all fires go out eventually.


244
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,910
Yet someone here simply
refuses to let it go out.


245
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,240
Although he doesn't even care,


246
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,260
you insist on giving
him a leaf every year.


247
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,720
But don't you realise


248
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,830
he's only treating you as an arm,


249
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,250
which he can cut off
and abandon anytime.


250
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,790
People can't live without their arms.


251
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,550
But people have two arms.


252
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,050
Sister,


253
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,770
he's a Thunderbolt practitioner.


254
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,660
He could be struck dead anytime.


255
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,470
But he is never afraid.


256
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,590
It means he cares


257
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,460
about no one in this world.


258
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,140
Including you.


259
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,410
What do you really like about him?


260
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,460
Ling Borough only sees the
moonlight once a year.


261
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,670
Have you ever seen a shooting star


262
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,500
that only appears once in a century?


263
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,110
Ten years ago,
the shooting star coincided


264
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,920
with the spirit tide, and we were
overwhelmed by spirit beasts.


265
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,420
I was seriously wounded,


266
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,050
so I didn't see it.


267
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,330
I saw it.


268
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,490
With Qin Lie.


269
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,890
[It's the shooting star.]


270
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,580
[Qin Lie, make a wish now.]


271
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,700
[If you have a wish,
you should seize it yourself.]


272
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,000
This man


273
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,500
is looking at the heavens,


274
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,260
yet he asks nothing from it.


275
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,280
I get it now.


276
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,500
Sister,


277
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
what this man wants to achieve


278
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,640
isn't in Ling Borough.


279
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,400
If he stays,


280
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,380
I'll stay with him.


281
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,410
If he wants to leave,


282
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,210
I won't hold him back.


283
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,850
Be it the snowfield of the far north,


284
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,540
or the land of gold and silver,


285
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,650
I love him


286
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,800
and only him.


287
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,470
Chief is here.


288
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,440
Ladies and gentlemen.


289
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,910
Ladies and gentlemen.


290
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,610
Today is the day we see the moon


291
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,090
which appears only once
a year in Ling Borough.


292
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,210
Let's hear what our chief
has to say, shall we?


293
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,410
Yes.


294
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,190
Everyone,


295
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm not going to make a speech this year.


296
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,160
[Chief of the Ling Family, Ling Cheng Ye]


297
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,990
Instead,


298
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm going to sing you all a song.


299
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,390
Yes, yes.


300
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,890
Xingyun Pavilion?


301
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,850
Du Shao Yang, Young Master
of Xingyun Pavilion,


302
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,520
and Zhuo Qian, Deacon of Ye family,
are here.


303
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,150
Where is the chief of the Ling family?


304
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,080
I, Ling Cheng Ye,


305
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,490
greet you, Young Master Du,


306
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,430
on behalf of Ling Borough.


307
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,590
Deacon Zhuo.


308
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,930
Which one of you is Qin Lie?


309
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,890
Seize him.


310
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,560
Stop.


311
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,590
Kneel.


312
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,520
You haven't explained anything.


313
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,670
Why should I kneel?


314
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,850
Kneel.


315
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,490
Three months ago,
on the ninth day of the month,


316
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,250
where were you?


317
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,920
Can you remember


318
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,380
what happened three months ago?


319
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,620
Deacon Zhuo,


320
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,320
did Qin Lie do anything wrong?


321
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,090
All the people of Ling Borough


322
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,990
ever do is plant herbs and hunt beasts.


323
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,490
Nothing else.


324
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,300
As for what we have
done on a certain date,


325
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,840
those are the only things that we did.


326
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,440
If you want a specific answer,


327
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,210
I'm afraid it's a bit difficult
for us to provide it.


328
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,060
Difficult to answer?


329
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,790
That means you have no answer.


330
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,040
In that case,


331
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,400
Qin Lie has no alibi


332
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,030
for slaughtering 33 outlander villages


333
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,460
with Thunderbolt.


334
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,570
33 villages.


335
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,900
Thousands of lives.


336
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,500
All killed by the Thunderbolt skill.


337
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,830
In all of the far north,


338
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,820
the only person who
practices Thunderbolt


339
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,630
is you, Qin Lie from Ling Borough.


340
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,170
The snowfield is vast.


341
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,890
How can you be sure there isn't a
second Thunderbolt cultivator?


342
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,370
Qin Lie,


343
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,570
where were you last night?


344
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,560
We were hunting
in the snowfield last night.


345
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,450
We even killed a Silver Flame Spider.


346
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,390
We, and the spider's corpse,


347
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,150
are your witness and proof.


348
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,550
I was talking to Qin Lie.


349
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,590
Why are you answering?


350
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,340
Young Lady Yu Shi,
you and Qin Lie are close.


351
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,510
It's understandable that
you're covering up for him.


352
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,410
Ling Borough is a tight knit family.


353
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,480
Besides, my sister is telling the truth.


354
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,370
She isn't covering up for him.


355
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,130
Why didn't you say anything?


356
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,850
Aren't you going to defend yourself?


357
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,360
Don't you know what day it is?


358
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,950
I do.


359
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,620
Let's not ruin the festivities.


360
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,290
After tonight,


361
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,140
you can ask me whatever you want.


362
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,410
You won't run away?


363
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,780
I won't.


364
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,050
Good.


365
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,240
No.


366
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,090
Why not?


367
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,510
What if he finds a chance to escape?


368
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,710
Lock him up.


369
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,520
The Lings always were harmonious people.


370
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,800
No one has committed a crime before.


371
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,690
So we don't have any jails here.


372
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,140
Put him in the woodshed.


373
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,180
The men of the Ye family will
guard the inner court.


374
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,380
The men of the Du family will
guard the outer court.


375
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,940
Lead the way.


376
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,070
Come on, let's go.


377
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,250
Let's go.


378
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,010
Recently,


379
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,740
several outlander villagers


380
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,850
have been killed by Thunderbolt.


381
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,430
Everyone


382
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,390
[Ling Xiang, Ling Bo, Ling Kang An]


383
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,120
thought Qin Lie was the murderer.


384
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,760
After the investigation,


385
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,310
Qin Lie was vindicated.


386
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,550
It was just a misunderstanding.


387
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,850
Yes, yes.


388
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,600
Just a misunderstanding.


389
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,310
A misunderstanding.


390
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,550
We apologise.


391
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,240
Misunderstanding.


392
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,580
I know you feel indignant.


393
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,380
But to us,


394
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,450
your defence is only a joke.


395
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,870
If Du Shao Yang says you're
the murderer,


396
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,370
then you're the murderer.


397
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,100
The old master is suffering
a serious injury.


398
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,960
The Du and Ye families are fighting
for the new master's seat.


399
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
So the Du family wants to gain
the Ling family's support.


400
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,920
If the Ling family wants to protect me,


401
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,900
they have no choice but
to side with the Du family.


402
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,670
So you're not stupid.


403
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,880
Kid, I can save you.


404
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,600
But I have one condition.


405
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,620
No need.


406
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,070
Lock the door.


407
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,100
l'm going to sleep.


408
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,560
-Lock it up.
-Yes.


409
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,250
Yu Xin.


410
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,000
Yu Shi, have you seen Xuan Xuan?


411
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,150
Where is Xuan Xuan?


412
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,680
I'm not dead, bookworm.


413
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,930
Qin Lie has been locked
up in the woodshed.


414
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,290
He...


415
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,880
I suggested the place.


416
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,680
Get what I mean?


417
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,030
You mean the tunnel I used


418
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,830
to meet with you when we were kids?


419
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,770
Later, when no one is looking,


420
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,710
you'll help him escape.


421
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,770
Qin Lie will not come out.


422
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,530
Is he trying to get himself killed?


423
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,160
Qin Lie,


424
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,760
if you don't work with me,


425
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,700
you will have no chance to live.


426
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,470
Qin Lie?


427
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,400
You're pretending to be asleep?


428
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,460
You're going to die, and you're
pretending to sleep?


429
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,150
Qin Lie,


430
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,770
you've escaped.


431
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,890
Come on. Let's leave Ling Borough.


432
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,380
Leave?


433
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,830
Why should I leave?


434
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,210
I sneaked out to see the moon.


435
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,530
Not to run away.


436
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,420
Yu Shi really does know you well.


437
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,800
Xuan Xuan said you're going
to die for sure.


438
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,940
You must leave.


439
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Go back. I have things to think about.


440
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,660
Leave me alone.


441
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,880
Are you waiting for the moon or
are you thinking about things?


442
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,840
Can't I do both?


443
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,530
Why haven't you passed out?


444
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,470
Yu Xin,


445
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,450
carry my message to the chief.


446
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,440
Tell him the Ye family wants to use
me to get Ling Borough's support.


447
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,130
Ask the chief how he wants to handle it.


448
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,810
Go now.


449
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,960
Sneaking out as a suspect


450
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,420
just to see the moon.


451
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,660
Is it worth it?


452
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,820
We can see the moon at
Xingyun Pavilion every night.


453
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,190
I heard the moon at Xingyun Pavilion


454
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,440
is faint


455
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,150
and dim.


456
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,730
Nothing compared to the moon
at Ling Borough


457
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,400
which appears every year


458
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,160
clear and bright.


459
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,240
Where do you set your sights at?


460
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,660
Purple Mist Sea?


461
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,310
Artefact Forging Sect.


462
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,410
That far?


463
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,470
It's just the starting point.


464
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,030
Are you curious what's there?


465
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,990
Here in the far north,


466
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,310
people would kill


467
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,110
to get into Xingyun Pavilion.


468
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,780
They think Xingyun Pavilion


469
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,290
is the most glamorous place
in Chilan Continent.


470
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,540
Little do they know that Xingyun Pavilion


471
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,030
is the lowest


472
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,280
Bluestone Class in Chilan Continent.


473
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,430
People have no idea


474
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,760
how big the world is.


475
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,150
Do you have bigger ambitions?


476
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,820
All my life, I've been looking


477
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,140
for a kindred spirit.


478
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,380
Someone with high aspirations like me.


479
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,010
An equal with whom


480
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,420
I can explore


481
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,910
heaven and hell.


482
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,630
I noticed you


483
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,650
watching from the sidelines.


484
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,850
You obviously came here to convict me,


485
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,880
but you let Deacon Zhuo


486
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,720
do all the talking.


487
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,160
You're a scheming person.


488
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,180
Looking for a kindred spirit?


489
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
More like


490
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,920
looking for a


491
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,550
partner in crime.


492
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,510
The Spirit Realm is huge.


493
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,310
The Chilan Continent


494
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,920
is just a little speckle


495
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,570
at the edge of the realm.


496
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,600
And in the vast far north,


497
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,230
your family


498
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,990
is even more insignificant.


499
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,950
What's the use in having
high ambitions?


500
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,150
Without anyone to help you,


501
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,790
you might not even survive tonight,


502
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,030
let alone get out of Ling Borough.


503
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,940
You came all the way here


504
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,739
just to investigate the case?


505
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,770
You have no other purpose?


506
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,750
Why did you change the subject?


507
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,770
Because I don't think 
we're hitting it off.


508
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,020
Get back to the woodshed.
Don't make me attack you.
