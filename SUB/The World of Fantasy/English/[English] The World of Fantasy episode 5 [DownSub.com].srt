[Episode 5]


4
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,950
Yu Shi?


5
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,130
Something's up.


6
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,050
What is?


7
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,810
Emergency at Xingyun Pavilion.


8
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,810
The old master of Xingyun Pavilion,


9
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,810
the whole Ye family
including Ye Yang Qiu,


10
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,770
and two of their closest families,


11
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,650
all wiped out overnight.


12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,020
Who did it?


13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,430
The four families of Xingyun Pavilion


14
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,730
got wiped out in just one night.


15
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,889
Not even the servants were spared.


16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,560
What a coldblooded
and vicious murderer.


17
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,560
It sends chills down my spine.


18
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,240
Qin Lie,


19
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,000
do you know who the murderer is?


20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,090
Hundreds of lives were taken
silently in just one night.


21
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,540
Could it be


22
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
the Soul Reaping Beast?


23
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,680
It's impossible.


24
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,020
The Soul Reaping Beast


25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,970
was already killed by the Saintess.


26
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,680
This is equivalent to


27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,579
eradicating Xingyun Pavilion.


28
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,750
I had reported this matter
to the Palace of Hell.


29
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,780
I'll kill this villain once the


30
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,150
actual perpetrator is identified.


31
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,620
Profound Heaven Emissary,


32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,860
in light of Xingyun Pavilion's misfortune,


33
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,579
I hope you could report it to the Saintess


34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,100
and help Xingyun Pavilion
weather the storm.


35
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,810
Right!


36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,150
Please help us with this,
Profound Heaven Emissary.


37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,270
Alright.


38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,590
Yu Shi,


39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,880
where are you going?


40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,079
Whether the Soul Reaping Beast
is the murderer or not,


41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,880
I need to stop by Ling Borough.


42
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm worried about their safety.


43
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,579
No.


44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,190
It's too dangerous to go there alone.


45
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,700
I'll go with you.


46
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,540
Qin Lie, how about you?


47
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,660
Nonsense!


48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,590
I would never tip off
the Alliance and get killed.


49
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,530
Do you think...


50
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,780
It can't be the Soul Reaping Beast.


51
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,970
Let's go.


52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,840
Xiao Ying!


53
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,410
Hua Yu Xin?


54
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,350
Go back and wait.


55
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,600
Xiao Ying, can I come with you?


56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,760
No, Master Hua specifically ordered me


57
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,120
not to take you there.


58
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,800
Have you found Xuan Xuan?


59
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,010
Go back and have a rest.


60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,529
Let us handle this.


61
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,540
Let's go!


62
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,660
-Yes, let's go.
-Yes.


63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,850
Let's go.


64
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,170
Okay, let's go.


65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,640
Xuan Xuan.


66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,090
Xuan Xuan.


67
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,860
Yu Xin, what's wrong with you?


68
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,570
Isn't Xuan Xuan back yet?


69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,360
Several teams have been


70
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,200
searching for her for days


71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,150
for hundreds of miles of Ling Borough,


72
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,560
but to no avail.


73
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,480
Stop crying. Let's go.


74
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,020
We'll discuss it when we get back.


75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,659
I... I can walk by myself.


76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,200
You guys can go back.


77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,530
Xuan Xuan would be happy


78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,130
to see someone waiting for her


79
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,150
if she gets back.


80
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,800
Xingyun Pavilion


81
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,320
was almost annihilated in just one night.


82
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,470
There's no need to guess.


83
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,159
It must be the Du family.


84
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,020
Something doesn't feel right.


85
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,580
Not to mention that


86
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,440
the Du family of Xingyun Pavilion
doesn't have the power.


87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,930
Even if they have the power,


88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,220
why did they kill all the forces


89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,900
and left the shell of Xingyun Pavilion?


90
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,310
To build a tavern?


91
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,890
The Ling Borough must be affected


92
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,680
if something has happened
to Xingyun Pavilion.


93
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,770
How about this?


94
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,980
Qin Lie, Gao Yu,


95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,520
tell them


96
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,430
to alert the whole borough
in addition


97
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,010
to finding Xuan Xuan.


98
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,130
Yes, sir.


99
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,320
Father,


100
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,710
something happened to Xingyun Pavilion.


101
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,110
I know.


102
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,580
Uncle Xiang came here today.


103
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,730
They deserved it.


104
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,270
Father!


105
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,870
Xuan Xuan may be a wilful child,


106
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,240
but this all started


107
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,700
because Du Shao Yang
forced her to marry him.


108
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,230
I would never forgive him


109
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,920
if anything happens to Xuan Xuan.


110
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,930
And Xingyun Pavilion.


111
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,450
[Outside the Far North's borders,
at the foot of Qisha Valley]


112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,850
This person is really weird.


113
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,830
She's still wearing like that right now.


114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,950
Right, it's a strange world.


115
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,020
Look at her vacant expression.


116
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,960
Could she be a ditz?


117
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,070
Look at this model.


118
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,690
They both have excellent


119
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,010
material and colour.


120
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,440
Lady,


121
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,150
do you want to buy clothes?


122
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,909
Mr Proprietor,


123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
look, it's very pretty.


124
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,450
Mr Proprietor, how much is this cloth?


125
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,310
It's not expensive.
Only 300 stone coins.


126
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,890
How about this?


127
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,400
That's not expensive either.


128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,510
Only 130 stone coins.


129
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,080
Then,


130
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,390
which cloth can I buy
with two stone coins?


131
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,640
Two stone coins?


132
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,000
-This...
-I can't buy any of them?


133
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,429
Forget it.


134
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,570
I'll leave then.


135
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,570
Don't leave.


136
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,900
If you just walk out like this
without buying anything,


137
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,100
I'll lose the reputation of my store.


138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,270
Two stone coins...


139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,600
Wait here. I'll take it for you now.


140
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,470
-My bag! Stop there!
-Catch the thief!


141
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,310
Catch the thief!


142
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,380
Get out of my way!


143
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,050
Get out of my way!


144
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,510
Get out of my way!


145
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,860
-Get out of my way!
-Stop there!


146
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,530
To hell with you!


147
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,970
Stop there!


148
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,640
Watch where you're going!


149
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,410
Xuan Xuan!


150
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,930
Xuan Xuan!


151
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,950
Xuan Xuan!


152
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,730
Xuan Xuan!


153
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,930
Yu Xin has been staying at the South Door


154
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,180
since he came back from Xingyun Pavilion.


155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,210
He wouldn't eat, drink, sleep,


156
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,300
or go home.


157
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,230
Master Hua is so mad that
he wants to kill someone.


158
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,720
And his wife cried so hard.


159
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,420
Gao Yu,


160
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,130
I tend to think...


161
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,750
Think what?


162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,730
How do I say it?


163
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,670
It feels like


164
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,550
someone is following us.


165
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,610
What do you mean?


166
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,090
I'm saying that


167
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,050
I think there's a


168
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,110
non-existent person in Ling Borough.


169
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,080
Where?


170
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,190
This is what I think.


171
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,510
There's no one here.


172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,010
Don't try to scare me.


173
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,530
I must be rattled


174
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,180
as I have a lot on my mind recently.


175
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,080
Let's go.


176
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,800
Let's have a drink with Yu Xin.


177
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,530
Get him drunk


178
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,150
and send him back to have a sleep.


179
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,390
I was thinking the same thing.


180
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,860
We finally get to drink together,


181
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,330
yet we're wallowing in misery.


182
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,660
It was you who dragged me here.


183
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,470
How can I drink


184
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,400
when Xuan Xuan is still missing?


185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
Can you stop talking about Xuan Xuan
just for a while?


186
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,890
With all the things happening,


187
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,500
we hardly had a chance to sit down
and drink together.


188
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,920
If one day, a windstorm comes


189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,570
and takes one of us away,


190
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,170
we'd never have a gathering again.


191
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,620
What are you crying for?


192
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,250
If I don't cry now,


193
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,350
it would be useless for me to cry


194
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,460
when we can't meet each other.


195
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,070
Qin Lie,


196
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,530
Gao Yu,


197
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,590
thanks, guys.


198
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,450
What's that for?


199
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,400
We grew up together.


200
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,750
As a child, I was timid,
and an outlander to boot.


201
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,770
Yet you guys were willing to
take me as your brother


202
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,620
and look after me.


203
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,690
Beware of getting drunk


204
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,360
as you drank that much.


205
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,450
Come on!


206
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,800
Come on!


207
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,770
Qin Lie, Gao Yu,


208
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,320
I never thought that


209
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,210
I would dare to fight.


210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,690
You think Ling Borough is so great?


211
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,280
You think you're all that because


212
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,510
your father is the master?


213
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,970
Go on and cry!


214
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,640
You're a big man?
Go on and cry!


215
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,340
Cry. No one's going to help you.


216
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,750
Stop!


217
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,010
Why do you pick on Yu Shi?


218
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,230
Beat him up!


219
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,630
-Father, mother!
-Beat him up!


220
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,130
Help me!


221
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,840
I thought you were strong.


222
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,110
Yes.


223
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,560
-I thought you were strong.
-Coward!


224
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,340
-Coward! Coward!
-Bring it on!


225
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,510
-Coward!
-Don't pick on him!


226
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,190
I didn't expect


227
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,580
Yu Xin to be the first one


228
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,880
to fight.


229
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,900
When I arrived,


230
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,240
-I thought I was dreaming.
-True.


231
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,820
Qin Lie, Gao Yu,


232
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,650
that was the first time I fought


233
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,150
and got injured.


234
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,520
But I was happy,


235
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,980
ha...happy.


236
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,060
After that,


237
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,610
you guys took me as your brother.


238
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,900
I still remembered that
Yu Shi was injured that time


239
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,540
and Gao Yu was the first one
to rush to Yu Shi...


240
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,160
This bookworm


241
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,140
drinks like a fish.


242
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,550
How are you going to face Yu Shi?


243
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,050
About the murder in Xingyun Pavilion,


244
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,250
I...I really suspect
the Soul Reaping Beast.


245
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,920
You didn't know it before


246
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,970
or you pretended not to know it.


247
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,830
But now, she's confessed
her feelings to you.


248
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
Confessed?


249
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,760
Qin Lie,


250
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,470
Yu Xin already told me.


251
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,840
You're a man.


252
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,990
You couldn't even dare to face a woman?


253
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,030
Either accept her or


254
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,980
set her straight.


255
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,610
Do you like her after all these years?


256
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,030
I drank too much.


257
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,260
Send him home.


258
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,180
I think your conscience is sealed
by the Soul Suppressing Orb.


259
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,960
Why are you still here?


260
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,210
I waited for you all night.


261
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,410
Where were you?


262
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,760
Patrolling.


263
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,960
Something just doesn't feel right.


264
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,800
The one who drank with us last night


265
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,750
was not Yu Xin.


266
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,660
What?


267
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,069
Last night,


268
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,740
when I sent Yu Xin home.


269
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,880
Let's go.


270
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,730
Qin Lie,


271
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,600
Gao Yu,


272
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,290
why am I here?


273
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,390
Is Xuan Xuan back yet?


274
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,770
Yu Xin,


275
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,300
what had happened yesterday


276
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,670
after we left?


277
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,870
I remembered that I met a lady


278
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,490
after you guys went back to town.


279
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,560
She was wearing a purple cloak.


280
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,080
Miss,


281
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,840
did you come from the snowfield?


282
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Then, have you seen a girl?


283
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,520
Her name is Xuan Xuan. She wears a gown
made of animal skin.


284
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,220
I asked her whether
she had seen Xuan Xuan before.


285
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,630
She said she had seen her before.


286
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,750
And then...


287
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,030
Then?


288
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,120
I can't remember what happened after that.


289
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,480
Yu Xin,


290
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,890
you're finally awake.


291
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,220
You scared me to death!


292
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,890
Last night when you came back,


293
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,850
you slept as soon as you laid down.


294
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,080
We couldn't wake you up.


295
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,110
Your father and I thought you were sick.


296
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,980
Turns out you're lovesick.


297
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,100
Madam,


298
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,210
we'll leave for now as
we have something to do.


299
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,000
What do I like to eat the most?


300
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,330
The dishes which Yu Shi cooked.


301
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,630
What do I like to eat the most?


302
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,580
I have no idea.


303
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,050
Don't do that.


304
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,360
I really don't know.


305
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,190
You usually eat whatever you have.


306
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,990
I've never seen you
so picky about food.


307
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,980
Alright.


308
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,600
It seems you're right that


309
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,500
the Soul Reaping Beast didn't die.


310
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,510
It must've followed us


311
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,760
all the way


312
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,390
after the massacre at Xingyun Pavilion.


313
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,790
Calm down.


314
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,960
Why is it following us?


315
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,320
To kill people?


316
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,190
We are all already dead


317
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,780
if it wants to kill people.


318
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,990
And most of the people in Ling Borough
are outlanders without spiritual powers.


319
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,020
There's no point in eating them.


320
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,680
Then what should we do now?


321
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,130
Tell the master?


322
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,140
Are you sure this is the real master?


323
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,550
Do we need to ask his favourite food too?


324
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,880
The master might be fake.


325
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,030
The elder might be fake too.


326
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,890
Then, every person in Ling Borough
might be fake as well.


327
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,740
The Soul Reaping Beast
can transform into anyone.


328
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,250
It'll cause a panic


329
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,820
if we spread the news now.


330
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,140
There'll be suspicion


331
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,560
and paranoia.


332
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,100
All hell will break loose.


333
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,670
Find more jade plates.


334
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,170
The more the better.


335
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,170
I'll store the thunder energy
in these jade plates


336
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,220
and wait until the
Soul Reaping Beast appears,


337
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,640
thousands of Thunder Storage
Jade Plates will be thrown to it.


338
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,100
This can scare it away


339
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,510
even if it didn't get killed.


340
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,660
Are you sure about this?


341
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,170
Yes, I'm sure.


342
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,880
But I have no money.


343
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,870
Gao Yu! Gao Yu!


344
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,030
Don't go! I really don't have money.


345
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,930
Yu Shi?


346
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,540
You're back.


347
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,310
Why are you still here


348
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,960
at this late hour?


349
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,900
A lot of things have happened recently.


350
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,760
I can't fall asleep.


351
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,170
You can't fall asleep?


352
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,200
Drink some warm water, it'll be better.


353
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,450
Yu Shi,


354
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,410
what's wrong with you?


355
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,030
What are you doing?


356
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,600
Look, Qin Lie came to see Yu Shi again.


357
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,450
Yu Shi,


358
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,830
come out here for a second.


359
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,590
I have something to tell you.


360
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,590
You should go.


361
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,440
We have nothing to say.


362
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,380
Stop there.


363
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,490
You just leave as I told you to.


364
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,490
Are you really that sick of me?


365
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,340
You even refuse to look at me.


366
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,520
Then, why did you eat the dishes
that I cooked


367
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,300
and wear the clothes that I made?


368
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,510
Stop there.


369
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,410
You're so rude to Yu Shi.


370
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,970
And you can't even take a scolding.


371
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,210
Qin Lie, you call yourself a man?


372
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,100
She hasn't finished, you can't leave.


373
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,760
Why do you stare at me?
Are you going to hit me?


374
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,330
Alright,


375
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,580
go ahead.


376
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,390
Scold me.


377
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,810
You thought I'm scolding you?


378
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,860
Qin Lie,


379
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,840
I really can't stand it anymore.


380
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,830
I never complain about
the way you treat me.


381
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,520
But you even pushed me away last night


382
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,510
when I devoted myself to you.


383
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,170
Today,


384
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,120
you're standing in front of me
as if nothing happened.


385
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,050
How can I stand it?


386
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,380
Say something! Say it!


387
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,880
What do you want me to say?


388
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,700
Either she kills me


389
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,880
or I kill myself.


390
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,150
Qin Lie,


391
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,960
your house is on fire,
and it's being robbed.


392
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,280
Come back with me.


393
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,570
She's gone nuts!


394
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,270
Do you sense


395
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,860
something off about Yu Shi?


396
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,210
I suspect that she is
the Soul Reaping Beast.


397
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,380
I would rather that she was
the Soul Reaping Beast just now.


398
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,610
It's not funny!


399
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,730
If she really was the incarnation
of the Soul Reaping Beast,


400
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,370
then it could explain why


401
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,370
she was acting abnormally just now.


402
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,730
Was she?


403
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,150
I feel she treated you exactly right.


404
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,770
I'm talking about
the Soul Reaping Beast!


405
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,470
The Soul Reaping Beast
transformed into Yu Xin,


406
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,600
and now


407
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,890
Yu Shi.


408
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,520
What on earth does it want?


409
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,930
It certainly comes after Qin Lie.


410
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,240
Saintess Song!


411
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,570
Profound Heaven Emissary,


412
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,340
how impressive!


413
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm just safekeeping it.


414
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,380
Saintess Xie died at the claws
of the Soul Reaping Beast.


415
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,940
If I don't kill the Soul Reaping Beast
on this trip,


416
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,580
I would be ashamed to go back to
the Profound Heaven Alliance.


417
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,230
If you could help me hunt
the Soul Reaping Beast,


418
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,850
I'll let the matter of


419
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,810
the Profound Heaven Badge drop.


420
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,790
Saintess Song, you said that


421
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,560
the Soul Reaping Beast
came after Qin Lie?


422
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,080
The Soul Reaping Beast is very vengeful.


423
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,330
How could it not take revenge on Qin Lie


424
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,140
as he hurt it in the God Trapping Cave?


425
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,020
How is it going to take revenge on me?


426
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,950
Transform into Ling Yu Shi.


427
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,540
Are you sure that this
Yu Shi is the fake one?


428
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,890
It's been a few days since I got here.


429
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,620
I have been lurking and never show up.


430
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,610
That's what I'm saying.


431
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,120
There's a non-existent person
in Ling Borough recently.


432
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,110
I thought it was the Soul Reaping Beast.


433
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,250
It was me.


434
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,900
Once the Soul Reaping Beast
is in the dark,


435
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,960
I'll be in the dark as well.


436
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,860
I've been observing each person
in Ling Borough.


437
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,110
I'm sure that the current Ling Yu Shi


438
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,870
is the Soul Reaping Beast.


439
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,240
Why does it transform into Yu Shi?


440
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,320
Destroying one's soul is more lethal
than killing people.


441
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,850
The power of the
Soul Reaping Beast is that


442
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,330
it can transform into the person
you care the most


443
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,740
to confuse you,


444
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,260
let you destroy the woman
you love the most by your own hand.


445
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:54,100
I love the most...


446
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,230
It doesn't matter whether she is or not.


447
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,570
She will die anyway.


448
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,890
You mean


449
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,380
you're going to kill this Yu Shi?


450
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,400
Of course.


451
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,630
No.


452
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,920
What if this Yu Shi is the real one?


453
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,250
I'd rather kill the wrong one
than let it go.


454
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,390
Let alone


455
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,920
I can't be wrong.


456
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,320
Let's go.


457
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,110
May I borrow this?


458
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,310
You guys look awful.


459
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,150
Looks like I was right.


460
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,580
If this Yu Shi is the fake one,


461
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,110
where's the real one?


462
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,610
She got eaten.


463
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,810
Then we can't kill her.


464
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,220
Why?


465
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,700
First,


466
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,550
I need sufficient evidence to prove that


467
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,170
this Yu Shi is the fake one.


468
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,550
Second, if she really is the fake one,


469
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,180
I'd need to find out Yu Shi's whereabouts.


470
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,490
Ling Yu Shi is already dead!


471
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,250
-What if she isn't?
-Calm down!


472
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,700
Calm down, everyone.


473
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,320
Someone's here.


474
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,020
Qin Lie,


475
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,620
the master wants to see you.


476
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,990
Uncle Ling,


477
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,030
you wished to see me?


478
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,840
Come here.


479
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,160
Offer an incense for Yu Shi's mother.


480
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,290
[Ancestor's Memorial Tablet]


481
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
Come, Qin Lie.


482
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,150
Come.


483
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,720
There's a thing I want to
discuss with you.


484
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,480
Let me know what you think.


485
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,910
I wish to promise Yu Shi to Yu Xin.


486
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,320
What?


487
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,160
What about Xuan Xuan?


488
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,790
Look, Xuan Xuan hasn't been back
for so long.


489
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,990
Yu Xin is heartbroken.


490
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,790
If I betroth Yu Shi to him,


491
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,300
I can make it up to him.


492
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,320
Yu Xin is stubborn.


493
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,060
The one he likes is Xuan Xuan.


494
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,970
He won't be happy even if
he gets to marry Yu Shi.


495
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,740
Once they get married,
she'll grow on him.


496
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,590
Uncle Ling,


497
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,690
is this a joke?


498
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,910
I knew it was a joke.


499
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,420
How can one force love?


500
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,390
So you know love can't be forced.


501
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,370
Looks like I've been joshing
with you so much


502
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,520
that you forgot I'm the master.


503
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,480
Master.


504
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,820
You're not interested in Yu Shi,


505
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,460
yet you never made your feelings
clear to her.


506
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,490
You make Yu Shi suffer.


507
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,860
If it wasn't for your grandfather,


508
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,760
I would have beaten you to death.


509
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,740
What are you doing?


510
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,050
Hitting the unfaithful fiend


511
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,680
and avenging Yu Shi.


512
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,930
Then you should at least


513
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,710
wait until I've finished speaking.


514
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,940
Haven't you finished yet?


515
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,290
It hurts.


516
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,600
Bear with it!


517
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,930
It hurts!


518
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,710
Gao Yu,


519
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,050
I suspect Uncle Ling is
the Soul Reaping Beast.


520
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,840
Is it here?


521
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,230
-Is it here?
-It hurts!


522
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,650
Enough! I'm going to
kill Ling Yu Shi now!


523
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,800
Don't you dare!


524
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,780
Calm down!


525
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,340
Qin Lie,


526
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,710
Saintess Song and I had a discussion


527
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,340
while you were away.


528
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,180
Saintess Song is sensible.


529
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,460
She agreed and said


530
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,530
she will only decide what to do next


531
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,020
after we proved Ling Yu Shi is fake.


532
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,300
How to prove it?


533
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,190
The Soul Reaping Beast may be scary,


534
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,660
but it is naive.


535
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,360
It'll reveal its true colours


536
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,490
once it gets what it wants.


537
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,780
To tell if it's real,


538
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,260
you must make it think
you've fallen into its trap.


539
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,580
How to do it?


540
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,740
No!


541
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,860
I would never say those words to Yu Shi.


542
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,140
Why?


543
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,940
What if


544
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,890
this Yu Shi is the real one?


545
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,810
She's fake.


546
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,320
She is the fake one.


547
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,429
Yu Shi,


548
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,360
I have something to tell you.


549
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,420
Go ahead.


550
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,810
Are you hungry


551
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,530
or are your clothes torn?


552
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,800
She is the fake one...fake.


553
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,900
Yu Shi,


554
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,420
I...


555
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,700
Let go of me.


556
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,800
I like you.


557
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,600
I've liked you since childhood,


558
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,120
but I never had the guts to confess.


559
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,300
I promised my grandfather that
I'll become the Supreme Lord.


560
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,630
I'm afraid that I'll have to leave
Ling Borough someday.


561
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm a thunder practitioner.


562
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,480
Every time I ascend to a new realm,
I risk being obliterated.


563
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,070
The Soul Suppressing Orb is still
sealing my memories.


564
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,390
I...


565
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,480
I...


566
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,220
I'm afraid I might
get you into trouble


567
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,890
as I have lots of enemies.


568
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm not afraid of missing you
for eternity,


569
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,280
but I'm afraid of letting you wait
for eternity.


570
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,570
Liar.


571
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,050
I can cook,


572
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,680
but I'd rather you cook.


573
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,380
I can sew,


574
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,930
but I'd rather you sew.


575
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,310
I can make money by hunting spirit beasts,


576
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,620
but I'd rather borrow from you.


577
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,660
I want to be with you every day.


578
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,800
I understand.


579
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,760
I'm always the one you trust the most


580
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,390
and care the most.


581
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,540
I swear to heaven and earth.


582
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,900
You are my happiness


583
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,490
and my sadness.


584
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,430
If you wish to have an ordinary life,


585
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,340
I'll abandon my dream
of being the Supreme Lord.


586
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,190
If you're willing to join me


587
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,170
in my path to become the Supreme Lord,


588
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,060
I'll give you all of my achievements.


589
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,310
I only wish to be with you


590
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,330
for the rest of life.


591
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,310
Let us face everything


592
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,980
together in the future.


593
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,150
Really?


594
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,220
Yu Shi,


595
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,110
marry me.


596
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,040
How is it?


597
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,870
Are you sure?


598
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,890
That Yu Shi is the fake one.


599
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,070
She is the Soul Reaping Beast.


600
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,910
How about the real Yu Shi?


601
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,490
Ling Yu Shi


602
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,420
was eaten by the Soul Reaping Beast.


603
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,180
The Soul Reaping Beast
chose Ling Yu Shi


604
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,420
because it knew you couldn't kill her.


605
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,420
Qin Lie, could you?


606
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,770
I'll do it if he can't!


607
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,960
I'll do it!


608
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,090
Tell me.


609
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,210
How to kill it?


610
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,750
Tomorrow morning,


611
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,040
you'll ask the Ling family
for her hand in marriage.


612
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,070
What?


613
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,890
You're back.


614
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,650
Gao Yu,


615
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,790
do you trust Song Ting Yu?


616
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,740
What do you mean?


617
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,350
I don't trust her.


618
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,680
The Soul Reaping Beast is real,


619
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,790
and it's true that she wants to kill it.


620
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,990
But I still don't trust her.


621
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,290
Her mind is too complicated.


622
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,260
It's really hard to keep track.


623
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,500
What is your idea?


624
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,340
I want you to find the Master of Frost.


625
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,690
The Master of Frost?


626
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,500
We've never met
the Master of Frost before,


627
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,050
yet she ordered the frostwolves
to help us.


628
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,360
I think


629
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,120
she is well-intentioned.


630
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,790
Only the Master of Frost


631
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,970
can save the day if things go south.


632
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,430
I don't know if I can find her.


633
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,960
Will they even


634
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,020
bother with me even if I found her?


635
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,880
Moreover,


636
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,150
I can't make it back either


637
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,700
if something happens here.


638
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,500
We're dead already before you


639
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,740
come back if something really happens.


640
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,390
At least you're alive.


641
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,080
You can restore justice for us


642
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,230
after knowing the truth.


643
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,920
Okay.


644
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,370
I'll be quick.


645
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,810
Gao Yu.


646
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,910
Yu Shi?


647
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,780
Why are you here?


648
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,310
Qin Lie asked my father for my hand.


649
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,430
At the moment when my father agrees,


650
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,920
I only know


651
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,750
the one I love isn't him.


652
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,980
It's you.


653
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
You're not Ling Yu Shi.


654
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,850
You're Soul Reaping Beast.


655
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,050
I'm Yu Shi.


656
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,450
I'm the Ling Yu Shi that
you've been dreaming of,


657
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,060
the Ling Yu Shi that you love.


658
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,010
Ain't I?


659
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,360
Take me with you.


660
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,190
Take me far away.


661
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,390
Do you know why I spared only you


662
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,620
when I unleashed that bloodbath
in Xingyun Pavilion?


663
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,470
On the surface,


664
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,690
you seem like a suave, easy-going person.


665
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,810
But deep down, you carry
a lot of baggage.


666
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,590
Gao Yu,


667
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,850
I saw your evil side.


668
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,970
You are the one we, the Dark Nether Race,
have been looking for.


669
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,480
Once you're reborn,


670
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,730
you will use the Du family for your cause,


671
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,590
for the Dark Nether Race's cause.


672
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,570
Sweet dreams.


673
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,790
Have a good sleep.
