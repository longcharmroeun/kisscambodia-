[Episode 19]


4
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,950
Lian Rou, there is a
lot of demon aura here.


5
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,070
It's all demon aura out there too.


6
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,389
There is no way out.


7
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,900
It's the scent of Demon Purifying Grass.


8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
This is a Demon Cleansing Pill
made from the Demon Purifying Grass.


9
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,360
But the efficacy of this pill


10
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,680
won't last for long.


11
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,390
How can there be


12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
so much demon aura in
the Artefact Forging Sect?


13
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,260
The master has ordered a retreat.


14
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,400
Let's talk about this on our way out.


15
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,420
Okay.


16
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,650
Hurry up.


17
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,220
Oh, Gong Mu Shan,


18
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,780
why didn't you tell us
everything 700 years ago?


19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,240
You only said half of it.


20
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,590
What do you mean the
Artefact Forging Sect can't be tainted?


21
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,300
You didn't make it clear.


22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,680
And look at how things have turned out.


23
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,630
The time hadn't come back then.


24
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,650
I couldn't say it.


25
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,000
So the time has come now?


26
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,570
If it hadn't come,


27
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,210
I wouldn't have let my grandson


28
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,500
pull out the Spiritual Lines Pillar.


29
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,200
I think I understand
what you are trying to do.


30
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,780
I can feel that


31
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,730
in a short time,


32
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,850
the God Race will return.


33
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,180
And when that happens,


34
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,550
the Spirit Realm will turn into
a battlefield again.


35
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,860
Since the time has come,


36
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm afraid that if we
don't do something early,


37
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,580
it would be too late by then.


38
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,980
But this is a risky move.


39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,580
My friend, no matter how smart you are,


40
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,510
you're not infallible,


41
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,240
there is no guarantee that there
won't be any unforeseen problems.


42
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,980
There's always risk
in getting things done.


43
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,490
As long as the most important purpose


44
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,680
is served, it's fine.


45
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,540
Your precious grandson


46
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,270
has fallen into the Nether Realm.


47
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,660
Aren't you worried he might
get eaten by nether beasts?


48
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,050
Good fall.


49
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,010
Mang Wang, go.


50
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,340
[Mang Wang]


51
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,730
Go!


52
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,490
Song Si Yuan, I want to see Chief Song.


53
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,230
Si Yuan, go and invite him again.


54
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,510
Yes.


55
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,610
Forget it.


56
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,150
He called himself a Master?


57
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,480
More like a coward.


58
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,860
He has probably run away in fear
with his tail between his legs.


59
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,990
I'm here, I'm here.


60
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,210
I, Xie Yi, apologise for being late.


61
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,230
Forgive me for keeping everyone waiting.


62
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,550
Sorry.


63
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,610
Please forgive me.


64
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,010
-Master Xie,
-I'm sorry.


65
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,570
I, Song Yu, am not
trying to shirk my responsibility.


66
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,710
I've explained


67
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,040
this matter to Master Ying.


68
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,760
Everything that happened before,


69
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,340
I know nothing about it.


70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,970
But


71
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,650
we are not shirking our responsibility.


72
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,150
Now...


73
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,570
I, Xie Yi, know that I've made a mistake.


74
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,420
I've made a mistake!


75
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,130
You're a Master.


76
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,670
Please get up, get up now.


77
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm guilty, I shouldn't get up.


78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Because of my
recklessness and belligerence,


79
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,180
I have made a huge mistake.


80
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,600
I still regret it.


81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,020
I'm here to accept my punishment.


82
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,000
Please punish me, Chief Song.


83
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,030
And of course, Eight Extremes Temple


84
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,550
is now under your command, Chief Song.


85
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,510
People say Xie Yi is a lunatic.


86
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,630
How are you crazy?


87
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Now that you're kneeling like this,


88
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,270
what else can I do with you?


89
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,419
Lang Xie.


90
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm filled with deep regret.
My heart aches.


91
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,850
My heart aches.


92
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm willing to accept any
punishment, Chief Song.


93
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,950
700 years ago,


94
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,750
the Sage forbade us from encroaching


95
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,950
on the Artefact Forging Sect.


96
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,840
Turns out it was because of the


97
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,390
nether passageway located
beneath the Spiritual Lines Hall.


98
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,170
I believe that these
12 Spiritual Lines Pillars


99
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,790
were also placed by the Sage


100
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,510
to seal the passage.


101
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,190
I, Song Yu, have no way of knowing


102
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,320
why he didn't tell the truth back then,


103
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,090
which led to the accident today.


104
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,410
Master Xie and I


105
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,230
are to be blamed for what happened today.


106
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,490
I didn't know the five great sects
would launch an attack.


107
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,300
You didn't know? Really?


108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,940
Just passing the blame to others easily.


109
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,920
Lang Xie,


110
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,640
the opening of nether passageway


111
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,860
isn't just a threat to
the Artefact Forging Sect,


112
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,850
but it threatens the
whole Chilan Continent.


113
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,240
Why don't we set aside
our differences for now


114
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,640
and fight together against the enemy?


115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Well said.


116
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,500
Master Ying...


117
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,680
No, the current leader is still Qin Lie.


118
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,480
But unfortunately, Master Qin
has fallen into the Abyss.


119
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,840
It's unknown


120
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,100
whether he's still alive or not.


121
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,330
Master Ying,


122
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,740
to me,


123
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,280
you're the only leader, Master Ying.


124
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,360
I feel the same way, Master Ying.


125
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,690
You mustn't, you mustn't.


126
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,770
Master Ying, what about Master Xie?


127
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,770
He is forgiven.


128
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,930
Please get up, get up.


129
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,270
Master Ying, your heart


130
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,400
is as vast as the ocean.


131
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,990
I'm truly impressed.


132
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,270
It's nothing.


133
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,850
Master Ying,


134
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,140
now that the nether
passageway is wide open,


135
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,230
not to mention that the Dark Nether Race
could flood into the realm,


136
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,950
the biggest crisis right now


137
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,840
is the spread of the demon aura.


138
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,970
Master Ying, do you have
a plan to deal with this?


139
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,300
This is a Demon Cleansing Pill.


140
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,070
Refine it and absorb
it into your spirit court.


141
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,270
It would help you to resist
the demon aura for a while.


142
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,720
Next,


143
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,480
I'll need everybody's help to


144
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,150
plant this Demon Purifying Grass


145
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,260
in every corner of Firetop Mountain,


146
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,640
in order to prevent the
demon aura from getting out.


147
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,060
Also, the nether beasts that
came out with the demon aura,


148
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,820
need to be eliminated as soon as possible.


149
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,470
Brilliant plan, Master Ying.


150
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,020
Given the critical situation,


151
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,160
the Horned Demon army of
the Nether Realm may attack at any time.


152
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,150
We, the Profound Heaven Alliance
and Eight Extremes Temple,


153
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,870
will do everything in
our power to fight them


154
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,980
and protect everyone's safety.


155
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,040
However...


156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,310
Chief Song,


157
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,690
you're trying to ask
if the Artefact Forging Sect


158
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,280
has any weapon that can
help the resistance, aren't you?


159
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,610
Of course we have.


160
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,440
Master Mo Hai is our most powerful weapon.


161
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,570
But you people


162
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,720
just murdered his wife.


163
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,220
Who killed her?


164
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,950
We'll deal with this matter later.


165
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,960
Master!


166
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,200
I said, we'll deal with this matter later.


167
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,750
Chief Song,


168
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,240
Saintess Song showed up


169
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,220
in the Artefact Forging Sect
again for some reason.


170
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,260
And she has fallen into
the Abyss with Qin Lie.


171
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,600
How do you plan to rescue her, Chief Song?


172
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,480
[Forest in the Abyss]


173
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,660
Qin Lie?


174
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,000
Qin Lie?


175
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,290
Qin Lie?


176
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,960
Show yourself.


177
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,450
[Kun Sen]


178
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,830
Human race.


179
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,070
The Horned Demons are comparable to
Netherpassage Realm human cultivators.


180
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,860
[What are you fighting for?]


181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,070
[For the glory of the
Profound Heaven Alliance?]


182
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,210
[For the safety of Chilan Continent?]


183
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,610
[No.]


184
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,990
[What are you fighting for then?]


185
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,160
[For Gong Mu Lie.]


186
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,730
What a powerful weapon.


187
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,440
It has the same ability
to invade one's mind


188
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,850
like Soul Reaping Beast.


189
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,670
Thank you for your Demon Cleansing Pill.


190
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,160
What about you?


191
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm a Netherpassage Realm cultivator.
Mind your own business.


192
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,590
Have you seen Yu Shi?


193
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,990
I got separated from her.


194
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,110
I haven't seen her.


195
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,300
You're wounded.


196
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,730
I'm fine.


197
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,490
Why did you hide it?


198
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,510
A saintess doesn't have
the right to be injured?


199
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,450
Now that we're trapped here,


200
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,340
and there's no way to find out
what's going on up there now,


201
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,330
let go of your pride as a saintess.


202
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,180
Yu Shi!


203
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,110
Yu Shi!


204
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,870
Qin Lie?


205
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,450
Qin Lie!


206
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,940
I'm here!


207
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,630
Yu Shi!


208
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,660
Yu Shi!


209
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,569
Yu Shi!


210
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,650
Qin Lie.


211
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,010
Why are you following me?


212
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,050
Where are you going to find Yu Shi?


213
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,340
The Abyss


214
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,060
is as large as the Chilan Continent.


215
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,130
How are you going to find her
in this vast Nether Realm?


216
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,120
Why do I always fail to protect her


217
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,760
at a critical moment like this?


218
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,430
Qin Lie, don't blame yourself.


219
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,700
I'm right here with you.


220
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,060
What's the use of losing your temper now?


221
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,740
The priority now is to find a way out


222
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,410
and protect ourselves.


223
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,080
If you find Ling Yu Shi,


224
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,150
and she falls into the hands
of the Horned Demons,


225
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,000
you'll still be able to protect her.


226
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,180
Qin Lie,


227
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm going to give you two options now.


228
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,230
First, pull yourself together.


229
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,740
Kill our way out together
once we find the exit.


230
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,510
Second, I'll kill you now,


231
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,740
before you attract the attention
of the Horned Demons


232
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,810
and put me in danger.


233
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,830
Why is your blood


234
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,720
purple?


235
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,080
The demon aura.


236
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,450
Cultivators who have reached the
Netherpassage Realm and higher


237
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,560
are capable of resisting demon aura.


238
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,450
But if you are injured,


239
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,650
the demon aura will enter
your body through your blood.


240
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,350
You gave me the last Demon Cleansing Pill.


241
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,680
In that case,


242
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,750
our only option is to find a way out now.


243
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,390
You're not going to look for
Ling Yu Shi anymore?


244
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,840
Of course I'll keep looking for her.


245
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,660
But you are being attacked
by the demon aura now,


246
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,520
you won't be able to
hang in there for long.


247
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,410
I'll get you out of here first.


248
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,530
This Thought Breaking Crystal


249
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,900
contains the Horned Demons' memories
of the battle of Purple Mist Sea.


250
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,220
You can use it to find


251
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,980
the way to Purple Mist Sea.


252
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,400
Why me?


253
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,850
Why don't you do it?


254
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,790
When one is absorbing the
Thought Breaking Crystal,


255
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,890
he will need to reach


256
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,740
a state of selflessness.


257
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,950
Your senses will be shut down,
you won't be able to move or speak.


258
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,380
If I let you stand guard
while I absorb it,


259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,490
when the Dark Nether Race attacks,


260
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,520
both of us won't be able to survive.


261
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,980
Although I'm poisoned by the demon aura,


262
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,530
my strength is still
much stronger than you.


263
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,540
Therefore, it's safer for
us to let me stand guard.


264
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,370
You once said


265
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,960
you're better than me.


266
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,070
You were right.


267
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,970
You can help him ascend
to a new realm so easily.


268
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,440
Qin Lie,


269
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,640
maybe she is the one


270
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,370
who can help you to go higher and further.


271
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,430
What's wrong?


272
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,080
I keep feeling that someone is beside me.


273
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,300
I think I hear Yu Shi talking to me.


274
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,370
Qin Lie,


275
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,780
I'm right here.


276
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,860
If it's meant to be, you'll
find each other eventually.


277
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,620
If it's not,


278
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,290
then that's it.


279
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,820
Qin Lie, wait for me.


280
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,560
Qin Lie.


281
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,220
You're awake.


282
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,180
Who are you?


283
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,660
[Zhao Xi]


284
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,880
I'm Zhao Xi. What's your name?


285
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Ling Yu Shi.


286
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,450
You were dreaming just now.


287
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,430
Dreaming?


288
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,730
Am I dead?


289
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,270
It's the Nightmare Crystal.


290
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,560
Nightmare Crystal?


291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,250
This place is different
from your human world.


292
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,160
Just like this place,
the Nightmare Valley,


293
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,920
where Nightmare Crystal
can be found everywhere.


294
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,330
When you are unconscious,


295
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,570
if your beloved one calls you softly,


296
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,770
Nightmare Crystal will
help you to come back.


297
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,840
You'll be able to return
to your loved one's side.


298
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,010
I was with him just now,


299
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,710
and yet I'm here now.


300
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,920
I couldn't see my own body,


301
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,730
I was just an apparition.


302
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,100
Actually


303
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,640
you've been here this whole time.


304
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,220
What you saw


305
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,410
is the reality


306
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,260
reflected by the Nightmare Crystal.


307
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,350
They left.


308
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,430
I wanted to go after them,


309
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,940
but no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't.


310
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,870
They?


311
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,540
He wasn't alone?


312
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,830
She was nice to him.


313
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,120
She would rather die


314
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,320
than kill him.


315
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,630
Someone came between you two?


316
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,030
Maybe


317
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,880
it's me who have come
between them from the beginning.


318
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,120
If you like him, go after him.


319
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,360
Don't give up.


320
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,350
If you love him, then try to let go.


321
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,060
Otherwise, you'll be miserable.


322
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,890
I surprised you, didn't I?


323
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,350
We Heaven Race know a thing
or two about relationships too.


324
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,210
You belong to the Nether tribe.


325
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,550
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.


326
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,570
Otherwise, I wouldn't have saved you.


327
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,490
[Human race?]


328
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,570
Aren't you afraid your
people will find out?


329
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,760
I am.


330
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,090
That's why I took the
hidden path on my way back.


331
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,720
I took a big detour


332
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,440
to avoid crowded areas.


333
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
This is your house?


334
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,800
It's a bit shabby, isn't it?


335
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,180
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.


336
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,820
Black Gold Vines


337
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,710
were abundant in the nearby valley.


338
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,260
But they were all used by
nether beasts to build nests.


339
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,900
I'll steal some back later
to make a bed for you.


340
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,190
That way you'll have a bed to rest.


341
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,750
I think I can understand now


342
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,430
why you people are
determined to go to the land above.


343
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,680
It's just that


344
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,540
why do you have to go to
war against the human race?


345
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,390
Wouldn't it be better


346
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,500
to skip the bloodshed and live in harmony?


347
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,210
It's you human race who...


348
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,900
What?


349
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,570
Nothing.


350
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,660
The Nether Crystal


351
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,470
is a treasure of the Nether Realm.


352
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,540
I heard from the older
generation of the tribe


353
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,210
that there used to be
a lot of nether crystals.


354
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,410
Even the flowers that bloomed on
the trees were nether crystal flowers.


355
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,780
They shone brightly
throughout the Nether Realm.


356
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,980
As the war went on and on later,


357
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,540
the strong ones consumed
too much of the crystals for cultivation,


358
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,180
which caused the crystals
to become less and less,


359
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,700
while the Nether Realm
became darker as well.


360
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,160
Without the daylight,
it's always night here.


361
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,750
Zhao Xi,


362
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,550
thank you.


363
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,820
Are you really a human race?


364
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,180
Why


365
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,600
are your hair and eyes purple?


366
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,050
Are you sick?


367
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,900
I don't know.


368
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,510
Probably because I've been tainted


369
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,400
by the demon aura.


370
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,670
I've seen humans tainted
by demon aura before.


371
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,690
They didn't look like this.


372
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,240
You look quite


373
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,400
tired and weak.


374
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,380
Get some rest.


375
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,230
I'll go get you a glass of water now.


376
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,730
I heard that people on the ground


377
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,450
can wash their faces
and bodies with water,


378
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,680
is it true?


379
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,010
Water is precious here.


380
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,550
We can only get one glass per day.


381
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,140
I'll go get my water for today.


382
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,720
You mustn't go anywhere.


383
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,600
[Why]


384
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,490
[is your blood purple?]


385
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,440
[The demon aura.]


386
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,680
[Cultivator of Netherpassage Realm
and above]


387
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,790
[is capable of resisting demon aura.]


388
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,600
[But if you are injured,]


389
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,800
[the demon aura will enter
your body through your blood.]


390
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,670
[I've seen humans tainted
by demon aura before.]


391
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,470
[They didn't look like this.]


392
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,440
[I can only use my power to
suppress the demon aura for now.]


393
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,950
The passageway has
been open for a long time,


394
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,920
but so far the Dark Nether Race
hasn't struck yet.


395
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,820
The longer they wait,
the worse it could be.


396
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,370
A storm is brewing.


397
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,520
This nether passageway
was opened suddenly,


398
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,330
it probably took the
Dark Nether Race by surprise too.


399
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
But the nether beasts that
ran out from the passageway


400
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,970
are getting stronger.


401
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,170
It's probably part of the
Dark Nether Race's plan.


402
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,620
My guess is that


403
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,560
they must be reorganising
their armed forces at the moment,


404
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,620
attempting to conquer
Chilan Continent in one fell swoop.


405
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,250
Also...


406
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,840
Say it.


407
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,420
About those nether beasts


408
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,000
that rushed out with the demon aura,


409
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,320
a few escaped during the chaos,


410
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,640
they're still missing for now.


411
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,800
I've ordered the sects to
send out their best disciples


412
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,080
to track them down and kill them.


413
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,480
It happened so fast.


414
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,110
I've made the decision
without your permission.


415
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,220
Please punish me, Chief Song.


416
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,660
You are my own brother.


417
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,370
I would never blame you.


418
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,920
I was afraid that the
Artefact Forging Sect


419
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,030
would grow more powerful and
become a disobedient force,


420
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,880
that's why I turned a blind eye


421
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,380
when the five great sects
attacked the Artefact Forging Sect.


422
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,270
I didn't expect


423
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,920
I would have to rely on them in the end.


424
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,020
Brother,


425
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,310
this is obviously that
lunatic Xie Yi's fault.


426
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,040
Even if Xie Yi did nothing,


427
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,330
if they didn't submit to me,


428
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,320
I would still attack them myself.


429
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,350
It'll still end the same way.


430
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,690
We can only blame the Sage from back then.


431
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,050
If he had said everything clearly,


432
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,850
we would not have attacked
the Artefact Forging Sect,


433
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,750
we would've done our
best to keep them safe.


434
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,810
And we would not end
up in this situation today.


435
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,940
No one knows


436
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,010
what the Sage's intention is.


437
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,550
Chief Song.


438
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,200
You keep an eye on that side.


439
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,090
Yes.


440
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,220
Chief Song.


441
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,250
Yi Yuan, what's the situation out there?


442
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,400
Chief,


443
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,410
all the residents of the Armoury City


444
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,210
who inhaled the demon aura


445
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,270
have been placed


446
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,900
in several warehouses in the west.


447
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,960
They are being treated by people of


448
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,400
the Artefact Forging Sect
and Cloud Sky Mountain.


449
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,180
And the whole Armoury City
has been vacated


450
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,940
for the disciples of
various sects to live in,


451
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,430
as a temporary military camp.


452
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,290
Water-Moon Sect,
Crimson Flame Association,


453
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,360
White Camel Mountain and other forces


454
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,340
have also sent their elites


455
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,060
to rush here without delay.


456
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,860
How are the masters of the five sects?


457
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,330
Other than missing a finger,


458
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,650
they are fine.


459
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,110
However,


460
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,610
they were the ones who attacked the
Artefact Forging Sect first,


461
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,340
and they were really rude.


462
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,070
Chief, I'm a citizen of Purple Mist Sea


463
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,650
and a member of the Artefact Forging Sect.


464
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,380
I help both sides and neither side.


465
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,020
They really crossed the line.


466
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,560
So?


467
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,500
So in order to avoid evoking hatred


468
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,770
from the Artefact Forging Sect


469
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,360
and destroying our alliance,


470
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,820
I've sent them back to recuperate.


471
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,230
I've sent someone to look after them.


472
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,560
This way, they won't
come running out again.


473
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,990
You did a great job.


474
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,470
I made the right decision picking you


475
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
to be my liaison with the
Artefact Forging Sect.


476
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,170
Thank you, Chief Song.


477
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,370
Has Master Mo Hai started crafting


478
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,950
the Terminator Profound Bombs?


479
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,460
Go and tell Master Mo Hai personally


480
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,600
if there is anything he needs,


481
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,360
I'll do my best to provide to him.


482
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,330
Yes.


483
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,580
Whether we can reseal
this nether passageway,


484
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,340
it's all on him.


485
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,000
Lord Lang Xie.


486
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,540
Shao Yang,


487
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,560
has there been any news
from the disciples of the sects


488
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,940
sent to hunt the escaped nether beasts?


489
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,260
No news at the moment.


490
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,450
My lord, what about Ying Xing Ran?


491
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,590
You'd better called him Master Ying.


492
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,760
Qin Lie is in grave danger.


493
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,470
The position of sect master still
belongs to Ying Xing Ran.


494
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,840
Even the three elders


495
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,450
are trying to boost various disciples'
morale to fight the enemy.


496
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,130
Even the chief of the
Profound Heaven Alliance


497
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
and the Master of the
Eight Extremes Temple


498
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,460
have to bow down before him now.


499
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,770
He's now high and mighty.


500
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,010
It's too early for him to get excited.


501
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,650
Qin Lie may be a menace,


502
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,460
but he is an anomaly.


503
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,390
He has escaped death many times.


504
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,710
This time,


505
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,610
I really hope he dies.


506
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,230
But my intuition tells me


507
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,080
that he'll be back.


508
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,980
The fact that you have such an intuition


509
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,910
means that deep down inside,


510
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,670
you still hope he can survive.


511
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,930
Your fate are tied together,


512
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,780
it's inseparable now.


513
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,960
Lord Lang Xie, Shao Yang.


514
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,170
Here comes the upstart of the
Profound Heaven Alliance.


515
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,440
Why are you being so hostile to me?


516
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,210
I'm just an errand boy.


517
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,140
Is Lian Rou in there?


518
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,370
No.


519
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,730
Lian Rou.
