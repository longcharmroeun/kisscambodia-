[Episode 20]


4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,510
Elder,


5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,360
on behalf of Chief Song and Saintess Xie,
Yi Yuan would like to ask


6
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,150
if you need anything.


7
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,670
Nothing.


8
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,210
Ask Yi Yuan


9
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,200
to send my message to Xie Yi.


10
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,240
How was it?


11
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,760
Elder said there's nothing that he needs,


12
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,900
he just wants you
to send his message to Xie Yi,


13
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
tell him to take good care of himself.


14
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,320
I don't think it's a good time to do this.


15
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,610
How is this not a good time?


16
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,420
Should I do it for you?


17
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,890
Xie Yi killed Commander Feng.


18
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,090
It's just a matter of time


19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,030
before the Bloody Spears and Elder Mo Hai
make him pay the price.


20
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,300
Alright,


21
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,600
send my message to him as well,


22
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,430
tell Saint Xie


23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,950
to take good care of himself.


24
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,750
Alright,


25
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,800
you should take care of yourself too.


26
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,840
I should leave now.


27
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,770
What are you thinking about?


28
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,030
Some got themselves into trouble,


29
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,360
some are preparing
to fight against Dark Nether Race,


30
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,040
whereas I can only stand guard here.


31
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,450
It's kind of boring.


32
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,650
Really?


33
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,260
You've been staying up
for two days and two nights.


34
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,260
Go back earlier and rest.


35
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,790
Yi Yuan.


36
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,260
I need a favour, but,


37
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,800
keep this between you and me.


38
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,079
Sure.


39
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,800
What is it? Fill me in.


40
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,170
Senior Tang Si Qi
sneaked out early this morning.


41
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,060
She said she wants to rescue
Artefact Forging Sect from the outside.


42
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,670
Senior Si Qi?


43
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,770
Now I know why I haven't seen her lately.


44
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,940
If you can,


45
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,620
try to look into it
in Profound Heaven Alliance


46
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,680
and Eight Extremes Temple.


47
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,030
See if there is any news about her.


48
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,990
However,


49
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,360
you must keep a low profile.


50
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,510
Shao Yang,


51
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,320
do you like her?


52
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,420
Don't ask so many questions.


53
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,470
Alright, I'll look right into it.


54
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,870
I am Ku Luo.


55
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,230
[Ku Luo, Ku Lu]


56
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,560
I am Ku Lu. Who is up there?


57
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,840
Both Mortal Realm and Netherworld


58
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,700
are separated by Earth.


59
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,270
But you've been stirring up a storm.


60
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,340
Aren't you afraid
that you might provoke us,


61
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,580
and we then invade the Netherworld
and exterminate your race?


62
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,520
On what grounds?


63
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,140
On what grounds the humans


64
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,120
get to live on the land
where the sun shines


65
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,190
and the plants grow,


66
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,220
whereas the Horned Demon Race


67
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,910
has to live
in the dark and humid underground


68
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,240
without the sun?


69
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,320
We don't have clean water,


70
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,860
delicious food,


71
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,870
bright and warm sun.


72
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,180
And all these


73
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,470
were supposed to belong to us!


74
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,690
You drove us away!


75
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,409
You killed our people!


76
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,640
Don't try to argue your way out of it.


77
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,190
You still have time to retreat.


78
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,909
However, if you still insist on fighting,


79
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,930
don't blame us
for exterminating the Nether Tribe.


80
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,490
Fight!


81
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,940
-Charge!
-Charge!


82
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,700
Fighters, listen up!


83
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,750
Yes!


84
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
The Dark Nether Race


85
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,790
must be killed without mercy!


86
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,270
Kill without mercy!


87
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,210
This seems to be the enemy's camp,


88
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,490
but why aren't the Dark Nether Race
guarding it?


89
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,480
The passageway has been opened.


90
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,810
It's a great opportunity for us
to seize upper hand.


91
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,500
The army should have been summoned
for the war.


92
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,380
Let's get out of here.


93
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,520
Hold on.


94
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,510
Your injury seems severe.


95
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,980
I'm fine.


96
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,210
Even if I was unhurt,


97
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,740
we'll die if we're stuck here.


98
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,050
Let's go.


99
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,390
Look, what do you think about this?


100
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,870
Isn't this even more obvious?


101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,010
No.


102
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,740
In this kind of harsh environment,


103
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,370
being seriously ill or dying
is a norm to us.


104
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,020
Some people are so ill
that their bodies are festering.


105
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,280
They can only cover themselves up
like this


106
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,780
as not to frighten the children.


107
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,920
Although the nether passageway
has been sealed,


108
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,390
Sky Ladder goes straight to the ground,


109
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,280
that place must be guarded
by strong human beings.


110
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,020
If they see you,
they might actually lift the blockade


111
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,049
and let you go.


112
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,950
You have to follow me closely later.


113
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,230
If anyone asks, don't panic.


114
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,200
I'll take care of it.


115
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,620
Zhao Xi,


116
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,030
if I can make it back alive,


117
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,460
I might actually fight against
your people.


118
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,240
Won't you regret saving me?


119
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,350
As a matter of fact,


120
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,850
I should've killed you


121
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,620
or handed you over
and taken credit for it,


122
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,450
but I couldn't do it.


123
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,720
Ms Yu Shi,


124
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,650
in fact,


125
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,300
the Dark Nether Race that you talked about


126
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,370
is not as evil as you think.


127
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,580
Both parties just happen
to have different goals


128
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,140
and opposite standpoints.


129
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,350
Zhao Xi,


130
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,130
after I go back,


131
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,030
if I meet any Dark Nether Race
who has never harmed human beings,


132
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,400
I will definitely spare his life.


133
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,180
Is she sick?


134
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,520
My sister has abscesses on her face,


135
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,730
so she covers her face up.


136
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,750
Why aren't you resting at home
if you're sick?


137
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,070
Brother, she's terribly ill.


138
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,490
I still have a glass of water unclaimed.


139
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,810
Go get it and give it to her.


140
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,350
Thank you, brother.


141
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,140
I had always been curious


142
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,690
about the life you're living


143
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,020
in the Netherworld.


144
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,730
Us?


145
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,270
We eat human flesh.


146
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,830
It's terrifying.


147
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,330
I scared you, didn't I?


148
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,360
Actually,


149
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,370
although we're of different races,


150
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,190
we share the same nature.


151
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,480
There's not a race
which is absolutely good,


152
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,110
there's not a race
which is absolutely evil.


153
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,870
Ms Yu Shi, are you sure you're fine?


154
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,850
I'm fine.


155
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,650
It's just that


156
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,090
I've breathed in so much demon aura,


157
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,080
but I don't feel uncomfortable at all.


158
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,490
Could you also
be a part of the Dark Nether Race?


159
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,140
That's impossible.


160
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,300
I don't have
the shadow pattern of Shadow Tribe,


161
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,300
nor do I have
the long horns of Horned Demon Race.


162
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,100
Our priestess said,


163
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,110
before we came to the Netherworld,


164
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
we didn't look like this.


165
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,250
The men were handsome and dashing,


166
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,750
the women were elegant and beautiful.


167
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,390
We were the most elegant race
in the entire Star Realm.


168
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,030
Star Realm?


169
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,350
I only know that Chilan Continent


170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,460
and several other continents


171
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,720
are called Spirit Realm as a whole.


172
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,610
What is the Star Realm?


173
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,790
The priestess only told us


174
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,570
that we were brought here
by a powerful venerable


175
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,690
to escape the war.


176
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,950
As for what the Star Realm is,


177
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,690
she didn't say anything.


178
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,560
I think she actually made that up


179
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,740
to comfort us.


180
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,930
There might actually
be a secret behind this.


181
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,960
It's just that the time hasn't come,


182
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,820
so the priestess can't tell you anything.


183
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,960
In fact, I feel like


184
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,090
a secret that I don't know
is lying within me.


185
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,780
But I have a feeling


186
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,390
that this secret will be revealed
in no time.


187
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,500
Your secret


188
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,620
might change everything that you have,


189
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,230
including the man whom you care about.


190
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,760
Are you scared?


191
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,680
I will take it and face it.


192
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,820
There's nothing to be scared of.


193
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,140
Yi Yuan.


194
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,490
How did it go?


195
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,500
I've looked into it.


196
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,050
I didn't find any news about her.


197
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,500
Where on earth is she?


198
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,160
These few days,


199
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,140
I turned the entire Armoury City
upside down


200
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,270
but couldn't find her.


201
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,670
Could she be dead already?


202
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,120
What are you guys talking about,


203
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,470
sneaking around out here?


204
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,210
Lord Lang Xie.


205
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,880
Yi Yuan and I were discussing


206
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,080
about the reason
of Dark Nether Race's sudden retreat.


207
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,120
Exactly.


208
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,000
Yesterday, the mysterious man
came out of nowhere.


209
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,790
The Dark Nether Race kneeled before him
as if he was Evil God.


210
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,710
After that, he went to the Netherworld
with the commander of Dark Nether Race,


211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
and they've been biding their time
since then.


212
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,540
They've been on a stand-off with us
for a day and a night.


213
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,620
They seem to be waiting
for some instructions.


214
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,510
I'm afraid they're deliberately
dragging it on.


215
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,020
The greater the invasion of demon aura,


216
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,340
the greater the loss of our combat power.


217
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,910
We only have limited Demon Purifying Grass
after all.


218
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,790
Yi Yuan,


219
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,970
go and ask Mo Hai


220
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,760
how long
can the remaining Demon Purifying Grass


221
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,180
last us.


222
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,760
Besides that,


223
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,830
ask him about his progress
on the Terminator Profound Bomb.


224
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,700
Affirmative.


225
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,130
Go back and get some sleep now.


226
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,060
If you're still looking tired like this,


227
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,110
I'll throw you into the Netherworld too.


228
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,900
Affirmative.


229
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,360
[Where on earth]


230
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,890
[is this woman hiding?]


231
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,940
Shao Yang!


232
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,150
You have to take your own path.


233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,590
If you do not want my help


234
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,170
or let me follow you,


235
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,030
I will not go against your will.


236
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,090
But if you miss me,


237
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,900
remember,


238
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,550
I'll be waiting for you
in the pavilion by the lake.


239
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,930
Lake?


240
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,380
Si Qi!


241
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,450
Si Qi!


242
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,390
Si Qi.


243
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,870
I'm such an idiot.


244
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,970
[Evil God Mountains]


245
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,450
So this is the Evil God Mountains.


246
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,280
If we want to get
to the Sky Ladder of Purple Mist Sea,


247
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,680
Mountains of Evil God
is the only way there.


248
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,890
Along the road,


249
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,520
there will be more and more
Horned Demons.


250
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,940
[Du Du, Priestess]


251
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,360
This is weird.


252
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,810
These people seem to have come here
to worship something.


253
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,420
What are you thinking about?


254
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,100
Do you still have Gao Yu's
Evil God Ring with you?


255
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,990
My gut tells me they're related somehow.


256
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,330
I'm afraid Artefact Forging Sect
has already fallen.


257
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,050
I wonder how Gao Yu is doing now.


258
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,020
When I fell into the nether passageway,


259
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,610
the ring flew away out of the blue.


260
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,290
I have no idea where it went either.


261
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,860
Only on important days


262
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,960
do we come here,


263
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,500
kowtow and pray for the protection
of the Great God.


264
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,250
But this is weird.


265
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,220
Why is there a worshipping ceremony today?


266
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,010
The holy light shines upon
the heart of the brave.


267
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,560
So many lives have been sacrificed.


268
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,990
It's tearing our hearts out.


269
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,680
The glory of our Great God is still here!


270
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,150
Bless the bamboo tent,
for it shall never fall.


271
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,120
Bless the mountains,
for they shall never collapse.


272
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,170
Bless the Nether River,
for it shall flow eternally.


273
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,860
Bless our holy race,
for it will live forever!


274
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,760
Today,


275
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,590
the Great God Ring which belongs


276
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,610
to the last Great God of our race,
Luo Lin, The Great God,


277
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,980
has finally found its host.


278
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
The Great Ring has returned,


279
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,690
the child of Luo Lin, The Great God
has finally been born.


280
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,910
Today,


281
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,550
as soon as the child
of Luo Lin, The Great God


282
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,970
steps onto the altar of Great God,


283
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,380
absorbs and refines all the gifts


284
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,820
of Luo Lin, The Great God,


285
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,170
once again,
our race will have a Great God!


286
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,770
Great God, Great God!


287
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,630
Let's get out of here.


288
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,630
[Qin Lie?]


289
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,020
What's the matter?


290
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,410
What's wrong, Qin Lie?


291
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,900
Qin Lie!


292
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,710
What exactly are you?


293
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,420
Why did you take me here?


294
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,190
Mr Xue Li?


295
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,840
Have you been following me?


296
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,020
Yes, I was protecting you.


297
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,950
Since you fell into the Netherworld,


298
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,500
this little thing came out of nowhere


299
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,360
and entered your body.


300
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,040
You knew that this thing
entered my body long time ago,


301
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,590
but you didn't tell me.


302
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,970
Why should I tell you?


303
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,710
It's not doing you any harm.


304
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,230
Mr Xue Li, this is my body.


305
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,050
Don't worry.


306
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,880
This little thing
is covered in thunder and lightning.


307
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,460
It has the same nature as yours.


308
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,780
It is not harmful but useful to you.


309
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,070
Can't you see?


310
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,880
It brought you here, that's the proof.


311
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,640
This is the thunder pool.


312
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,460
There lies the real core of thunderbolt.


313
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,760
I can feel


314
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,000
that you've perceived
the essence of frost.


315
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,870
The core of thunderbolt
is the essence of thunderbolt.


316
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,680
If you can absorb and grasp it,
you will benefit a lot from it.


317
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,720
The essence of frost


318
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,780
caused my cultivation base
to improve by leaps and bounds.


319
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,230
Now that condensation of Yuan Lake
is approaching,


320
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,950
if I can refine the core of thunderbolt...


321
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Song Ting Yu.


322
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,610
Ling Yu Shi?


323
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
How is Qin Lie doing?


324
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,700
I have no idea either.


325
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,510
Clear your mind from distractions!


326
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,790
Absorb it with all your might.
Enter into no-soul or no-self doctrine!


327
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,740
I will guard you!


328
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,850
Run!


329
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,300
Let's go! Run! Run!


330
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,570
Qin Lie, if you give up right now,


331
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,180
not only will your efforts
go down the drain,


332
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,930
you will also lose your mind!


333
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,110
Listen to me!


334
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,420
Just focus and refine


335
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,410
the essence of thunderbolt
that you've absorbed.


336
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,190
Leave the rest to me!


337
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,730
Isn't the Great God supposed
to protect the people?


338
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,190
Qin Lie? He...


339
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,390
Gao Yu?


340
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,500
Mr Xue Li,


341
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,730
is he dead?


342
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,550
I'm not capable of taking his life yet.


343
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,300
Qin Lie!


344
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,620
Yu Shi!


345
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,890
Get out of here first.


346
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,450
Step back!


347
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,320
Do you know Qin Shan?


348
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,170
Qin Shan is my grandfather.


349
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,810
Do you have any proof?


350
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,100
He is my grandfather.


351
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,540
What is there to prove?


352
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,560
Do you know my grandfather?


353
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,220
Did he leave anything for you?


354
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,940
No.


355
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,010
To be exact,


356
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,480
there's an orb inside my head.
Does that count?


357
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,110
The Soul Suppressing Orb?


358
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,300
That's right.


359
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,290
It's Qin Shan, our benefactor's belonging.


360
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,590
It belongs to him?


361
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,780
It was my grandfather


362
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,550
who implanted the Soul Suppressing Orb
inside my head?


363
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,770
My grandfather is a human.


364
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,750
How could he be the benefactor
of the Dark Nether Race?


365
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,870
He had shown us great kindness.


366
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,600
I'll let you off


367
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,860
to repay his kindness.


368
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,400
What did Grandpa Qin Shan do for you?


369
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,700
I guess


370
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,590
you really don't have any idea.


371
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,410
Since he didn't tell you,


372
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,470
I'm in no position to say anything


373
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,610
in case any issue arises.


374
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,920
The horn will be blown three times.


375
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,550
If you're still here by that time,


376
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,470
I will take your lives!


377
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,630
Madam!


378
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,600
Madam, tell me!


379
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,620
Let's go!


380
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,490
-Madam!
-Run!


381
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,160
-Madam, tell me!
-Run!


382
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,190
Madam!


383
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,530
Yu Shi.


384
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,410
Who are you?


385
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,730
Qin Lie, stop it.


386
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,250
He is Zhao Xi.


387
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,180
He saved my life.


388
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,440
Zhao Xi, what are you doing here?


389
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,840
You left abruptly just now.


390
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,450
I was afraid that you might be in danger,


391
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,850
so I had been tailing you.


392
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,760
Just now, I was hiding somewhere else.


393
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,840
But a gust of strong wind took me up


394
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,210
and brought me here.


395
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,040
This place is far
from the Great God Mountains.


396
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,810
How did we get here in a flash?


397
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,260
It was chaotic at the time,


398
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,200
but the priestess


399
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,240
could tell right away


400
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,360
that she was on our side.


401
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,370
This means she already knew


402
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,410
that we aren't a part of Dark Nether Race.


403
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,270
She has impressive power,


404
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,640
and is definitely a great threat
to the human race.


405
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,000
The priestess


406
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,150
has never killed, she only saves lives.


407
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,250
Don't you...


408
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,470
Ms Yu Shi, thank you.


409
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,420
To you, I'm the Dark Nether Race,


410
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,660
but you...


411
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,920
You also saved me before.


412
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,480
To you,


413
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm also from another race.


414
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,560
Zhao Xi,


415
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,490
we're leaving.


416
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,880
Remember me, I'm Zhao Xi.


417
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,690
This magic plant
is a Netherworld Demonic Fruit.


418
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,390
It has never seen the sun, just like me.


419
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,480
After you return to the ground,


420
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,470
can you place it under the sun


421
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,820
and call out my name?


422
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,340
In that way,


423
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,070
I might be able to feel the warmth
of the sun.


424
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,570
If there's a chance,
I'll take you guys to Herb Mountain.


425
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,640
It has ample sunlight.


426
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,580
It's best place
for the magic plants to grow.


427
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,620
I've never seen the sun since I was born,


428
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,030
but if I get to be with the sun
after I die,


429
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,970
I'll be more than happy.


430
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,210
Zhao Xi!


431
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,020
Song Ting Yu, what are you doing?


432
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,900
He was trying to kill me,
didn't you see that?


433
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,380
Zhao Xi,


434
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,450
why did you do that?


435
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,130
When I heard


436
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,950
that you called her Song Ting Yu,


437
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,620
I knew


438
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,700
that she's Saintess Song
from the Profound Heaven Alliance.


439
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,020
Our people died at her hands.


440
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,020
She even killed my father.


441
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,570
Zhao Xi.


442
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,790
Ms Yu Shi,


443
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,730
thank you for remembering


444
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,850
my name.


445
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,659
Zhao Xi.


446
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,929
Obviously,
you were already prepared to attack.


447
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,870
Did you know that he wanted to kill you?


448
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,699
I could see the murderous intent
in his eyes,


449
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,480
but Ling Yu Shi wasn't his target.


450
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,690
If he wanted to kill Ling Yu Shi,
he would've done it long time ago.


451
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,320
That means
his target was either you or me.


452
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,739
I had to do it.


453
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,850
Zhao Xi.


454
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,320
Yu Shi, I'm sorry.


455
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,850
Song Ting Yu,


456
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,350
how did your injury become so serious?


457
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,220
A hundred years ago,


458
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,160
when I entered the nether passageway
for the first time,


459
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,780
it was Uncle Liang who carried me.


460
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,550
When I got up the Sky Ladder
for the first time,


461
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,140
I climbed up by myself.


462
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,730
I was nine years old,
training my strength.


463
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,790
I had climbed for three full months


464
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,980
before I could finally see the sun.


465
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,320
I used to think
that the Sky Ladder was unachievable.


466
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,440
But after going through numerous wars,


467
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,840
I learned that it was not hard at all.


468
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,900
Climbing up Sky Ladder is hard,


469
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,140
but it's nothing compared to guarding it.


470
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,810
Now,


471
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,140
I'm afraid I won't get
to see the sun any more.


472
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,700
We've come this far,


473
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,440
and you're telling me
that you can't make it.


474
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,150
Then why did you drag us into this?


475
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,910
Song Ting Yu, you must get up there.


476
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,700
Don't make me look down on you.


477
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,590
Ling Yu Shi,


478
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,930
I wish to talk to Qin Lie alone.


479
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,220
Can I?


480
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,610
What do you want to say?


481
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,180
Why did you never ask me


482
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,680
the reason why I've been helping you


483
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,100
and protecting you?


484
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,170
Why?


485
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,490
Because I always have someone in my heart.


486
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,720
I know.


487
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,290
It's Gong Mu Lie.


488
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,880
The Tale of Gong Mu Lie


489
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,860
was destroyed by my father.


490
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,410
But,


491
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,870
I know,


492
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,860
Gong Mu Lie has always been my side,


493
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,830
protecting me,


494
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,770
because you are him.


495
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,530
Song Ting Yu,


496
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,850
wake up,


497
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,320
I'm Qin Lie.


498
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,160
I'm wide awake.


499
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,710
The moment the Luminous Pillar
of Xingyun Pavilion was activated,


500
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,560
Icestone City
was supposed to be destroyed.


501
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,230
But nothing happened.


502
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,880
I didn't kill you to cover it up either.


503
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,310
Do you remember that?


504
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,700
I do.


505
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,460
It was Gong Mu Lie who stopped everything.


506
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,880
I saw him.


507
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,120
I really saw him.


508
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,480
Back then,


509
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,310
only you and Du Shao Yang were there.


510
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,570
I am certain
that you are actually Gong Mu Lie.


511
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,570
Gong Mu Lie?


512
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,340
You're mistaken.


513
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,790
Starting from that day,


514
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,560
I've been trying to look for


515
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,630
traces of Gong Mu Lie in you.


516
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,150
But as time goes on,


517
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,540
I can't even tell


518
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,930
who that person in my heart is.


519
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,390
I used to carry Gong Mu Lie's book
around with me.


520
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,170
That'd make me feel safe.


521
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,490
I knew he'd protect me


522
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,880
and stay by my side forever.


523
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,460
After being with you,


524
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,820
I started to develop the same feelings.


525
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,900
After we got here,


526
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,800
I know


527
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,480
that although you're here with me,


528
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,880
all you think about is Ling Yu Shi.


529
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,120
Qin Lie,


530
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,980
I can't hold it any longer.


531
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,110
I'm destined to die here.


532
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,460
Before I die,


533
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,750
could I take you as Gong Mu Lie?
