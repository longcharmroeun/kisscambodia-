[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,039
[Episode 10]


4
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,150
Pu Jiao is a petty man.


5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,340
When he learned that Young Master and I


6
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,600
helped Saintess hunt down
the Soul Reaping Beast,


7
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,280
he got jealous


8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,340
and tried to drive a wedge
between Young Master and me.


9
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,170
Both of us secretly set a trap,


10
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,640
with the intention of catching Pu Jiao.


11
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,330
Little did we know,
we still fell into his trap.


12
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,000
Po Jiao is sly.


13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,220
He instigated
a fight between Qin Lie and me.


14
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,370
Somehow,


15
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,150
the energy of the Luminous Pillar
was triggered,


16
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,130
and the entire Icestone City
was almost destroyed.


17
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,120
Luckily, Saintess Song
got there in the nick of time,


18
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,940
otherwise Icestone City
would've been ruined.


19
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,610
And this is the chronology


20
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,020
of the whole incident.


21
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,560
I didn't know


22
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,710
that Pu Jiao could be so sly.


23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,570
Luckily, Saintess Song
came to the rescue in time,


24
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,850
otherwise,


25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,520
the aftermath would be horrible.


26
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,500
I've executed Pu Jiao.


27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,670
After all, it was me who sent him here.


28
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,480
I also have to bear the responsibility


29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,850
for Mistress' misfortune.


30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,210
No, no.


31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,850
You have avenged Mistress.


32
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,970
Thank you for your grace,
Saintess of Profound Heaven Alliance.


33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,370
Please rise.


34
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,250
Do you have any other questions?


35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,160
Since the truth has come to light,


36
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,680
we don't have any questions now.


37
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,160
The Horned Demon Race has invaded,


38
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,520
I'll set out to Purple Mist Sea
at first light tomorrow.


39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,340
Qin Lie, Du Shao Yang,


40
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,210
come with me first.


41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,940
Master Du, after the funeral
is taken care of,


42
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,570
deploy immediately.


43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,700
Li Zhong Zheng and Lu Li,


44
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,440
go back and inform your master


45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,200
to standby.


46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,710
Yes.


47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,880
That must be tough for you


48
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,620
to cover up such a big lie
for Song Ting Yu.


49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,560
But the Horned Demon Race
has invaded.


50
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,180
For the greater good,


51
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,900
this is the only thing we can do.


52
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,140
General situation is one of the reasons.


53
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,420
Another reason


54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,190
is to meet Master Mo Hai
from Artefact Forging Sect.


55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,540
At the end of the day,


56
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,430
Du Shao Yang and I are just the same.


57
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,360
We're selfish.


58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,210
When facing someone with such strength,


59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,190
we have no other choice


60
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,040
but to obey her.


61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,250
Besides, we also wanted


62
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
to negotiate with her using your
credit for killing the Soul Reaping Beast


63
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,320
in exchange for an opportunity
to get into Artefact Forging Sect.


64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
Although the plan has changed,


65
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,760
we still achieved our motive.


66
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,690
We earned this opportunity


67
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,870
from Uncle Hua's death.


68
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,000
Now,


69
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,830
I'm not on par with Song Ting Yu yet,


70
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,200
but I will definitely claim justice


71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,140
for Uncle Hua.


72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,560
You'll depart to Purple Mist Sea tomorrow.


73
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,519
It's even closer


74
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,079
to the centre of Chilan Continent.


75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,220
I wonder how the sky


76
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,870
looks over there.


77
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,030
I'll tell you after I come back.


78
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,070
Don't come back


79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,100
and don't stop.


80
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,780
Follow your own footsteps


81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,580
and go even higher


82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,080
and further.


83
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,580
Yu Shi,


84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,909
if I can go to a higher and further point,


85
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,640
and look at the sky full of stars,


86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,060
I'll come back and take you there with me.


87
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,510
I promise.


88
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280
I will definitely take you
around the world,


89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,860
watch all the moon and stars.


90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,840
I will take you


91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,450
to see all the sceneries of the world.
I...


92
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,750
I'll wait for you.


93
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,730
Tomorrow, I'm going to Qisha Valley


94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,080
with Brother Li.


95
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
I heard


96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,990
that it is scenic too.


97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,900
I also promise


98
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,790
that if there's a chance in the future,


99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,990
I'll definitely take you
to visit Qisha Valley.


100
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,400
Sure.


101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,710
By the way,


102
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,470
regarding Li Zhong Zheng,


103
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,830
watch out for him.


104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,250
I have a feeling that he's up to no good.


105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,820
Lu Li will look out for him,


106
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm not worried.


107
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,060
You've always been slow to catch on.


108
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,800
How did you find out?


109
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,020
Li Zhong Zheng is obviously a bad guy,


110
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,000
it's not hard to tell.


111
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,540
I meant Lu Li.


112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,860
What's wrong with Lu Li?


113
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,860
I'm going to visit Gao Yu.


114
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,590
I'll go with you.


115
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,050
Recently,


116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
I always feel
that something is wrong with Gao Yu.


117
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,920
He was brought up by his sister,


118
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,210
now that misfortune fell upon her,


119
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,930
he's definitely devastated.


120
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,340
Go take a rest first,


121
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,960
I'll go by myself.


122
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,730
Gao Yu.


123
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,720
I want to be alone.


124
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,550
Is what you told Qin Lie true?


125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
I know I won't be able
to hide it from you,


126
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,770
but please stop asking, father.


127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,030
I'm not supposed to tell.


128
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,720
First of all, it is Saintess Song's order.


129
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,140
Second of all, if you know too much,


130
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm afraid
you'll be dragged into the mess.


131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
But rest assured, Father.


132
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,340
I will definitely


133
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,970
avenge Stepmother.


134
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,380
Regarding the revenge,


135
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,940
you can put it aside for now.


136
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,300
We should keep our priorities straight.


137
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,510
You going to Purple Mist Sea
with Saintess Song,


138
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,620
that's the priority.


139
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,440
I will definitely seize this opportunity.


140
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,170
What's the matter?


141
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,840
Tell me.


142
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Back then,


143
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,830
did you really think


144
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,650
that I got drunk
because I was feeling dejected?


145
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,510
If you want me to believe it,


146
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,270
then I will.


147
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,039
I will play along with you two


148
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,240
and see what you're going to do.


149
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,960
Us two?


150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,870
I've long noticed


151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,210
you and Qin Lie
exchanging glances.


152
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,860
I really can't hide anything from you.


153
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,230
Since someone's trying to act smart,


154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,610
then I'll act a fool.


155
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,210
I've never taken you for a fool.


156
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,580
I'm talking about Pu Jiao.


157
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
The trip to Purple Mist Sea


158
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,890
will be rough.


159
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,910
Apart from Saintess Song,


160
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,290
you should be even more alert to Qin Lie.


161
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,910
Don't take him as a friend.


162
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,940
Because Qin Lie


163
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,670
will never be your friend.


164
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,470
Yes, father.


165
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,640
Qin Lie!


166
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,050
[Xingyun Pavilion]


167
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,860
Do you believe in what happened before?


168
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,130
No.


169
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,450
Do you believe it?


170
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,120
I will never believe it.


171
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,190
Under the Luminous Pillar,


172
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,310
Song Ting Yu obviously


173
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,050
wanted to kill us there.


174
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,130
But I can't figure out


175
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,740
as to why she suddenly changed her mind.


176
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,720
And now she wants me to believe her,


177
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,170
that is impossible.


178
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,470
As for Uncle Hua and your
stepmother's death,


179
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,840
she is definitely involved.


180
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,180
Then do you believe in the Nether War?


181
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,380
It's a great deal,


182
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,270
she certainly won't lie about it.


183
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,380
Before we set out,


184
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,020
there's something that I have to ask you.


185
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,230
Before this, we were enemies,
and then allies.


186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,990
At the end, I betrayed you.


187
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,960
Now we'll fight side by side. We...


188
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,700
I have a sense of priority.


189
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,290
For the well-being of Chilan Continent


190
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,580
and meeting Master Mo Hai,


191
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,870
I can put our personal issues
behind for now.


192
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,660
I can even work with you.


193
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,920
Okay.


194
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,910
Now you can keep all our issues


195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,430
in your mind first.


196
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,730
Of course I will.


197
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,180
If I don't,


198
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,700
you will do it too.


199
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,770
You're right.


200
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,090
One day,


201
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,290
we will eventually put an end
to all our issues.


202
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,420
Uncle Li.


203
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,580
Let's talk tomorrow. It is closed now.


204
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,460
Aren't the doors


205
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,260
still open?


206
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,310
I like to leave the door open
even when the business is closed, alright?


207
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,440
Uncle Li,
I've come to bid farewell to you.


208
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,070
The Nether War has started.


209
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm going to Purple Mist Sea Battlefield.


210
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,220
To be a cannon fodder?


211
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,900
Are you saying
that you purposely came to bid farewell


212
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,840
because you're going off to die?


213
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,470
Do we know each other so well?


214
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,140
I appreciate your reminder before this,


215
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,960
so I came here to thank you.


216
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,370
I'm leaving.


217
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,310
Goodbye.


218
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,460
Hold on.


219
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,100
Take this with you.
It might come in handy.


220
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,840
Go home and practice.


221
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,940
What is it for?


222
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,460
[Two pieces of mud crystals]


223
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,390
Forging artefact.


224
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,240
Forging artefact?


225
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,950
Two pieces of mud crystal,


226
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,150
four catties of golden sand,


227
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,210
one piece of black marble


228
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,750
and five catties of black iron.


229
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,470
What are these?


230
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,510
The list of materials for making
Terminator Profound Bombs.


231
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,630
Terminator Profound Bomb?


232
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,210
What is that?


233
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,160
Something explosive.


234
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,530
It packs quite a punch.


235
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,680
It's all there in the recipe.


236
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,350
Go back and study it.


237
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,070
If you manage to create it,


238
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,580
you can blow up whoever you want.


239
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,820
But do keep this in mind,


240
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,400
you must be careful.


241
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,080
Don't blow yourself up.


242
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,460
Thank you, Uncle Li.


243
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,470
Go ahead.


244
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,550
Thank you.


245
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
Then I shall leave now.


246
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,230
Go on.


247
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,570
Terminator Profound Bomb.


248
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,610
Terminator Profound Bomb.


249
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,140
Father,


250
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,590
Yu Shi sent us a letter.


251
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,620
Open and read it now.


252
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,520
Father,


253
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,370
a letter from Purple Mist Sea.


254
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,390
Mayhem in the battlefield.


255
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,590
[Xingyun Pavilion
was ordered to join the war.]


256
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,350
[Qin Lie is also involved in it.]


257
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,240
[The cause of Uncle Hua's death
has come to light.]


258
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,130
[It wasn't Du Shao Yang who did it,]


259
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,910
[but please forgive me for not being able
to tell you the truth.]


260
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,590
[Recently, my fire poison has flared up,]


261
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,450
[Li Zhong Zheng is planning
to take me back to Qisha Valley]


262
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,860
[to get rid of fire poison.]


263
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,630
[Apart from that,
Zhong Zheng also sent a message,]


264
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,580
[Xuan Xuan has to return
to Qisha Valley at once,]


265
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,350
[must not disobey the order.]


266
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,370
No, no.


267
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,190
She can't tell the truth?


268
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,840
Yu Shi knows what to do.


269
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,050
There must be a story behind this.


270
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,250
Have faith in Yu Shi and Qin Lie.


271
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,400
Qin Lie is going to aid the
Profound Heaven Alliance in battle.


272
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,490
Yu Shi has also become
the disciple of Qisha Valley.


273
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,390
These are good news. Good news.


274
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,430
These are good news indeed, Xuan Xuan.


275
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,230
Since your master
is asking you to go back,


276
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,860
then you should depart without delay.


277
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,600
Father, I am sorry.


278
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,530
I wanted to wait until Yu Shi comes back


279
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,960
before I leave.


280
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,480
I didn't expect that...


281
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,130
Loose ends must be tied up.


282
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,840
The truth must be known.


283
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,530
Only then will you be at peace.


284
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,040
Otherwise, what's the point of living?


285
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,280
I understand.


286
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,680
Being a disciple of Qisha Valley


287
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,240
was supposed to bring glory
to the Ling family.


288
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,110
But now I'm going against
my master's order


289
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
and leave Qisha Valley without permission.


290
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,820
I...


291
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,600
I'll say the same thing.


292
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,080
Whatever means the most to you,


293
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,630
then you should go after it.


294
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,670
Xuan Xuan,


295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,910
don't worry.
I will take good care of Master.


296
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,410
But, promise me,


297
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,750
give yourself a time limit.


298
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,640
When the time has come,
whether you find him or not,


299
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,030
you have to come back.


300
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,680
Xuan Xuan,


301
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,180
sorry,


302
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,940
I can't go there with you.


303
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,720
Winter is coming.


304
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,360
We have to reconstruct the houses


305
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,830
which were destroyed
by the Soul Reaping Beast.


306
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,950
Thank you.


307
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,370
Thank you.


308
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,360
If Qin Lie can come back alive,


309
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,610
Yu Xin can do it too.


310
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,520
Yu Xin said he won't leave me


311
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,080
his entire life.


312
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,320
I didn't ask him to die.


313
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,830
How can he die?


314
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,460
He's definitely hiding
because he's afraid


315
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,980
that I'll scold him and beat him.


316
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,400
I have to find him.


317
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,130
The ice field is freezing.


318
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,650
As an outlander,
he must be suffering a lot.


319
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,780
I'm afraid
I won't have the heart to leave,


320
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,800
so I can't look straight into your eyes.


321
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,920
No matter where and when,
I will keep you in my heart,


322
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,330
and take care of my own safety.


323
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,840
I'm leaving.


324
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,170
Thirty li south is Purple Mist City.


325
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,170
[Purple Mist City]


326
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,020
To the southeast of Purple Mist City


327
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,730
is the boundless sea.


328
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,230
[Purple Mist Sea]


329
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
The sea surface is surrounded


330
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,450
by purple mist all year round


331
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,970
due to the transpiration
of purple seaweed,


332
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,170
hence the name, Purple Mist Sea.


333
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
In the western mountains
of Purple Mist City


334
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,900
lies the only nether passageway


335
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,990
in the Chilan Continent.


336
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,250
If you want to pass this passage,


337
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,090
we need to pass through Purple Mist City.


338
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,440
There are nine gates and thirteen camps,


339
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,240
[Frontline Fortress]


340
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,750
a total of 22 barriers
in Purple Mist City.


341
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,760
The most heroic warriors of the human race
are stationed inside.


342
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,880
The south, north and west sides
of the campsite


343
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,520
are full of towering
and unreachable ridges.


344
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,440
The cliffs and the ground are planted


345
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,800
with Demon Purifying Grass


346
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,329
which can purify demonic energy.


347
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,060
Purple Mist Sea


348
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,609
is an important bastion against
the Nether tribe.


349
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,440
Right now, the warlord


350
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,790
guarding the nine gates and 13
camps of Frontline Fortress


351
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,950
is Xie Zhi Zhang


352
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,820
[Xie Zhi Zhang]


353
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,580
of the Eight Extremes Temple.


354
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,560
Upon death, the Dark Nether Race
turned into shadows,


355
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,540
leaving an indelible mark on the land.


356
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,180
The shadows contain Nether energy


357
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,650
and must be cleansed
with Demon Purifying Grass.


358
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,580
Lord Xie,


359
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,420
Saintess Song is here.


360
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,650
We're cleaning up the battlefield.


361
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,240
This place is a mess.


362
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,920
I suggest you retire back
to Purple Mist City, Saintess.


363
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,130
How many soldiers did they send?


364
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,630
There were 300 of suicide corps.


365
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,520
How many casualties do we have?


366
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,930
Five hundred.


367
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,760
The enemy sent 300 soldiers


368
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,470
and we have 500 casualties.


369
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,200
For the past five years,


370
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,180
it was Saintess Xie who led us
in the Nether War.


371
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,470
But now Saintess Xie
is nowhere to be found.


372
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,070
Despite your lack of experience
in leading battles,


373
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,830
you questioned me as soon
as you arrived.


374
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,070
I'm afraid I can't answer you.


375
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,940
I've fought the Dark Nether Race
since I was nine.


376
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,100
How dare you say that I lack experience?


377
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,640
From what I hear,


378
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,370
you only stood guard


379
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,430
in Frontline Fortress


380
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,890
among a legion of soldiers.


381
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,540
That's not much of an experience.


382
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,820
Xie Zhi Zhang,


383
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,440
are you disdaining Saintess Song
for her young age?


384
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,260
Saintess Xie is young too,


385
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,910
but I've never disdained her.


386
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,310
That's because you're Saintess Xie's
second uncle!


387
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,510
That's because
every time Saintess Xie came here,


388
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,540
she'd ask about
the well-being of the soldiers,


389
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,030
not making accusations!


390
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,030
Saintess Song, please help yourself.


391
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,930
Don't just stand there!


392
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,210
Get to work!


393
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,060
Xie Zhi Zhang is ungrateful.


394
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,820
Shut up.


395
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,410
Ungrateful people


396
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,730
are just what I like.


397
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
You shut up, too.


398
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,760
Uncle Liang, stay here.


399
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,310
Both of you, come with me.


400
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,010
Saintess Song,


401
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,600
where are we going?


402
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,920
Don't you wish to meet Master Mo Hai?


403
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,440
The armoury hall is right ahead.


404
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,120
Master Mo Hai is the top armourer
of the continent.


405
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,790
I heard he has a bad temper.


406
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,920
I heard that he is harsh


407
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,720
and slanderous.


408
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,750
Some people also say that he is weird,


409
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,550
strict and arrogant.


410
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,310
Those are just rumours.


411
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,230
This blade is meant for attacking,
but it's made of magnetic stone.


412
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,130
-Wait.
-Defending while attacking is good.


413
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,260
Unfortunately, you've added water crystals


414
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,590
which counteracted the magnetic stone.


415
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,620
You used common level materials


416
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
and made a machete fit only
for outlanders.


417
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,690
Why bother fixing it?


418
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,770
Just get rid of it.


419
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,720
My blade!


420
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,970
[Lian Rou, Artefact Forging Sect]


421
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,910
Take it.


422
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,290
Thank you, thank you.


423
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,800
[Mo Hai, Artefact Forging Sect]


424
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,840
Little Ting Yu, you're here.


425
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,050
Dismiss.


426
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,340
Greetings, Master Mo Hai.


427
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,890
It's been so many years
since I last saw you.


428
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,230
Master, they are Qin Lie


429
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,500
and Du Shao Yang.


430
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
The young men who helped you
hunt down the Soul Reaping Beast.


431
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,950
I'm deeply grateful


432
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,530
for your help in this battle.


433
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,760
This time, the Nether tribe
made a surprise attack,


434
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,030
we were caught off guard.


435
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,260
Besides, it's your first time
leading a war.


436
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,740
How can I not come?


437
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,900
Must we go there?


438
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,730
She died.


439
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,290
We saw it with our own eyes.


440
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,060
I've fought her since I was young.


441
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,400
I can't be more familiar
with her scent.


442
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,110
She's certainly still alive


443
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,920
and staying around us.


444
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,500
How do you know


445
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,150
that we'll find her if we put to sea?


446
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,100
I'm sure we will.


447
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,170
She'll be waiting for me over there.


448
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,920
[There's no need to hide.
I saw it already.]


449
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,750
[I really don't understand
what's so interesting about it.]


450
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,790
[Of course you don't,
because you don't care.]


451
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,000
[Guess where I went.]


452
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,330
[Purple Mist Sea Battlefield.]


453
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,520
[Really?]


454
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,160
[So be it.]


455
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,790
[Father promised me]


456
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,440
[that I can also go to the battlefield]


457
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,050
[after I turn nine years old.]


458
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,250
[I went there one year earlier than you.]


459
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,090
[I'm only eight years old now.]


460
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,560
[Besides,
Eight Extremes Temple has decided]


461
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,510
[that I'll be the future commander
of the Nether War.]


462
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,830
[Apart from that,]


463
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,630
[I sailed.]


464
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,880
[It's the most beautiful]


465
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,000
[and mysterious Purple Mist Sea.]


466
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,760
[Are you envious?]


467
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,990
[Don't worry. If there's a chance,]


468
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,440
[I'll take you with me.]


469
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,310
[We'll sail to the middle of the
Purple Mist Sea]


470
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,700
[and admire the view there.]


471
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,980
[For real?]


472
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,430
[Yes.]


473
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,640
It's been so long.


474
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
Do you miss me?


475
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,030
Escaped by faking your own death.


476
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,810
What kind of mission


477
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,290
has Eight Extremes Temple assigned to you?


478
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,890
Now I know


479
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,180
why you didn't blow my cover


480
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,960
when you saw me behind Luminous Pillar.


481
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,950
So you have a misunderstanding.


482
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,740
I faked my death


483
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,830
because I don't want
to be a Saintess any more.


484
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,040
I want to fall in love with someone


485
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,670
and keep my nose clean.


486
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,470
What?


487
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,550
As the commander in chief,


488
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,660
you faked your death
for love and personal desire.


489
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,990
Do you still care about the life
of the people on the continent?


490
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,550
How dare you judge me?


491
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,780
Aren't you just the same?


492
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,520
You only think about that man all day


493
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,030
and even carry that thing with you.


494
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,290
Give it back to me!


495
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,620
So, the large figure standing
under the Luminous Pillar


496
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,210
of Xingyun Pavilion that night


497
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,900
really was Gong Mu Lie?


498
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,940
You saw him too.


499
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,090
That night, only Qin Lie and Du Shao Yang


500
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,200
were on the rooftop.


501
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,440
Are you suspecting that one of them


502
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,870
is Gong Mu Lie?


503
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,360
That's impossible.


504
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,730
They're not worthy enough.


505
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,970
Then are you suspecting


506
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,910
that Gong Mu Lie actually showed himself


507
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,010
or projected his consciousness


508
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,500
on one of them?


509
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,000
So you changed your mind,


510
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,350
spared them


511
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,040
and kept them by your side


512
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,520
just to find the answer?


513
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,270
Do you think it is possible?


514
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,170
It's likely to be Qin Lie,


515
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,800
but not Du Shao Yang.


516
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,140
Although Du Shao Yang is handsome


517
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,680
and ambitious,


518
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,450
he always made the wrong decisions.


519
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,710
If I were Gong Mu Lie,


520
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,150
I wouldn't choose
someone with such bad luck.


521
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,790
However, Qin Lie


522
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,030
always does the impossible.


523
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,790
He is more suspicious.


524
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,240
When you said
you want to fall in love with a man,


525
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,220
you meant Du Shao Yang, right?


526
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,330
That's why you told me to count him out.


527
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,940
If you dare lay a hand on him,
I won't let you off.


528
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,040
Won't let me off?


529
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,840
I'll report you to the
Eight Extremes Temple right now.


530
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,530
Let's see if you can run away from it.


531
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,610
One day,
Eight Extremes Temple will find out.


532
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,770
You betrayed Eight Extremes Temple,


533
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,660
let's see what you got yourself into.


534
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,130
I know I can't escape from it.


535
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,080
I also know that that day


536
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,860
will come sooner or later.


537
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,030
But before that day comes,


538
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,360
I want to fall in love.


539
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,620
Whether punishment or death awaits me,


540
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
I will not regret it.


541
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,370
Xie Jing Xuan,


542
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,960
I can keep it a secret for you,


543
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,760
as long as you tell me


544
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,490
if there's any good way
to deal with the Nether War.


545
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,610
Of course there is.


546
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,340
I've led battles in the Netherworld
for many years,


547
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,720
so I have plenty of ideas.


548
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,560
However, I won't tell you.


549
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,760
I will tell Du Shao Yang.


550
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,830
So, if you want to win this war,


551
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,640
be nice to him.


552
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,350
You're childish.


553
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm telling you,


554
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,360
the Purple Mist Sea is my battlefield now.


555
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Don't throw it into chaos.


556
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,210
You want to search for clues from Qin Lie,


557
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,630
but you don't know men well enough,


558
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,700
whereas Qin Lie hates you to the core.


559
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,290
Where do you even start?


560
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,770
Cast a love spell on him,


561
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,100
and he will be yours.


562
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,610
[Qisha Valley]


563
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,520
Is this Qisha Valley?


564
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,620
Qisha Valley is located
in the hinterland of Chilan Continent,


565
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,180
it has the most pleasant weather.


566
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,520
It's so much better than the North
where you're from.


567
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,050
The North is dry and cold,


568
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,200
it's not cosy and warm like this place.


569
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,460
Even the sun is brighter.


570
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,230
I really don't understand why some people


571
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,560
don't appreciate
the beauty of Qisha Valley


572
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,380
and like the frosty North?


573
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,230
Such poor taste.


574
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,340
If we go further,


575
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,510
we'll arrive at Water Valley.


576
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,890
Yiyuan Pond


577
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,100
in Water Valley


578
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,460
is a holy place for cultivating
water spirit art.


579
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,050
You will practice here from now on.


580
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,770
Let's go see Master first.


581
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,810
[Jiu Liu Yu, Master of Qisha Valley]


582
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,480
Master,


583
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,590
Yu Shi's fire poison...


584
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,110
Among the two daughters
of the Ling family,


585
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,870
one has fiery passion,


586
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,720
another one has water-like gentleness.


587
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,260
Good.


588
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,770
A disease needs time to be cured,


589
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,230
you will eventually recover.


590
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,220
Take this elixir and drink it.


591
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,680
Practice well in the future.


592
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,580
Thank you, Master.


593
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,410
Take her to settle in.


594
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,520
Yes, Master.


595
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,380
Miss Yu Shi, please come with me.


596
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,340
You stay here.


597
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,330
Tell Master what happened
in Xingyun Pavilion.


598
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,470
From now on, you will stay here.


599
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,010
The Heavenly Water Spirit Record


600
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,520
is a high-level water spirit art.


601
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,720
Using water as the source
of spiritual power,


602
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,270
it can cleanse you as well as
any living being.


603
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,850
When training, use this method
to perceive and refine


604
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,450
the water element in Yiyuan Pond.


605
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,240
Purify and absorb it
with your spiritual power.


606
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,810
Then the poison will be cured.


607
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,280
Thank you, Brother Li.


608
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,950
From now on, we'll be a family.


609
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,570
You don't have to be so polite with me.


610
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,310
Your hands...


611
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,070
Why are they so cold?


612
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,400
Li Zhong Zheng!


613
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,950
Master wants to ask you something.


614
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,310
Make yourself home.


615
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,090
Hey, don't you seduce my brother.


616
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,260
I won't seduce your brother.


617
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,470
I wanted to advise you
to keep an eye on him.


618
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,800
To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.


619
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,140
If you bare your soul to a man,


620
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,260
he might be stressed out.


621
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,860
You're one to talk.


622
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,950
Come in.


623
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,300
Mister Du, your breakfast is here.


624
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,000
Didn't we agree


625
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,760
that all of us
will have breakfast together?


626
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,100
You?


627
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,450
How did you get in here?


628
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,180
This is Purple Mist Sea.
It's a battlefield.


629
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,880
Did you think this is Icestone City?


630
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,590
Mister Du,


631
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,100
Master Mo Hai is asking for you.


632
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,390
Alright, I got it.


633
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,430
You...


634
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,080
Ting Yu must've brought you here


635
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,190
to become my apprentices.


636
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,130
I just happen


637
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,450
to be in need of two helpers.


638
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,070
Your wish is our command.


639
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,900
I need someone


640
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,260
to be in charge of my daily meals,


641
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,780
and someone to run errands
and send my messages.


642
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,100
Choose one yourselves.


643
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,930
Don't like it?


644
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,820
I'll take charge of your daily meals.


645
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,200
Tang Si Qi, you...


646
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,140
There are many people during the day,
come back at night.


647
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,320
Leave now.


648
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,820
Go.


649
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,450
Why did you invite me over for dinner?


650
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,650
After inviting you,


651
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,540
I'll invite Du Shao Yang over as well.


652
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,710
I want to talk to both of you alone


653
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,340
and get to know you better.


654
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,120
After all, we are comrades
on the battlefield.


655
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,449
Comrades?


656
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,670
Du Shao Yang also said the same thing.


657
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,050
Why does this word


658
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,360
sound so odd when both of you said it?


659
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,100
Don't you ever think


660
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,040
that covering me up


661
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,330
in front of Du Hai Tian and Li Zhong Zheng


662
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,530
means you have the goods on me.


663
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,730
I can take your life anytime.


664
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,940
Just do it.


665
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,920
Why are we still eating?


666
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,429
Are you eating or not?


667
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,420
If you don't, I'll eat first.


668
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,139
Just ask me whatever you want.


669
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,989
I'll go to bed after dinner.


670
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,220
Come in.


671
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,310
What are you doing?


672
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,770
I made them myself.


673
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,620
Sit down and have a try.


674
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,290
How can I finish them?


675
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,780
You don't have to finish them.


676
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,610
Tell me which one you like,


677
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,860
so that I know your preference.


678
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,810
After this,
I'll cook dishes that you like.


679
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,200
Go on and try it.


680
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,090
Is it good?


681
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,680
That night,


682
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,710
we didn't perform the wedding ritual.


683
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,880
I didn't ask you.


684
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,120
Why are you telling me this?


685
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,380
Why didn't you ask me


686
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,120
how I got in here?


687
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,540
You're right.


688
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,210
How did you get in here?


689
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,430
Because they were short-staffed,


690
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,460
and I happen to know how to cook.


691
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,340
Purple Mist City


692
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,070
is the first barrier
to the Nether Battlefield.


693
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,310
There will be layers of inspection.


694
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,890
It's impossible for people


695
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,760
without any sectarian status to enter.


696
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,430
Who exactly are you?


697
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,460
What is your purpose of approaching me?


698
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,670
I'm a woman who's blindly in love.


699
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,570
A woman can do anything


700
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,730
for the man she loves.


701
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,060
I'm approaching you


702
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,830
because I like you.


703
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,340
Tang Si Qi.


704
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm telling you,


705
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm not interested in women.


706
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Woman is not an interest,


707
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,110
woman is man's need,


708
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,400
an essential feeling.


709
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,350
Without feelings,


710
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,600
you'll feel incomplete
no matter how much you get.


711
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,750
Then, after I get what I want,


712
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,730
I'll come get you, alright?


713
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,640
Du Shao Yang,


714
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,450
on such a quiet night,


715
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,050
you and I are sitting face to face,


716
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,740
exchanging words in soft, gentle tones.


717
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,550
Delightful,


718
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,130
isn't it?


719
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,130
If you really care about me,


720
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,670
get out of here at once.


721
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,650
If you stay here,


722
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,100
you will distract me,


723
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,690
my future will be destroyed.


724
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,620
I did not come here
to destroy your future.


725
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,290
I'm here to help.


726
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,290
Would you like to know


727
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,330
how to wipe out the Nether tribe


728
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,470
and earn Song Ting Yu's favour?


729
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,940
Your cooking is not bad,


730
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
but it can't be compared
to Yu Shi's cooking.


731
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,490
So, haven't you figured out
what you want to ask?


732
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,650
You...


733
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,540
You...


734
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,120
Thank you Saintess for your meal.
Excuse me.


735
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,910
You...


736
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,030
Qin Lie!


737
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,580
You really don't care about me, do you?


738
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,470
Then just ask me.


739
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,670
I've been asking you,
and you never said anything.


740
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,490
When I said I wanted to leave,
you lost your temper.


741
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,040
Why is your mood so unpredictable?


742
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,500
How dare I not care about you?


743
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,190
[Cast a love spell on him,]


744
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,210
[and he will be yours.]


745
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,720
Qin Lie.


746
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,260
[He is actually]


747
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,610
[you.]


748
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,140
[How did you]


749
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,430
[counter my attack?]


750
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,000
Saintess Song.


751
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,520
Saintess.


752
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,780
You...


753
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,790
[Why did I get countered?]


754
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,870
[It shouldn't be possible.]
