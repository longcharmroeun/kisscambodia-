[Episode 9]


4
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,380
Boss.


5
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,420
Sir, what can I get you?


6
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,479
Have you seen this before?


7
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,530
Get out.


8
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,980
Have you seen this before?


9
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,620
-There's a shop in front.
-Try your luck over there.


10
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,250
Boss, I...


11
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,890
I can tell that


12
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,150
you either want to buy
things you can't afford,


13
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,140
or you want to sell things nobody wants.


14
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,090
I've seen people like you.


15
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,590
Other shops didn't appreciate your stuff,


16
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,090
and you don't believe my small
shop can afford to buy your stuff.


17
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,780
You should go.


18
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,900
Boss,


19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,530
I have a few pieces of spiritual arrays.


20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,110
Please take a look at it.


21
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,170
The drawing is nice.


22
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,760
I can use it as leg pads for my table.


23
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Sorry for wasting your time.


24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
Wait.


25
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,400
How many spirit boards do you have?


26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,840
May I know your name, sir?


27
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,000
Li Mu.


28
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,710
What about


29
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,680
your wife?


30
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,840
None of your business. I'm asking you,


31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,390
how many spirit boards are there?


32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,790
Get it all out for me.


33
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,870
This is all I have.


34
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,750
What did you see?


35
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,680
Nothing.


36
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,680
You're not very talented.


37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,510
But I do feel some changes around.


38
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,400
You could be talented.


39
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,230
I've been seeing certain drawings
in my dream since I was a kid,


40
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,909
but I forgot most of them
every time I woke up.


41
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,040
These sketches are based
on the drawings in my dream.


42
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,400
But


43
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,400
these are just the tiny
pieces of the original drawing.


44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,470
Kid,


45
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,120
sometimes, pushing
yourself too hard to look for it


46
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,040
could backfire.


47
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,160
Take your time, go home and keep dreaming.


48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,550
One day


49
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,230
when you can remember
everything in your dreams,


50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,910
come back to me.


51
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
Alright.


52
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,600
You've travelled so far


53
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,470
to open your store in this place.


54
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
It's because of this kid, am I right?


55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
He helped you before?


56
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,070
No way.


57
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
Look at that plateau redness
on his cheeks.


58
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
Even his cultivation level is
only at the Natal Opening Realm.


59
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,720
Yet you're impressed by him.


60
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Me?


61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,350
It was just a favour to you.


62
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
Shao Yang.


63
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,720
You're here.


64
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,790
Did Pu Jiao do anything unusual today?


65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
No.


66
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
If it really was him who sent
someone to kill Uncle Hua,


67
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,190
we have to find a way


68
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,690
to provoke him to do it again.


69
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,290
It would be best if he did it himself.


70
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
I've already done so.


71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,880
[Before I find the
evidence to expose you,]


72
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,730
[there's one thing I have to do first.]


73
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,950
[What is it?]


74
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,790
[I'll marry Du Shao Yang.]


75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,320
[Ling Borough will form an alliance]


76
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,190
[with Xingyun Pavilion.]


77
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,280
I've given him a reason to kill me.


78
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,440
And since he can't afford to fail,


79
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,680
he'll definitely come for me himself.


80
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,630
So with me as the bait,


81
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,880
it's perfect.


82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
-No.
-No.


83
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,880
The ship has sailed.


84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,600
What's done is done.


85
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Your only choice now is to work with me.


86
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,910
Protect me.


87
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,350
-Yu Shi...
-I...


88
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
Are you just setting up trap
or are you being serious?


89
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,470
-Of course I...
-Setting up trap.


90
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,000
You used our marriage as a reason


91
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,470
to provoke Pu Jiao.


92
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,800
If Pu Jiao believes that
we're going to get married,


93
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,400
he would come for you himself.


94
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,690
Yes.


95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,320
This is too bad for you then,


96
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,030
you are going to marry me again.


97
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,190
You want to get married?


98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
And as soon as possible?


99
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,320
Why?


100
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,630
A marriage alliance between two families


101
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,320
was our original intention back then.


102
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,070
What about you, Miss Ling?


103
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,260
Haven't you been accusing Shao Yang


104
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,400
of murdering Blacksmith Hua
of Ling Borough?


105
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,560
I wasn't thinking clearly.


106
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,320
I thought about it afterwards.


107
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,950
Shao Yang wouldn't do that.


108
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,840
I'm willing to marry him
because I believe in him.


109
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,910
This is good for both
families to bury the hatchet


110
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,350
and make peace.


111
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,040
To mend the relationship between
our two families as soon as possible,


112
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,560
Yu Shi and I have
reached an agreement that


113
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,600
we should get married without delay.


114
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
After that, we'll go back to
Ling Borough and meet Chief Ling.


115
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,910
We'll clear up the misunderstanding
with the Lings.


116
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,400
Does Qin Lie know about this?


117
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,280
I'll tell him.


118
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,070
That means he doesn't know.


119
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,120
He's not going to come and
ruin the wedding again, is he?


120
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,200
We will take care of this matter.


121
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,440
Stepmother, please don't worry.


122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,909
Fine.


123
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,990
Your marriage is settled then.


124
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Master...


125
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,120
I said it's settled.


126
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Pass my words.


127
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,040
The Young Master of
Xingyun Pavilion is getting married.


128
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,690
The town will celebrate the
joyous moment together.


129
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,010
Yes.


130
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,710
The marriage is settled?


131
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,370
I thought she is in love with Qin Lie?


132
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,590
That's true.


133
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,440
But Qin Lie doesn't know about it yet.


134
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,590
Well.


135
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,640
I shall kill her personally this time.


136
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm going to turn their wedding


137
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,520
into a funeral.


138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,030
[Miss me?]


139
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,270
I'm guessing that you missed me?


140
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,150
You've heard about it, haven't you?


141
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,120
Congratulations.
You're getting married again.


142
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,320
That's why I'm here to remind you.


143
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't make any trouble.


144
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,270
Do you love her?


145
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,560
None of your business.


146
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,470
There isn't any sparkle in your eyes.


147
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,640
Looks like


148
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,520
you don't love her.


149
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,590
Women are not meant to be loved.


150
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,830
They are meant to procreate then?


151
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,000
I love power and status.


152
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,390
Do you know what it
feels like to love someone?


153
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,120
Your heart will become tender.


154
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,600
It'll make you feel powerful.


155
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm already powerful.


156
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,200
A man's power of
fist is the most inferior.


157
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,280
The real power is


158
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,830
love.


159
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,080
Endless love


160
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,230
boundless love,


161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
it will make you feel like a bird


162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,200
soaring in the sky,


163
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,960
or like a fish swimming in the water.


164
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,680
Your heart will blossom like flower.


165
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,080
A flower that blooms in your heart.


166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,120
What kind of nonsense books
have you been you reading?


167
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,790
Love


168
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,760
will make your heart tender.


169
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,710
It'll make you powerful.


170
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,910
It'll take away your fear.


171
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,270
Because you have her in your heart,


172
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,270
and she has you in hers.


173
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,590
You'll be by her side,


174
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,160
and she'll be by yours.


175
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,920
You know that


176
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,030
even if you lose,


177
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,680
you'll still have her.


178
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,960
So


179
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,790
you'll never lose everything.


180
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,400
You still have fear.


181
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,710
-I don't.
-Yes, you fear that


182
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,890
you would lose everything in the end


183
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,540
after you've been working
hard for your whole life.


184
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,000
By then,


185
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,080
you'll have no one by your side.


186
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,720
No one cares about you
and no one wants you.


187
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,880
All that's left is an emptiness.


188
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,790
-A pack of nonsense.
-Du Shao Yang!


189
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,850
If you don't love her and
you don't want to marry her,


190
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,150
but you're not in the
position to do anything,


191
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,600
do you believe that


192
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,000
I can ruin this marriage for you?


193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,440
And I won't put you
in a difficult position.


194
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
I do.


195
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,650
I believe you.


196
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,200
But I don't need it.


197
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm warning you...


198
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,450
Don't worry.


199
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,470
Once you're married, I'll leave.


200
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll stop bugging you.


201
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,280
I don't touch married man.


202
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,690
For me, they are as good as dead.


203
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,640
I believe that


204
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
my dream man


205
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,830
will show up one day.


206
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,880
I'll wait here for you
to finish your wedding.


207
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,030
If you want to break the engagement,


208
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,960
come here and find me.


209
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,230
If you are married,


210
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,230
I'll leave.


211
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,040
You'll never see me again.


212
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,080
Where have you been?


213
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,760
I...


214
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,790
What's the matter?


215
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,350
None of your business.


216
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,390
I heard that you are getting
married to Ling Yu Shi.


217
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,230
Yes.


218
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,240
Who did you just meet?


219
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,790
What's that smell on your body?


220
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,630
This is impossible.


221
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,910
It can't be her.


222
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,200
You and Ling Yu Shi's wedding


223
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,520
is just a trap?


224
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,090
Yes.


225
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,350
You told them about Pu Jiao's plan


226
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,320
to deal with Qin Lie,


227
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,270
in order to gain their trust?


228
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,910
Yes.


229
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,320
[Although it's just to set up a trap,]


230
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,120
[I wonder if Qin Lie will have
a problem with the wedding?]


231
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,770
Miss Ling.


232
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,760
Come in.


233
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,520
Miss Ling, this is your
wedding dress for tomorrow.


234
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,840
Leave it.


235
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,850
Yes.


236
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,960
Du Shao Yang,


237
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,570
hand over Yu Shi to me.


238
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,080
Yu Shi was the one who
proposed this marriage.


239
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,470
She's marrying me willingly.


240
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,880
This is none of your business.


241
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,150
That's impossible.


242
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,390
You must have threatened her
by some means.


243
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,760
Xingyun Pavilion will not
tolerate your insolence anymore.


244
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,110
Get lost.


245
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,790
Ling Yu Shi that wench.


246
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,680
She's getting involved
with Qin Lie on one hand,


247
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,240
and seducing Gao Yu on the other.


248
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,750
Now she's going to marry Shao Yang.


249
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,150
Marrying this kind of woman is
a disgrace to our family.


250
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,680
Whoever dares to insult Yu Shi again,


251
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,650
I'm going to hurt her.


252
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
Take the mistress back to her room.


253
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,790
Qin Lie,


254
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,520
don't forget it.


255
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,760
-It was Yu Shi who...
-Shut up!


256
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,960
I was just wondering
what's with all the fuss here.


257
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,080
Turned out Qin Lie's here to make a scene.


258
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,350
Qin Lie, if you make any more trouble,


259
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,060
don't blame me
for having to attack you.


260
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,349
It's none of your business.


261
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,839
-Get lost.
-You're being ungrateful.


262
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,359
For the sake of Miss Ling,


263
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,109
let him off today.


264
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,750
I'll let him off


265
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,910
for the sake of Brother Li.


266
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,960
Guo Ying, Guo Hao,


267
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,390
take him outside and let him cool off.


268
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,079
I don't want to see him
again before the wedding.


269
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,119
Yes.


270
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,390
Thank you for your help.


271
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,910
It's our pleasure, Master Du.


272
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
It's messy here.


273
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,440
Why don't you all go back
to your rooms and rest?


274
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
Once everything is in order,


275
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,750
I'll send the invitation
to you personally.


276
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,720
I hope it won't delay the
time of the wedding ceremony.


277
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,440
It's fine.


278
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,390
I'm here now, nothing can be delayed.


279
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,210
You watched the woman
you love being snatched away,


280
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,420
yet the words you spoke
were still fair


281
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,080
and reasonable.


282
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,680
No wonder I'm attracted to you.


283
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,990
Shut up.


284
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Hurry up.


285
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,080
Walk faster.


286
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,960
Where are you taking me?


287
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,990
Letting me cool off?


288
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,910
Who is it?


289
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
This is a wedding dress I chose for you.


290
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,110
Yu Shi,


291
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,790
can you put it on for me too?


292
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,360
This is not the time to joke.


293
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,580
The wedding is tomorrow.


294
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,730
Pu Jiao will definitely
do something tonight.


295
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Why did you come out?


296
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,200
Don't let anyone see you.


297
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,120
You've worn a wedding dress twice.


298
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,920
Once for Qin Lie,


299
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
once for Shao Yang.


300
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,300
What about me?


301
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,030
Why did you


302
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,960
never choose me?


303
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,320
Gao Yu,


304
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,840
what are you trying to do?


305
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,410
Can I hug you?


306
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,940
Just for a while.


307
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,040
This is my only wish.


308
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,100
Stop there.


309
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,790
I'm just teasing you.


310
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,910
I saw that you were being nervous.


311
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm just joking with you.


312
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,720
I'm not nervous.


313
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,630
Go back and hide.


314
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Saintess.


315
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,490
Help!


316
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,250
Something bad has happened, Young Master!


317
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,720
Something bad has happened, Master!


318
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,750
It's Mistress.


319
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,030
She's dead.


320
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
What?


321
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,870
Huang'er!


322
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,850
-Mistress!
-Stepmother!


323
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,080
Sister.


324
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,970
Qin Lie.


325
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,560
What happened?


326
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,300
Qin Lie murdered my wife.


327
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,840
I didn't murder her.


328
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,630
I'm being framed.


329
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,360
If you didn't kill her, who did?


330
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm going to kill you!


331
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,910
Qin Lie.


332
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,480
You've got the nerve to
resist despite being weak.


333
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,680
Stop it.


334
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,050
Your lover is a murderer.


335
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,030
Behave yourself.


336
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,370
He didn't do it!


337
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,210
Brother Li,


338
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,910
please help Qin Lie.


339
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,240
Please spare his life, we still
need to interrogate him for the truth.


340
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,170
That's enough.


341
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,680
Are you trying to take the
law into your own hands?


342
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,960
He killed my wife.


343
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,370
I also believe that he killed your wife.


344
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,490
But when did he start to
have intention to kill her,


345
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,630
when did he kill her,
including your wife's body,


346
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,110
we must investigate everything.


347
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,660
We can only convict him


348
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,510
once we get everything clear.


349
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,740
Take him away.
I'll question him personally.


350
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,750
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.


351
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,420
Gao Yu!


352
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,240
-Qin Lie.
-Protect Yu Shi!


353
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,910
Brother Li,


354
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,080
I'll leave it to you to
take care of the scene.


355
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I'm going to interrogate Qin Lie now.


356
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,750
Of course.


357
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,480
Knock yourself out, Lord Pu Jiao.


358
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,320
This is all your fault.


359
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,690
She has nothing to do with this!


360
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,960
You're still defending her.


361
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,350
The one who died was my own sister.


362
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,960
The only family I have left.


363
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,870
Once Lord Pu Jiao
checks everything out,


364
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,840
if she really is involved,


365
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,200
I'll kill her myself.


366
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,080
Come with me.


367
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,880
Huang'er.


368
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Who do you think


369
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,750
is behind this?


370
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,210
Whoever it is, this has
nothing to do with us.


371
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,990
Gao Yu,


372
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,200
let go.


373
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Let go of me.


374
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,560
Let go.


375
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,670
Let go.


376
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,830
Calm down.


377
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,570
Can't you see it?


378
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,630
We've been tricked.


379
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,320
It wasn't Pu Jiao.


380
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
Our plan has been seen through long ago.


381
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,500
Pu Jiao's stupidity, your sister's death,


382
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,830
Qin Lie's arrest,


383
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,020
the person behind all this


384
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,750
had turned our trap to her advantage.


385
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
And the person behind is?


386
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,570
Song Ting Yu.


387
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,600
I thought of a way to save Qin Lie.


388
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,030
I need to see him.


389
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,750
You'll get yourself killed.


390
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,280
At least I'll die with him.


391
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,480
I won't let you go.


392
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,560
Let go.


393
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,750
Let go of me!


394
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,240
Sister.


395
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,570
Sister.


396
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,430
Yu Shi.


397
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,860
Yu Shi.


398
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,150
I can finally hug you.


399
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,920
Why?


400
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,940
Gao Yu was protecting Ling Yu Shi.


401
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,720
Although it was easy to kill her,


402
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,560
it could draw attention as well.


403
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,320
Killing Gao Huang'er was different.


404
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,610
I just needed to find
someone to take the blame.


405
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,270
Of course I would
pick the easy one to kill.


406
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
She is my stepmother.


407
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,970
Since she's the stepmother,
why are you upset?


408
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,460
Do you care about her
like she's your mother?


409
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
I told you


410
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,790
my entire plan.


411
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,440
But you


412
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,370
hid everything from me.


413
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,510
You killed my stepmother today.


414
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,240
Who knows


415
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,570
which person close to me
you'd kill next time?


416
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,300
You did well.


417
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,460
This Luminous Bead is yours now.


418
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,030
Now that you have this,


419
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,390
you can ascend to a new realm instantly.


420
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,870
How did I give myself away?


421
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,680
Du Shao Yang.


422
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,480
That's impossible.


423
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,660
I was ordered to come
here to set up traps.


424
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,790
I let Du and Ling families
turn against each other first,


425
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,510
then I'll capture


426
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,790
and have you all slaughtered.


427
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,560
You


428
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,910
are a smart guy.


429
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,680
You figured out my plan.


430
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,790
But Du Shao Yang is smarter.


431
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,750
He knew that joining my side is
better than forming alliance with you.


432
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,240
He sold you out long ago.


433
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,140
You don't believe me?


434
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Then why didn't he save you


435
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,200
and walked away alone just now?


436
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,800
You don't really consider
him a friend, do you?


437
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,040
The word loyalty never belonged to him


438
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,070
Though there is one
word that suits you well.


439
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
Dumb.


440
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,040
You're going to die soon.


441
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,930
Speaking of Du Shao Yang,


442
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,020
well,


443
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,140
why didn't he help you just now


444
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,320
and walked away alone?


445
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,780
Because he is going
to the Luminous Pillar,


446
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,500
the place where you
usually met with each other.


447
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,670
Why is he going there then?


448
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,030
He's waiting for me to
give him his reward there.


449
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,240
The star and cloud were close once.


450
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,670
The light could break
the sincerest friendship.


451
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,780
Du Shao Yang,


452
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,560
you betrayed us.


453
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,460
When you discussed about forming
an alliance with me in secret,


454
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,760
you intended to force her
out and negotiate with her.


455
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,000
I thought you've got a point at that time,


456
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
but afterwards, I felt it's ridiculous.


457
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,920
You overestimated yourself.


458
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,750
Saintess Song showed herself indeed,


459
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,240
but she was not forced out by us.


460
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,890
She had already seen through us.


461
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,080
So you were bought off by her?


462
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,150
It's Xingyun Pavilion's duty


463
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,260
to share the problems of the Saintess.


464
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,950
And I


465
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,540
will profit from it too, of course.


466
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,030
For the sake of profit,


467
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,110
you even sacrificed your stepmother.


468
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,710
In this journey,


469
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,780
someone has to be sacrificed.


470
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,300
[3,000 years ago,]


471
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,080
[the opening of nether passageway had
led to the invasion of Dark Nether Race.]


472
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,030
[The human world
turned into a living hell.]


473
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,150
[Human race won a pyrrhic victory.]


474
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,360
[When the Chilan Continent
returned to peace,]


475
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
[it was already devastated.]


476
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,270
[Rebuilding of the continent
took thousands of years.]


477
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,030
[300 years ago,]


478
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,660
[the Profound Heaven Alliance
saw that people of this land]


479
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,390
[were scattered around and helpless
under the attack of spirit beasts.]


480
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,670
[They sent the strong ones
here to build the Icestone City.]


481
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,310
[And they made a peace treaty
with The Master of Frost]


482
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,380
[to return peace to the people.]


483
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,150
[Those strong ones
built the Luminous Pillar]


484
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,630
[on the roof of Xingyun Pavilion's hall.]


485
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,200
[It let the starlight
to guide people home.]


486
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,150
[But the strong ones'
kindness did not stop there.]


487
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,270
[To prevent the Dark Nether Race
from returning,]


488
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,750
[the strong ones injected a powerful
force into the Luminous Pillar.]


489
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,480
[If the Dark Nether Race returns
and northern land falls,]


490
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,860
[people can activate the
power of the Luminous Pillar]


491
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,810
[to destroy the entire Icestone City.]


492
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,190
[The activation of Luminous Pillar]


493
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,840
[is to let them die with the enemies
when their combat forces are drained.]


494
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,110
[To let them avoid torture]


495
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,960
[and save their dignity.]


496
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,270
[This is the strong ones'
love for the weaklings.]


497
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,150
[This is the final compassion
given by the strong ones.]


498
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,630
The activation of Luminous Pillar


499
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,360
requires the combination
of thunder and starlight.


500
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,150
Two spiritual forces as one.


501
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,240
According to the
Icestone City's ancestral rule,


502
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,510
the star and cloud were close once.


503
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,750
It actually has two meanings.


504
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,550
The first meaning is


505
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,880
the activation of Luminous Pillar requires
the combination of two spiritual forces.


506
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,230
The second meaning is


507
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,960
the master and the vice master


508
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,239
need to keep this secret together.


509
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,270
As for


510
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
the light could break
the sincerest friendship,


511
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,639
it expresses the strong ones' sadness


512
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,800
towards the destruction of Icestone City.


513
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,679
To conceal the truth that Soul
Reaping Beast did not die by my hand,


514
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,800
all those who know must die.


515
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,900
I deliberately appointed the
presumptuous Pu Jiao to set up the trap.


516
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,159
so that Qin Lie and Du Shao Yang
could see through it.


517
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,260
But Qin Lie was too kind,


518
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,520
he underestimated Du Shao Yang's ruthless.


519
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,470
Since they have turned against each other,
a battle between the two is inevitable.


520
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,250
Luminous Bead's power,


521
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,950
combined with Qin Lie's thunder energy,


522
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,390
the entire Icestone City and them


523
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,170
will be annihilated.


524
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,650
We're done.


525
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,750
Gong Mu Lie?


526
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,990
What happened?


527
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,810
It's you.


528
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,540
It was you who wanted
to destroy Icestone City.


529
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,450
I wanted you two to kill each other.


530
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,970
I didn't expect that


531
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,190
I almost made a huge mistake.


532
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,880
What huge mistake?


533
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,480
What exactly is going on?


534
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,430
I want you both dead.


535
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,650
Because you both are
too difficult to control.


536
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,780
I can't just kill you for no reason.


537
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,460
So I manipulated you
into killing each other.


538
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,200
Every time you were
in a difficult situation,


539
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,120
you somehow made a breakthrough
and grew stronger.


540
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,070
I was afraid that you can't beat him,


541
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,870
so I gave you the Luminous Bead


542
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,630
for you to strengthen your power.


543
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,550
I didn't expect that your battle


544
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,260
would generate such great force


545
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,750
that almost destroyed
the entire Icestone City.


546
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,060
It was you who stopped
this force of destruction.


547
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,320
Yes.


548
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,640
After your battle,


549
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,170
you two actually skipped a
level and rose to a new class.


550
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,420
One is on the pinnacle of
the Natal Opening Realm.


551
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,470
The other is on the early level
of the Manifestation Realm.


552
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,810
You are both very talented indeed.


553
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,510
It's easy to kill you,


554
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,050
but it would be such a waste to do so.


555
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,280
It's better to foster your talents


556
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,320
and get you to work for me in future.


557
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,990
The death of Blacksmith Hua is


558
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,200
Pu Jiao's presumptuous
move to start the rivalry.


559
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,230
By the time I found out,


560
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,840
the damage was already done.


561
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,360
I don't trust you.


562
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,860
What about my stepmother?


563
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,810
I asked Pu Jiao to kill some
warriors of Xingyun Pavilion.


564
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,470
I didn't expect he would misunderstand me.


565
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,770
In order to claim credit,
he killed Gao Huang'er.


566
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,220
I don't believe you.


567
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,260
So what if you don't believe me?


568
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,230
If I want to kill you,
I can do it very easily.


569
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,380
What are you trying to do?


570
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,140
Do you know about the Dark Nether Race
from the netherworld?


571
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,520
There are five dark tribes.


572
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,110
Among them, Horned Demon Tribe
have been residing


573
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,720
in the depths of the netherworld
underneath our Chilan Continent.


574
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,630
I only allowed Pu Jiao to


575
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,310
go on his own ways this time


576
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,240
because I have more
important things on hand.


577
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,060
Three days ago, the Horned Demon Tribe
launched an attack suddenly.


578
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,830
The battle with the netherworld
comes every 30 years.


579
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,910
It has become a routine over
the past thousands of years.


580
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,110
But it's only been 17 years this time,


581
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,680
the Dark Nether Race
has launched the attack.


582
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,360
Something is wrong.


583
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,430
At first light, I'll go to the


584
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,240
nether passageway in Purple Mist Sea
to take control of the situation.


585
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,240
This matter concerns the survival
of the entire Chilan Continent.


586
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,180
If you want,


587
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,120
you can come with me.


588
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,090
If you don't want to,


589
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,820
you can go your separate ways now.


590
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,010
But the war is in a dire situation now.


591
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,390
All forces across the world,


592
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,890
from the Red Copper Class
to the Bluestone Class,


593
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,450
as well as some party-less
independent cultivator


594
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,100
are going to Purple Mist Sea.


595
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,190
Even the Artefact Forging Sect,
who doesn't involve in worldly affairs


596
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,270
has sent Master Mo Hai
to lead the team personally.


597
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,530
Master Mo Hai?


598
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,720
What's the matter?


599
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,510
You want to recruit us?


600
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,530
Sure.


601
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,250
But only on one condition.


602
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,720
You're trying to negotiate with me?


603
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,450
Let's hear it.


604
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,920
Arrange a meeting with
Master Mo Hai for us.


605
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,480
You guys want to enter
Artefact Forging Sect?


606
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,230
Yes.


607
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,620
Fine.


608
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,460
But whether you can
win Master Mo Hai's favour,


609
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,290
you'll have to rely on your fate.
