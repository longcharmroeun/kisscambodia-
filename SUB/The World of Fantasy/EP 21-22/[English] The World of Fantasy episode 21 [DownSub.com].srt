[Episode 21]


4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Qin Lie.


5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,440
I can't hold out much longer.


6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,270
I'm destined to die here.


7
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,590
Before I die,


8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,880
can I pretend that you are Gong Mu Lie?


9
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,710
I am sorry.


10
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,150
Song Ting Yu.


11
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,389
Song Ting Yu, stay awake!


12
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,150
Song Ting Yu.


13
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,870
You are fond of Qin Lie, aren't you?


14
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,079
Do you really think that
he will remember you forever


15
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,220
if you die in his arms?


16
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,990
He won't remember you.


17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,670
He saved you out of ethics.


18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,140
He has no feelings for you.


19
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,720
He will forget about what happened today
in a blink of an eye.


20
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,860
You said that you can't
hold out any longer.


21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
It's exactly what I am hoping for.


22
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,760
You are never a threat to me


23
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,140
but it's good to have one less person


24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,150
to jump at the chance.


25
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,480
If you die here,


26
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,910
be it Qin Lie or Gong Mu Lie,


27
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,640
both of them are mine.


28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,660
You can dream on.


29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,600
Let's go.

Shao Yang.


32
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,560
Why do you send the medicine by yourself?


33
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,950
We are short-handed. I am here to help.


34
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,100
Okay.


35
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,230
Du Shao Yang.


36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,470
Come out.


37
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,710
Yes.


38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,940
You are meritorious in the battle
to kill Di Shi Jiu.


39
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,780
We are facing great difficulties
yet you didn't back off.


40
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,550
You patrol around without taking a rest.


41
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,950
Furthermore, you are determined.


42
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,920
I have the heart to promote you.


43
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,760
Thank you.


44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,420
I went to see Mo Hai.


45
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,070
He's almost done making
the Terminator Profound Bombs.


46
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,029
That means


47
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,100
we will initiate a war against
the Dark Nether Race soon.


48
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,230
I plead to fight for the war.


49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Shao Yang.


50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,200
The moment the war starts,


51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,400
we will be fighting to death.


52
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,300
Although we have
Terminator Profound Bombs,


53
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,550
the person who was taken by
the Dark Nether Race


54
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,990
still worries me.


55
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,830
I can tell that


56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,710
you are an ambitious person.


57
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,800
You are on par with Qin Lie.


58
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,140
If we lose in the war,


59
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,070
I want you to run away alive


60
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,200
at all cost.


61
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,980
So that one day you may reestablish
the Bloody Spear Guard.


62
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,630
Got it.


63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,630
I will live up to your trust.


64

[Tea]


65
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,350
We do nothing but waiting idly
in the village.


66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
We wait from day time to night time,


67
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,270
from night time to dawn.


68
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,909
Why hasn't the war started yet?


69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,390
I am bored.


70
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,030
I plan to show you around


71
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,520
but there is nothing interesting to see.


72
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,580
It is just like a dead town.


73
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,750
Do you know of


74
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,630
any interesting places?


75
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:55,820
What?


76
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,909
Demon aura?


77
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
That's right.


78
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,100
Since Jing Xuan


79
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,480
was put in charge of the Nether War


80
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,700
over a hundred years ago,


81
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,640
I've never been to the Nether Battlefield.


82
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,830
I almost forgot


83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,110
how it feels to be surrounded


84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,520
by demon aura.


85
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,980
Why don't we check it out?


86
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
I knew that you would like it.


87
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,640
Let's go.


88
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,100
Time to eat.


89
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,020
Stand there.


90
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,020
There are only commoners


91
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,480
who are in distress.


92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,670
You should check on the guardians.


93
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
What are you doing here?


94
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,550
Please hear me out.


95
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,990
We are from the Palace of Hell.


96
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,070
We are ordered by
the Master of the Palace of Hell


97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,909
to check if the residents in the building
are doing well.


98
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,230
Everyone in there are doing well.


99
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
There is nothing to check.


100
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,750
People inside the building
were injured by the demon aura.


101
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,300
Without master's order,


102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,870
no one is allowed to enter.


103
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,640
We are working in the same field.
Please give me some leeway.


104
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,790
I just want to take a look.


105
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,070
Go away.


106
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,150
Leave now.


107
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,030
Fine.


108
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,260
I will leave now.


109
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,960
It's time to eat. Why are you still here?


110
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,150
I am not hungry. I don't want to eat.


111
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,550
That is impossible.


112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,940
[Pu Ci Residence]


113
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,100
Something is unusual in the passageway.
Send out the warning!


114
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,190
Get ready!


115
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,300
Don't attack us.


116
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,190
I am Qin Lie of Lin Borough.


117
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,550
Quick, come and rescue Saintess Song.


118
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,640
It's Saintess Song.
Hurry up, help him out.


119
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,419
Here.


120
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,070
Finally we are back to Chilan Continent.


121
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,540
Qin Lie, what is wrong with you?


122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
Qin Lie.


123
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,900
You are almost done with Natal Opening
Realm and will ascend to a new realm soon.


124
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,280
If you successfully ascend to
a new realm, you will...


125
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,660
You will reach the pinnacle
of the Manifestation Realm.


126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,990
Go away now! The Heavenly Thunder
is coming.


127
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,900
It's as strong as the
Thunder of the Ninth Heaven


128
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,660
that killed the Soul Reaping Beasts,
if not more.


129
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,590
She is poisoned.


130
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,280
Even after taking the medicine,


131
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,400
her condition remains the same.


132
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,100
You were an apprentice at Water Moon Sect.


133
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,470
You are the best medicine practitioner
in the Purple Mist Sea.


134
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,080
Please save her.


135
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Since medicine is not effective on her,


136
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,470
do you have any other idea?


137
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,270
She is poisoned by the demon aura.


138
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,640
We just have to find someone


139
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,400
proficient in the Dark Nether Race's arts


140
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,660
to absorb the demon aura out of her body.


141
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,100
We have been fighting against
the Nether Race for three centuries.


142
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,300
The Nether Race fights
bravely but ruthlessly.


143
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,790
They would rather die than yielding.


144
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,150
Once they are captured,
they would kill themselves.


145
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,860
Why would they cure the Saintess,
who is a human.


146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,070
Doctor.


147
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,950
For how long more she can live?


148
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,900
We shall see if she can survive the night.


149
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,070
I'll inform the Profound Heaven Alliance
at once.


150
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,510
Please take care of her.


151
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,100
Don't go.


152
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,230
Gong Mu Lie, I don't want you to go there.


153
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,080
Mother of Land will kill you.


154
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,910
Mother of Land?


155
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,390
Song Ting Yu, what are you trying to say?


156
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,390
We grew up together.


157
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,080
We are so close with each other.


158
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,110
Why are you going to see her?


159
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,220
I am reluctant to accept it, Gong Mu Lie.


160
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,780
Song Ting Yu.


161
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,980
I am Qin Lie.


162
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,160
Qin Lie?


163
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,200
Have you not awakened?


164
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,550
Don't go against Song Yu.


165
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,340
Please don't do it.


166
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,280
It is as if Song Ting Yu
has changed into another person.


167
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,720
She mentioned the Mother of Land.


168
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,110
Could it be the same person
in the prophecy?


169
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,640
Mother of Land and the son
of the God of War.


170
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,420
Could Gong Mu Lie
be the son of the God of War?


171
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,510
Are you...


172
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,470
It is impossible.


173
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,150
If she wants to pretend
I'm Gong Mu Lie, fine.


174
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,840
Then I'll pretend


175
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,660
she's infatuated with Gong Mu Lie.


176
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,420
However, she said that
she grew up with me.


177
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,230
That is sheer ridiculous.


178
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,080
Perhaps just like me,


179
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,220
she is related to your background.


180
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,720
However, what did she mean


181
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,860
by "awakened"?


182
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,670
Yu Shi.


183
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,520
Take good care of her.


184
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,870
I will think of another way.


185
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,980
Sure.


186
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,160
Blood Progenitor, Xue Li.


187
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,720
What do you want?


188
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,230
Xue Li.


189
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,460
Do you know of any method


190
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,200
to save Saintess Song from the demon aura?


191
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,340
Her body is attacked by the demon aura.


192
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,230
It depends on her own making


193
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,270
if she can survive the night.


194
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,590
It is impossible that there is
no way at all to save her.


195
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,430
You should take care of
your own business first.


196
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Think about it.


197
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,040
So many people are after you.


198
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,510
Qin Lie, after you have got the insight


199
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,760
of the last Spiritual Lines Pillar,


200
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,200
my physique is back.


201
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,200
Therefore,


202
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I have to go.


203
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,100
Where are you going?


204
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,350
That is rubbish.


205
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,080
Of course I am going to
Heavenly Calamity Continent


206
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,960
to look for my family.


207
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
By the way,


208
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,390
don't forget to
keep Spiritual Lines Pillars properly.


209
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,190
It will be useful to you.


210
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,110
It doesn't belong to the
Artefact Forging Sect.


211
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,960
It belongs to the Heavenly Armament Sect
of Heavenly Calamity Continent.


212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,630
But...


213
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,110
They are huge. How do I keep them?


214
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,790
You have got an insight of...


215
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,640
all 12 Spiritual Lines Pillars.


216
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,430
They are just like your children now.


217
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,160
You can keep them as you wish.


218
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,430
Take care, lad.


219
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,780
See you again,


220
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,540
Xue Li.


221
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,400
The demon aura is fatal to her.


222
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,540
Why do I feel so comfortable


223
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,870
after absorbing the demon aura?


224
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,590
Who am I?


225
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,630
Surprisingly, she recovered
without any cure.


226
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,310
She is Saintess Song after all.


227
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,840
She doesn't hold the title for no reason.


228
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,630
She has her own ways.


229
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,910
It is such a miracle.


230
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,310
Just treat it as a miracle.


231
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,840
When will


232
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,230
my miracle be here?


233
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,350
What is your miracle?


234
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,960
My grandpa.


235
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,860
The eight stone pillars
left behind by my grandpa.


236
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,910
Why are they so powerful?


237
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,710
They can even trigger Heavenly Thunder.


238
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,990
They are so similar to


239
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,520
the 12 Spiritual Lines Pillars.


240
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,100
Is everything


241
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,350
left behind by my grandpa to me?


242
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,200
The Blood Progenitor, Xue Li once said,


243
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,280
The Spiritual Lines Pillars belong to
the Heavenly Armament Sect.


244
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,280
I remember that my master too once said,


245
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,550
The Heavenly Armament Sect
are the true master artificers.


246
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,720
Was your grandpa part of the
Heavenly Armament Sect?


247
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,750
The Nether Tribe claimed that
they are indebted to my grandpa.


248
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
However, why did my grandpa help them out?


249
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,350
Don't forget about the Master of Frost.


250
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,400
He also received help from
your grandpa, Qin Shan.


251
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,840
So my grandpa is a god?


252
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,830
If your grandpa is a god,


253
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,110
doesn't that make you the son
of the God of War?


254
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,300
Qin Lie.


255
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,870
The myth


256
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,080
can only be solved by your grandpa.


257
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,780
However, we are clear that


258
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,350
we won't be able to find


259
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,300
a big shot like him.


260
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,310
We can only wait for him to come back.


261
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,460
I believe that he will
come home one day soon.


262
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,069
You can't remember anything?


263
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,030
You mentioned Gong Mu Lie


264
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,560
and Mother of Land.


265
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,280
You also said something about awakening


266
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,160
and you told me not to go against my dad.


267
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Have you forgotten all of them?


268
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
When the demon aura attacked my body,


269
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,550
I felt something different.


270
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,590
I had a weird dream.


271
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,390
However,


272
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,350
I don't remember what I've said.


273
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,400
What did you see in your dream?


274
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,460
In the Mirror Realm,


275
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,750
there was a clear lake.


276
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,390
When Gong Mu Lie wasn't cultivating,


277
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,700
he would take a stroll around the lake.


278
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,430
At high tide in the morning,


279
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,980
Gong Mu Lie would be waiting for
the sunrise by the lakeside.


280
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,940
At low tide at night,


281
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,460
Gong Mu Lie would take a break
under the moonlight.


282
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
However,


283
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,060
with his back turned on me,


284
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,820
I couldn't see his face clearly.


285
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,520
He had been with a lady.


286
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
I think


287
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
that is part of the content
in The Tale of Gong Mu Lie.


288
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,030
Who is that lady?


289
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,320
Could you see her face?


290
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,700
Saintess Song is safe and sound.


291
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,100
It is indeed a blessing for
Chilan Continent.


292
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,460
Thank you for taking care of me,
Guardian Xie.


293
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,910
Once I am back to
the Profound Heaven Alliance,


294
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,520
I will request the Chief to reward you.


295
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,750
You don't have to do so, Saintess.


296
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,310
Thank you, Uncle Xie.


297
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,400
I appreciate your respect for me.


298
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,920
Armoury City is on its last stand.


299
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,350
Once we lose it,


300
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
the entire Chilan Continent
will be in danger.


301
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,670
I wish I could fly there to help out.


302
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,340
However, this place


303
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,180
is the exit of the nether passageway.


304
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,270
We have to stay back and guard this place.


305
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,980
Golden Fire Cloud Canvas?


306
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,910
This magical item...


307
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,060
They say there are less than


308
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,320
three of them in Chilan Continent.


309
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,280
Thank you for lending me
the magical item.


310
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,390
I will return it to you for sure
the next time we see each other.


311
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,040
Don't mention it.


312
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,670
Chilan Continent is my homeland.


313
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,230
I will never allow any foreign tribe
to take a share on it.


314
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,390
I swear on my life that
I will protect it.


315
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,460
I will chase Dark Nether Race
back to the underground.


316
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,390
After taking the medicine,


317
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
they look so much better.


318
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,270
We're running out of
Demon Cleansing Pills.


319
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,340
If they don't get better,


320
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,640
they will die soon.


321
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,430
Dear daughter!


322
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,100
Dear daughter, can you hear me?


323
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,270
What are you doing?


324
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,670
Both of you should be
going on a patrol now.


325
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,910
[Pu Ci Residence]


326
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,910
Why are you screaming?


327
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,550
I came here yesterday.


328
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,060
I heard my daughter's voice
coming from the building.


329
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,200
Are you serious?


330
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,030
Yes, I am really serious.


331
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,700
However, my daughter died a long time ago.


332
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,860
Since she is dead,


333
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,100
why are you fooling around? Go away.


334
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,670
My dear daughter, I really miss you.


335
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,830
-Why are you so cruel...
-Hold on.


336
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,830
How could you dump me?


337
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,980
My stomach is not feeling well.


338
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,550
Please take me to the outhouse.


339
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,230
-Fine, come with me.
-Sure.


340
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,990
It is over there.


341
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,390
My dear daughter!


342
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,070
My dear daughter!


343
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,590
My dear daughter!


344
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,150
Where are you?


345
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,340
Can you hear me?


346
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,870
I struggled a lot
when I was looking for you.


347
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,680
Hey.


348
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,220
Hey.


349
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,190
Can I ask you a question?


350
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,230
Have you seen my daughter?


351
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,760
My daughter is dead.


352
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,390
Hey.


353
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,520
Why aren't you talking?


354
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,670
Master Xie!


355
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,940
Master Xie!


356
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,700
Master Xie!


357
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,710
I am dressing in a different attire


358
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,350
yet you still can recognise me.


359
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,830
It was an honour meeting you


360
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,990
at the Profound Heaven Alliance.
How could I forget?


361
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,340
What a sweet talker. I like you.


362
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,640
Get up.


363
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,040
Master Xie, why are you dressed like this?


364
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,160
What's the occasion?


365
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,320
Do you need my help?


366
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,390
There is no occasion.


367
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,070
I was bored, so I came out
for a walk.


368
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
What is your name?


369
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,190
My name is Du Shao Yang.


370
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,980
Du Shao Yang.


371
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,280
What a good name.


372
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,710
Not bad.


373
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,670
Where is that lad?


374
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,980
He has gone missing in a blink of an eye.


375
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,820
Si Qi!


376
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,950
Shao Yang!


377
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,980
Si Qi!


378
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,820
It was so dangerous.


379
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,190
I have the same thought.


380
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,590
I am so scared.


381
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,350
Si Qi.


382
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,800
Where did you go?


383
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,190
I struggled a lot looking for you.


384
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,980
I went to see Chief Song.


385
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,710
Then, I heard that my dad was coming.


386
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,700
I planned to leave.


387
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,700
However, I want to see you
for the one last time.


388
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,430
I was waiting for you every night
at this place


389
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,510
but you never appeared.


390
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,680
You were here on that night.


391
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,110
Am I right?


392
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,640
I come here to see you


393
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,280
but when I see you,


394
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,590
I feel really reluctant to leave.


395
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,700
I struggled a lot looking for you.


396
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,030
In order to hide away from my dad,


397
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,920
I could only push my luck
at the warehouse.


398
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,680
I went to that warehouse.


399
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,270
Why didn't I see you?


400
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
I am sorry.


401
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,340
Sorry to have made you worried.


402
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,100
I can't blame you.


403
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,110
Ever since I met your dad,


404
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,680
I can totally understand your feelings.


405
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,110
Your dad is insane.


406
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,950
Si Qi.


407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,470
If your dad found you,


408
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,270
what would he do to you?


409
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,270
He would turn me into


410
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,340
a heartless servant.


411
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,980
A heartless servant?


412
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,590
His escort...


413
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,580
How foolish.


414
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,760
I am surprised that you tried to run away.


415
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,470
Are you not willing to serve me?


416
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,630
Am I so scary?


417
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,870
I won't do it again.


418
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,990
Please pardon me.


419
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,030
Look at me.


420
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,460
Come here.


421
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,440
Master Xie.


422
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,700
Please pardon me.


423
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,710
What a handsome looking face.


424
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,220
You look good when you smile.


425
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,020
Here, give me a smile.


426
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,750
The smile doesn't look good.


427
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,010
Give me another smile.


428
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,510
Your smile is hideous. Try again.


429
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,870
Please pardon me, Master Xie.


430
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,350
Please pardon me.


431
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,710
You don't even know how to smile!


432
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,510
What can your brain do?


433
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,270
Please pardon me, Master Xie.


434
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,470
Please pardon me.


435
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,180
If you can't smile from the heart,
why do you need a heart?


436
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,390
His name is Mo He.


437
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,870
He was my dad's bodyguard.


438
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,180
He was vicious.


439
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,710
He was the cream of the Eight Extreme
Temple warriors.


440
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,230
How could he?


441
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,460
After he became a heartless man,


442
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,990
his spiritual power remained the same


443
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,820
but he did not care.


444
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,630
He is always at the commander's service.


445
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,020
If he were told to murder someone,


446
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,870
he would do it.


447
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,590
If he were told to commit suicide,


448
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,990
he would do it.


449
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,260
Is there no cure?


450
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,470
Only the commander can cure him.


451
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,140
Shao Yang.


452
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,990
I can't stay any longer.


453
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,750
I will put you in trouble.


454
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,660
Even if I die,


455
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,900
they will find my body.


456
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,660
It will eventually put you into trouble.


457
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,060
Si Qi.


458
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,300
I am sorry.


459
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,270
Lang Xie said that


460
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,510
he will promote me.


461
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,750
When I am dead,


462
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,230
you must destroy my body.


463
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,110
You must not let my dad find any body part
of me, including my finger.


464
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,300
I will pretend that I am falling asleep.


465
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,780
I will be in your arms


466
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,300
and take an eternal nap.


467
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,900
Well done.


468
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,510
It is indeed well done.


469
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,230
What a bitter lover.


470
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,230
It makes my heart leap.


471
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,060
I almost cried.


472
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,590
Du Shao Yang.


473
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,110
You are chicken-hearted.


474
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,750
How can you be the successor of
the Bloody Spear Guard?


475
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,750
Jing Xuan.


476
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,820
No.


477
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,510
You are known as Tang Si Qi here, right?


478
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,540
Si Qi.


479
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,270
Dad.


480
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,020
Can you let us go?


481
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,230
I am not hungry. I don't want to eat.


482
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,990
At the first instance,


483
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,470
I recognized your voice.


484
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,810
I was thinking


485
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,270
my daughter faked her death.


486
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,530
What a great episode.


487
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,540
I have to be part of the episode.


488
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,900
So, I waited outside the warehouse.


489
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,300
However, you didn't come out.


490
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,650
I have no other way


491
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,990
but to lure you out.


492
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,110
I saw you running and walking around.


493
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,750
I felt really sorry for you.


494
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,020
I was such an evil.


495
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,350
My own daughter


496
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,470
is terrified of me.


497
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,990
In the end, this lad came out


498
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,270
and got you out of the trouble.


499
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,710
I got puzzled. Could it be


500
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,990
you and this lad got engaged
without permission?


501
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,870
Don't do that!


502
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,300
You are getting bolder.


503
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,180
Please spare him, dad.


504
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,590
It's my fault.


505
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,300
I will let go of him


506
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,510
but I won't let go of you.


507
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,350
Si Qi!


508
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,390
Do you want her to come back?


509
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,110
Do you want to marry her?


510
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,540
It's over.


511
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,710
Look.


512
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
What is that?


513
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,350
Isn't that Thunderbolt Formation
that I use during cultivation?


514
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,170
Why did it become like this?


515
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,580
This is...


516
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,630
A Teleportation Formation.


517
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,230
I can recognize this crystal.


518
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,870
It is the Nightmare Crystal
of the Nether Realm.


519
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,230
When we were in the Nether Realm,


520
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,750
through the power of the
Nightmare Crystal,


521
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,180
I saw...


522
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,780
I saw you and her...


523
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,870
If I am not mistaken,


524
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,820
the Dark Nether Beasts
escaped from the Abyss


525
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,620
but they didn't go anywhere


526
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,750
as there was an agenda.


527
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,460
Through the power of Nightmare Crystal,


528
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,230
they've changed the Thunderbolt Formation
into a Teleportation Formation.


529
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,630
They used their life force to
charge the portal.


530
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,540
Nightmare Crystal


531
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,420
is an essential component


532
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,420
of a Teleportation Formation.


533
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,710
What should we do?


534
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,020
Should we destroy it?


535
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,180
The portal is not fully opened yet.


536
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,780
I think it is still lacking something.


537
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,170
What is it?


538
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,820
I am not sure.


539
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,540
I need to ask my dad.


540
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,540
Look, what is that?


541
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,860
Qin Lie!


542
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,860
The evil force is strong.


543
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,030
I think


544
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,460
there is some hidden information in it.


545
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,830
Can you open it?


546
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,230
Let me try.


547
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,470
Sage.


548
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,380
Like you asked, I brought you
the first volume


549
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,830
of the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


550
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,860
However, those who are not
royalty of the Nether Tribe


551
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,620
can't cultivate it.


552
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,310
If it is cultivated by a foreign tribe,


553
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,830
the cultivator will be killed.


554
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,780
I heard a voice.


555
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,340
Who are the Royalty of the Nether Tribe?


556
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,380
What is the Scripture of the Nine Hells?


557
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,750
The Royalty of the Nether Tribe


558
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,020
is the common master of
all the tribes in Nether Realm.


559
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,570
They are the royal family.


560
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,180
Even the Evil God obeys them.


561
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,060
The Scripture of the Nine Hells
is their secret incantation.


562
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,030
In that case,


563
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,300
the Sage


564
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,990
must have found the
Royalty of the Nether Tribe.


565
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,860
That's why he was looking
for the scripture.


566
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,420
The messenger said "you humans."


567
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,030
It means


568
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,340
the Sage is a human, too.


569
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,070
If that is the case,


570
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,510
why did he help his enemies


571
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,180
to attack his own people?


572
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,070
The Scripture of the Nine Hells


573
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,100
has three volumes in total.


574
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,570
It is the source of all secret powers
in the Nether Realm.


575
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,710
Even the secret power possessed by
the Evil God


576
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,580
derived from the scripture.


577
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,620
He was looking for the first volume
of the scripture.


578
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,830
It means the royal bloodline of
the Nether Tribe has awakened.


579
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,300
As long as we found...


580
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,750
Song Ting Yu, what are you doing?


581
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,340
The scripture is written in


582
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,510
the ancient language of the Nether Realm.


583
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,550
It means


584
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,830
the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


585
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,310
You are part of
Royalty of the Nether Tribe.


586
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
You absorbed the demon aura from her body.


587
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,380
Yes.


588
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,470
Why didn't you tell me?


589
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,410
That is because I was scared.


590
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,580
Even if so,


591
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,460
it doesn't mean that she is part of
the Royalty of the Nether Tribe.


592
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,990
Back in the Abyss,


593
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,650
I was confused.


594
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,180
The Abyss was full of demon aura.


595
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,100
I was attacked by the demon aura
as I was injured.


596
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,340
It was only reasonable.


597
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,550
Qin Lie had Demon Cleansing Pills.


598
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,380
He could fight off the demon aura.


599
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,750
That was reasonable too.


600
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,170
However, you, on the other hand,


601
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,230
after absorbing so much demon aura,


602
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,990
nothing happened to you.


603
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,660
So, I observed you in secret


604
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,620
until we are back to the ground.


605
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,030
How ridiculous.


606
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,580
Even in that case,


607
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,550
it can be explained in some other ways!


608
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,790
The Scripture of the Nine Hells
is connected to her.


609
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,660
It recognizes her as its master.


610
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,170
How can it be justified?


611
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,230
Let go of us first.


612
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,230
No way.


613
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,460
Before we found out the truth,


614
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,330
no one is allowed to leave.


615
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,980
Qin Lie.


616
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,030
What she said


617
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,140
might be true.


618
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,380
When we were in the Abyss,


619
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,270
I was puzzled too.


620
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,310
After absorbing so much of demon aura,


621
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,550
I didn't feel uncomfortable.


622
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,180
In contrast, I felt at ease.


623
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,030
However, am I really
the Royalty of the Nether Tribe?


624
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,710
I am not sure.


625
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,750
I only know that


626
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,070
even since I joined Qisha Valley


627
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,510
and started cultivating with the
Heavenly Water Spirit Record,


628
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,860
part of me has changed.


629
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,990
I became more sensitive
towards evil power.


630
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,860
Sometimes,


631
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,340
my hair and eyes turned purple.


632
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,650
Why didn't you tell me about that?


633
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,790
I don't want you to worry.


634
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,060
Furthermore, I asked my master before.


635
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,470
She said that it usually happened
during cultivation.


636
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,860
I believe that you are not lying.


637
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,940
Since you trust her,


638
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,510
why don't you let go of her?


639
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,260
Don't forget that
Yu Shi saved your life before.


640
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,340
I know.


641
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,330
I never forgot her kindness.


642
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,900
However,


643
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,410
I still suspect that she is part of
the Royalty of the Nether Tribe.


644
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,140
Before I found out the truth,


645
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,940
you won't run away, right?


646
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,070
No.


647
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,620
I really want to know


648
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,300
what is going on.


649
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,900
I have a request.


650
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,100
Before we found out the truth,


651
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,990
don't tell Song Yu about this.


652
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,550
Sure, I promise.


653
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,310
However, the Scripture of the Nine Hells


654
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,550
will be kept in my possession.


655
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,660
Ting Yu?
