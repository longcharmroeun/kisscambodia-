[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,039
[Episode 22]


4
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,310
It's been a while, Master Lang Xie.


5
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,090
News from the Purple Mist Sea


6
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,890
said that you're all safe.


7
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,300
Qin Lie.


8
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,470
I've heard that you have a charmed life.


9
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,050
So it's true.


10
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,330
Qin Lie.


11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,930
Why did you take the
Spiritual Lines Pillars?


12
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,229
From what I know,


13
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,830
the Spiritual Lines Pillars
don't belong to you


14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,760
but the Artefact Forging Sect.


15
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,730
Nonsense!


16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,250
The Spiritual Lines Pillars
had been with us


17
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,050
since the beginning of our sect.


18
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,920
I won't listen to your rubbish.


19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm occupied.


20
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,460
How dare you?


21
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,990
You're not the sect master, Qin Lie.


22
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,440
On Chief Song's orders,


23
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,240
the Artefact Forging Sect


24
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,840
had been passed to Master Ying.


25
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,720
You joined the Profound Heaven Alliance.


26
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,480
Never mind.


27
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,930
I have no time for you.


28
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,620
Hand the pillars out!


29
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,720
Take them from me if you can.


30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,810
Saintess Song.


31
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,110
Please help the Artefact Forging Sect.


32
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,500
This is your internal affair.


33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,740
I can't help you, nor do I have the time.


34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,050
I have only one question.


35
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,000
Is Jiu Liu Yu of the Qisha Valley
still here?


36
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,680
Saintess.


37
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,450
Master Jiu Liu Yu


38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,990
was assassinated last night.


39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,860
[Tea]


40
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,370
Jiu Liu Yu's death was suspicious.


41
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,180
Indeed.


42
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,500
Seems like there's a great secret on you.


43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,520
That's why someone wanted to kill you.


44
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,490
Senior Li Zhong Zheng must know about it.


45
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,790
They're back at the Qisha Valley.


46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,780
I'll go back and ask them.


47
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,180
Are you planning to escape?


48
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,860
I need to inform


49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,540
my father about the portal.


50
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,430
Don't think of running away.


51
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,070
Otherwise, I'll reveal the truth.


52
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,410
Then,


53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,230
you'll be hunted by every sect.


54
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,690
You'll have nowhere to go


55
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,370
in the entire Chilan Continent.


56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,540
How can a portal exist in the


57
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,190
herb mountain at the Ling Borough?


58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,530
We can't be certain that it's just
the herb mountain.


59
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,790
Who placed the Scripture of the
Nine Hells there?


60
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,680
Who was it prepared for?


61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,450
Who was the Sage?


62
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,440
Chief, the message said that the


63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,540
Scripture of the Nine Hells


64
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,880
will combine with the Nether
Realm's royal blood.


65
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,100
What's different


66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,740
with the Royal Nether Race?


67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,550
The God Race,


68
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,220
Bo Tian.


69
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,920
Ting Yu.


70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,910
The powerful Bo Tian Tribe claimed
themselves as gods.


71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,330
When they attacked 30, 000 years ago,


72
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,420
the royals led the Abyss


73
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,470
and various human races to fight.


74
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,760
The war lasted for more
than thousand years.


75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,380
Many great masters were killed.


76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,010
These were the histories


77
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,600
written in ancient scriptures.


78
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,400
Chief, I've read a book about it.


79
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,910
The Royal Nether Race had
purple hair and eyes.


80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,850
Is it true?


81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,350
The Tale of Gong Mu Lie?


82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,410
When will you stop your obsession?


83
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,980
I'm not obsessed!


84
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,530
You're the Saintess.


85
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,120
You've shamed us


86
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,140
from falling into the Abyss


87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,610
and got poisoned by the demon aura.


88
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,920
Brother, the Nether underground
is a dangerous place.


89
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,600
Ting Yu was capable to leave unscathed.


90
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,300
Where's Qin Lie?


91
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,880
Why didn't you bring him here?


92
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,250
He was preoccupied.


93
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,260
I'm waiting for a chance.


94
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,890
I don't want your explanation!


95
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,470
If he could manage to


96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,890
tame the twelve Spiritual Lines Pillars,


97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,000
he must join my forces!


98
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,940
Kill him if he refuse!


99
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,180
Yes.


100
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,670
You're tired.


101
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,040
Get some sleep.


102
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,320
You have plenty of things to do.


103
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,040
Leave me be.


104
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,710
Nothing is more important than you.


105
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,820
How can I compare myself to the
crisis of Chilan Continent?


106
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,360
Qin Lie.


107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,350
I know you're worried that
Song Ting Yu would harm me.


108
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,150
But I trust her.


109
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,010
Before the truth is found,


110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
she won't do anything to me.


111
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,310
You believe her,


112
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,850
but I don't.


113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,310
This woman is a hard nut to crack.


114
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,190
How is she hard to crack?


115
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,470
She likes you.


116
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,450
You're too kind, Yu Shi.


117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,090
Everything she said or does


118
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,080
are all her conspiracies.


119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,840
Besides, I only care


120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,420
about you.


121
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,100
Yu Shi.


122
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm sorry.


123
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,720
We were underground for so long and


124
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,760
I didn't see that the aura
doesn't affect you.


125
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,500
It's obvious that I have neglected you.


126
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,960
In your heart,


127
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,560
I'm not a reliable person.


128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,860
That must be why you're being secretive.


129
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,860
I didn't tell you


130
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,930
to spare you from worrying.


131
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,659
So what for purple hair and eyes?


132
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,820
Even if you're a nether demon,


133
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,820
your enemies


134
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,340
are my enemies.


135
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,550
If the whole Chilan Continent
becomes your enemy,


136
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,500
I'll be enemies with the whole
Chilan Continent.


137
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,920
You can't speak like that.


138
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,290
The consequences will be severe.


139
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,810
Besides, don't feel guilty for me...


140
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,910
It's not guilt.


141
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm willing to do this


142
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,100
for you.


143
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,290
That's enough for me.


144
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,290
Qin Lie.


145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,620
Senior Feng Rong met with a mishap.


146
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,790
Master Mo Hai had to suppress his sadness


147
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,420
to cultivate more magic tools.


148
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,530
Check on him


149
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,730
and see if you can help.


150
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,890
You should follow me.


151
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,169
I can't leave you alone.


152
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm tired.


153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,410
I need some rest.


154
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,000
Come back soon when you can.


155
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,270
Master Mo Hai.


156
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,550
You're back?


157
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm waiting for you.


158
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,420
Yes?


159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,860
Master Lang Xie.


160
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,180
Saintess Song.


161
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,090
Do you know where Qin Lie is?


162
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,430
I saw him speaking to Mo Hai.


163
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,770
[Zhao Xi.]


164
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,100
[If I can return safely,]


165
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,920
[I might fight with your people in turn.]


166
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,250
[Don't you regret saving me?]


167
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,040
[I should've killed you]


168
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,430
[or take you in for a reward.]


169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,160
[But I can't do it.]


170
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,680
[Miss Yu Shi.]


171
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,270
[The Dark Nether Race]


172
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,600
[is not as wicked as you think.]


173
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,200
Remember, I'm Zhao Xi.


174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,990
This spiritual herb


175
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,530
is the Nether Devil Fruit.


176
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,340
Like me, i had never seen sunlight before.


177
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,370
When you return to the ground,


178
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,180
can you place it under the sun


179
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,470
and call out my name?


180
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,970
Perhaps that way,


181
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,910
I can feel the warmth of the sun too.


182
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,850
Zhao Xi.


183
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,240
Who is it?


184
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,300
Where is Qin Lie?


185
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,330
He went to Master Mo Hai.


186
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,750
I want to speak to you.


187
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,490
I see that you're close


188
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,980
to that Zhao Xi.


189
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,100
He saved me.


190
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,070
And he was kind to me.


191
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,510
Seems like we had different encounters
underground.


192
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,570
The Dark Nether Race I met


193
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,650
were all cruel murderers
of the human race.


194
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,910
I didn't see that.


195
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,930
They were like us.


196
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,060
They were kind and desired peace.


197
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,010
They dreamed to lead a better life.


198
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,250
Did you forget that Zhao Xi


199
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,050
wanted to kill me?


200
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,190
That was because you
killed his family and friends.


201
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,620
No one is completely good or evil.


202
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,530
If we massacre each other for
various motives,


203
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,740
goodness will ultimately turn evil.


204
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,160
We think that the Dark Nether Race is evil


205
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,270
but we are the evildoers


206
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,000
in their perspective.


207
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,260
Seems like you do empathize them.


208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
If you're the Royal Nether Race,


209
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,170
will you join forces with them


210
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,890
and fight the human race?


211
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,660
Are you sounding me out?


212
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,020
I'm merely asking.


213
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,580
I don't care if I'm human


214
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,690
or the Royal Nether Race.


215
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,200
I blame myself for being too weak.


216
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,320
If I'm invincible,


217
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,400
I can dissolve the enmity myself.


218
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,260
When I found out


219
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,680
we were allies with the Nether Race,


220
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,840
I shared the same thought as you.


221
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,650
But the Nether War lasted so long


222
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,500
which intensified our feud.


223
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,000
I had no way


224
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,760
to dissolve it.


225
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,270
But you're the Saintess.


226
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm a useless daughter of my father.


227
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
My title as the Saintess


228
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,020
has no actual affect.


229
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,060
Besides, it's too late now.


230
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,040
Master Mo Hai


231
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,810
had made plenty of Terminator
Profound Bombs.


232
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,170
Tomorrow morning,


233
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,550
my father will wage war
on the Dark Nether Race.


234
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,650
So fast?


235
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,800
With countless Terminator Profound Bombs,


236
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,420
the Dark Nether Race won't


237
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,580
be able to survive wherever they hide.


238
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,780
My father was delighted.


239
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,110
So he planned to held a feast tonight


240
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,960
to celebrate his victory tomorrow.


241
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,090
I knew you would come.


242
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,300
You plotted against me?


243
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,500
So,


244
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,920
these Terminator Profound Bombs


245
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,410
are fake?


246
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,850
Capture her.


247
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,120
How dare you!


248
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,250
You summoned me late at night


249
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,320
with a thorough plan.


250
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,470
I lied that the Terminator Profound
Bombs were made


251
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,370
and we'll fight the Dark Nether
Race tomorrow.


252
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,220
I wanted to see


253
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,850
her reaction.


254
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,350
As expected,


255
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,020
you're a Royal Nether Race.


256
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,810
Royal Nether Race?


257
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,750
Impossible.


258
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,690
The Royal Nether Race was eliminated


259
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,310
few thousand years ago.


260
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,290
Legend says that the Royal Nether Race
had purple hair and eyes.


261
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,620
Ling Yu Shi, you once said


262
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,300
that your hair and eyes would turn purple,


263
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,440
right?


264
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,570
Miss Ling, you...


265
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,680
You're a Royal Nether Race?


266
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,600
Master Mo Hai.


267
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,320
I'm not sure if I'm of
the Royal Nether Race.


268
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,700
It's not important to me.


269
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,180
I grew up in the the far north.


270
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,070
I spoke the human language and


271
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,050
practised the human spirit art.


272
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,040
The spiritual herbs I planted
were for human use too.


273
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,090
No matter if I'm human


274
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,670
or demon,


275
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,270
I refuse to see wars between the tribes.


276
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,510
We're not killing each other.


277
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,670
They were brutal lots.


278
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,579
Master Lang Xie.


279
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,960
If you had to live


280
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,890
underground and never see daylight,


281
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,260
how would you feel?


282
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,530
A Nether Race youngster saved me


283
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,170
when I fell into the netherworld.


284
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,910
What I saw and felt


285
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,370
was different than how we imagined.


286
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,310
We're merely different


287
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,510
in our origins.


288
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,010
They have emotions.


289
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,750
They want to live in peace too.


290
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,060
Yu Shi.


291
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,700
What is your plan after


292
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,190
stealing the bombs?


293
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,140
I'll hide them.


294
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,740
Then I'll try to appease


295
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,800
everyone's hatred.


296
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,370
You may think that I'm naive.


297
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,050
We do not know how much power we possess.


298
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,600
No one can determine


299
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,200
what we can achieve


300
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,740
or not achieve.


301
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,520
What do you plan to do?


302
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,170
Qin Lie, you saw her stealing...


303
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,880
I asked what your plan was.


304
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,410
I'll hand Ling Yu Shi to my father.


305
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,130
Good.


306
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,900
Keep them apart!
Qin Lie has a space magic tool!


307
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,330
The peak of Manifestation Realm?


308
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,450
You've levelled up again after a few days.


309
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,910
Don't lose yourself, kid!


310
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,310
He absorbed the power


311
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,380
of the thunder pool in the
Evil God Mountains.


312
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,660
He formed his energy source with my help.


313
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,080
Qin Lie, listen to Master Lang Xie!


314
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,320
Don't lose yourself!


315
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,500
Qin Lie!


316
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,570
Leave me here! Go!


317
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,980
You want to trap me?


318
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,170
Try me!


319
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,780
Qin Lie! You traitor!


320
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,040
Move, Master Lang Xie! I'll kill him!


321
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,420
You let them off on purpose!


322
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,520
How dare you?


323
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,930
I asked you to move!


324
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,980
Why should I move?


325
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,300
I almost got them!


326
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,970
You would've got them if you could!


327
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,690
I was scared that they would escape!


328
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,780
Stop arguing.


329
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,160
Elder Mo Hai, why didn't you attack them?


330
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,860
Yu Shi.


331
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,270
Did I scare you?


332
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,260
No.


333
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,680
I was too agitated


334
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,370
and felt that my hair and eyes
were changing.


335
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,040
I contained it


336
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,080
in fear that they would see me.


337
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,700
So what if they see you?


338
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,940
You look prettier


339
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,570
like this.


340
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,560
Is it worth it to anger the human race


341
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,230
for me?


342
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,130
If I'm really a Royal Nether Race,


343
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,520
won't you blame me for stealing the bombs


344
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,060
to help the Abyss?


345
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,130
I don't care who you are.


346
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,080
You're always my Ling Yu Shi.


347
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,200
But you're wrong to steal the


348
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
Terminator Profound Bombs.


349
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,140
You should've asked me to do it.


350
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,960
You can stay in your room


351
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,880
and wait for me to retrieve them.


352
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,940
Yu Shi.


353
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,320
If you're really a Royal Nether Race,


354
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,950
what would you do?


355
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,040
I'll accept myself as a Royal Nether Race


356
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,590
If I truly am one.


357
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,680
But it doesn't mean that
I'll submit to my fate.


358
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,820
Right?


359
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,300
Yes.


360
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,040
If I'm a Royal Nether Race,


361
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,360
would my father


362
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,520
and everyone in the Ling Borough...


363
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,120
People of the Ling Borough
are in Qisha Valley!


364
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,930
Would they be in danger?


365
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,170
We'll go right away!


366
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,210
Song Ting Yu would've guessed it.


367
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,890
But the Qisha Valley is too far from here.


368
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,290
We might not make it.


369
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,150
We can.


370
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,540
This is?


371
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,620
I planned ahead of Song Ting Yu.


372
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,510
That's why I made a magic tool


373
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,180
at the Artefact Forging Sect.


374
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,560
I failed many times
before I finally got it.


375
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,200
Let's go.


376
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,790
Why did no one tell me about Ling Yu Shi


377
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,510
being the Royal Nether Race?


378
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,270
I wanted to prove it.


379
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,130
You should let your father prove it.


380
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,680
What to do now that things
turned out this way?


381
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,530
It's so awkward.


382
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,380
Your father would be angry later.


383
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,690
Chief.


384
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,580
Qin Lie will bring Ling Yu Shi back


385
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,770
to Qisha Valley.


386
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,040
Please allow me to make amends


387
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,950
and bring men to the Qisha Valley.


388
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,640
Grand Priestess.


389
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,900
Why are you here, Grand Priestess?


390
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,320
On the holy ritual of the Holy Gods,


391
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,630
I sensed a peculiar spiritual energy.


392
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,140
If I was right,


393
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,040
the owner of the spiritual power


394
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,650
belongs to the Royal Nether Race.


395
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,890
The royals are back?


396
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,220
It was said that the Royal Nether Race
had perished


397
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,710
in the war with the God Race.


398
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,620
But we had hoped


399
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,240
for the royal bloodline
to exist in the world.


400
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,230
If it was,


401
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,600
it would be our time to rise again.


402
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,070
The king of the Gods,


403
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,770
the Royal Nether Race!


404
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,140
North!


405
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,600
-Fight!
-Yes!


406
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,980
Fight!


407
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,700
Go!


408
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,320
Bring the royal bloodline back safely!


409
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,790
Yes!


410
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,830
[Qisha Valley Village]


411
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,790
They have been inside the whole time?


412
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,240
I asked the disciples taking care of them.


413
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,800
They didn't show up lately.


414
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,600
The Profound Heaven Alliance
ordered to kill.


415
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,730
Ling Yu Shi is a Royal Nether Race.


416
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,490
No one in the Ling Borough


417
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,160
shall be spared.


418
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,590
-Do it.
-Yes!


419
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,960
Hide!


420
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,770
Ling Ying!


421
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,650
Ling Ying,


422
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,030
I'm back.


423
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,270
Yu Shi.


424
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,340
Are we really the Dark Nether Race?


425
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,530
[Sage of the Nether Tribe]


426
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,670
[Mirror of Souls, Jungle of Gems]


427
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,470
[Ten thousand years ago,]


428
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,180
[our people and the human race]


429
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,130
[lived together in this spirit realm.]


430
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,200
[We divided the lands to north and west.]


431
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,100
[The West belonged to the
Nether Continent.]


432
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,300
[It was the most mysterious]


433
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,560
[and magical land in the spirit realm.]


434
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,520
[Sunlight and rain nurtured our people,]


435
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,990
[nourished the land and
cultivated spiritual gems.]


436
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,950
[Our people and the human
race kept in contact]


437
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,530
[by sharing cultivation materials
and co-lived in harmony.]


438
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,730
[We kept peace together.]


439
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,100
The Nether Tribe was ruled
by the Royal Nether Race.


440
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,530
[When the God Race attacked us
ten thousand years ago,]


441
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,680
[we fought together with the human race


442
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,880
[and exterminated them.]


443
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:49,250
[But the Royal Nether Race
perished in the war.]


444
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,450
[We lost our stronghold,]


445
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,060
which caused confusion and
distress among our people.


446
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,210
Aside from this tragedy,
the human race prospered.


447
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,050
The human race couldn't survive


448
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,170
on the Eastern Lands.


449
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,460
Therefore,


450
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,400
they began to exploit the
lands of the west.


451
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,490
[Our ally became our enemy.]


452
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,710
[Finally, we lost greatly.]


453
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,990
[The human race forced us
to the underground.]


454
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,640
[Sunlight was never seen in the Abyss.]


455
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,490
Water was scarce.


456
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,010
We used up our resources within a year.


457
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,500
Our people began to lose themselves


458
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,960
as they lived in great darkness.


459
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,130
[Gradually, they became monsters.]


460
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,300
I was the last Sage


461
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,460
of the Royal Nether Race
3,000 years ago.


462
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,710
I strongly believe


463
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,130
that the Royal Nether Race


464
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,630
would never cease to exist.


465
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,449
Therefore, I leave my remnants of powers


466
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,400
in the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


467
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,719
If the bloodline of the Royal Nether Race
survived,


468
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,460
[the Scripture of the Nine Hells
will find them.]


469
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,370
[And they need to know that]


470
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,170
[the Nether Tribe of the past]


471
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,940
[were all benign beings who
appreciated the world]


472
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,469
[and dreamed of peace and love.]


473
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,980
Are we done with the nonsense?


474
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,960
Let's stop standing here.


475
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,580
Let's fight!


476
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,580
Attack!


477
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,290
I want some wine!


478
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,590
Hold me captive! Hurry!


479
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,900
I'll kill her if you don't stop!


480
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
Palm of Great God!


481
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,340
Spare them, Brother Xie.


482
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,040
Xie Yi!


483
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,050
That was fun! Let's continue!


484
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,460
Hurry and leave!


485
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,860
The Saintess is in my hands!


486
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,960
Back down!


487
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,250
Back!


488
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,310
Just a pretence.


489
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,380
She saved us.


490
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,350
I didn't know why you did it,


491
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,290
but I thank you.


492
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,400
Hail to the Queen!


493
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,880
Hail to the Queen!


494
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,520
I'm the Queen?


495
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,590
Now that the Scripture of the Nine Hells


496
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,870
acknowledged its master,


497
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,830
you shall become the new Queen.


498
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,070
You're willing to acknowledge me?


499
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,870
This is heaven's will.


500
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,340
We'll oblige to it


501
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,110
and see you as our ruler.


502
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,110
I always thought I was human.


503
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,270
I grew up as a human.


504
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,610
I drank their water,


505
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,070
ate their food,


506
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,310
and made friends with them.


507
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,080
Only now I know


508
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,830
that I'm a Royal Nether Race.


509
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,110
I won't avoid my identity.


510
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Are you willing to take the risk


511
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,600
and believe in me?


512
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,050
Yes!


513
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,650
Yes!


514
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,700
Rise, everyone.


515
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,920
We're all equal.


516
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,190
You don't have to kneel for me.


517
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,720
I know my existence


518
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,570
brought you hope.


519
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,100
I don't know how much I can change
the current situation.


520
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,340
But I'll try my best.


521
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,900
I hope I can bring my people


522
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,360
back to the world filled
with love and peace.


523
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,780
There shall be no war


524
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,890
and no hatred.


525
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:31,170
Good!


526
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,570
The Mother of Lands can contain
everything!


527
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,030
The Mother of Lands?


528
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,410
The highest monarchy of the
Royal Nether Race


529
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,270
shall be the Mother of Lands!


530
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,640
What should we do with the two humans?


531
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,860
What's with that look?


532
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,980
Are you scared that we'll be different?


533
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,230
Will we?


534
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,910
I only know that


535
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,850
no matter you're the Queen


536
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,740
or a disciple of the Qisha Valley,


537
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,290
you're my Ling Yu Shi.


538
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,240
And I'm your Qin Lie.


539
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,630
Of course.


540
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,940
I'm Qin Lie.


541
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,960
I killed your people before.


542
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,320
However,


543
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,180
you killed plenty of my people too.


544
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,950
I don't know


545
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,710
if we could become friends


546
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,210
and end our feud.


547
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,890
However, I promise that


548
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,140
Ling Yu Shi is my utmost importance


549
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,560
besides my grandfather.


550
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,850
I'll fight anyone


551
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,780
who stands against her.


552
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,190
Including everyone here!


553
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,530
Good!


554
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,190
What about her?


555
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,640
The Saintess of the Alliance.


556
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,520
If we're putting down hatred


557
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,310
and asking for peace,


558
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,480
we shall stop our massacre.


559
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,040
Besides, she saved us.


560
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,850
We'll release her.


561
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,400
