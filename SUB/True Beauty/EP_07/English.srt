1
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:38,364
Ryu Hyung Jin, the top
pitcher for Seonil High.

2
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,934
His win-loss record this
season is at 6 to 0...

3
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,705
and he has the lowest
ERA this season.

4
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,044
Strike one.

5
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,385
2 balls, 2 strikes.

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,915
Strikeout!

7
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,385
- What's the current status?
- 2 outs in the bottom of the 9th.

8
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:57,824
The teams are tied at 5 to 5.

9
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,595
Ryu Hyung Jin throws
the ball... Hold on.

10
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:03,895
Is something the
matter with him?

11
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,765
The screen isn't
at a pause, is it?

12
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:09,705
What... What's gotten into him?

13
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:18,774
A strike.

14
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,845
Straight at my heart.

15
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:32,354
- Hi.
- Hello.

16
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:35,254
- Hello.
- Mr. Han!

17
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:36,524
Looking good today, Mr. Han.

18
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,925
- The light's bouncing off you.
- You look so cool.

19
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,065
You're looking as good as ever.

20
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:42,664
Your classroom's that way.

21
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,504
We know.

22
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:46,974
- Anyway...
- You look awesome today.

23
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,175
Have a good day!

24
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,744
This is all thanks to
Hee Kyung's mother.

25
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,685
I mean, Ju Kyung's mother.

26
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,494
How can she not have called
during the time it took...

27
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,235
for my eyebrows to settle?

28
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,765
Is kiss a joke to you?

29
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,575
- Do my lips... Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Han.

30
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:25,105
Yes, hello. Yes,
this is Han Joon Woo.

31
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:27,475
Lower, I said.
Squat lower, boys.

32
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,114
- Do it properly.
- Good morning.

33
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,355
Had the karaoke owner called,

34
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,825
you would be off to
a new school by now.

35
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,355
- Get it?
- It wasn't us, sir.

36
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,554
Who else from this school...

37
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:43,594
would engage in a fistfight?

38
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,834
I dare you to bring them to me.

39
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,635
It really wasn't us, sir.

40
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,505
- It wasn't us.
- It wasn't us.

41
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,735
Did you just curse at me?

42
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,005
It was me!

43
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,445
I was the one who
engaged in that fight.

44
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,175
Seo Jun?

45
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,214
I was just about
to call for you.

46
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,814
Stand next to
them. You've got...

47
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:07,214
to be kidding me. Squat down.

48
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:11,255
- Seo Jun...
- Was it really you?

49
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:12,355
Quiet!

50
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,825
- The brawl...
- We were part of it too.

51
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,594
- What?
- Kids?

52
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,895
So much for looking
sweet and innocent.

53
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,594
Squat next to them. Right now!

54
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,534
Settle next to them
and squat down.

55
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:27,635
Squat down! Unbelievable.

56
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,404
What will become of you all?

57
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,445
I was there too.

58
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:36,814
I see it was a colossal mess.

59
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:38,344
Unbelievable.

60
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:41,755
I'm the one who
started that fight.

61
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:43,784
Good going.

62
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:44,784
Good for you.

63
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:47,325
My goodness!

64
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:48,695
You punks!

65
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:52,425
My goodness gracious.

66
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:56,735
Did our top student
get hurt by any chance?

67
00:03:56,964 --> 00:04:01,135
What in the world
did you fools do...

68
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:05,244
to make Soo Ho get
involved in a fight?

69
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,475
Mr. Han Joon Woo.
Mr. Han Joon Woo?

70
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,045
- Yes, that's me.
- Great.

71
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,485
These flowers are for you.

72
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,614
- He got flowers!
- My gosh!

73
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,255
- Flowers?
- Yes.

74
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,094
- Who...
- Oh, it was sent by Lim Hee...

75
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,195
What?

76
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,495
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,895
It's nothing. Yes,
I know who it is.

78
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:29,334
- I think I know who sent it.
- Okay.

79
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:34,505
I want you guys to go to
the counseling office.

80
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:35,505
You...

81
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:36,705
- Yes?
- You guys.

82
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,745
Go to the counseling office.

83
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:41,615
Us?

84
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,284
Did you get the flowers?

85
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,255
Ms. Lim, why did
you send me flowers?

86
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:56,265
Can't a woman send
flowers to a man?

87
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,164
Plus, we even kissed.

88
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,164
- Ms. Lim.
- It's a reeves spirea.

89
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:03,765
A reeves what?

90
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,005
A reeves spirea.

91
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,575
Oh, I see.

92
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,245
The name of the
flower doesn't matter.

93
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,404
Do you know what the
meaning of that flower is?

94
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:14,714
"I'll do my best to you."

95
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,745
I'm doing my best
to make you mine.

96
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,524
So think of me every time
you look at the flowers.

97
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:27,594
I'm off to a business trip
tomorrow. Do you have time tonight?

98
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,424
No, I'm busy.

99
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,895
It's the exam period,
so there's a lot to do.

100
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:33,435
I guess I'm the only one who
can't stop thinking of you.

101
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,104
Do you still not
want to buy shoes?

102
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:39,435
Think about it carefully.

103
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:54,755
I'M SORRY.

104
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:04,765
Are you guys Han
Seok Bong or what?

105
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,395
You guys write
like calligraphers.

106
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:08,234
Why don't you just grind ink?

107
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,635
When are we going to
finish writing 10 pages?

108
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,834
Here. Look.

109
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,904
Look at this. What do you think?

110
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,774
I've done this so many times
that I can write with two hands.

111
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:19,914
What do you think?

112
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:23,445
Babe, they obviously never
wrote this kind of stuff before.

113
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,185
Look.

114
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:34,255
You must be proud.

115
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,654
Sorry, you guys.

116
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:37,865
It's all because of me.

117
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,464
Why are you sorry?

118
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:40,964
Seo Jun.

119
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,604
You should apologize
to Ju Kyung.

120
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:47,104
This happened because they
thought she was your girlfriend.

121
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:50,445
Well... She looks fine.

122
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:52,844
Do you not have legs?

123
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,745
Why didn't you run away?

124
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:57,784
Can't you speak nicely?

125
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,015
Whatever.

126
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:02,924
They won't bother you
again, so don't worry.

127
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,955
By any chance, did you
fight with them again?

128
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:09,455
Why would I fight?

129
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,565
Do you even think they're
good enough to fight me?

130
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,604
I would've beaten
them to a pulp.

131
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,034
- Beat them to a pulp?
- Beat them to a pulp?

132
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:27,544
He's so scary.

133
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:28,815
Let's hurry up.

134
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,615
I'm scared too.

135
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,555
He's so scary.

136
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,224
Soo Ho.

137
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,195
Regardless of our situation,

138
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,305
what you did for my mom
is a different matter.

139
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:52,865
I should still thank
you for what you did.

140
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,274
But from now on, don't
get yourself involved...

141
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,075
in my business.

142
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,825
What? What was that?

143
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,885
I accidentally dozed off.

144
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,565
You dozed off?

145
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:21,734
What's his deal?

146
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:23,964
My gosh.

147
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:32,875
Roar!

148
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:37,615
Hey.

149
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:41,355
- What?
- Try doing that.

150
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:45,284
- Do what?
- Try roaring again.

151
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:47,595
What? Why do you
want me to do that?

152
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:51,164
Roar! Roar!

153
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,395
I'm scared you might
appear in my dreams.

154
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,904
You're like a beast.

155
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:00,735
What's his problem?

156
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:02,934
It's totally absurd.

157
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,745
Are you guys studying
hard for your exams?

158
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,414
Mr. Han, can you reduce the
chapters we have to study?

159
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:10,944
Just a little bit?

160
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,115
- She's right.
- Please, Mr. Han.

161
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:17,554
Some of you don't know what
it is that you really want.

162
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,694
And some of you do know,
but you're hesitant.

163
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,794
But opportunities come
without a warning,

164
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:25,395
and you must be prepared
to take advantage of it.

165
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:29,034
So in order to seize
an opportunity...

166
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,505
- when you see one...
- Mr. Han.

167
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,465
Thank you for your great words.

168
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:33,704
You're the best. Bye.

169
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,444
- Let's go.
- Nice.

170
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,715
Who wants to eat tteokbokki?

171
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:41,444
- Come on.
- Let's go.

172
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,985
You should study hard
for your midterm exams.

173
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:47,885
That's what I wanted to say.

174
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:50,725
That is all.

175
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:21,385
SEOUL

176
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:35,095
SEOUL

177
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,125
- Soo Ho.
- Yes?

178
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:03,324
"Mystery Scenario" just
released a new book.

179
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:06,024
Do you want to go to
Prince Comics with me?

180
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:07,694
- No.
- Okay.

181
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,335
Why is he so busy?

182
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,204
- Ju Kyung.
- Yes?

183
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,444
But the bus will be here soon.

184
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,314
I didn't mean for
you to "get in".

185
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,444
You told me you need
to get better grades.

186
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,015
Meet me at the study cafe
tomorrow so we can study together.

187
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,534
He wants to study with me?

188
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,365
Why?

189
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:55,044
Because I want to be with you.

190
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:57,745
Oh, gosh.

191
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:04,385
I'll see you tomorrow.

192
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,255
Good night.

193
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,694
Good night.

194
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,324
"Good night"?

195
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:14,835
It's only early in the evening,
but you want to sleep already?

196
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,164
Why are you thinking of sleeping
when you should be studying?

197
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:20,404
I was studying.

198
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:23,034
If you don't get
better grades time,

199
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,304
I'll go ahead and throw
away all your makeup.

200
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,274
Okay, I get it.

201
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:29,444
If you want me to study,
stop bothering me.

202
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:05,544
Why is he good-looking
even when he's sleeping?

203
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,314
He makes my heart flutter.

204
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:38,585
I don't want to study.

205
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,954
Why are you sleeping again?

206
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:41,914
I guess you're not
determined to study.

207
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:43,385
Tell me the three
Cheongnokpa poets.

208
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:46,125
1, 2, 3.

209
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,794
You slept during class again.
How will you get your grades up?

210
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,995
He's so scary. Stop
berating the poor girl.

211
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:55,034
You scolded her so much
that she's hiccupping?

212
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:05,544
Do you want to go to a baseball
game after our last exam?

213
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,145
Hyung Jin is playing.

214
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,345
I can't. I have a
tutoring session.

215
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,044
Okay. It was fun last time.

216
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,755
Yes.

217
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,554
Don't tell My Hoonie, okay?

218
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,485
Don't tell me what?

219
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,824
What? Nothing.

220
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,265
Are you planning a surprise?

221
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,064
No. Study.

222
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,735
- Bye.
- Bye.

223
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:36,975
- Bye.
- Get home safely.

224
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,875
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

225
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,485
Why does he look so tired?

226
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,885
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

227
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:48,855
What's your problem?

228
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,694
Ju Kyung. About what happened...

229
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,794
at the karaoke place...

230
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,534
Darn it. I came to apologize.

231
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:04,064
I was trying to say I was sorry.

232
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,735
I apologized, okay?

233
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,574
What's wrong with him?

234
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,574
Why? What... What's going on?

235
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,085
Oh my gosh.

236
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:22,355
Hey. You saw that, right?

237
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,524
I apologized, okay?

238
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:44,274
APOLOGIZE!

239
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:46,674
You punk.

240
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,544
Apologize!

241
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,784
- Apologize! Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

242
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,485
- Apologize! Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

243
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:58,554
- Apologize! Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

244
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:01,625
- Apologize! Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

245
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:04,564
- Apologize! Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

246
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:11,605
Yes.

247
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,635
What the... What happened?

248
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,845
APOLOGIZE!

249
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,414
Why, that little freak.

250
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:28,355
Darn it. I almost had it.

251
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:34,625
I'm home.

252
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:38,024
Did you do something you
need to apologize for?

253
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,194
What?

254
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:55,345
I couldn't sleep because I
kept following him around.

255
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:00,991
I'm glad.

256
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,902
I was nervous that he'd
come back and retaliate.

257
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,961
I can sleep peacefully now.

258
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,902
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

259
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:12,602
- Nice. How lucky.
- Yes!

260
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,372
When will we ever
become college students?

261
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:16,842
Why do they like
drinking so much?

262
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,912
My sister gets wasted
whenever she drinks.

263
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,511
Because it makes you feel good?

264
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:24,082
Have you drunk before?

265
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,322
Yes.

266
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,322
A little of my dad's
liquor late at night?

267
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:32,122
What? Have you never
tasted alcohol?

268
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:36,162
I have this much courage,
so I've never even tried.

269
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:43,671
Okay. Cheers.

270
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,642
Finishing touch.

271
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,681
What do you think?
Do I look older?

272
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:58,322
You totally look like a
college girl. The campus queen.

273
00:17:58,882 --> 00:17:59,882
Silly.

274
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:01,251
I'm thirsty.

275
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:07,392
The professor's lectures
have gotten so boring.

276
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,731
I know. That's right.

277
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,832
What should we do on Monday?
Since there's no lecture.

278
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,832
I don't know. Should we ask
the student representative...

279
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:14,902
to buy us lunch?

280
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:16,372
Sounds good.

281
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,342
ID please.

282
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,142
I forgot my ID.
Do you have yours?

283
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:27,412
I forgot mine too.

284
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:29,882
Can't you just ring us
up? We're in college.

285
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,021
- Which college?
- Hankuk University. Second year.

286
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,582
- Which department?
- English.

287
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,491
I'd like to pay please.

288
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,122
- Who's your homeroom teacher?
- Han Joon Woo.

289
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:38,421
- Ju Kyung.
- Why, you...

290
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:41,662
You punks. You're in
high school, aren't you?

291
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,902
Should I call your
homeroom teacher?

292
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:45,931
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

293
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,171
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

294
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:54,941
I'm getting drunk.

295
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:56,572
That's sweet.

296
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:00,981
That looks great.
It smells good too.

297
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:04,451
How is it?

298
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,122
It's good.

299
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,622
I'm so stupid.

300
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,191
There's no homeroom in college.

301
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:14,862
Oh no.

302
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:17,862
Do you put on hand cream?

303
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,902
- It's okay.
- That must sting.

304
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:23,402
How did that happen?

305
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:26,441
It's because of my habit.

306
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:32,011
I wash my hands like crazy
whenever I'm stressed out.

307
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:34,652
I have to stop, but it's hard.

308
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:37,082
When you're
stressed? About what?

309
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:40,822
What else? It's
because of my grades.

310
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,921
If I got your grades, my
family would worship me.

311
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,632
It hurts my pride, so keep
this to yourself, okay?

312
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,261
You're the first person
I've told this to.

313
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:57,072
Thank you for telling me.

314
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:00,542
Why are you thanking me?

315
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:08,152
Actually, I was a total
outcast in my old school.

316
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:10,481
What?

317
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:14,652
But I'm so happy now because
I have a friend like you.

318
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:16,921
Keep this to yourself, okay?

319
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,721
Cheers.

320
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,201
Cheongnokpa.

321
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,771
They made their appearance
in 1939 and consisted of...

322
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,542
Cho Chi Hun, Pak Tu Jin, and...

323
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:37,441
I almost cracked my head open.

324
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:39,582
Thanks.

325
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:41,711
I was protecting the tree.

326
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,352
It's a solid rock.

327
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,521
What? A rock?

328
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,292
What are you reading?

329
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,731
Don't talk to me. I
can't bomb this exam.

330
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:58,501
Do we have an exam today?

331
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,431
What is that?

332
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,771
Literature.

333
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:05,042
I know you don't care about
school, but this is extreme.

334
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,142
Like you get good grades?

335
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:10,681
Hey, at least I try.

336
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,451
What group were Cho Chi Hun,
Pak Tu Jin, and Park Mok Wol in?

337
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,882
Who cares if it was a
sports team or a music band?

338
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:19,921
You ignoramus. It's
Cheongnokpa. Cheongnokpa.

339
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,792
It'll be on the exam for
sure, so remember it.

340
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,822
And Saengmyungpa came
about to be in the 1930s.

341
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,221
Forget it!

342
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,461
What's your favorite
number from 1 to 5?

343
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:31,662
Three?

344
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:34,102
I'll go with five
for everything.

345
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:55,822
Did you bring a black marker?

346
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,421
No. I borrowed one.

347
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,421
You should've told
me. I brought three.

348
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:00,792
I should've borrowed from you.

349
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:02,562
Did you study a lot?

350
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,132
No. I go with three if
I don't know the answer.

351
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,961
You should go with three too,
if you don't know the answer.

352
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:09,171
No. I can solve them all.

353
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:13,542
Good luck with the
exam. You can do it.

354
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,221
SOLVE FOR THE VARIABLE THAT
SATISFIES THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION.

355
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:33,662
MIDTERM, MATHEMATICS

356
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:54,812
There have never been
candles like this before.

357
00:22:54,812 --> 00:22:56,612
Are these candles
or bars of perfume?

358
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:59,451
Handmade aroma candles
at just nine dollars.

359
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:02,152
- I'll buy one.
- Thank you, ma'am.

360
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,521
I'm loving the scent.

361
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,292
- Isn't it good?
- It sure is.

362
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:07,792
Thank you.

363
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:08,862
Good luck with the rest.

364
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:10,332
We'll buy some other day.

365
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:11,531
- Sure thing.
- I wish you luck.

366
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:16,902
Goodness.

367
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,912
What do you think you're
doing at your wife's shop?

368
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:22,342
I'm earning money.

369
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,142
I earned more than
100 dollars today.

370
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:25,842
Shut that trap.

371
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:28,152
You earned money?

372
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:29,781
How much did you spend
on the materials?

373
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,322
- Five dollars a piece.
- How many did you make?

374
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,122
- 50 since I'm a beginner.
- How many did you sell?

375
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:34,421
About 30 candles.

376
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,021
You spent 250 dollars
to make 270 dollars.

377
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:37,292
And on top of that
classes cost 100 dollars.

378
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,362
Actually, 80 dollars.

379
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:41,332
Factor in the transportation
cost and you're in the red!

380
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,062
You're always in the red.

381
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:45,102
So stop wasting your
time and money...

382
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:47,632
and sit still breathing.

383
00:23:47,632 --> 00:23:48,731
Got it?

384
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:53,642
- Ryu Hyung Jin!
- Ryu Hyung Jin!

385
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:55,042
Ryu Hyung Jin.

386
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:56,711
- Ryu Hyung Jin!
- Ryu Hyung Jin!

387
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,511
- Ryu Hyung Jin!
- Ryu Hyung Jin.

388
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,082
- Ryu Hyung Jin.
- Ryu Hyung Jin!

389
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,112
Strike!

390
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:06,082
What did you tell
Tae Hoon though?

391
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:08,721
That it was my
grandma's 80th birthday.

392
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:10,662
I wish you the best
of health, ma'am!

393
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:13,421
You must've rented out a
baseball stadium for her party.

394
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:14,592
Is this a celebratory game?

395
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:17,701
Did you think I wouldn't know?

396
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,602
Hyung Jin, I'll be at
your semi-final game.

397
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:21,201
Are you stalking me
on my social media?

398
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,201
That's just eerie, you know.

399
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:26,001
- Not so much as you lying to me.
- As if you would've let me go.

400
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,112
Why are you jealous when
I said he's a friend?

401
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:30,612
If I was interested
in him romantically,

402
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:32,941
I would've sent a private message,
not come cheering in public.

403
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,951
Guys, please.
Please don't argue.

404
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,152
I never said I doubted you.

405
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:39,152
But how can I trust him to
only see you as a friend too...

406
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,481
when you're as
pretty as an angel?

407
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,921
How could he not fall for you?

408
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,461
I guess that's true, but...

409
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,931
How can I leave when I
already bought fried chicken?

410
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:50,431
How can I?

411
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,731
I'm sorry...

412
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,671
You're too cute to get angry at.

413
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:58,142
My dear heart.

414
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:00,771
You're too cute.

415
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:04,481
Honey, have some fried chicken.

416
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:05,741
Thanks.

417
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:07,042
Ryu Hyung Jin!

418
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:10,112
Since when have you and Tae
Hoon been close enough...

419
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:11,481
to come to watch
baseball together?

420
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,951
We're good friends
starting today.

421
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:15,652
Soo Ho.

422
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,822
I'll give you my favorite piece.

423
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:21,292
Congratulations.

424
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:32,441
- It's the real deal
- It's the real deal

425
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:36,671
- The real deal is here
- The real deal is here

426
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:58,332
That darn jerk.

427
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:00,662
Why are you being mean to Jjoo?

428
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:02,102
Unbelievable.

429
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,572
I'll throw this away.

430
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:08,042
Isn't Hyung Jin the best?

431
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,011
What if he gets scouted
to the big league?

432
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,741
Hyung Jin, over here!

433
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:18,352
What on earth?

434
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:19,622
Hyung Jin!

435
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,892
I looked everywhere for
you after my last game.

436
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:31,662
Are you Soo Ah's friend?

437
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:35,402
- What?
- Two strikes.

438
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:39,602
You're even more
stunning up close.

439
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:41,211
My gosh.

440
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:42,671
I...

441
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:45,281
You're Soo Ah's friend,
which means I'm older.

442
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:50,052
What's going on?

443
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:52,181
Can I get your number?

444
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:54,221
My cell number?

445
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,521
- Give him your number!
- Give him your number!

446
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:58,092
- Give him your number!
- I need to get going, so hurry.

447
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:01,092
- Give him your number!
- Give him your number!

448
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,592
- But...
- Give him your number!

449
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:05,402
- Give him your number!
- Give him your number!

450
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:08,271
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.

451
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:10,941
- Give him your number!
- Give him your number!

452
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,001
Here.

453
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,781
Saved. I'll be in touch.

454
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:24,681
No way. Hyung Jin must be
head over heels for you.

455
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,451
Don't you know what
a scary world it is?

456
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:30,251
Soo Ah knowing him
doesn't make it okay.

457
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:31,792
What if he's bad news?

458
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:33,622
What?

459
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:36,332
I'll get going.

460
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:40,931
What's with him?

461
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:49,971
I'll be honest with you.

462
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,941
I've fallen for you.

463
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,652
Even when I buy shoes,

464
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:58,421
I only make a decision after
taking enough time to...

465
00:27:58,421 --> 00:27:59,751
look at them from every angle.

466
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,852
That's how I grow more
attached to them...

467
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:05,921
and cherish them even
after they're worn out.

468
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:09,731
Then from this point on,
think of me when you can,

469
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:11,302
look into the kind
of person I am,

470
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:13,001
and take your time
getting to know me.

471
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,402
If I don't want to
buy shoes though,

472
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,342
I don't even enter shoe stores.

473
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:21,542
You seem like a great person,

474
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:25,112
but this isn't a good time
for me to date anyone.

475
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:41,092
Do you still not
want to buy shoes?

476
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:43,592
Love is a luxury I
can't afford right now.

477
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:44,701
Hold on.

478
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:47,201
Are you thinking
about your girlfriend?

479
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:49,302
Not at all.

480
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,671
As if. You were
thinking about her.

481
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:53,302
- No, I wasn't.
- He said he wasn't!

482
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:55,741
- Right?
- Of course.

483
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:57,882
Then I'm glad.

484
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,181
What the...

485
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:02,781
As if.

486
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:06,521
Close your eyes

487
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:09,991
- And feel the breeze
- That voice.

488
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:13,622
Like the gentle touch

489
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:17,292
Of a mother

490
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,862
- Is that her from the festival?
- Your everything

491
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:20,531
She's unrecognizable.

492
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:23,902
- She's just like Ju Bal.
- Shout it out

493
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,912
Bravo. That was incredible.

494
00:29:29,912 --> 00:29:31,011
I give you high praise.

495
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:32,842
It was the right
amount of vibrato...

496
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,681
and your head voice was
perfect in the high notes.

497
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:36,451
Crazy jerk.

498
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:43,691
Embarrassed, are you?

499
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:57,431
Why did you follow me here?

500
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,671
You like Ju Kyung, don't you?

501
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:04,112
How could I not notice when
you made it so obvious?

502
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:06,912
You following me to the
stadium was weird enough,

503
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:08,181
but then...

504
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:10,912
you let Ju Kyung have
all the drumsticks.

505
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:12,552
That's true love, you see.

506
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,622
And then when you got all
jealous of Ryu Hyung Jin,

507
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:18,392
that was...

508
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,132
Could I seriously
be more clever?

509
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,961
So why haven't you
told her how you feel?

510
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:27,031
If you take too long,

511
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:29,001
someone like Ryu Hyung
Jin will snatch her up.

512
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,102
What...

513
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,342
I don't mean that they're
a couple yet, but...

514
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:42,781
Enjoy your date.

515
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,981
Soo Ah? Hey, Soo Ah!

516
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:49,652
- How...
- I wanted to walk you home.

517
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,261
- Sorry?
- That's just an excuse.

518
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:54,431
I wanted to see you so much that I
sneaked out of the boarding house.

519
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:56,332
What?

520
00:30:56,862 --> 00:30:58,761
- Can you do that?
- Of course not.

521
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,171
If I get caught, I'd
be kicked off the team.

522
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:02,632
Oh, no!

523
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:05,872
Then please head back.

524
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,872
I'm only joking.

525
00:31:08,872 --> 00:31:10,412
As if they could kick
out their star player.

526
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:13,612
You're right.

527
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,181
Three strikes.

528
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:20,721
It seems as though
I'm completely hooked.

529
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:24,961
You were particularly harsh
during study sessions.

530
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:27,021
Hiding your feelings like
that doesn't work these days.

531
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:29,592
If it were me, I'd
rather go out...

532
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:32,261
with a straight shooter
like Hyung Jin too.

533
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:33,632
What do you want me to do?

534
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,971
What should you do?

535
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,642
You're clueless when
it comes to dating.

536
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:39,971
Gosh.

537
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:43,612
How about I give
you some pointers?

538
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,412
Do you have a boyfriend?

539
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:48,912
No.

540
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:50,882
Is that so?

541
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,122
I don't have a
girlfriend either.

542
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:57,921
What's the chance of
someone that I like...

543
00:31:58,062 --> 00:31:59,592
liking me back?

544
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:04,332
It seems just as low as a chance
of a perfect game in baseball.

545
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:10,531
The chance of someone that
I like liking me back?

546
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:19,142
Hey!

547
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:21,251
Soo Ho, my best friend.

548
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:28,451
No way. Consistently
trying paid off.

549
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:31,421
After the 1,000th try,
you got through to Soo Ho.

550
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:33,721
I won't wash my hand today.

551
00:32:34,731 --> 00:32:36,592
The ranking of your grades
doesn't determine your happiness,

552
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,731
but higher grades
always bring joy.

553
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,931
Soo Ho, you have the
highest grades in your year.

554
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,302
Congratulations. Let's give
him a round of applause.

555
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:48,671
LIM JU KYUNG, LITERATURE: 49,
PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS: 50...

556
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:49,872
Nice.

557
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:52,412
- Seo Jun.
- I'm doomed.

558
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,912
Let's also give him a round of
applause so he can be happy.

559
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:58,481
- Great job.
- Here you go.

560
00:32:58,481 --> 00:32:59,681
Good luck.

561
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:01,951
I got 50 on my literature test.

562
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:04,491
I just marked number three
for everything. Unbelievable.

563
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:07,122
Ju Kyung, what did you get?

564
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,491
Let me see. What did you...

565
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:11,761
You got 49?

566
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:15,431
You acted like you knew what
you were doing. Good luck.

567
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,872
I also should've marked
number three for everything.

568
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,672
My mom's going to kill me.

569
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:31,082
Soo Jin, did you come
in second place again?

570
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:33,181
You must be upset.

571
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:38,991
CLASS RANK: 4TH

572
00:33:49,332 --> 00:33:51,372
You marked the wrong
numbers from number 30.

573
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:54,571
Soo Jin, this isn't like you.
Why did you make a mistake?

574
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:57,442
I should go.

575
00:34:02,712 --> 00:34:05,522
- What's wrong?
- Don't ask. You're so annoying.

576
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,321
- My gosh.
- Is this for real?

577
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:13,792
My goodness.

578
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:15,861
- What? Isn't he Ryu Hyung Jin?
- Yes, it's him.

579
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:19,502
- Isn't that Ryu Hyung Jin?
- It's Ryu Hyung Jin.

580
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:20,761
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

581
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:22,272
He's so good-looking.

582
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:24,471
What class is Lim Ju Kyung in?

583
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:26,071
Lim Ju Kyung?

584
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:28,712
You still went up by 20 ranks.

585
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:30,741
You didn't get lower grades, so
I'm sure she won't get angry.

586
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:32,582
- Right?
- Ju Kyung!

587
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:34,812
- Ju Kyung!
- Ju Kyung!

588
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:36,082
Hyung Jin!

589
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,221
What are you doing here?

590
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,491
- I came to see you.
- He came here to see her.

591
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,122
Take this.

592
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:49,732
- What's he trying to pull?
- Talk louder.

593
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:51,401
I think he has a
problem with you.

594
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:54,772
I have a jinx, so I can't
play without this ball.

595
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,241
Then why are you giving me this?

596
00:34:59,002 --> 00:35:00,971
So I can ask you to
come to the final match.

597
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:05,542
If I win the game, I want
to ask you something.

598
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:06,912
- My gosh.
- What does he want to ask?

599
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:08,951
Can't you just ask me here?

600
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:11,721
No way. I can't
ask you out here.

601
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:13,422
- Seriously?
- My gosh.

602
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:15,522
He's giving her a heads up
that he's going to ask her out?

603
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:16,922
My gosh.

604
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:20,022
Ju Kyung, you're
awfully popular.

605
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:23,931
Up until pretty recently, people
thought she was dating me.

606
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:26,002
You can't move on so quickly.

607
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,872
- What?
- You have no respect for your ex.

608
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:33,102
What are you guys
doing? You little punks.

609
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,602
Who are you?

610
00:35:34,812 --> 00:35:37,071
Make sure you come to
the final match, pretty.

611
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:39,442
- Hey.
- My goodness.

612
00:35:39,611 --> 00:35:41,111
- My goodness!
- Hyung Jin!

613
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:47,381
Where are you going?

614
00:35:57,631 --> 00:36:00,361
Hey, Soo Ho. Do you remember me?

615
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,071
We were in the same
class last year.

616
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,372
We did a few group
projects together too.

617
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:10,212
I've had feelings for
you ever since last year.

618
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:13,841
If you don't have a girlfriend,
would you like to...

619
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,582
No, I already like someone else.

620
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,361
He likes someone?

621
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:38,071
I can't believe
he likes someone.

622
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,212
Make sure you show up, pretty.

623
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:09,332
Your mom is really angry.

624
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:13,071
She threw away all your makeup.

625
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:24,821
Where are the apples?

626
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:26,422
I brought you apples.

627
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,412
- Mom.
- When did you come home?

628
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:51,111
Where are all my
makeup products?

629
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:54,442
I threw them away. Why?

630
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:56,651
- What?
- I called your homeroom teacher...

631
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:57,681
and asked about your grades.

632
00:37:58,422 --> 00:38:00,151
Your grades didn't
go up by 30 ranks.

633
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:02,392
But I still got better grades.

634
00:38:02,392 --> 00:38:04,651
I didn't do any worse, so
can't you cut me some slack?

635
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,962
Yes, her class
rank went up by 20.

636
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,491
Even if your class
rank goes up by 50,

637
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:11,931
you still won't make it to a
four-year university in Seoul.

638
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:13,732
I didn't even ask you to be in
the top 30 of your entire year.

639
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:15,172
If you did your best,

640
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:18,172
your class rank would've
easily gone up by 30.

641
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,841
She's right. Your grades
were too low to begin with.

642
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,412
But I really did try my best.

643
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,212
Where are all my makeup?

644
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:26,912
You didn't really throw
everything away, did you?

645
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,951
- Did you hide them?
- I threw them away!

646
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:32,881
I don't want to see you
wearing makeup again.

647
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:35,392
If you do, I'll kick you
out of this house as well.

648
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:36,922
What?

649
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:39,761
You really threw them away?

650
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:41,631
Mom!

651
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:44,361
How could you do that when you
know how much they mean to me?

652
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:45,931
They're mine, not yours.

653
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:47,131
How dare you yell at me!

654
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,502
Why are you angry at me
even when I tried my best?

655
00:38:49,772 --> 00:38:51,071
It's not my fault that I'm dumb.

656
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:53,002
If you tried your best,
you would've done better.

657
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,801
It's because you
didn't study as hard.

658
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,942
This time, I really
studied my best!

659
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:59,281
Why won't you believe me?

660
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,752
You never believe what I say.

661
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:05,821
This is why I never told you.

662
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:07,681
I can't believe you're
getting so emotional...

663
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,091
just because I threw
away your makeup.

664
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:12,662
Then tell me. What is it
that didn't you tell me?

665
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,522
What did you not tell me?

666
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:18,761
Do you know why I'm so
obsessed with wearing makeup?

667
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,701
Do you even know how I feel?

668
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:25,401
You know nothing, Mom.

669
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,341
You don't know what I
had to go through...

670
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,781
at my old school.

671
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:42,892
Where are you
going at this hour?

672
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:47,122
Fine, just go! Don't
you ever come back!

673
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:49,091
Honey, calm down.

674
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:59,172
Soo Ho, you need to make her
have butterflies in her stomach.

675
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,772
You need to make
her heart flutter.

676
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:03,841
First, go to her house.

677
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:07,011
Then call her and tell
her that you miss her.

678
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:08,312
And take in a deep breath.

679
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:10,781
Make sure you show
how much you miss her.

680
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:14,721
Then she'll ask "Where are you?"

681
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:17,752
And that's when you open
the window to her door.

682
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:19,861
Look at her with affection.

683
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:23,031
That's how you want to look at her.
It's very important. Write it down.

684
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:25,701
The moment she comes outside,
hug her and push her to a wall.

685
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,801
- And once you do that...
- Is that really necessary?

686
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:29,901
I need to push her to a wall?

687
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:31,901
Don't you watch dramas?

688
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,642
You know nothing for someone who
looks like a male lead in a drama.

689
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:34,841
What am I going to do with you?

690
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:38,942
Have you ever even kissed...

691
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:41,781
Hey, what am I
supposed to do next?

692
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:43,912
Gosh, forget it.

693
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:15,611
Ju Kyung.

694
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:30,491
Didn't you eat?

695
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:34,401
What's that?

696
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:40,172
My mom really threw
all my makeup away...

697
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:41,912
because my class rank
didn't go up by 30.

698
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:44,142
She's so merciless.

699
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:48,951
Is that why you cried?

700
00:41:49,582 --> 00:41:50,752
No.

701
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:56,292
Yes.

702
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:01,122
I just felt frustrated.

703
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:14,241
She doesn't even know why
I'm so obsessed with makeup.

704
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,642
She could've at least made
sure I was born smart.

705
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:19,511
You did great.

706
00:42:24,482 --> 00:42:25,721
You really did.

707
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:30,192
I know you studied hard. Your
class rank went up by 20.

708
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,361
I'm proud of you.

709
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:36,991
Are you crying again?

710
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,832
No, I'm not. Stop
making fun of me.

711
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:45,172
I'm not touched at all,
Mr. Top-of-the-class.

712
00:42:47,642 --> 00:42:48,772
What should I do for you then?

713
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:52,812
Should I buy you a whole
new set of cosmetics?

714
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,381
Why are you being so nice today?

715
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:59,821
You're always a cool tone,

716
00:42:59,821 --> 00:43:01,181
but you're a warm tone today.

717
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:03,892
Do you not like
guys who are cool?

718
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:05,761
What?

719
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:07,662
What do you like?

720
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:19,642
Where did this girl
go this late at night?

721
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,372
I called Prince.

722
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,272
She's at the comic book store.

723
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:26,511
She is?

724
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:29,651
Her and her comic book store.

725
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:34,181
What is she saying
she didn't tell me?

726
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:37,551
Did she cause trouble?

727
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:39,662
What trouble could
Ju Kyung cause?

728
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:45,701
Did she get picked on at school
for being ugly? Definitely not.

729
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,502
Why is Ju Kyung ugly?

730
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,872
- She's nice-looking.
- Yes, she's nice-looking...

731
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,172
just like you.

732
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:56,272
I'm offended now.

733
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:13,091
What is it?

734
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:17,292
I... I think I stepped
on something funky.

735
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,502
- Was it a worm?
- It's nothing.

736
00:44:21,232 --> 00:44:22,401
- It's a branch.
- No.

737
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:23,832
No, it isn't.

738
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:26,502
I think it's a worm.

739
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:28,741
No, it really is a branch.

740
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:33,982
It really is a worm.

741
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:35,982
I hate worms.

742
00:44:39,622 --> 00:44:41,551
Stay still. I'll get it off.

743
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:56,471
You'll fall. Sit.

744
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,801
Are you sure?

745
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:12,821
I meant, sit there.

746
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:15,122
What?

747
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,721
Never mind. Here. I'm done.

748
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:23,591
Oh. Thank... Thank you.

749
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:30,872
Get home safely.

750
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:33,841
Wait.

751
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:01,361
Study hard.

752
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,232
Good night.

753
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:35,180
Why are you home so late?

754
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,921
We need to talk!

755
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,220
Lim Ju Kyung!

756
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:41,290
Get back here right now.

757
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,481
Oh no.

758
00:47:05,981 --> 00:47:07,850
My heart is about to explode.

759
00:47:28,941 --> 00:47:31,301
Do you want to go
on a date with me?

760
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,011
Want to go on a date?
Should we go on a date?

761
00:47:34,011 --> 00:47:36,180
Do you want to watch
a movie with me?

762
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,080
Let's go watch a movie.
Should we go eat?

763
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,180
Do you want to go eat?

764
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,651
Didn't you know your dad
had it out for you recently?

765
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,290
Not beating Soo Ho is one thing,
but how could you drop to 12th?

766
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,520
You've never fallen out
of the top 10 before.

767
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:57,001
Are you seeing someone?

768
00:47:58,231 --> 00:48:01,470
I'm just wondering if
you're distracted...

769
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,740
Will you please stop?

770
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:06,171
Soo Jin. Soo Jin!

771
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,111
Even still, how could he
do that to a girl's face?

772
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,001
DATE FOODS GIRLS LIKE

773
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:37,770
THINGS GIRLS LIKE
TO DO ON DATES

774
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,571
HOW DO I IMPRESS THE GIRL?

775
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:09,571
- Why are you following me?
- Is something wrong?

776
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,341
What?

777
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,511
Did you get hit?

778
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,680
Did your dad hit you again?

779
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:21,910
Did you know?

780
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,450
How could I not?

781
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,761
You're really annoying.

782
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,691
You don't even know
what I'm going through.

783
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,631
But I'm killing myself to
beat you. I'm sick of it!

784
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:37,031
It's all just too annoying!

785
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:40,370
It's too annoying being
compared to you all the time.

786
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,870
I just can't do it anymore.

787
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,310
Why must you be in my school?

788
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,810
Why can't you just transfer out?

789
00:50:44,861 --> 00:50:46,231
I already like someone else.

790
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:27,640
Hey. Forget what I said, okay?

791
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,281
You have to forget it.

792
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:33,211
- Does he do that often?
- No.

793
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:35,450
I would've reported
him to the cops then.

794
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:38,651
Don't struggle with it alone.
Let me know if you need my help.

795
00:51:41,591 --> 00:51:43,990
You must think of
me as a friend.

796
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,390
Of course, you are.

797
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,361
Anyway, are my eyes still red?
Does it look like I cried?

798
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,540
- A little.
- Then let me borrow this.

799
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,990
The class will begin.

800
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,591
- Sure.
- Sure.

801
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:26,071
We'll start by reviewing the
September CSAT mock exam.

802
00:52:27,131 --> 00:52:30,200
I'll only go over the
important questions,

803
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,941
so check your handouts
and try solving them.

804
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,441
- Got it.
- Sure.

805
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:44,051
Make sure you go over what you
learned about derived functions.

806
00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:46,020
In the next class, I'll go
over some test questions.

807
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,091
See you then.

808
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,821
- Got it. Thank you.
- Thank you!

809
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,330
Your eyes seem fine now.

810
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:00,631
That's cold. Some
friend you are.

811
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:06,040
She already left.

812
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,341
Hey, can I have this?

813
00:53:13,381 --> 00:53:14,450
Bye.

814
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,231
Right. My feelings weren't
that serious anyway.

815
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,401
How can one not
fall for that face?

816
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,870
It's like falling
for a celebrity.

817
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,781
And it's upsetting to find out that
the celebrity you like is dating.

818
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:47,350
I can stop liking him
if I want to, I guess.

819
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,410
You should've told me if
you liked someone else.

820
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,211
How could you
confuse me like that?

821
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:20,551
Why give me that hairpin? Why
let me sit on your shoulder?

822
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:22,620
You playboy!

823
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:23,781
Lee Soo Ho,

824
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:26,790
I'll crush you!

825
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,751
Lim Ju Bal.

826
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,790
Die, die!

827
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:34,631
Lee Soo Ho, just wait until
I get my hands on you.

828
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:46,740
Ms. Lim, how was
your business trip?

829
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,111
It's nice to be back.

830
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,111
What's this?

831
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:57,620
THANK YOU.

832
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,120
Thank you.

833
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:06,790
He needs to be taught a lesson.

834
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,821
LIM HEE KYUNG

835
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:35,051
- Hello?
- What are you up to?

836
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:38,220
I was asleep.

837
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,890
Did I wake you, then?

838
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:44,160
Well, how was your
business trip?

839
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:45,501
Have you been waiting
for my return?

840
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,600
I guess not.

841
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,470
Gosh, I miss you.

842
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,810
- Are you not home yet?
- Look outside your window.

843
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,421
You won't even let
me see your face?

844
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,861
I see that my affectionate
gaze didn't work.

845
00:56:30,111 --> 00:56:31,211
What brings you by...

846
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:35,111
Why did you give
the petals back?

847
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,981
To not think of me anymore?

848
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,321
Are you done with me?

849
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:46,861
Should we end this?

850
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
No.

851
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:13,850
LIM JU KYUNG'S SPOT. SIT WITHOUT
PERMISSION, AND GET A HAIRY BUTT!

852
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,890
Want to meet me
at Prince Comics?

853
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,961
Is something up?

854
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:25,700
Talk about a long list.

855
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,640
When did you become a ghost?

856
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,671
I'm not in the
mood to be teased.

857
00:57:35,671 --> 00:57:36,910
Are you sick?

858
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,640
You should've said
so before coming out.

859
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,111
I'm not sick.

860
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,921
Of course, I should help you
pick out Go Woon's birthday gift.

861
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,620
Did Ryu Hyung Jin dump you?

862
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:48,051
- That's not it.
- He did!

863
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:49,191
That's not the case.

864
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,020
He even sent me
tickets to his game.

865
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,361
Really? But you look
like you were dumped.

866
00:57:57,861 --> 00:57:58,961
Let's go, then.

867
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,870
I just didn't get enough sleep!

868
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,801
Perceptive, isn't he?

869
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,051
Hello?

870
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:18,551
Are you home?

871
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:22,390
No, I dropped by the
department store. Why?

872
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:26,120
- By yourself?
- Hey, Ju Kyung.

873
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:29,390
Hurry up.

874
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,031
Are you with Han Seo Jun?

875
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:36,740
It's loud here, so I'll
call you back later.

876
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:51,620
The scent of cosmetics
is picking up my mood.

877
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,020
- Is this what you want to buy her?
- Yes.

878
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,091
She'll be singing on stage soon,

879
00:58:56,091 --> 00:58:57,861
and she has been practicing
her makeup skills.

880
00:58:58,321 --> 00:59:00,560
I hear she attends
a musical academy.

881
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:03,160
It's amazing how both
siblings can sing well.

882
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:05,961
But you've never heard me sing.

883
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:09,200
You were a K-pop idol trainee
known for your talented vocals.

884
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,901
Why did you quit though?

885
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,071
As if there's anything good
about being a celebrity.

886
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:17,381
Just pick out the
products for me.

887
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:23,321
Since she'll be on stage,
highly pigmented eyeshadow...

888
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:26,151
and a semi-permanent
lip tint will be best.

889
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:30,220
This must be new. I
wonder if it'll last long.

890
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:38,361
I can't tell since I
already had some on.

891
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,901
Why don't you give it a try?

892
00:59:39,901 --> 00:59:42,571
No way. You just tried
that on yourself.

893
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:43,901
Who cares? Come on.

894
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:45,671
- No way.
- Come on.

895
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:55,011
Good. The color shows nicely.

896
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:57,620
How about this, then?

897
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:01,850
- Hey, Seo Jun.
- Yes?

898
01:00:02,191 --> 01:00:03,560
This one.

899
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:07,031
Right, this...
I'll buy her this.

900
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,731
Do I go that way?

901
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,040
Her? Seriously?

902
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,841
No way.

903
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,551
The doors will open.

904
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:43,560
My makeup might get on
you if you're too close.

905
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,731
- Overloaded.
- I told you to lose weight.

906
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,200
- I'm sorry.
- Hold your breaths in 2, 3.

907
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:55,071
Overloaded.

908
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,040
This is why you should've
cut back on lunch.

909
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,981
We'll take the next one.
Let's get off, guys.

910
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,080
- It was good though.
- Unbelievable.

911
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,870
- What are you doing here...
- Let's go.

912
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,200
Why are you getting off when
it's not the first floor?

913
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,941
Hey, guys...

914
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:37,620
Come on. Let's go.

915
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:41,990
You're being a nuisance.

916
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,910
What just happened?

917
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:07,910
Guys, I think the
elevator stopped.

918
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:16,421
UNDER INSPECTION

919
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,390
Why don't you let go already?

920
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,261
You let go first.

921
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:27,330
- Why are you here?
- I came to shop.

922
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,270
You? You came shopping?

923
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,600
Am I not allowed to shop?

924
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,470
Then go ahead and shop.

925
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,240
Why are you holding on to her?

926
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,441
I came to shop with her.

927
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,680
Let me go.

928
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:39,950
Let me go, okay?

929
01:02:40,281 --> 01:02:43,651
Will you please stop
it already? My gosh!

930
01:02:45,821 --> 01:02:47,390
What's wrong? Are you sick?

931
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,191
Are you scared?

932
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:50,660
I'm sure the doors
will open soon.

933
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:53,790
- Hang in there.
- No, no.

934
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,430
I can't.

935
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:59,361
I really need to
go to the bathroom.

936
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,430
Why did you have to
buy me a large coffee?

937
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:05,240
And the elevator broke because
you kept messing with it.

938
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:07,540
My gosh.

939
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,211
Excuse me! Sir!

940
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:10,910
When are you going
to let us out?

941
01:03:15,381 --> 01:03:17,781
Are you crazy? My gosh!

942
01:03:19,481 --> 01:03:22,350
- Hurry! Hurry up and keep going.
- Okay.

943
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,361
- Are you okay?
- Is anyone inside?

944
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:28,660
We're going to open the
doors. Don't move, okay?

945
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:46,810
I'm so embarrassed. How am
I going to face Soo Ho now?

946
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,011
My gosh, this is killing me.

947
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,961
I didn't know it was
going to snow today.

948
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,211
Hey, pretty.

949
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,921
- How...
- Gosh, we're really meant to be.

950
01:04:29,591 --> 01:04:31,961
Some of you don't know...

951
01:04:32,321 --> 01:04:34,290
what it is that you really want.

952
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,660
And some of you do know,
but you're hesitant.

953
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,970
But opportunities...

954
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:44,140
come without a warning,

955
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:47,111
and you must be prepared
to take advantage of it.

956
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,160
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

957
01:05:10,131 --> 01:05:12,961
Hey, buddy. It's
nice to see you here.

958
01:05:14,031 --> 01:05:15,171
Why are you here?

959
01:05:16,071 --> 01:05:18,301
Why do you think I'm here?
I came to watch baseball.

960
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,970
I thought you didn't
like baseball.

961
01:05:20,341 --> 01:05:21,470
I like it now.

962
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:23,281
- Since when?
- Pretty recently.

963
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,511
So you came to watch...

964
01:05:24,981 --> 01:05:27,211
- a high school baseball match?
- They're just as professional.

965
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,781
You shouldn't look down on them.

966
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,620
This is going to be fun.

967
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,390
Enjoy.

968
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,430
Ryu Hyung Jin is finally here.
Gosh, I love the look in his eyes.

969
01:05:44,031 --> 01:05:47,370
The audience is going crazy
just because of his appearance.

970
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,970
Fortunately, he seems to be
in great condition today.

971
01:05:50,301 --> 01:05:52,341
He's going to receive the
spotlight of today's game.

972
01:05:52,341 --> 01:05:54,540
- The best pitcher of Seonil High...
- Have you seen Ju Kyung?

973
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:55,910
She left earlier.

974
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,540
She should be studying
during the weekends.

975
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:01,950
What's the point of telling
her off all the time?

976
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,020
The game has finally begun.

977
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,051
SEONIL HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL
TEAM, THROW THE BALL!

978
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,191
SEONIL HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL
TEAM, THROW THE BALL!

979
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:14,560
- Ryu Hyung Jin! Ryu Hyung Jin!
- Ryu Hyung Jin! Ryu Hyung Jin!

980
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,361
- Ryu Hyung Jin!
- Ryu Hyung Jin!

981
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:19,400
Strike!

982
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,801
I heard someone from
the major league...

983
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:22,931
is here to watch
Ryu Hyung Jin play.

984
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:25,841
My gosh, does that mean
he'll go to the States...

985
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,141
- if he wins the game today?
- Of course.

986
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,181
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!

987
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:33,711
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!

988
01:06:33,711 --> 01:06:36,181
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!

989
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,751
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!

990
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,120
I heard he always tries his
best to stay in great shape...

991
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,561
in order to keep pitching
the fastest balls.

992
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,761
Where were you?

993
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:50,931
- I went to get a selfie stick.
- He already thinks like a pro.

994
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:52,730
Isn't it amazing?

995
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,301
They say it's impossible to beat
a genius who also tries hard.

996
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,671
Gosh, I can already see
that he has great potential.

997
01:06:58,671 --> 01:07:00,070
Loads of teams will want
to sign a deal with him.

998
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,171
Let's hope he doesn't make the
same mistake he made last time.

999
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,910
I've never seen such a
handsome baseball player.

1000
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:06,141
I really hope he does great.

1001
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,221
He asked me out.

1002
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,080
Why would he ask you out?

1003
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,320
I'm serious. I
even rejected him.

1004
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:17,490
You're unbelievable.

1005
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:28,471
I'll return your
baseball via parcel.

1006
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:30,400
I'm sorry.

1007
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,801
What's that supposed to mean?

1008
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:35,171
I actually like someone.

1009
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:42,711
Does he like you too?

1010
01:07:49,591 --> 01:07:52,921
You told me that's just as low
as a chance of a perfect game.

1011
01:08:02,931 --> 01:08:06,301
Ryu Hyung Jin's perfect finale!

1012
01:08:06,301 --> 01:08:10,480
- Nice!
- He really did great.

1013
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,240
- Thanks to Ryu Hyung Jin,
- What?

1014
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:16,580
the victory goes to
Seonil High School.

1015
01:08:27,431 --> 01:08:28,690
- Ryu Hyung Jin!
- Ryu Hyung Jin!

1016
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:31,730
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!
- The best pitcher, Ryu Hyung Jin!

1017
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:34,601
Did you have fun?

1018
01:08:37,141 --> 01:08:39,001
- Yes, it was fun.
- Really?

1019
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:40,641
I didn't.

1020
01:08:41,311 --> 01:08:43,141
I only came because I thought
Ju Kyung might be here.

1021
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:44,780
I was nervous.

1022
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:47,650
That's why I came today.

1023
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:50,450
But you just came here
to watch baseball.

1024
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:53,381
Right?

1025
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:56,351
Yes. I told you already.

1026
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:00,461
Why are you asking me twice?

1027
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,330
See you.

1028
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,900
Why do you have to like Ju
Kyung of all people, you idiot?

1029
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:12,271
Soo Ho.

1030
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:22,480
Okay, fine.

1031
01:09:23,011 --> 01:09:25,421
To be honest, I came here
because I like Ju Kyung.

1032
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,790
Am I not allowed to like her?

1033
01:09:56,046 --> 01:09:58,879
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG GUN
JOO FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1034
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,211
TRUE BEAUTY

1035
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:27,551
<i>Did you guys wear
matching outfits...</i>

1036
01:10:27,551 --> 01:10:30,011
<i>to announce that you
guys are a couple?</i>

1037
01:10:30,011 --> 01:10:33,450
<i>- Go on a date! Go on a date!
- Go on a date! Go on a date!</i>

1038
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:34,851
<i>Do you like someone?</i>

1039
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:37,021
<i>Why did you avoid me today?</i>

1040
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:39,190
<i>I didn't avoid you.</i>

1041
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,400
<i>Why does it have to be Ju Kyung?</i>

1042
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:47,730
<i>I don't know! I don't
know why I like her.</i>

1043
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:51,101
<i>Why are you crying
because of him?</i>

1044
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:53,471
<i>Do you like him?</i>
