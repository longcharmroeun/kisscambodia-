1
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:26,208
This is where...

2
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,219
This is where...

3
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:34,318
Se Yeon...

4
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,558
I know.

5
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,159
Se Yeon...

6
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,198
I know.

7
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:50,969
I know everything.

8
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,739
EPISODE 6

9
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,509
Here.

10
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:40,688
Are you all right?

11
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:45,658
I should be asking you,
not the other way around.

12
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,799
I'm fine.

13
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,299
But you're not.

14
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,269
The pain is suffocating you.

15
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,639
I see you remember now.

16
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,778
Why did you play dumb?

17
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,979
You should've told me.

18
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:07,979
You're right.

19
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,118
I don't know why I did.

20
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,349
I wasn't here that night...

21
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,819
to end my life.

22
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,299
So there's no need to pity me.

23
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,199
- That's not why...
- Fire!

24
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,199
There's a fire. Everyone, out!

25
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,349
- Is it a serious fire?
- Everything's on fire!

26
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:40,908
Oh, no!

27
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,019
But I don't want to die here.

28
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:45,519
What do we do? There's a fire!

29
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:53,489
What now? Oh, no.

30
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,558
In one of the units,

31
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:57,829
smoke was released...

32
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,898
while grilling
dried young pollack,

33
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,368
and that sent off the
fire alarm by mistake.

34
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,468
Who grills that at home?

35
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:07,069
It's better grilled
over charcoal, right?

36
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:08,069
Unbelievable.

37
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,639
- Move. Move!
- Hey, stop pushing.

38
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,139
Let me get down first.

39
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,079
Are you kidding me?

40
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,648
What a way to ruin a night.

41
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,479
Unbelievable.

42
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,748
He just pushed through.

43
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,419
Don't jump to conclusions. I'm
only nice to you out of pity.

44
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,299
It was stupid of me to
run all the way here.

45
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:50,948
Does Ju Kyung know?

46
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:53,549
That you killed a friend?

47
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,659
Don't forget...

48
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:01,729
that you killed Se Yeon...

49
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,928
and that you have no
right to be happy.

50
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,308
Someone told me...

51
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:22,378
that crying is a way
to cleanse your heart.

52
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:26,419
I'm just saying.

53
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:30,618
It's all right to cry sometimes.

54
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,959
You don't have to
pretend to be okay.

55
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,529
I'll get going then.

56
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,729
But it's annoying now.

57
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:11,928
I don't want...

58
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,328
to bother with you
anymore, so get out.

59
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:16,839
I never knew you were
such a busybody too.

60
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:19,938
Who asked you to be nice
or thoughtful to me?

61
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:24,109
I won't bug you anymore, so
don't pity me anymore either.

62
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:47,599
Are you just getting home?

63
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,138
Why are you here unannounced?

64
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,678
- Have you eaten?
- I have, so leave.

65
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,878
Are you telling me to leave
when it's been so long?

66
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,078
Your homeroom teacher called today
about a parent-teacher conference.

67
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:05,948
No way, it's Lee Joo Hun.

68
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,049
My gosh.

69
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:10,359
No pictures are allowed.

70
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,459
We're sorry. Let's go.

71
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:17,099
Just ignore the
parent-teacher conference.

72
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,959
I'll tell him you're busy.

73
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,399
I already cleared my schedule.

74
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,938
So what do I need to bring to
a parent-teacher conference?

75
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:26,969
I've never done this before,
so I'm already nervous.

76
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,868
I said I don't want
the school to know.

77
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:32,209
The teaching staff already
know I'm your father,

78
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,979
so what would they think of
me if I never make a visit?

79
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,448
Just do what you always do.

80
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:39,618
I want to rest, so leave.

81
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:06,078
I'm home.

82
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:07,609
Hey.

83
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:09,919
- Is Mom sleeping?
- Yes.

84
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,549
Gosh, that looks delicious.

85
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:13,349
Just cook one for yourself.

86
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,919
Let me have a bite. Come on.

87
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,229
That's not a bite.

88
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,328
It's really good. Why
don't you cook one more?

89
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:25,399
Cook it yourself, Seo Jun.

90
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,498
You're so cheap.

91
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,138
Are you really my sister?

92
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,339
I can't get used to
seeing you wearing makeup.

93
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:38,179
Ju Kyung helped me with this,
so I haven't removed it yet.

94
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:41,449
By the way, you told me Ju Kyung
helped you when you were in need.

95
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,518
What was that about?

96
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:47,489
A few girls bullied me because they
were jealous I got to perform solo.

97
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:49,288
They bullied you?

98
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,658
- What are their names?
- Why? Are you going to meet them?

99
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,628
Don't even think about it. It's
going to be so embarrassing.

100
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,099
And Ju Kyung already
told them off.

101
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:00,298
She did?

102
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,398
She's got some guts.

103
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,908
That was nice.

104
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,679
You're a great cook.

105
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,378
It was nice and simple.
Gosh, it tasted really good.

106
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:16,719
Seo Jun!

107
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:20,449
This was the last pack
of my favorite ramyeon.

108
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,008
Why am I going the other way?

109
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:46,079
Why aren't you stopping? Aren't
you going to go to school?

110
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:48,709
Where are you going?

111
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,248
What? I'm going to school.

112
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,959
What? What do you want?

113
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,998
Are you going to make fun of me
and say you'll do everything I say?

114
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:07,729
- No, it's not that.
- He'll do everything you say!

115
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,929
I'll do everything you say.

116
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,969
You just said you won't say
that. Are you kidding me?

117
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,908
If you make fun of me
again, I won't stand still.

118
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,239
I'll get back at you too.

119
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:22,408
- Seo Jun!
- Seo Jun!

120
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,118
Why did you have to interrupt?

121
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:25,719
"I'll get back at you too."

122
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:28,248
I'll do everything
you say. I will.

123
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,189
- Kang Soo Jin.
- Yes.

124
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:32,689
- I'm so doomed.
- My gosh.

125
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,489
- Kim Si Yeon.
- Yes.

126
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,158
- Soo Ah.
- Yes.

127
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,028
NATIONAL ASSESSMENT TEST

128
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:40,398
- Kang Yoon Hui.
- Yes.

129
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,898
GRADE 7

130
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:45,368
My gosh, I got lower grades
than what I expected.

131
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,180
2ND OUT OF 25

132
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,748
I totally failed the test.

133
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,548
All flowers endure the
wind as they bloom.

134
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:00,689
Even the most beautiful flowers had
to endure the wind as they bloomed.

135
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:05,158
So don't let your grades
upset you too much.

136
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:08,689
Mr. Han, will you please stop?

137
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,359
- Please.
- Mr. Han.

138
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,569
Why does it feel like I'm enduring
a stronger wind than others?

139
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,729
Hyun Kyu, I think it's okay
for you to be a little upset.

140
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,868
I'm meeting your parents this
week to discuss your grades.

141
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,508
Those of you whose parents
are expected to come today...

142
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,778
let me know if they wish
to change their schedule.

143
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,278
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,179
I'm at your school.

145
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:32,148
I'm doomed.

146
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:36,189
Ms. Hong, if you look here,

147
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,158
it's a lucky number.
A lucky seven.

148
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,329
Is she Genghis Khan
or Taejo Wang Geon?

149
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,729
Why did she unify all her
grades into one number?

150
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:49,028
Maybe she was too busy adjusting
to the new environment.

151
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,638
Mr. Han, with these grades,

152
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:55,709
she won't be able to get into
a university in Seoul, right?

153
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:58,908
- No... No.
- This is making me angry.

154
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,449
But there's still hope.

155
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:05,378
If she starts studying
hard from now...

156
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:11,589
Ms. Hong!

157
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:17,729
By any chance,

158
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,699
did you see anything?

159
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:24,239
There was nothing to see.

160
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:29,809
It's okay. You can overcome it.

161
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,538
I can overcome it?

162
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:48,189
"Eyebrows for men and women"?
"Semi permanent eyebrow tattoo"?

163
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,339
TEACHERS' OFFICE

164
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:02,668
Mom.

165
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,179
You darn little...

166
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:21,559
Is that Lee Joo Hun?

167
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,298
- Isn't that Lee Joo Hun?
- Yes, it's him.

168
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:24,359
What's he doing here?

169
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,229
My goodness!

170
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,599
I saw something
glowing from afar,

171
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,739
so I thought someone had
turned the lights on.

172
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,939
But it was you. You're here.

173
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,109
Hello, sir. I'm Soo
Ho's homeroom teacher.

174
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,579
It's nice to meet
you. I'm Soo Ho's dad.

175
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:41,679
Mr. Han!

176
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:45,319
How could you ask a top star
to come all the way to school?

177
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:47,048
You should've
visited him yourself!

178
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,288
Apologize! Apologize right now!

179
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:50,589
I'm sorry... What?

180
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,528
No, it's okay. I've always
wanted to visit my son's school.

181
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:54,589
Mom!

182
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,699
- Is this the teachers' office?
- Yes. Come this way.

183
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,729
"I will buy you with money!"

184
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,168
I was a huge fan
of "Maze of Love".

185
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,908
Can I get an autograph?

186
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,349
- I love you. I love you.
- Me too.

187
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:15,849
- Can I also get an autograph?
- Sure.

188
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,319
I'm a music teacher.

189
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,118
- Me too.
- This is a report card.

190
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,949
- My goodness.
- Here.

191
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:24,189
I've always been your fan.

192
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,059
- My turn.
- Here.

193
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,429
Oh, my gosh. Mom.

194
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:31,559
I teach music here.

195
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:38,638
Lee Soo Ho.

196
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:40,239
Hey, Soo Ho.

197
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,179
- What are you doing?
- Gosh, come on.

198
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,579
We totally dominated the
basketball court together.

199
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,278
We were like NBA
basketball players.

200
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,349
We were like Stephen
Curry and Klay Thompson.

201
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,589
You understand, man?

202
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:55,989
- You?
- Guys, I have big news!

203
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:59,518
- What?
- Soo Ho, your dad is Lee Joo Hun?

204
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:00,989
- What?
- The celebrity?

205
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,489
Yes, the famous celebrity.

206
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,158
- Isn't it unbelievable?
- What are you talking about?

207
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:06,599
"Lee Joo Hun"?

208
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,929
The other kids saw him in
front of the teachers' office.

209
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,668
You're incredible, Soo Ho.

210
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:12,638
My mom is a huge fan.

211
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,839
Can you ask him
for an autograph...

212
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,038
- Hey... I get it now.
- Seriously?

213
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:21,109
- No wonder he's so handsome.
- Be quiet already.

214
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,579
He told me he doesn't
have a family.

215
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,319
Soo Jin, did you
know about this?

216
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,089
Soo Ho hates having people
find out about his dad.

217
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,489
No wonder he didn't tell anyone.

218
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,758
Lee Joo Hun is the CEO
of Move Entertainment.

219
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,689
Doesn't that mean Soo
Ho is really rich?

220
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,258
I always wondered why he
looked down on everyone.

221
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,628
But I get it now. He lives
in a different world.

222
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,128
You're right.

223
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,239
He lives in a completely
different world.

224
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,699
Wait. Didn't Lee Joo Hun's
wife die a long time ago?

225
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,109
- Does that mean Soo Ho doesn't...
- Hey.

226
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,368
Stop talking nonsense. Just
shut your mouth and eat.

227
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,449
- Soo Ho gets...
- Hello.

228
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,449
outstanding grades and
is a great athlete.

229
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:01,148
He also has amazing looks
because he takes after you.

230
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:02,518
He's the most perfect student.

231
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:04,319
Is that so?

232
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:06,118
Okay then. I'll see you again.

233
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:08,189
- Of course. Thank you for coming.
- It's Lee Joo Hun!

234
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,729
- It's Lee Joo Hun!
- "Lee Joo Hun"?

235
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,128
- Unbelievable!
- My gosh!

236
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:13,069
- You're so handsome!
- You're really good-looking!

237
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,998
- He's looking at us!
- Take a photo!

238
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:17,199
- Hurry!
- Take a photo!

239
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,469
- My gosh.
- This is so cool.

240
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,768
- He's so handsome.
- Seriously.

241
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,109
- You're so handsome!
- You're so good-looking!

242
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,748
Where did she go?

243
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,018
Did you talk to the teacher?

244
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:34,648
Yes.

245
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,518
- Hey, Soo Ho.
- Why are you here?

246
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,258
It looks like it's
lunchtime. Did you eat?

247
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:41,929
I told you not to
come to school.

248
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:43,959
Don't you think
you're being brazen...

249
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,569
by doing this all of a sudden?

250
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,628
Mr. Lee!

251
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:51,569
Mom, you're still here?

252
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,268
I had to talk to Ju
Young's homeroom teacher.

253
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:54,609
Come on. Just go.

254
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,969
But he's right there.

255
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,709
- Mr. Lee!
- Mom!

256
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:01,148
- We meet again.
- Yes.

257
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,918
He must be your son.

258
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,919
Mr. Lee, your son is
extremely handsome too.

259
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:12,858
Do you think so?

260
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,528
Are you classmates with Soo Ho?

261
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,399
Oh, yes. Hello.

262
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:20,568
I'll be off now.

263
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:29,939
Is he also that blunt at school?

264
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,808
Yes, a little.

265
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,578
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let go of me.

266
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:39,788
I only got your autograph earlier,
and I thought it was a real pity.

267
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:42,189
Would it be okay to
take a photo together?

268
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,505
Did you have to...

269
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,036
kick Se Yeon out like that?

270
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,146
Are you blaming me?

271
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:07,175
Seo Jun, you're not
the only one who's sad.

272
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,945
He was powerless!

273
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,616
You could've stopped it!

274
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,455
Stop being rude.

275
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:19,586
Do you think I'm a charity
that helps powerless kids?

276
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,925
What's wrong with an
agency firing a talent...

277
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,366
that drew criticism
from society?

278
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:35,975
You should've come, Dad.
Why did you send Mom?

279
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:39,876
Rip up my report card
once she comes home, okay?

280
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,185
Spicy pork?

281
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:46,415
Okay. Make it super spicy.

282
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:50,126
I love you, Dad. Okay.

283
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:53,925
Soo Jin.

284
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,056
Why would you rip
up your report card?

285
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:58,566
My mom got Lee Joo
Hun's autograph on it.

286
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,435
On the front or back?

287
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:03,136
Front.

288
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:05,106
No wonder you're mad.

289
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:09,876
Seriously. My dad is the only one
in my family who cares about me.

290
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,705
Why? Because he's
making you spicy pork?

291
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:14,376
That's right.

292
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,945
You must be close to
your dad. I'm jealous.

293
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,086
Although my dad's unemployed?

294
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,856
Although he caused trouble
and cost us our house?

295
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:52,786
You look terrible.

296
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,116
Don't you think so?

297
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,755
Who cares how I
look? It's okay...

298
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,185
as long as Joo
Hun came out good.

299
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:03,566
You know, the camera can't
capture how he looks in person.

300
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,596
His face glowed.

301
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:12,106
A back alley hottie and
a national hottie...

302
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:14,336
just don't compare.

303
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,445
Still,

304
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:24,745
how could you get an autograph
on your daughter's report card?

305
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:28,685
You call this a report
card? With grades like that?

306
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,755
How humiliating.

307
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:33,755
Son. Cover up your
sister's name.

308
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:35,356
Make sure it can't be seen.

309
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,066
What a joke.

310
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,866
That brat bought so much.

311
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,935
I know she's your kid,
this is way over the line.

312
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,136
Freeze.

313
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:51,606
Did you seriously think you
could pull a fast one on me?

314
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:58,215
This is the only way
she'll come to her senses.

315
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,386
- I'm home.
- Hey...

316
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:08,296
Mom.

317
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:10,225
Isn't that my makeup?

318
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,896
That's right. I'm
throwing it all away.

319
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,435
Why? I haven't finished
using them up yet.

320
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,435
Should I throw you out? I
haven't finished raising you yet.

321
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:20,675
Spare my makeup.
It's my lifeline.

322
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,836
I'll make it within the top
20 in the next exams... No.

323
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,905
Top 30. Okay? Please.

324
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:27,445
Promise you'll make
pigs fly, who don't you?

325
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:30,215
Mom, please.

326
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,896
Losing is a habit. And
habits must be fixed.

327
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:43,665
Do you think I invested in
you to see grades like these?

328
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:46,465
You can't beat the son of
a lowly family like that?

329
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:48,596
How will you get into the
best med school like that?

330
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:18,026
My babies.

331
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,165
You poor things.

332
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:22,566
I'll protect you.

333
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:29,005
Why did I keep you?

334
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:39,286
Jeong Se Yeon's friend.

335
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,386
Lee Joo Hun's son. Why does
he have so many secrets?

336
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,155
Does he not get
along with his dad?

337
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:49,995
Is that why he said
he had no family?

338
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:51,925
Whatever.

339
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:54,695
Why do I care? We're
not friends anymore.

340
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:59,265
Don't think about it.

341
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,675
Put the top slide on right away
so the blood doesn't coagulate.

342
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:05,975
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

343
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:08,675
- Place the top slide.
- Yes, ma'am.

344
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:12,245
First, we'll see if
the color changes.

345
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:16,586
Then use the microscope to
observe how the cells crumple up.

346
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:17,655
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:19,356
Ju Kyung, look at this.

348
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,596
Let go.

349
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,405
I said to let go.

350
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,975
Just talk. Don't grab me.

351
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:11,245
I have nothing to
say, so let me...

352
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:20,215
What's going on? Did
you two have a fight?

353
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:43,975
Do you have time
today after school?

354
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:50,485
The calories are cheering me up.

355
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:51,816
Thanks, Go Woon.

356
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,155
I wanted to buy you
something better.

357
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,455
This is fine. I didn't do much.

358
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:00,026
"I was only washing that
foul mouth of yours."

359
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:04,096
Don't you remember?
Thank you so much...

360
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:06,425
for that day and the
day of the festival.

361
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:08,396
I'm glad you look cheerful.

362
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:12,036
Didn't they bully
you since that day?

363
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:14,336
They say things behind my back.

364
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:17,646
They say I painted my
face to sing on stage.

365
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,415
They say I've got the nerve
showing up without makeup.

366
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,915
Are you okay hearing that?

367
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:26,386
If I hate my face just
because they say that,

368
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:29,556
I'd be agreeing
that I'm a loser.

369
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:34,326
So I'm going to ignore them and
live with the face I'm given.

370
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:40,096
You're very cool.

371
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:45,536
Why am I so scared to
live with the face...

372
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:47,036
that I've been given?

373
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:49,876
I really am a loser.

374
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:52,975
That's right. Do you mind...

375
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:55,146
teaching me how
to put on makeup?

376
00:25:55,745 --> 00:25:56,776
Makeup?

377
00:25:57,415 --> 00:26:00,816
A man's hotness comes from...

378
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:06,586
Yes. Wow.

379
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,296
Shall we begin?

380
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:14,435
Okey dokey! Is that true? Yes.

381
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:18,165
Okey dokey! Is that true? Yes.

382
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:22,935
Yes. Okey dokey.

383
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:38,626
- What...
- You were home?

384
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:42,695
Please put some clothes
on when you're home.

385
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:47,896
Hey.

386
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,175
Darn it!

387
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:58,846
No...

388
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:06,586
Hey, I didn't see anything.

389
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,316
I really didn't!

390
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,796
Darn it!

391
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:17,665
Darn...

392
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:22,796
It serves him right for
not listening to me.

393
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,636
My little brother's
like that at home too.

394
00:27:27,136 --> 00:27:30,076
Wait. He's in your year.
Do you know Lim Ju Young?

395
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:32,576
No, he must be in
a different class.

396
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,576
He's not worth knowing. Just
pretend he doesn't exist.

397
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:37,915
Thank you for today, Ju Kyung.

398
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:39,116
It was my pleasure.

399
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,185
- Bye, then. Don't see me out.
- Right.

400
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,616
Well, get home safely!

401
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,455
Did she leave?

402
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:53,836
Lim Ju Kyung!

403
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:56,536
Hey, Ju Kyung.

404
00:27:58,665 --> 00:28:01,475
- Sorry about that.
- You...

405
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,346
You're now pulling my hair too?

406
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,346
You should've stopped
when I called for you.

407
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:09,646
Why did you call for me?

408
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:13,346
What? Oh, no reason.

409
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:14,985
No reason?

410
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:17,955
- Come on. I'll walk you.
- Forget it.

411
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:19,886
Why would you when I
can just take the bus?

412
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,455
I never said I'd walk you home,

413
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,225
just to the bus station.

414
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:24,396
I know where it is.

415
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:25,796
You should get back home.

416
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:29,896
How can I when I'm grateful
for what you did for Go Woon?

417
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:31,735
What did you just say?

418
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:33,735
- What?
- You...

419
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:36,876
- What?
- You thanked me just now.

420
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,005
Did I?

421
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:41,715
I never imagined
that coming from you.

422
00:28:41,975 --> 00:28:43,415
Say it again, so I
can properly hear it.

423
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:45,846
Why should I when
you already heard it?

424
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:47,515
I didn't properly catch it.

425
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:53,026
I'm sorry.

426
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:55,495
You're sorry?

427
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,995
I won't say it twice.

428
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:03,735
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

429
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:07,205
- Why?
- You see,

430
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:09,606
I saw it.

431
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:11,146
See what?

432
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:13,245
Your underwear.

433
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,576
Roar!

434
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,715
Hey, you said you
didn't see anything!

435
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:21,485
Darn it.

436
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:27,925
Hey, there. It's been a while.

437
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:31,866
Ju Kyung hasn't dropped by either
lately. Is it an exam week?

438
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:36,836
Lim Ju Kyung!

439
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,505
I bet you're here reading comic
books again and not studying.

440
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:44,076
My goodness. Soo
Ho, is that you?

441
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,146
What's the matter with you?

442
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:58,526
Mom, I'm home.

443
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:00,596
Finally, I can breathe again.

444
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:02,796
Dad, I'm hungry.

445
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:04,066
Cook me dinner already.

446
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:06,096
My daughter, you're home.

447
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:14,175
Mom, the one beside you.

448
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:16,836
Is that Lee Soo Ho?

449
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,905
Goodness. Of course, it is.

450
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,715
Did you think he
was a sculpture?

451
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:23,915
Darn it!

452
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,286
Mom, why did you
invite him home?

453
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:35,455
I wanted to cook dinner for
my daughter's classmate.

454
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:37,165
Are you my biggest
hater or something?

455
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,925
Why would you do this to me?

456
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:41,195
Try this.

457
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:44,566
Gosh, Dad's cooking is better.

458
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:54,116
Soo Ho, are you
and my Ju Kyung...

459
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:57,586
more like friends
or something more?

460
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,386
We're not that close.

461
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:00,985
Not even close to being friends.

462
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:02,655
Why would you even ask him that?

463
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,185
Is that so?

464
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:07,995
Then I wish for nothing more...

465
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:10,665
than for it to be kept that way.

466
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,765
Hey, aren't you busy today?

467
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,465
I'm not.

468
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,536
Don't be ridiculous. You
have extra classes today.

469
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:20,705
What? Extra classes?

470
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,505
That's not the case.

471
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,276
Right?

472
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,846
Our Soo Ho must be hungry.

473
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:28,975
Honey, get the
table with Ju Young.

474
00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:31,846
Let's enjoy today's
dinner as if it's a feast.

475
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,086
A feast, my foot.

476
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:37,886
Come on. Don't just sit
there like a pile of hay.

477
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,225
What on earth?

478
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:56,435
You're not my brother or anything,
so I'll call you whatever I want.

479
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:59,876
Look here, Mr. Lee.

480
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:02,346
What's this about, Mr. Lim?

481
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:05,415
You're the one who caught my
sister without her makeup, right?

482
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:07,755
That seems to be the case.

483
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:09,556
Are you picking on her...

484
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:11,725
using her secret as leverage?

485
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:12,925
That's not the case.

486
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:16,755
Obviously, your presence is
making her uncomfortable.

487
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,765
So why did you even
accept this invitation?

488
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:20,396
Do you like her or something?

489
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:22,265
That's true.

490
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,505
You're funny.

491
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:30,675
You're a funny one.

492
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:32,405
Quite humorous, aren't you?

493
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,675
But don't make jokes
like that to her.

494
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:39,146
She'll get the wrong idea
and get hurt in the end.

495
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:42,856
I heard that you're the one
who's been hurting her more.

496
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:46,026
You look down on her at
every chance you get.

497
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:47,126
Did she tell you that?

498
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,596
You really are friends then.

499
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:51,495
You know about her life.

500
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,665
That I give you credit for.

501
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:58,866
Look here, Mr. Lee. Put
some muscle into it.

502
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,646
This...

503
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:16,615
This is the table I
bought when I got married.

504
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:20,656
- I'm sorry.
- There's no need to be.

505
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:24,026
I can't get married again,
but I can always buy a table.

506
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:27,796
"UNDERSTANDING AROMAS"

507
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:32,665
I'd like to give him this. Here.

508
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,135
- Thank you.
- Open up.

509
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,305
Is it good?

510
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,316
Had we not lost the house,

511
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:44,986
I would've treated
you to beef, not pork.

512
00:33:44,986 --> 00:33:48,486
Honey, pork's known
to be better for you.

513
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:51,725
Wait, I knew it.

514
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:53,926
Young and rich.

515
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:55,396
Hey, put that down.

516
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:56,995
"Put that down."

517
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:59,966
Ju Kyung's not just clumsy,

518
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:02,566
but she gets clumsy grades too.

519
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,506
Mom, there's no need
to tell him that.

520
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:06,665
I heard that you're
top of your class.

521
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,205
Can you look out for Ju Kyung...

522
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:11,205
- and study with her?
- Sure.

523
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:13,946
Not just by yourselves though.

524
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:15,376
Always in groups.

525
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,415
Why would I study with him?

526
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:22,515
Hey, this isn't a
knock-off, right?

527
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:24,455
Can I try it on?

528
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:27,126
I just want to see how it fits.

529
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:28,455
- Ju Young!
- Hey!

530
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:30,396
Would you like to have it?

531
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:33,896
Soo Ho, I couldn't
possibly be more grateful.

532
00:34:33,896 --> 00:34:35,995
Hey, give that back.

533
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:38,006
Stop poking me with
your dirty foot.

534
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,705
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

535
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:42,336
You imbeciles!

536
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:55,555
Soo Ho's joining us today, so
let's have our dinner graciously.

537
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:58,055
But she keeps poking
me with her foot.

538
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,285
Ju Young, let go of me!

539
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:01,926
Do you have a death wish?

540
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:16,376
Ju Kyung, let's eat.

541
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:24,446
Soo Ho, do you have
a younger sibling?

542
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:26,245
I don't.

543
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,415
Then can you
consider me as yours?

544
00:35:28,915 --> 00:35:30,685
I don't want to
be hers, you see.

545
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:33,185
If I could choose,
rather than my son,

546
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:34,926
I'd give you my daughter.

547
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,796
They're hardly adults, you know.

548
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:40,265
I'm only kidding. There's
no need to get all serious.

549
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:44,606
Anyway, it seems like
our fates are entwined.

550
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:47,365
- Sorry?
- My eldest works at Move.

551
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:48,736
Your father's agency.

552
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:50,906
Right.

553
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:53,546
Let's quickly eat up
and wrap up dinner.

554
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:56,876
She made a career move from
a major company last year.

555
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,816
Her being meticulous
and sharp...

556
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:02,385
will definitely help your
father run his business.

557
00:36:07,955 --> 00:36:09,696
Come back home.

558
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,095
I'm home.

559
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,365
Am I home?

560
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:26,446
Gosh, I'm thirty.

561
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,216
Eat up, Soo Ho.

562
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:29,415
Where's the water?

563
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:33,245
She normally doesn't
drink like this.

564
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,285
Mom!

565
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,026
The lights are out again.

566
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,526
This darn old house.

567
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,426
We only need to
locate the fuse box.

568
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:44,725
- The what?
- Where's my phone?

569
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:48,196
Soo Ho, I'm sorry. Could
you let me through?

570
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:49,466
- Sure.
- I can't see anything.

571
00:36:49,466 --> 00:36:50,865
No, it's that way.

572
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,836
- What is this?
- It's my foot.

573
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:58,075
- Oh, your foot?
- Why is the sofa so up high?

574
00:36:58,075 --> 00:36:59,975
It's my bottom, you fool!

575
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:01,845
Why did you hit me?

576
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:08,015
- I found it!
- Oh, my goodness.

577
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:11,685
My goodness, my legs.

578
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,995
- Honey.
- My gosh.

579
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:18,765
My gosh, what is this?

580
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:25,205
- Get off me.
- Gosh, my legs.

581
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:28,376
I can't get up. My gosh.

582
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:30,406
- Honey.
- My gosh, honey.

583
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:38,515
I just want to disappear.

584
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:40,285
Seriously.

585
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:44,785
My gosh, my back hurts.

586
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,725
Why did you follow her home?

587
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,635
You should've just
told her you're busy.

588
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:56,035
I couldn't do that.

589
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:57,665
You're good at that.

590
00:37:58,906 --> 00:38:02,836
You're good at drawing a
line and keeping a distance.

591
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:07,975
I'm sorry you had to put up
with all that. I'll see you.

592
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:17,115
My gosh, this is so
embarrassing. Why are they here?

593
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,256
WARNING! AUTHORIZED
PERSONNEL ONLY!

594
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,566
Ju Kyung.

595
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:29,665
- Hey.
- What?

596
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:31,435
Why are you still sleeping?

597
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:33,836
I studied until past midnight?

598
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,435
What's gotten into you?

599
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:38,006
Then you must be tired. That's
good. Let's go to the dry sauna.

600
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:41,376
I need to get rid of the alcohol
inside me and have hangover soup.

601
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:42,876
No, I can't be bothered.

602
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:44,586
Why are you so
lethargic these days?

603
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:46,216
I'll buy you something
delicious. Let's go.

604
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:48,356
- I'm not hungry.
- Really?

605
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:51,626
You don't want chicken feet?

606
00:38:52,426 --> 00:38:53,526
Deal.

607
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,055
Deal.

608
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:56,396
Come on out.

609
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:57,696
- Can I have sikhye too?
- Sure.

610
00:38:57,966 --> 00:38:59,026
And boiled eggs?

611
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:01,696
- Let's go there.
- Okay.

612
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:06,765
PINE TREE FIREWOOD SAUNA

615
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:19,385
My gosh, this is nice.

616
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:25,656
Gosh, this is so
hot. My goodness.

617
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:31,725
It's hot in here.

618
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:38,365
Gosh, what is he doing here?

619
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:50,046
Isn't this the hottest room?

620
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:51,685
I don't like it
when it's too hot.

621
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,756
Hey, a real man should be
able to endure this heat.

622
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:56,885
If you can't stand it,

623
00:39:57,725 --> 00:40:00,055
go outside and get me ice cream.

624
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:01,296
What are you talking about?

625
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:03,526
I said I don't like it, but I
never said I can't endure it.

626
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:06,765
- Let's have the loser buy eggs.
- Deal.

627
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,205
This is driving me crazy.

628
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:17,306
I'll have some eggs and sikhye.

629
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:19,016
Oh, and chicken feet.

630
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:21,246
Would you like them spicy?

631
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,166
You require a lot of care.

632
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:40,836
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,206
He was cute.

634
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,706
Make it real spicy so that
my entire mouth will burn.

635
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:57,345
Will you please leave?

636
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:59,885
I feel like I'm
getting barbecued.

637
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:02,556
It's Saturday. Aren't you
meeting your girlfriend today?

638
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:03,686
"Girlfriend"?

639
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:05,396
Who are you talking about?

640
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:08,525
"I'll do everything you say."

641
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,166
Will you stop? It's
nothing like that.

642
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,465
Why don't you ask her out?

643
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,606
Ju Kyung is pretty.
Don't you agree?

644
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,235
She's not pretty. What's
wrong with your eyes?

645
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:21,976
- That jerk.
- Take a better look next time.

646
00:41:24,746 --> 00:41:28,385
Hey, wait. That lady hasn't
moved for a while now.

647
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:32,155
Do you think she fainted
because it's so hot in here?

648
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:35,856
Ma'am, are you okay?

649
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:39,226
Gosh, I didn't faint. I'm
just here to get some heat...

650
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:40,896
in order to relieve my muscles.

651
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:45,266
- Gosh, that's nice.
- You really are a professional.

652
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:47,436
She's a pro.

653
00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:51,306
We're with a true
professional, so I think...

654
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:52,706
it's pointless for us
to compete each other.

655
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:55,275
I'm just going to go
and get ice cream.

656
00:41:58,775 --> 00:42:00,416
Don't forget to buy boiled eggs!

657
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,146
I can't take it anymore.

658
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,166
That was so hot.

659
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,166
- Pick something cheap, okay?
- What would you like?

660
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:24,336
Boiled eggs.

661
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:27,376
The chicken feet are here,

662
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:28,675
- Ju...
- No!

663
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:34,516
LEE JOO HUN

664
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:36,586
- Goodness, you met Lee Joo Hun?
- Yes.

665
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:39,485
I bet he was really handsome.
You must have been so happy.

666
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:41,856
But what's that?

667
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:44,896
Ju Kyung's report card?

668
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,626
But then again,

669
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:52,735
you can't expect all three of
your kids to get good grades.

670
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:55,666
A girl just needs
to be pretty...

671
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:00,405
A girl just needs to be kind.

672
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,876
I'll be off now.

673
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:13,615
Lee Joo Hun's autograph is
good enough to be our heirloom.

674
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:16,925
But why did I have to get it
on this brat's report card?

675
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:22,595
Welcome.

676
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:25,095
Hello.

677
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:27,266

00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,615
She must be having fun.

681
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:54,396
- You can sit here.
- Thank you.

682
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:33,566
JEONG SE YEON

683
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:42,106
JEONG SE YEON

684
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:55,286
- Hey.
- Answer the phone.

685
00:44:55,586 --> 00:44:57,485
Gosh, she should wake up.

686
00:44:57,485 --> 00:44:59,356
Miss, excuse me.

687
00:45:42,465 --> 00:45:45,336
No one will recognize you
without your makeup on.

688
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:47,005
You didn't have
run away like that.

689
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:49,075
Just in case.

690
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:52,675
I wonder if this is
how fugitives feel.

691
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:55,186
I couldn't enjoy the sauna
or eat chicken feet...

692
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,646
because of you. Hey,
let's get burgers.

693
00:45:58,615 --> 00:45:59,816
Here's my card. Go get it.

694
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:01,215
You get it.

695
00:46:01,856 --> 00:46:04,186
What about my car? Go. Now.

696
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,126
I'm getting two then.

697
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:07,825
Sure.

698
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:14,295
- You're going to wear that?
- Yes.

00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:30,916
I really did see her.

702
00:46:36,786 --> 00:46:38,655
- Enjoy.
- What should we have?

703
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:41,496
- What?
- Han Seo Jun beat us?

704
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,525
They said nasty stuff
about Shinhwa kids.

705
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:45,295
What? Who is...

706
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,266
- I'm mad now.
- What are you having?

707
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,365
Whatever. Order anything
and come upstairs.

708
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,575
- Darn it. So?
- That's right.

709
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:57,005
Order number two.
Your order's ready.

710
00:46:57,746 --> 00:46:59,345
We'll have a big burger...

711
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:01,786
- Thank you.
- Original please.

712
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:02,885
And a premium burger.

713
00:47:02,885 --> 00:47:04,516
Cop came by, so I left.

714
00:47:04,516 --> 00:47:05,655
Use my card. Take a cab.

715
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,925
Who's this? Lim Ju Kyung?

716
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,095
Hey.

717
00:47:13,825 --> 00:47:16,626
Wow. It has been so long.

718
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,025
You're still as red as ever.

719
00:47:18,025 --> 00:47:19,536
Did you get even uglier?

720
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,066
I'll go then.

721
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:23,365
Hey.

722
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:26,235
Where are you going?
I'm not done yet.

723
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,106
Where did you transfer to?

724
00:47:30,376 --> 00:47:32,215
To the suburbs.

725
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:34,746
I'm visiting relatives.

726
00:47:34,746 --> 00:47:38,155
Kids are saying you transferred
because I bullied you.

727
00:47:39,516 --> 00:47:42,126
What were you going
around saying to people?

728
00:47:42,786 --> 00:47:45,655
Why are you making me...

729
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:48,396
sound like an evil witch?

730
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,396
I didn't.

731
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:55,135
Oh no. That must hurt.

732
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,575
Hey. Give me your number.

733
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:15,456
My wallet.

734
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:18,655
My school ID.

735
00:48:19,695 --> 00:48:22,266
- Hey, look at this.
- Nice.

736
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,896
- It's pretty.
- She hasn't changed.

737
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:53,295
Here.

738
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:02,836
Are you okay?

739
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:05,106
Am I okay?

740
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:08,606
Why? Did you help me
out of pity again?

741
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:12,146
We're not even close. Why
didn't you just keep walking?

742
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:14,816
Who are you to help
me? It's humiliating!

743
00:49:14,816 --> 00:49:16,916
- Ju Kyung.
- Like an idiot,

744
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,186
I thought we got
close and got excited,

745
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:22,825
and you said to get over myself.

746
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,996
You said I was annoying.

747
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:28,496
Ju Kyung.

748
00:49:28,496 --> 00:49:30,425
So I avoided you as you wanted.

749
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:33,735
You drew a line first, but
why are you doing this again?

750
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:36,505
Stop flip flopping
and confusing me.

751
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,306
Ju Kyung.

752
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:42,646
It's them, isn't it?

753
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:47,175
The kids who bullied you...

754
00:49:49,545 --> 00:49:50,885
before you transferred.

755
00:49:55,485 --> 00:49:56,626
You must've been startled.

756
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:02,825
You must've been scared.

757
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:27,556
I think I just saw Soo Ho.

758
00:50:27,715 --> 00:50:28,925
- Soo Ho?
- Yes.

759
00:50:30,586 --> 00:50:31,626
What's wrong?

760
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:34,595
- Cho Rong's there.
- What?

761
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:38,126
Darn it. Again?

762
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:41,036
What are you talking
about? Let's go.

763
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:42,166
I'm sure it was him.

764
00:50:44,965 --> 00:50:47,106
- Did he leave?
- What?

765
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:53,246
No.

766
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,286
Not yet.

767
00:50:58,615 --> 00:50:59,816
Oh no.

768
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:08,425
It's okay.

769
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:12,235
It's okay now.

770
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,295
Don't get caught. Bye.

771
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:06,316
I'm telling you. Seriously.

772
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:08,016
Where was that again?

773
00:52:08,016 --> 00:52:11,056
Wow. Look who it is.

774
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:12,126
Han Seo Jun is here.

775
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,695
Let's have burgers another time.

776
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:16,996
Let's go.

777
00:52:17,726 --> 00:52:21,496
Hey, you. Why do you keep
jetting whenever you see me?

778
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,436
We used to hang out together.

779
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:25,775
Are you drawing a line now?

780
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:28,135
I'm hurt.

781
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:30,175
Let's not cause a scene.

782
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:33,016
He's mad scary when
he talks all serious.

783
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:38,586
My bad. I thought this
was a garbage can.

784
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:43,726
- Do you want to die?
- Leave unless you want to die.

785
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:46,356
I don't want to waste my time
with hoodlums like you anymore.

786
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,865
Sun Ho. Let's just go.

787
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:55,436
What? What will you do here?

788
00:52:57,135 --> 00:52:59,505
When should we face off?

789
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:01,575
We'll see.

790
00:53:02,905 --> 00:53:03,976
Let's go.

791
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:05,775
Stop it.

792
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,695
No. Don't blink.

793
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:28,635
Stay like this for 15 minutes.

794
00:53:28,735 --> 00:53:32,876
It'll be awkward at first, but
it'll look natural over time.

795
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:37,175
Once you give this face
nice, thick eyebrows,

796
00:53:37,275 --> 00:53:39,575
that will be the final touch.

797
00:53:39,575 --> 00:53:40,646
Thank you.

798
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,186
It's raining out.

799
00:53:47,755 --> 00:53:49,056
Mr. Han Joon Woo?

800
00:53:50,456 --> 00:53:51,586
Ms. Lim Hee Kyung?

801
00:53:53,425 --> 00:53:54,525
Mr. Han.

802
00:53:54,795 --> 00:53:57,896
Do you know my eldest daughter?

803
00:53:57,896 --> 00:53:59,735
- No.
- "No"?

804
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:01,695
Eldest daughter?

805
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,266
- Ju Kyung's sister?
- Yes.

806
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:09,376
My shoes. My shoes.

807
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:10,806
Your shoes? Shoes.

808
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:12,115
Oh my gosh.

809
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:14,316
Oh my gosh. What?

810
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:15,945
- What's wrong?
- Have a nice day.

811
00:54:15,945 --> 00:54:18,485
Hey! Where are you
going? Joon Woo!

812
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:21,985
Joon Woo!

813
00:54:26,456 --> 00:54:27,525
Joon Woo!

814
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:38,635
I got you.

815
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:45,376
You'll catch a cold. Take this.

816
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,786
- What are you doing?
- You're getting wet.

817
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,325
You use it.

818
00:54:57,485 --> 00:54:58,925
I'm fine. Take it.

819
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:01,295
But you'll get wet.

820
00:55:01,626 --> 00:55:03,595
You're getting wet. Come here.

821
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:17,775
I can't take it.

822
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,675
I'm going to do something bad.

823
00:55:23,816 --> 00:55:25,215
Run away if you're scared.

824
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:50,806
Get home safely!

825
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,715
Pick up when I call!

826
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:41,496
Access granted.

827
00:57:02,445 --> 00:57:07,456
YOU CAN MAKE IT. GOOD LUCK!

828
00:58:05,306 --> 00:58:06,416
Se Yeon,

829
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:08,945
what do I do?

830
00:58:18,925 --> 00:58:20,956
Lee Sung Ryong,
you annoying jerk.

831
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,825
Why have you been
calling since yesterday?

832
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:28,695
Lim Ju Kyung?

833
00:58:31,066 --> 00:58:32,476
But I was here too.

834
00:58:36,505 --> 00:58:37,876
She's showing off her looks.

835
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:46,086
Tarzan in his one-cent underwear

836
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:48,885
Roar!

837
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:03,965
Roar!

838
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:22,255
- Come on.
- Let it curve.

839
00:59:22,255 --> 00:59:24,385
- Please...
- We'll see.

840
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:26,255
Nice!

841
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,396
See? Can you believe that shot?

842
00:59:29,726 --> 00:59:31,425
How can one miss this shot?

843
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:35,365
You're not going with me when
I skipped school for this?

844
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:38,306
Let me play just one more game.

845
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:40,175
That's what you said earlier.

846
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:43,345
It'll end soon, okay?
Just wait over there.

847
00:59:43,345 --> 00:59:44,706
Is Han Seo Jun still
dodging your calls?

848
00:59:44,775 --> 00:59:47,246
He's ignoring me,
that pretentious jerk.

849
00:59:52,016 --> 00:59:53,255
Just watch.

850
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,485
- No way!
- What the...

851
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:56,586
I know...

852
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:57,686
- who Han Seo Jun's girlfriend is.
- What?

853
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:00,755
Her name's Lim Ju Kyung.

854
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:06,036
Lim Ju Kyung?

855
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:08,635
She's Lim Ju Kyung too.

856
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:12,135
What a joke.

857
01:00:12,135 --> 01:00:14,235
What are the chances of
her having the same name?

858
01:00:16,206 --> 01:00:17,206
It's the same person.

859
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:18,876
- She's stunning.
- Hey.

860
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:22,746
Is she really Han
Seo Jun's girlfriend?

861
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,255
No way.

862
01:00:28,655 --> 01:00:30,356
What are the chances?

863
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:32,626
- Lim Ju Kyung?
- She's pretty.

864
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:37,825
Today...

865
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,036
- Study hard, guys.
- What?

866
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,336
- What?
- What on earth?

867
01:00:49,206 --> 01:00:52,416
Absence is Soo Ho...
Soo Ho's absent today,

868
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,215
- so just know that.
- What?

869
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:56,715
- Mr. Han!
- What was that?

870
01:00:57,345 --> 01:00:58,956
Hold on. What about
his quote of the day?

871
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,655
Maybe he's out of
quotes to deliver.

872
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:04,456
- Maybe nature called him.
- And now it's calling me.

873
01:01:04,586 --> 01:01:06,396
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Hey.

874
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:08,025
Hold on.

875
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:11,896
He's absent?

876
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,135
I wonder why.

877
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:16,905
What's up with him?

878
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,675
SOO HO, SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO YOU?

879
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:24,275
Soo Ho, something
happened to you?

880
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:41,496
I wonder if something came up.

881
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:44,626
Did he walk in the
rain yesterday?

882
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:47,336
Could he be sick?

883
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,206
Why weren't you at school...

884
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:27,376
LEE SOO HO

885
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,376
Are you perhaps sick?

886
01:02:29,376 --> 01:02:30,646
LEE SOO HO

887
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,945
WHAT ABOUT "THE
VOICE OF THE SPIRIT"?

888
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:36,586
Get me melon ice
cream on the way home.

889
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:39,916
That darn brat thinks
I'm his errand girl.

890
01:02:47,195 --> 01:02:50,726
The creatinine level has
decreased since last time...

891
01:02:51,095 --> 01:02:53,066
and everything
else seems normal.

892
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:55,066
I'll lower your dose...

893
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:56,536
- of medication.
- Sure.

894
01:02:57,336 --> 01:02:58,465
That's a relief.

895
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:01,936
- That's great news, Mom.
- See? I told you not to worry.

896
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:05,545
- Thank you.
- That should be said to Dr. Kang.

897
01:03:06,146 --> 01:03:08,016
An acquaintance of yours...

898
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:10,545
requested the best
staff to be on her case.

899
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:12,246
My acquaintance?

900
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,786
It won't take long!

901
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:16,286
But he's currently in surgery.

902
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,126
Besides, you must make
an appointment first.

903
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,726
But it won't take long!

904
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:20,755
What's going on here?

905
01:03:44,985 --> 01:03:47,556
LIM JU KYUNG, KANG SOO JIN

906
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:49,086
WHAT ABOUT "THE
VOICE OF THE SPIRIT"?

907
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:58,695
She's killing me.

908
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:03,905
I should've checked
before sending it.

909
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:06,606
This is mortifying!

910
01:04:07,336 --> 01:04:08,606
You idiot.

911
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:09,945
MY FRIEND SOO AH

912
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:13,345
I'm almost there.
I'll save you a seat.

913
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:25,226
Hi, Lim Ju Kyung.

914
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:27,425
How have you been?

915
01:04:29,095 --> 01:04:32,095
- As if we'd let you go easily.
- Did we startle you?

916
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:36,965
Where are you going?

917
01:04:37,436 --> 01:04:38,465
Come on.

918
01:04:42,005 --> 01:04:43,275
It was the first time
he came to see me...

919
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:44,675
after the death of his mother.

920
01:04:45,106 --> 01:04:49,615
He begged me in tears to
help a friend's mother.

921
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,126
Why are you here?

922
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,865
Is it true that
you know Dr. Kang?

923
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,226
Who told you that?

924
01:05:06,735 --> 01:05:07,795
Why did you do it?

925
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:16,575
Did you think I'd come
and thank you in tears?

926
01:05:16,905 --> 01:05:19,106
Is that why you did
that behind my back?

927
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,945
Wouldn't you have
done the same thing?

928
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:25,246
- What?
- If you were me,

929
01:05:26,615 --> 01:05:29,056
wouldn't you have done
the same to save my mom?

930
01:05:30,255 --> 01:05:34,226
Because you were my friend.
That's why I did it.

931
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:37,325
If that makes you angry,

932
01:05:38,496 --> 01:05:39,735
just forget it happened.

933
01:05:40,795 --> 01:05:41,865
That's what you should do.

934
01:05:43,836 --> 01:05:44,936
Lee Soo Ho!

935
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:48,376
Why is Ju Kyung calling me?

936
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:53,075
Hey, Seo Jun.

937
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,575
You must've picked up right away
because it's your girlfriend.

938
01:05:58,445 --> 01:06:00,916
Seo Jun, I'll be waiting,
so hurry up over here.

939
01:06:02,056 --> 01:06:03,425
I miss you.

940
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:07,496
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

941
01:06:07,626 --> 01:06:11,365
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

942
01:06:11,365 --> 01:06:13,795
- I trusted love
- I trusted love

943
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,735
- But I got betrayed
- But I got betrayed

944
01:06:18,366 --> 01:06:19,436
What's going on?

945
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:21,476
Darn it.

946
01:06:22,476 --> 01:06:23,675
What's going on?

947
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:33,955
Why isn't Ju Kyung here? She
told me she was almost here.

948
01:06:33,955 --> 01:06:36,486
I guess she decided
to skip class today.

949
01:06:36,486 --> 01:06:38,526
Ju Kyung isn't the type
to skip class, okay?

950
01:06:38,526 --> 01:06:40,326
The receiver cannot be reached.
Please leave a message...

951
01:06:40,326 --> 01:06:42,326
She isn't even picking up.
Do you think she's okay?

952
01:06:42,326 --> 01:06:44,226
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

953
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:49,165
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

954
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:52,875
What do you want to do until
your boyfriend gets here?

955
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:56,845
I don't have a boyfriend.

956
01:06:57,406 --> 01:06:59,446
Oh, you don't?

957
01:06:59,446 --> 01:07:02,745
- Look who's here
- Come on.

958
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:08,316
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

959
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:12,285
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

960
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:14,495
- I can't believe what I see
- I can't believe what I see

961
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:17,196
- So I look again
- So I look again

962
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:19,995
- But it's really you
- But it's really you

963
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:22,665
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

964
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:27,106
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

965
01:07:27,106 --> 01:07:29,406
- I trusted love
- I trusted love

966
01:07:29,406 --> 01:07:32,106
- But I got betrayed
- But I got betrayed

967
01:07:32,106 --> 01:07:34,816
- Yes, you
- Yes, you

968
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:37,845
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing there?

969
01:07:38,085 --> 01:07:39,146
- What are you
- What are you

970
01:07:39,146 --> 01:07:41,116
Ju Kyung, you went
to a karaoke room?

971
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:42,255
What?

972
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:44,656
You should've told me...

973
01:07:44,755 --> 01:07:47,495
Wait. I think they're bullies.

974
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,465
What? Are they trying
to take money from her?

975
01:07:51,696 --> 01:07:52,896
Where is this place?

976
01:07:54,465 --> 01:07:57,236
Wait. I think I've
been there before.

977
01:08:01,436 --> 01:08:03,875
KARAOKE ROOM

978
01:08:07,146 --> 01:08:08,616
KARAOKE ROOM

979
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:32,366
- Vroom, vroom
- Vroom, vroom

980
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:35,476
- I go to you like
- I go to you like

981
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:39,646
Who's this? You're
not the guy I called.

982
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:40,816
Ju Kyung.

983
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:42,785
Soo Ho?

984
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:48,186
Oh, wait. He's the guy
who followed us last time.

985
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:49,285
Oh, him?

986
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:50,385
Hey!

987
01:08:52,285 --> 01:08:53,795
What are you doing?

988
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:57,295
Hey, get him!

989
01:09:01,936 --> 01:09:03,606
- Hey!
- It's Han Seo Jun.

990
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:04,965
- Seo Jun is here.
- Go get him.

991
01:09:04,965 --> 01:09:06,035
Darn it.

992
01:09:09,106 --> 01:09:10,375
Get him!

993
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:12,076
Soo Ho, come on.

994
01:09:21,085 --> 01:09:22,285
- Hey...
- Come here.

995
01:09:22,385 --> 01:09:24,625
- What's your problem?
- You punk.

996
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:28,056
Hey!

997
01:09:41,906 --> 01:09:43,476
We're here!

998
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:49,116
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

999
01:09:51,385 --> 01:09:52,415
No.

1000
01:09:53,385 --> 01:09:56,016
- Who are these jerks?
- Who are you guys?

1001
01:09:58,085 --> 01:09:59,556
"AMOR FATI" BY KIM YEON JA

1002
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,795
- Gosh, are you okay?
- Has she lost her mind?

1003
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:02,995
Let's go!

1004
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:09,236
You little jerk.

1005
01:10:12,635 --> 01:10:14,906
- Hey!
- My gosh.

1006
01:10:16,306 --> 01:10:17,446
Get over here!

1007
01:10:21,776 --> 01:10:23,715
Nice one!

1008
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:24,715
Hey!

1009
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:27,455
My gosh.

1010
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:30,526
I like focusing on one thing.

1011
01:10:30,755 --> 01:10:32,326
Why me again?

1012
01:10:32,356 --> 01:10:34,226
My gosh.

1013
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:36,356
TRUE BEAUTY

1014
01:11:39,285 --> 01:11:40,955
<i>My heart is about to burst.</i>

1015
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,196
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

1016
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:45,396
<i>That must hurt.</i>

1017
01:11:45,826 --> 01:11:47,035
<i>What happened?</i>

1018
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:48,835
<i>Thanks.</i>

1019
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:54,175
<i>- Can I have your number?
- Give him your number!</i>

1020
01:11:54,175 --> 01:11:56,005
<i>I came just in case Ju
Kyung might be here.</i>

1021
01:11:56,576 --> 01:11:57,606
<i>I was worried.</i>

1022
01:11:58,406 --> 01:11:59,406
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1023
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:03,516
<i>Do you want to go
on a date with me?</i>
