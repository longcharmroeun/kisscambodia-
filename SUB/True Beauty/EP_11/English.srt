00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,682
EPISODE 11

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,521
- Okay, sir.
- Sir.

3
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,461
- What's going on?
- Was this really necessary?

4
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:22,461
Ms. Lim, what are you doing?

5
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:25,292
I get that you didn't
want Se Yeon's name...

6
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,001
to become an issue again.

7
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:29,702
But how could you
even steal his song...

8
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,001
to cover up your mistake?

9
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:33,641
- What is she talking about?
- It's nothing, sir.

10
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:38,111
He doesn't care
about the rookies.

11
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,541
- Let's go. Let's talk outside.
- Let go.

12
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,041
I said, let go!

13
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,592
You had a reporter
publish an article...

14
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:55,891
about Se Yeon being
a bully in school...

15
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:58,092
to prevent this photo of you and
the actress from becoming an issue.

16
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,602
If you felt even the slightest bit
of responsibility about his death,

17
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:03,471
you shouldn't have done this.

18
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:07,071
Even if this song has no copyright,
this is still plagiarism.

19
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:10,772
How dare you barge in here
and talk all that nonsense?

20
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:12,341
Come on.

21
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:15,841
Se Yeon and Leo are only 18.

22
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,852
You also have a son yourself.

23
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:19,681
If you feel bad for doing
this to these kids...

24
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,082
who are young enough
to be your son,

25
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,052
you should set things straight.

26
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,461
It's better for you to take
care of this yourself...

27
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,761
rather than to have me
blow the whistle on you.

28
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,561
Are you threatening
me right now?

29
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,502
Think whatever you want.

30
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:41,472
I came to tell you this
knowing I could get fired.

31
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,341
Have you lost your mind?

32
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,311
I'll leave on my own.

33
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:02,961
Soo Ho.

34
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:07,662
Soo Ho.

35
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,402
Soo Ho!

36
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,271
Did you hear the song?

37
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,812
The song that was released
by Move Entertainment.

38
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,342
That jerk. Hey!

39
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:23,081
Soo Ho!

40
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,331
Guys, what do you think?
Should we get one each?

41
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:39,331
- It's not so bad.
- Oh, please. It's too childish.

42
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,002
Try one on. Let me help.

43
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,342
There. Let's see how they look.

44
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,712
Don't you ever take this off.

45
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:52,882
Right back at you.

46
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,502
- Congratulations, congratulations.
- Congratulations, congratulations.

47
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,212
- Congratulations on Se Yeon's debut.
- Congratulations on Se Yeon's debut.

48
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,741
- Congratulations.
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

49
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:29,581
I just felt bad.

50
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:30,812
Why would you feel bad?

51
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,782
You became a trainee before me,
so it's natural you start first.

52
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,321
Congratulations, Se Yeon.

53
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,192
- My gosh.
- Get over here.

54
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:38,921
- Look at him.
- Nice.

55
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,962
I came up with one. "Leo".
What do you think? Nice, right?

56
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,162
"Leo". It suits you, Soo Ho.

57
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:46,962
Leo and Se Yeon.

58
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:50,331
Will you guys give me this
song after I make a debut?

59
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,671
Why would we give this to you?

60
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,801
- What?
- I'm going to sing a duet with you.

61
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,171
Who says?

62
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:59,912
- Let me hear you guys sing first.
- What? Is it an audition or what?

63
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,611
- What?
- An audition sounds nice.

64
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,811
"MISSING YOU"

65
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:01,972
Hurry.

66
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,952
EMERGENCY WARD

67
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:20,762
Soo Ho! Soo Ho!

68
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,691
Soo Ho! Please open
the door, Soo Ho.

69
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,291
Soo Ho!

70
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,061
Please let me in.

71
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,532
Soo Ho! Soo Ho!

72
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:32,171
- Isn't he Jeong Se Yeon?
- "Jeong Se Yeon"?

73
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,072
The guy who committed
school violence.

74
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:36,001
Oh, that guy who was on
the real-time search list?

75
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,512
It's a huge issue.

76
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:38,871
But what's he doing here?

77
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,381
SE YEON

78
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:46,621
Reporter Choi, Mr. Lee's
too busy to date anyone.

79
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:50,121
They only went for drinks
after filming was wrapped up.

80
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:53,121
A sponsor? That's
an absurd rumor...

81
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,892
Of course.

82
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,602
JEONG SE YEON

83
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:13,642
JEONG SE YEON

84
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:19,452
"WAS JEONG SE YEON OF
N-6IX A SCHOOL BULLY?"

85
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,322
PEOPLE WHO COMMIT SCHOOL
VIOLENCE ALL DESERVE TO DIE.

86
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:24,621
HE SHOULD BE SOCIALLY OSTRACIZED.
IS HE NOT SORRY AT ALL?

87
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,121
IT MUST BE TRUE SEEING THAT
HIS AGENCY ISN'T DEFENDING HIM.

88
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,662
I HOPE THE VICTIMS CHEER UP.
THE TRUTH IS GETTING REVEALED.

89
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,301
But I didn't do it.

90
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,702
I didn't do anything.

91
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:40,871
I really didn't do it.

92
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,371
It was Jeong Se Yeon
who committed suicide.

93
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:13,602
- The K-pop idol singer?
- Really?

94
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,611
- You can't cross the line.
- Please step back.

95
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:28,222
POLICE

96
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,181
BOYFRIEND

97
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,921
BOYFRIEND

98
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:11,431
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

99
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:30,181
Ju Kyung.

100
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:32,452
What are you doing
here at this hour?

101
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,981
I have something to tell you.

102
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:38,192
Something to tell me?

103
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,991
I don't think I should
postpone this any longer.

104
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,292
Soo Jin, the truth is,

105
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:51,771
I'm going out with Soo Ho.

106
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,172
I also like him a lot.

107
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:04,481
I didn't mean to
hide it from you.

108
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,682
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

109
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:10,952
But when you told me you
had feelings for him,

110
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,621
I couldn't bring
myself to tell you.

111
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:17,832
I was scared we
might drift apart.

112
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,901
I didn't want to lose you.

113
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,901
But...

114
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:30,442
I just couldn't
keep lying to you.

115
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,011
I'm so sorry.

116
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,422
I see.

117
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,621
I'd be lying if I
told you I'm okay.

118
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,722
It's upsetting.

119
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,991
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:51,592
But this isn't the first
time I felt this way...

121
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,332
toward Soo Ho.

122
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,261
And back then, it
didn't last long.

123
00:09:56,832 --> 00:10:00,342
When you're friends with someone
for a long time, it's normal...

124
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:02,141
to get confused
every now and then.

125
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,771
That's just all it is.

126
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,682
So you don't need to
feel so bad about it.

127
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,082
- Soo Jin.
- You're making me feel like...

128
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,952
I gave you a hard time by
telling you how I feel.

129
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:16,021
So don't cry.

130
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:20,192
You didn't do anything
wrong. Look at me.

131
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,521
I just feel so bad.

132
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:25,031
I'm so sorry.

133
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,631
Soo Ho likes you.

134
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,302
So there's nothing I can do.

135
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:36,712
Once I get over him,

136
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:40,312
your relationship with Soo
Ho and our friendship...

137
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,312
will stay the same.

138
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,312
I look even more ugly now
that my eyes are all swollen.

139
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:29,592
BOYFRIEND

140
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:37,832
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

141
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,972
Is he still angry?

142
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,781
Did he get into an accident because
he got shocked by what I said?

143
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:51,481
What are you doing outside?

144
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,111
I just feel a bit frustrated.

145
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,621
Why did you come outside? You'll
catch a cold. Go back inside.

146
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,052
I also feel frustrated. I
want to get some fresh air.

147
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,092
Is there something wrong?

148
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:02,822
It's nothing.

149
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,462
Hee Kyung, what's
the matter with me?

150
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,771
What do you mean?

151
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,731
Every time something happens,

152
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:15,771
I always end up hiding
because I get too scared.

153
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:18,511
That makes things
more complicated,

154
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,111
and I end up hurting people
even though I don't mean to.

155
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:24,911
Why can't I just be
honest from the start?

156
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:29,121
I can be too careless at times.

157
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,922
And you get scared too easily.

158
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,391
From now on, try
being more honest.

159
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,592
Look what happened to Dad.

160
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:42,501
He should've just told
us that he got scammed.

161
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,432
But he tried to handle
it on his own...

162
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,602
only to end up
with a bigger debt.

163
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:49,672
And because of that, we had to sell
our apartment and move back here.

164
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,342
I'm sorry, girls.

165
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,712
Dad. Dad. He's crying again.

166
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,222
How long was he there?

167
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,422
He could've told
us he was there.

168
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:07,822
By the way, did you say you're
friends with my boss' son?

169
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:08,991
Lee Soo Ho?

170
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,391
Yes. Why?

171
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:13,661
He got into a car accident in
front of the company building.

172
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:14,661
What?

173
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,901
A car accident?

174
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,771
Soo Ho.

175
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:00,911
Soo Ho.

176
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,661
You can go.

177
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:57,131
I can't rest comfortably
if you two are here.

178
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,442
Still, I can't leave you alone.
It's uncomfortable with the cast.

179
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,842
Go. I'm just going
to sleep anyway.

180
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,371
You're so stubborn.

181
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:07,641
Then I'll come back in the
morning with your stuff.

182
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:11,082
You should've been
careful. We were so scared.

183
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,582
Go, go. I want to sleep.

184
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:15,281
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

185
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,621
Go back in.

186
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:39,442
Is Soo Ho okay?

187
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,812
Explain what Ms.
Lim said earlier.

188
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,011
Well...

189
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:50,692
In order to bury your
scandal last year...

190
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:52,552
What?

191
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,531
Nothing happened.

192
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,442
How could I possibly
date someone that young?

193
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:13,042
We live in the same building, so
I drove her home after a party.

194
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:16,481
They say living in the same building
proves you have a relationship,

195
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,812
so they plan to publish
an article on Monday.

196
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:24,822
Stop it. What
would Soo Ho think?

197
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,361
He won't talk to me as is.

198
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:33,231
It may hurt our merger.

199
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,462
Use money or whatever
it takes to stop them.

200
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:38,102
I'll take care of it.

201
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,602
Even still.

202
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,741
How could you use
someone from our agency?

203
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,342
I really thought Se
Yeon was a school bully.

204
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,442
There were comments online
that he changed his name...

205
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:50,352
after going to the juvenile
detention center...

206
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:51,781
when he was in middle school.

207
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:53,212
We checked the facts,

208
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,852
but it turned out the
bullies were behind it.

209
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,751
I found out Se
Yeon was framed...

210
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,692
when I read about
it in the article.

211
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:03,861
Then you should've told
me when you found out!

212
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,731
How could you keep it from me?

213
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,232
Se Yeon was dead by then.

214
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,602
What was the point?

215
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:15,641
And whether or not it was
true, words were spreading,

216
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,411
so it was bound to
get out eventually.

217
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,582
What's wrong with
speeding it up?

218
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:27,022
Shut your mouth. He committed
suicide because of it.

219
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,022
Don't you get it yet?

220
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,721
And then what? You
plagiarized his song?

221
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,861
How could you steal
a dead kid's song?

222
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,141
Soo Ho.

223
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:58,282
Soo Ho!

224
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,221
How badly were you hurt?

225
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,921
I'm sorry.

226
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,191
It's because I got mad.

227
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:11,062
I'm sorry. Wake up. Please.

228
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:22,941
Who are you?

229
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:29,325
Who are you?

230
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,004
- Who are you?
- Sis!

231
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:40,974
Soo Ho!

232
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,274
Sis?

233
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:46,984
You have a sister?

234
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,385
A cousin who's like a sister.

235
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:55,954
When did you come?

236
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:59,095
What? I... I just got here.

237
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:12,204
Don't cry. I'm fine.

238
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,744
It's not serious.

239
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,345
Sis.

240
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,115
I'm glad.

241
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,444
I kept calling, but
you wouldn't pick up.

242
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:24,984
I thought you were badly hurt.

243
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:27,224
I lost my phone in the accident.

244
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,085
I see.

245
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,925
You must be very
close to your cousin.

246
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,395
She was bawling just
because of a little cast.

247
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:40,835
We're very close.

248
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,034
I'll let you rest.

249
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:46,534
You're leaving already?

250
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:50,345
He's right. You came all this
way. You should stay longer...

251
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,944
Sis.

252
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,085
No. I'll go now.

253
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,184
Sis?

254
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:03,425
Oh my gosh.

255
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,625
A GENERAL WARD

256
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:09,625
What's going on? He was in
the accident with Seo Jun?

257
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,494
How did they...

258
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,234
It looked like he broke his leg.

259
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:18,274
Should I just sneak
a peek at his face?

260
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,244
No, no. I should...

261
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:25,175
Why are you sitting
on a patient?

262
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:29,345
- Sorry.
- Wait.

263
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:32,085
Stay like this for a minute.

264
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,294
I missed you like crazy.

265
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:51,974
You're hurt.

266
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,534
It's okay.

267
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:58,875
I feel fine now that I saw you.

268
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:12,095
I really am okay.

269
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:14,395
Where did this punk go?

270
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:24,575
Whatever. I don't care whether
or not you get your shot.

271
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:28,405
I don't care if you're in pain.

272
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:39,355
Sorry for getting mad at you.

273
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:44,794
I'm sorry too.

274
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:46,625
I won't do it again.

275
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:50,294
- Forgive me.
- I won't do it again either.

276
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:52,395
Forgive me.

277
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:57,534
What happened, though? How
did you get into an accident?

278
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:03,605
Ju Kyung.

279
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:05,944
What do I do?

280
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:11,355
Se Yeon...

281
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:30,905
Your girl will be mine for sure!

282
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:37,175
Too slow.

283
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,444
What you heard didn't
come from my mouth.

284
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,115
Where were you at this hour?

285
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:50,754
What on earth?

286
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,494
What a sap.

287
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:16,815
Sleep tight. I'll
come by tomorrow too.

288
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:22,484
Right. He lost his phone.

289
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:34,805
Close the window, will you?

290
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,405
Close it.

291
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:48,714
Talk about being unlucky.

292
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,794
Why did you run into the street?

293
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:03,224
You ended up injured too.

294
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:05,794
It wasn't because
of you, you know.

295
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,534
Your father thinks I'm Leo.

296
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:17,575
How can they do this after
first planning a memorial album?

297
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:23,184
What did you tell your father when
you bought all those instruments?

298
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:26,585
This wouldn't have happened
had you told him sooner.

299
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:29,655
Don't you find this unfair?

300
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,165
You had a reporter
publish an article...

301
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:39,534
about Se Yeon being
a bully in school...

302
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:41,565
to prevent this photo of you and
the actress from becoming an issue.

303
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,305
But how could you
even steal his song...

304
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:44,534
to cover up your mistake?

305
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:00,615
Ju Kyung.

306
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:04,724
Hey, Soo Jin. Did
you sleep well?

307
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,724
What are you, a robot?

308
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,665
Why are you being awkward?

309
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:11,994
Was I? I didn't mean to be.

310
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,034
Please don't, okay?

311
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:14,434
I'd hate for things to
be awkward between us.

312
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,004
I see you tied your
hair back today.

313
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:18,635
Me too. Look.

314
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:21,675
It's pretty.

315
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,744
Let's go.

316
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:28,345
Could we perhaps push up
the study session to today?

317
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:30,984
I have an extra class
lined up for tomorrow.

318
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:33,585
- But Soo Ho...
- What about him?

319
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:38,254
Soo Ho won't make it today
as he's in the hospital.

320
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:41,024
What? When?

321
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:43,494
He and Seo Jun were in a
car accident yesterday.

322
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:45,135
And you're telling me this now?

323
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:46,865
What?

324
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:52,204
Well, I only found
out last night.

325
00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:54,105
Is he badly hurt? Where
did the accident occur?

326
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:00,885
Forget it. I'll
just ask him myself.

327
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,885
You should head in. I need
to turn in my homework.

328
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:05,454
Sure.

329
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,405
I brought you some
clean underwear.

330
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:30,575
How are you feeling?

331
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:38,585
If you need extra help,
I'll hire a caregiver...

332
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:39,684
I don't need one.

333
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:42,784
I'd rather you not
come back here.

334
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:45,655
Soo Ho, what you
heard yesterday...

335
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,425
Seo Jun, Mom's here.

336
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:50,524
My gosh. Hello.

337
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:54,734
Yes, hello.

338
00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:59,274
We'll talk some other time.

339
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:16,655
- Mr. Han.
- Got it.

340
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,325
- Soo Jin.
- Yes?

341
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,625
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you help...

342
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,194
- sort out everyone's notebooks?
- Sure.

343
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:24,395
All right, new girl.
Head up to your class.

344
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:27,964
The class leader will
show you to your seat.

345
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,805
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

346
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,605
Mr. Han, didn't a student of yours
transfer from Yongpa High School?

347
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:38,714
Ju Kyung? Yes, she's
from Yongpa High.

348
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:42,115
I don't get why they'd transfer
to a neighboring school.

349
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:48,754
I did hear that students there
weren't exactly the nicest.

350
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:50,954
Sir, come on.

351
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,224
I'm sure the kids have
their own reasons.

352
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:07,605
- No, the meat.
- Just eat what I give you.

353
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:12,474
- There you go. Look at my baby eat.
- I'm not a baby.

354
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:15,284
This just reminds me of how I
fed you when you were young.

355
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:18,454
When did Mr. Trickle
get so big, right?

356
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:21,784
Soo Ho, did you know...

357
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:24,794
that Seo Jun's nickname
used to be Mr. Trickle?

358
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:28,125
- Mr. Trickle?
- Yes, we called him that because...

359
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,395
he couldn't stop wetting
his bed at night.

360
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:31,665
Why would you tell him that?

361
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,135
You did so until
you were about 10.

362
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:37,805
No, you wet your bed once or
twice in fifth grade as well.

363
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,335
Stop it, Mom.

364
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:42,744
As if there's anything
to be embarrassed by.

365
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:44,915
You're close enough to even
go to the sauna together.

366
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:49,115
How were you two involved
in the same accident though?

367
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:52,784
You rarely spend time together now
as if you've had a falling out.

368
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:57,625
Even when you came to
visit me in the hospital,

369
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:00,125
you told me not to tell Seo Jun.

370
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:03,194
I found it odd back then too.

371
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,434
That's not the case.

372
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:06,694
So how's your health?

373
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:09,365
Good. It's why I've
been out and about.

374
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:11,504
- Don't you have a job to get to?
- All right, fine.

375
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,004
Go ahead and have this.

376
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,004
Come on. That's it.

377
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:19,145
Are you done? I'll
clear these then.

378
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,684
Are you done as well? I'll
clear the plate for you.

379
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:28,125
I'm all right.

380
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,095
You can stick to
helping Mr. Trickle.

381
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:32,655
Hey!

382
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:39,434
I can still use
my legs, you know.

383
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,944
- What's with you?
- What do you mean?

384
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,284
- Is there an issue?
- No.

385
00:29:55,784 --> 00:29:56,885
Fine, then.

386
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:58,885
Lee Soo Ho.

387
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:02,325
Forget it.

388
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,395
I can't hold it in anymore!

389
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:07,764
- Hold what in?
- I need to pee.

390
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:10,524
Mr. Trickle strikes again.

391
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:12,665
Why are you telling me that?

392
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:15,565
- Who else can I tell?
- The nurse.

393
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,974
How can I tell the
nurse to lower my pants?

394
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,905
Yes, I'd like to change rooms.

395
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:24,345
- Are there any vacancies?
- Hey!

396
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:46,994
Darling, from what I hear,
Soo Ho and Seo Jun...

397
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:49,865
were injured in a fistfight
and not a car accident.

398
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:51,204
- Really?
- Yes.

399
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:53,004
It's weird how they
got injured together,

400
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:54,274
so that's what the rumors say.

401
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,605
Who do you think won?

402
00:30:55,704 --> 00:30:57,175
It was a car accident.

403
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:58,175
My sister saw it
as it happened...

404
00:30:58,175 --> 00:30:59,575
in front of the building
where she works.

405
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:03,345
Are you sure it wasn't a fistfight
in front of that building?

406
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:04,815
Not at all.

407
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:07,385
Shouldn't we visit Soo
Ho at the hospital?

408
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,625
Should we? Why don't
we all go tomorrow?

409
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,555
I'm late for my part-time
job. I'll get going.

410
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,125
- Bye, Jjoo!
- Work hard, Ju Kyung.

411
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:18,294
Lim Ju Kyung?

412
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:22,034
- Come on.
- Don't I know it.

413
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,135
What on earth?

414
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:24,704
Hi.

415
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:26,635
- Hi.
- Hi.

416
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,744
- I'm...
- Hi. Who might you girls be?

417
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,744
- She's talking to me, you know.
- Hold on a second.

418
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,714
Well, this is embarrassing
to ask, but...

419
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,714
- Ask me what?
- Your number!

420
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:41,585
- Congratulations.
- It's 010...

421
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:42,825
Do you know Han Seo Jun?

422
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,024
Han Seo Jun?

423
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:46,825
He's absent from school today.

424
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:48,494
We've been waiting at
the school gate, you see.

425
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:50,925
- To be honest, Seo Jun...
- Hey, Joo Hye Min!

426
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,635
Is it seriously that cow?

427
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:55,434
- Hey...
- Let's step back.

428
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,734
- What on earth?
- What's going on?

429
00:31:57,905 --> 00:32:00,305
- What are they doing?
- What now?

430
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:01,504
Wait for me!

431
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,774
I see you transferred
to Saebom High.

432
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:06,875
You switched schools after
reporting us as bullies...

433
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,784
only to land here of all places?

434
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,145
Stupid cow.

435
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:13,184
We were suspended from
school thanks to you.

436
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,625
- Why you...
- No, leave her be.

437
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:19,925
Hye Min, do you want us
to stop bullying you?

438
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,694
Answer me, you brat.

439
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:28,335
If you do what I ask,
we'll stop bothering you.

440
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:30,905
Can you do that for me?

441
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:33,875
Yes.

442
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,805
There's a girl named Lim
Ju Kyung at your school.

443
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:41,585
- Ju Kyung?
- She has the same name as Dumpling.

444
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:45,385
I want you to find out if she's
really dating Han Seo Jun.

445
00:32:47,514 --> 00:32:48,625
Aren't you going to answer me?

446
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,395
Okay, I will.

447
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,625
Okay, good. Keep me updated.

448
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:57,694
You know what will happen if
you ignore my texts, right?

449
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:12,845
Soo Ho.

450
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,245
Hey.

451
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:19,714
Are you here on a blind date?

452
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:23,524
How did you get in an accident?
You should've been more careful.

453
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,024
You didn't have to come.

454
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:27,095
I came because I was worried.

455
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:31,365
It's an air-purifying plant. You
don't need to water it often.

456
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:35,604
I heard you refused to
get help from a caregiver.

457
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:37,834
Your dad asked me
to take care of you,

458
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,475
so I brought some stuff
that you might need.

459
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:43,274
I brought a facial
cleanser and toner.

460
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,214
I also brought you your laptop.

461
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:50,314
- Thanks.
- No problem.

462
00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:53,314
Thank you, Seo Jun.

463
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:55,955
I heard you got hurt while
trying to save Soo Ho.

464
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,894
Why are you thanking me?
You're not his girlfriend.

465
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,854
If you're going to be so grumpy
about it, then I'll take it back.

466
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:03,894
Do you have to wear a
cast for a long time?

467
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:05,765
You don't need to get
surgery on your leg, right?

468
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:10,265
It's okay.

469
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,504
Did they only have
a double room?

470
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:17,644
Should I ask your dad to
move you to another hospital?

471
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:19,075
No, I'm good. Here.

472
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:22,615
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you be at your academy?

473
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:25,714
I still have time. Why are you
trying to make me leave so quickly?

474
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:28,024
- You're so mean.
- Why did you come by yourself?

475
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:29,885
Where's Ju Kyung?

476
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:31,694
What?

477
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,925
Aren't you guys best friends?

478
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:33,955
You always do things together,

479
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,225
so why didn't you
bring her with you?

480
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:37,464
She had a part-time job today.

481
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:41,095
Why? Were you waiting
for her to come?

482
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:44,334
Why are you asking me?
You should ask him.

483
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:51,475
Why should I ask him? Aren't
you the one dating Ju Kyung?

484
00:34:52,314 --> 00:34:54,214
- That's what our classmates think.
- What?

485
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:22,274
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

486
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:26,345
May I take your order?

487
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:30,644
Strawberries and grapefruit?

488
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:32,285
You must really like
refreshing drinks.

489
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:34,214
The taste of refreshing
drinks makes you feel nice.

490
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:39,095
It's just like you, Joon Woo.

491
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:40,825
How so?

492
00:35:47,135 --> 00:35:50,365
Because you're refreshing just
like grapefruit. Grapefruit.

493
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,975
Stop it. You can't
call me Grapefruit.

494
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:57,104
Why not? Isn't it normal for couples
to make nicknames for each other?

495
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:58,774
Right, Grapefruit?

496
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:01,144
Stop it, Strawberry.

497
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:02,944
See? It's weird.

498
00:36:05,854 --> 00:36:08,584
Hee Kyung, why didn't
you go to work today?

499
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:13,455
I had a reality check after I yelled
at my boss, so I took the day off.

500
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:16,164
Should I just quit
before I get fired?

501
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,064
Joon Woo.

502
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:21,564
Ju Kyung. Ju Kyung.

503
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:25,075
- Ju Kyung.
- What? What's the matter?

504
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:26,604
Joon Woo.

505
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:37,644
Are you that appalled
about Ju Kyung finding out?

506
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:41,185
I just feel a bit uneasy about
it because I'm her teacher.

507
00:36:41,524 --> 00:36:43,084
If she finds out,

508
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:46,024
she won't be able to think of
me as her homeroom teacher.

509
00:36:46,024 --> 00:36:49,765
And if the other kids find out,
they'll think I favored her...

510
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:52,595
every time I give her good
grades on her school work.

511
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:53,935
Okay, I get it.

512
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:56,104
Let's keep it a secret.

513
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:58,504
Thank you.

514
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,075
But why is she
working part-time?

515
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,044
Why is she making
money in secret?

516
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,615
She should be
studying right now.

517
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:13,115
It looks like Ju Kyung has...

518
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:16,055
a dream of her own.

519
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,024
She wrote on the
desired career sheet...

520
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:19,225
that she wants to
become a makeup artist.

521
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:20,794
Didn't you know?

522
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:22,194
"A makeup artist"?

523
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:28,464
What are you doing?

524
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:30,865
Hey, Mom. Punch me.

525
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:32,135
Punch you? Why?

526
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:35,205
Because I have
dynamic visual acuity.

527
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:38,575
Right. Left. Right. Left.

528
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,615
- Mom!
- Dynamic visual acuity, my foot.

529
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:43,814
Just go to the hospital for me.

530
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:47,015
- The hospital?
- Soo Ho got hospitalized.

531
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,285
He doesn't have a
mom to cook for him,

532
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:50,024
and you get sick of
hospital food after a while.

533
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,694
It's beef bone soup. Make
sure you give it to him.

534
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:54,865
How did he end up getting hurt?

535
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:56,124
But I'm busy right now.

536
00:37:57,365 --> 00:37:59,464
- Tell Dad to go instead.
- He went to the culture center.

537
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:01,334
Go deliver it right now.

538
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:08,905
SAEBOM CULTURE CENTER

539
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:13,644
Hey, we're going to
drink tea together.

540
00:38:13,644 --> 00:38:14,745
Would you like to join us?

541
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:18,685
Thank you for the invite,
but I need to cook dinner.

542
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:22,584
- What a family man.
- He's so kind.

543
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:24,555
I know a place that
sells delicious coffee.

544
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,655
- Really?
- If you come here...

545
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:28,765
to get your eyelashes
and eyebrows done,

546
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,225
you'll get coffee for free.

547
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,834
- We'll be there.
- Yes, of course.

548
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,865
- We'll see you next class.
- See you next time.

549
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:35,734
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

550
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,675
- I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

551
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,345
Columbus Park?

552
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:54,515
Hey! Stop!

553
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,885
Hey! Stop right there!

554
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:03,464
Hey! Stop! Where do
you think you're going?

555
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:06,664
Where do you think you're
going? Hey! Wait! Columbus...

556
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:13,274
Sir, please follow that car.

557
00:39:20,044 --> 00:39:21,414
Seo Jun's probably here too.

558
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:24,685
Why did I have to come with
no makeup on yesterday?

559
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:26,984
I need a mirror.

560
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:33,725
Is that good enough?

561
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:36,294
LEE S HO, HAN S JUN

562
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:40,464
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- Will you please do it properly?

563
00:39:47,575 --> 00:39:48,705
I'll come back later.

564
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:54,374
Hey, guys.

565
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,144
Hey, you're here.

566
00:39:57,984 --> 00:39:59,484
You guys look very close.

567
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:03,124
I was helping him get changed.

568
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:06,425
- Should I wait outside?
- Will you hurry up?

569
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:08,825
I'll hurry up and
get him dressed.

570
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:22,504
Are you going to the bathroom?

571
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:25,345
Do you need my help?

572
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:26,615
You help him with that?

573
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,914
I... I guess you
can't go by yourself.

574
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:34,984
Don't imagine it in your
head. I'm off to take a walk.

575
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:49,334
I brought this because I
thought you might be bored.

576
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,834
It looks heavy. You didn't
have to bring anything.

577
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:55,075
It looks fun.

578
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:00,845
I'll get it for you.

579
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:08,584
- Wait. Let me untangle it for you.
- Wait.

580
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:09,825
Sorry. Just a second.

581
00:41:12,524 --> 00:41:13,624
- Wait.
- My hair...

582
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:19,694
Hey, what...

583
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,635
This is from my mom.

584
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:27,075
I'll be off now. You guys can
continue what you were doing.

585
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:29,504
- It's not what you think.
- My hair's stuck...

586
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:32,615
Go ahead and kiss.

587
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:35,044
I'll kill you if you tell Mom.

588
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:37,584
- What are we going to do?
- Just a second.

589
00:41:38,555 --> 00:41:40,055
Sorry. Can you
move to the right?

590
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:43,524
- I'm sorry.
- What does Seo Jun like?

591
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:44,984
He loves chicken.

592
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:49,394
What are we going to do?

593
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:50,865
What are we going to do?

594
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,214
- Get in.
- Hold on.

595
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:02,723
- Seo Jun!
- We're here!

596
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:04,093
- He isn't here.
- Where is he?

597
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:07,363
- Soo Ho! Soo Ho!
- Darn it.

598
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,164
- Soo Ho!
- Seriously.

599
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,993
- Soo Ho!
- Stop!

600
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:14,303
- Don't touch me.
- Why not?

601
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:15,403
- It hurts.
- It hurts?

602
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:17,004
- It hurts?
- He's hurting.

603
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,473
Soo Ho!

604
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:20,144
- Don't touch him!
- Oh no.

605
00:42:20,144 --> 00:42:21,774
Just how bad is it?

606
00:42:25,183 --> 00:42:26,414
Am I dreaming?

607
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:27,883
- Whatever.
- Hold on.

608
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:30,013
What are you doing
here? Are you sick?

609
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,053
- I am not.
- Thank goodness.

610
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:35,624
Wait. Hold on. Don't you
want to know why I'm here?

611
00:42:35,624 --> 00:42:37,823
Don't you wonder if
I'm sick or something?

612
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:38,993
Not at all.

613
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,993
What's wrong? Are
you really sick?

614
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:47,064
I'm sick. I have a disease.

615
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,004
- A disease?
- It's terrible. Incurable.

616
00:42:50,174 --> 00:42:51,874
There are so many symptoms.

617
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:53,774
My brain can only
think about Go Woon.

618
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:55,843
My eyes can only see Go Woon.

619
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:57,573
My heart can only
beat for Go Woon.

620
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:01,883
My feet can only run to Go Woon!

621
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:04,113
- Oh my gosh.
- Seo Jun.

622
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:05,453
You're so sick.

623
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:07,153
- What?
- You poor thing.

624
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:10,294
but if it's incurable, you'll
die. Because I'll kill you.

625
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:16,394
- I will!
- Two.

626
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,394
leave Go Woon alone.

627
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:20,604
How dare you hit
on my baby sister?

628
00:43:20,604 --> 00:43:21,933
She says she isn't interested!

629
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,433
I'll make her interested!

630
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:26,674
- One!
- I will!

631
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:27,743
Two!

632
00:43:28,644 --> 00:43:30,513
keep liking Go Woon.

633
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:31,644
Why you...

634
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,683
I will keep liking Go Woon.

635
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:36,714
See you again, brother.

636
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:38,653
Stop right there!

637
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,084
He's such a freak.

638
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,694
Here. Your underwear. Underwear.

639
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:49,294
Does Ju Kyung know too?

640
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,493
That her brother likes you?

641
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:53,664
What? He's Ju Kyung's brother?

642
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:55,973
Yes. There.

643
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,803
Is that it?

644
00:43:58,504 --> 00:43:59,604
Yes.

645
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:03,174
It's good.

646
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,214
Try some.

647
00:44:06,214 --> 00:44:08,183
Seo Jun!

648
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:10,914
- You're alive.
- Come here.

649
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,254
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

650
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,754
Hey, Seo Jun! Are you okay?

651
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:17,694
- That hurts.
- It hurts?

652
00:44:17,694 --> 00:44:21,093
Seo Jun! You look good
in a hospital gown.

653
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:23,394
That injury is like
a medal of honor.

654
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,763
- You're awesome.
- Awesome.

655
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:26,734
I was worried sick about you!

656
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:29,604
- I had no appetite.
- Seriously.

657
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:33,144
Hey! You had no appetite
because you never stop eating.

658
00:44:33,444 --> 00:44:34,504
Gosh.

659
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:35,743
Excuse me!

660
00:44:36,113 --> 00:44:37,973
Can you guys keep it down?

661
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:39,814
Don't you see that sign?

662
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:41,013
You're not alone here.

663
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:43,153
I'm thirsty. Do you
have anything to drink?

664
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,524
Aloe...

665
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:53,664
Sorry. I'll fix it.

666
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:56,564
What is this?

667
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:58,133
Give that back.

668
00:44:58,133 --> 00:45:00,564
Look! It's underwear!

669
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,903
- What?
- Give me a break.

670
00:45:02,234 --> 00:45:03,573
- So fancy!
- So fancy!

671
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:04,734
Give them back.

672
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,604
Get out! Get out of my way.

673
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:10,414
Poor Soo Ho. You need your rest.

674
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:12,414
Look at him. He's sweating.

675
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:15,984
- Oh no! Oh no!
- What do I do about this?

676
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:17,783
- My hands are fine.
- Really?

677
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,424
Then I'll wipe your feet
since they're not fine.

678
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:21,823
Stop!

679
00:45:22,593 --> 00:45:23,953
Your foot!

680
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:32,863
It's small and cute.

681
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,504
I didn't know you liked pink.

682
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:37,004
How dare you touch it!

683
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:42,073
Hey! I just wanted to
wipe your feet for you...

684
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:43,874
No need to yell.

685
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:46,613
You're so mean.

686
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:48,984
Darn it.

687
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:53,524
You're so mean to me.

688
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:56,953
- Hey. Let's order chicken.
- Where's the TV?

689
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:59,194
- Hey. Order pizza too.
- Where should we order from?

690
00:45:59,194 --> 00:46:02,033
- Get what Seo Jun likes.
- He doesn't like pizza.

691
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:05,033
- Spicy? Soy sauce?
- Can I help you with anything?

692
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:08,004
Hey, guys. Leave. All of you.

693
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,234
Why? I'm sleeping here tonight.

694
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:12,803
We have to nurse you
through the night!

695
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:13,874
We're friends!

696
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:15,843
- Loyalty!
- Loyalty!

697
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:18,113
Where would you sleep?
Think of your size.

698
00:46:18,113 --> 00:46:19,914
Yes, yes. Leave
already. You're so loud.

699
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:21,144
You leave too. Please.

700
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:23,984
Soo Ho! You're
hurting my feelings!

701
00:46:23,984 --> 00:46:25,214
I'll go now.

702
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:26,524
- What?
- Let's go.

703
00:46:27,223 --> 00:46:28,924
- Why?
- Let's go.

704
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,223
Yes. Go. Let's go.

705
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:34,624
Hey. Why are you so
desperate to get rid of us?

706
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:35,894
For goodness’ sake!

707
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:40,064
- I want to be alone with Soo Ho.
- Alone?

708
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:42,433
Okay. I'm for this bromance.

709
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:43,774
- Me too.
- Me too.

710
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:46,703
- You liked Soo Ho?
- Really?

711
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:51,513
That's right. Yeo Ha Jin is
shooting a drama in the lobby.

712
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:54,714
- What? Yeo Ha Jin?
- Everyone's first love, Yeo Ha Jin?

713
00:46:57,153 --> 00:46:58,414
Sorry, Soo Ho!

714
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,823
- See you later!
- Take care!

715
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:01,883
Bye.

716
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:04,223
- Yeo Ha Jin!
- Hurry.

717
00:47:05,964 --> 00:47:07,624
Sorry, Seo Jun.

718
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,053
Oh my gosh.

719
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:38,153
Why did you leave?

720
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:40,223
I got rid of the guys for you.

721
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,493
I... It's too late.

722
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,734
Why did you bother hiding?

723
00:47:45,064 --> 00:47:47,004
Just tell everyone you're
dating. Problem solved.

724
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:49,433
No. I can't do that yet.

725
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,504
Why not? Because of Soo Jin?

726
00:47:51,504 --> 00:47:54,944
I told you that was
just hypothetical.

727
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:56,973
You're so silly.

728
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,113
Hey. What is that on your hair?

729
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:01,013
Sorry.

730
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:04,484
Darn it. It ripped off.

731
00:48:04,984 --> 00:48:07,323
What did you do in bed
that his button fell off?

732
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:11,593
You must be imagining that
because you're lonely.

733
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:12,964
The kids were joking!

734
00:48:13,664 --> 00:48:14,894
Then I'm going to
write on it too.

735
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:16,834
Come here.

736
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:19,834
Don't write anything weird.

737
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:25,004
All done.

738
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:27,343
Later.

739
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,513
TIGER ENERGY BOOST. ROAR!

740
00:48:29,513 --> 00:48:32,484
Tiger energy boost. Roar!

741
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:34,383
That's right. Seo Jun.

742
00:48:35,653 --> 00:48:36,783
Roar!

743
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,424
She's milking it.

744
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:46,564
PANDORA SHOP

745
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:51,093
You should've gotten
the touch up long ago.

746
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:52,803
It'll last a while now.

747
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,533
- Thank you.
- Let me see.

748
00:48:58,004 --> 00:48:59,944
- Are you done?
- It came out nicely.

749
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:02,944
- Lady Hong.
- Are you going to the store?

750
00:49:03,013 --> 00:49:05,613
No. I came to check
on my possession.

751
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,283
Your possession? What?

752
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:10,914
I... I will get going now.

753
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:13,723
You're not closed yet, are you?

754
00:49:13,723 --> 00:49:15,183
- Hello.
- My gosh.

755
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,664
You had a young,
handsome client.

756
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:22,263
I'll go now.

757
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,493
He's Ju Kyung's
homeroom teacher.

758
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:28,363
- Hello.
- You were always so polite.

759
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,774
You seemed like a teacher.

760
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:32,473
Are you married?

761
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:34,604
No, not yet.

762
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,444
How providential.

763
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,573
My daughter is single.

764
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:42,414
You two would be perfect together.
Would you like to meet her?

765
00:49:43,354 --> 00:49:46,124
I appreciate the thought,
but I'm not interested.

766
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:47,984
I'll go now.

767
00:49:48,223 --> 00:49:49,854
Why not?

768
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,024
If things work out, you can
have our pork trotters...

769
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:54,223
- for free forever.
- Pork trotters.

770
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:57,363
Who would get married
just for pork trotters?

771
00:49:57,363 --> 00:49:59,664
- You should like each other.
- Right.

772
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,604
- Bye, Mr. Han.
- Good night.

773
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:06,044
Find a guy for
Hee Kyung instead.

774
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,573
Do you know anyone good?

775
00:50:08,144 --> 00:50:09,473
Should I?

776
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,644
What kind of guys do you like?

777
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:12,984
Just say the word.

778
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:15,854
What kind of guys do I like?

779
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,354
Someone born early
in the year 1990?

780
00:50:20,024 --> 00:50:22,794
Someone with no eyebrows, who
looks cute with his hair down...

781
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:24,424
and sexy with it up.

782
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:26,624
Someone who seems
modest and well-behaved,

783
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,894
but like a kitten
when he whines...

784
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:31,894
and drives me crazy. That's
the kind of guy I like.

785
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:37,133
Just say you don't want to meet
anyone. No guy is like that.

786
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:38,973
- Yes, there is. There is one...
- She has lost her mind.

787
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:40,903
I have to go to the
convenience store. Bye.

788
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:43,743
That little... Hurry home!

789
00:50:45,414 --> 00:50:47,984
Joon Woo. Where are you going?

790
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,883
Why do you keep running away?
You're driving me crazy.

791
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:57,424
This is your neighborhood.
What if Ju Kyung sees us?

792
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:59,223
She won't walk this way.

793
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:01,093
Really?

794
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:05,664
- Do you like pork trotters?
- What?

795
00:51:05,734 --> 00:51:07,703
Who said you could
smile at just anyone?

796
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:10,104
- When did I do that?
- Everyone wants you...

797
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:12,403
because of your pretty smile.

798
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:15,203
That's only in your eyes.

799
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:17,343
Those are some pretty eyebrows.

800
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,183
You're way prettier.

801
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:21,914
Chin down.

802
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:29,823
Hee Kyung?

803
00:51:30,093 --> 00:51:32,323
My eyes!

804
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:34,464
Who were you kissing?
Your boyfriend?

805
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:35,694
Just go home.

806
00:51:35,694 --> 00:51:37,593
Hold on. Who is it?

807
00:51:38,433 --> 00:51:40,203
- Let go of me.
- Leave!

808
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,703
Let go!

809
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,104
Wait. Is it someone I know?

810
00:51:45,104 --> 00:51:46,774
Of course not.

811
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:49,473
What's with my sisters today?

812
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,613
I caught both of them
with their boyfriends.

813
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,484
Just get going, will you?

814
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:55,314
Where were you today?

815
00:51:55,314 --> 00:51:58,513
MIND YOUR HEAD.

816
00:52:04,294 --> 00:52:05,593
What...

817
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,834
How many zeros is this?

818
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,964
Honey!

819
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:14,363
I found him!

820
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,303
- Found who?
- Columbus Park.

821
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:19,203
Our eyes locked as I was
leaving the culture center.

822
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,403
- So to catch him...
- You took a cab?

823
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:24,743
Exactly! I took a
cab and tailed him.

824
00:52:24,743 --> 00:52:26,214
You see it in movies, right?

825
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:31,053
"Stop right there, Columbus
Park! Sir, step on it!"

826
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:32,683
So, did you catch him?

827
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:35,323
I lost him, of
course. But honey,

828
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:38,553
I was able to confirm
that he's in Seoul.

829
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:39,564
What good does that do...

830
00:52:39,564 --> 00:52:41,464
when you spent over that
much money on the cab ride?

831
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:42,933
- Honey, hold on.
- You...

832
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,964
- Wait a second.
- Unbelievable.

833
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:47,564
But I was able to confirm
that he's in Seoul.

834
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,174
What about the money
for the cab ride then?

835
00:52:54,573 --> 00:52:57,374
Be honest with me. Are
you studying makeup?

836
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,814
- How did you know?
- As if that's important.

837
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:02,653
Is this to avoid other
academic subjects?

838
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:05,484
Of course not. I'm
serious about this.

839
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,723
It's what I want to do.

840
00:53:08,254 --> 00:53:11,153
I haven't been able to take
any proper classes yet.

841
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,124
Is that why you're
working part-time?

842
00:53:13,464 --> 00:53:14,694
How did you know that?

843
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:20,033
Why else would you be
getting home so late?

844
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:22,803
No way.

845
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,573
That's perceptive of you.

846
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,274
Don't tell Mom yet though.

847
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:30,073
I'm going to seek
her approval...

848
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,984
once my grades have gone
up. I'll get going then.

849
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,453
Ju Kyung, I could pay
for the makeup classes.

850
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:41,953
No, I'd like to try
this on my own first.

851
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,093
Look at you all grown up.

852
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:45,754
- I'll get going then.
- Sure.

853
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:50,093
Ju Kyung, let me know
if you need any help.

854
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,263
Sure thing, sis. I love you!

855
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:02,714
Wait. Joon Woo's girlfriend...

856
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,174
is Ju Kyung's sister?

857
00:54:18,194 --> 00:54:19,763
Hello, Mr. Han.

858
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:22,593
Ju Kyung, here you go.

859
00:54:22,894 --> 00:54:25,834
I love strawberries,
you know. Thank you.

860
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:28,164
- Have a good day today.
- Thank you for this.

861
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:37,914
Good morning.

862
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:39,743
You're being too obvious.

863
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:41,644
About what?

864
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:44,084
You're obviously
being nice to her...

865
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:46,323
because she's your
girlfriend's sister.

866
00:54:48,553 --> 00:54:49,694
What?

867
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,453
I don't quite follow...

868
00:54:55,194 --> 00:54:56,234
I don't know.

869
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:59,203
I'm not one to
show these things.

870
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:05,174
When both...

871
00:55:05,174 --> 00:55:07,403
sheet A and sheet B are
on the coordinate plane,

872
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:11,644
the curve of the
upper boundary line...

873
00:55:13,084 --> 00:55:16,214
will be shown as
Y equals F of X.

874
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:19,624
- The lower curve...
- I hope he's all right.

875
00:55:21,924 --> 00:55:23,424
What could he be up to?

876
00:55:30,993 --> 00:55:34,664
The area between
these two curves...

877
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:38,734
will be the same.

878
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,513
Here.

879
00:55:47,283 --> 00:55:48,843
I want some meat.

880
00:55:49,453 --> 00:55:50,754
Yours look delicious.

881
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:57,553
Can you not spill, Mr. Trickle?

882
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:11,573
Okay, stop.

883
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:14,104
Move back a little. Okay.

884
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,374
- Take a right.
- Unbelievable.

885
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:21,843
You carry this around?

886
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,783
- Unbelievable.
- For my online followers,

887
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:28,683
every selfie should be
taken in the best way.

888
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:32,664
You look great.
Check out her skin.

889
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:34,124
- It sure is different.
- It actually works.

890
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:38,734
- That's your best one to date.
- You look great.

891
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:40,834
I'm entering this into the
Newstagram Queen Contest.

892
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,573
- You should enter too.
- No, I'm good.

893
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:46,174
She's right. You
should take one too.

894
00:56:46,174 --> 00:56:48,004
- All you need is right here.
- Right.

895
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,513
I'll pour my heart and
soul into your photo.

896
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:54,883
Here we go. Ju Kyung, 1, 2, 3.

897
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:56,883
Hold up the light reflector.

898
00:56:58,513 --> 00:56:59,553
Stay still.

899
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,084
You look amazing.

900
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,323
How is this not an angel?

901
00:57:09,124 --> 00:57:11,464
What is this? Why are
you taking her photos?

902
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,874
Oh, nothing. My
hand just slipped.

903
00:57:18,874 --> 00:57:20,274
- Carry on.
- Got it.

904
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:23,073
Over here. And snap.

905
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:26,044
Gosh, you look pretty.

906
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:28,544
Why don't you look into the air?

907
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:32,553
Please press down.

908
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:36,993
I'll soon get you a new one.

909
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,694
Soo Ho.

910
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,504
I told you not to come.

911
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:51,633
We should talk, okay?

912
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:56,513
It's like I finally
got my life back.

913
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:57,973
Hey.

914
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,314
You're back here again?

915
00:58:00,584 --> 00:58:02,544
You just can't
stay away, can you?

916
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,754
What choice do I have
when I can't call him?

917
00:58:05,914 --> 00:58:07,383
Talk about devotion.

918
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:09,854
One of your casts is gone.

919
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,863
I got another X-ray and the
doctor said it'd be all right.

920
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:16,394
I'm glad. Soo Ho should
get better soon too.

921
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:19,133
Hey. Did you know that...

922
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,933
- he has an older female cousin?
- What?

923
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:27,203
Yes. Yes, of course.

924
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:42,024
Why did you do it? Se
Yeon was my friend.

925
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,794
Why on earth did you do it?

926
00:58:49,294 --> 00:58:51,394
I didn't know about
Se Yeon's incident.

927
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:55,504
I let Director Oh
take care of it,

928
00:58:56,234 --> 00:58:58,703
but I had no idea what he'd do.

929
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,703
I would've stopped
him had I known.

930
00:59:01,044 --> 00:59:03,544
Like you just said, Se
Yeon was your friend,

931
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,914
so why would I have done it?

932
00:59:05,944 --> 00:59:07,644
So you're blaming it
all on Director Oh.

933
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:11,984
He did it to cover up your
romance with the actress.

934
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:17,823
Saying that you didn't
know makes it all right?

935
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:22,624
Do you honestly think
you're not responsible?

936
00:59:25,164 --> 00:59:26,464
I...

937
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,803
wasn't able to answer
Se Yeon's last call.

938
00:59:32,874 --> 00:59:35,504
Thinking that it led
to his suicide...

939
00:59:38,113 --> 00:59:40,584
has been haunting
me all this time.

940
00:59:42,214 --> 00:59:43,354
But...

941
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,783
you were the reason
why this happened.

942
00:59:47,953 --> 00:59:50,153
Why be afraid of some
rumor with an actress?

943
00:59:50,524 --> 00:59:52,053
As if it's any big deal.

944
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:54,694
I...

945
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:58,664
didn't want you to be
disappointed in me.

946
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:02,703
You were already so distant, and
I was afraid that the news...

947
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:04,834
will only drive you away.

948
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:07,174
It's why I wanted
to cover it up.

949
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:12,174
How can I be disappointed in a
man I have no expectations for?

950
01:00:14,113 --> 01:00:15,544
I already witnessed it...

951
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:19,113
a long time ago.

952
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,153
What you were doing
on the night Mom died.

953
01:00:37,274 --> 01:00:38,433
What?

954
01:00:40,843 --> 01:00:42,104
You saw that?

955
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,644
- Soo Ho, back then...
- Leave.

956
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:49,084
Soo Ho. Soo Ho!

957
01:00:49,414 --> 01:00:50,653
Get out!

958
01:00:53,823 --> 01:00:55,584
Soo Ho. Soo Ho...

959
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:57,354
- Soo Ho!
- Soo Ho!

960
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,723
- Soo Ho!
- Soo Ho, hold it together.

961
01:01:00,093 --> 01:01:01,723
Soo Ho, what's wrong?

962
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:03,234
- Soo Ho!
- Mr. Lee?

963
01:01:03,564 --> 01:01:05,794
- Soo Ho, what's wrong?
- Mr. Lee, are you all right?

964
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:08,303
Soo Ho, stay with me!

965
01:01:09,334 --> 01:01:11,073
He seems to have
had a panic attack.

966
01:01:11,303 --> 01:01:13,774
The ECG and other tests
showed no abnormalities.

967
01:01:14,044 --> 01:01:15,504
It was probably a psychogenic
non-epileptic seizure.

968
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:19,243
If this happened quite often,
he should receive counseling...

969
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:20,914
from a psychiatrist.

970
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:44,734
I always knew he
could be frustrating,

971
01:01:45,473 --> 01:01:48,073
but I didn't know he was
suffering psychologically.

972
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:52,374
I don't think he'll
ever tell you this,

973
01:01:54,984 --> 01:01:58,053
but Leo is actually Soo Ho.

974
01:02:01,854 --> 01:02:03,024
What?

975
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:05,153
You can tell just by
going over to his house.

976
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:07,424
Are you really his father?

977
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:11,064
I bet you have no idea
how happy he was...

978
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:14,064
every time he made
songs with Se Yeon.

979
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:31,113
GET WELL SOON.

980
01:03:54,004 --> 01:03:57,734
You see, I like Soo Ho.

981
01:03:58,433 --> 01:03:59,874
It hurts.

982
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:56,464
Leo is actually Soo Ho.

983
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,533
I bet you have no idea
how happy he was...

984
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:02,763
every time he made
songs with Se Yeon.

985
01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:25,553
What you were doing
on the night Mom died.

986
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:40,174
I wasn't able to answer
Se Yeon's last call.

987
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:44,144
Thinking that it led
to his suicide...

988
01:05:45,013 --> 01:05:47,584
has been haunting
me all this time.

989
01:05:58,823 --> 01:06:01,024
How long will you
take it out on me?

990
01:06:01,564 --> 01:06:02,924
Until you meet Se Yeon...

991
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:05,863
in the afterlife.

992
01:06:09,263 --> 01:06:10,403
Don't forget...

993
01:06:11,703 --> 01:06:13,374
that you killed Se Yeon...

994
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,144
and that you have no
right to be happy.

995
01:06:29,254 --> 01:06:30,693
He's sleeping like a log.

996
01:06:39,063 --> 01:06:40,533
Is he even breathing?

997
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,443
Why are you pretending to
sleep? I already saw you.

998
01:07:01,523 --> 01:07:04,393
- What do you want?
- I want to get some air.

999
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:06,724
But I don't have a wheelchair.

1000
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:08,794
Just sleep. It's
too late for that.

1001
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:12,794
My gosh.

1002
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:16,974
Will you hold on properly?

1003
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,914
You have a tiny face,
but you're so heavy.

1004
01:07:24,914 --> 01:07:26,073
Will you be quiet?

1005
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:29,983
Soo Ho, you just wait until
you're able to walk again.

1006
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:32,953
My gosh.

1007
01:07:33,254 --> 01:07:36,794
- Use your strength, Mr. Trickle.
- I am.

1008
01:07:39,294 --> 01:07:40,794
What are you doing?

1009
01:07:40,794 --> 01:07:42,124
I didn't have a wheelchair.

1010
01:07:42,464 --> 01:07:44,434
You could've called
and asked for one.

1011
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:45,664
Wait here for a moment.

1012
01:07:47,903 --> 01:07:50,233
Why didn't you call a nurse?

1013
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,304
Why didn't you just bring
one? You can walk just fine.

1014
01:07:52,304 --> 01:07:54,773
- I didn't think of that.
- Neither did I.

1015
01:07:54,773 --> 01:07:56,004
You get the top
grades in our year.

1016
01:07:56,004 --> 01:07:57,943
- Why didn't you use your brain?
- How are your grades?

1017
01:08:14,264 --> 01:08:15,493
Why...

1018
01:08:16,563 --> 01:08:18,033
didn't you tell me...

1019
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:21,664
that you never got
to meet Se Yeon?

1020
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,004
Up until now,

1021
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:29,443
I thought Se Yeon died because
you didn't believe him.

1022
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:30,573
That's why I kept...

1023
01:08:33,174 --> 01:08:34,643
You should've told me.

1024
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:36,184
Even if I told you,

1025
01:08:37,953 --> 01:08:39,914
it wouldn't have brought
him back to life.

1026
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,924
I felt guilty for his death.

1027
01:08:51,434 --> 01:08:53,233
If I answered his call,

1028
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:58,603
he might not have died.

1029
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:04,313
Is that...

1030
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:07,783
what you've been
thinking all these years?

1031
01:09:12,153 --> 01:09:13,624
You frustrating punk.

1032
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:28,603
Ju Young, come out
and eat some fruit.

1033
01:09:30,073 --> 01:09:32,004
Where did Ju Kyung
go? It's the weekend.

1034
01:09:32,004 --> 01:09:33,674
Didn't she leave
early in the morning?

1035
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:35,743
- Work.
- What?

1036
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,174
I said it's none of my business.

1037
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:42,044
You should show some
interest in your sister.

1038
01:09:42,214 --> 01:09:44,754
Lee Joo Hun, the CEO
of Move Entertainment,

1039
01:09:44,953 --> 01:09:48,523
announced that Black Soul's
title song was plagiarized...

1040
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:51,453
and declared to resign
from his agency and retire.

1041
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:55,023
- He's going to retire?
- Lee Joo Hun announced...

1042
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:57,493
- Hello?
- that the song was actually...

1043
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,563
- Did you see the news?
- written by Jeong Se Yeon...

1044
01:09:58,964 --> 01:10:00,264
Lee Joo Hun is apparently
going to retire.

1045
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:01,664
Joo Hun!

1046
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:04,334
Why? Why? My goodness!

1047
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:08,004
No!

1048
01:10:08,703 --> 01:10:10,943
Joo Hun!

1049
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:15,283
Let's define the two dots
between the graph as A and B.

1050
01:10:15,283 --> 01:10:18,353
The function value
of A becomes F of A.

1051
01:10:18,353 --> 01:10:20,554
And the function value
of B becomes F of B.

1052
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:21,823
Now here's the limit.

1053
01:10:21,823 --> 01:10:23,054
The moment you calculate...

1054
01:10:23,054 --> 01:10:25,294
Soo Jin, this is big news.
Did you read the article?

1055
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:30,264
If you connect B with A,

1056
01:10:30,634 --> 01:10:34,063
the line declines like
this and eventually...

1057
01:10:37,073 --> 01:10:38,174
Soo Jin.

1058
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:49,443
LEE JOO HUN CONFESSES THE TRUTH
BEHIND JEONG SE YEON'S DEATH

1059
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:05,764
Soo Ho.

1060
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:17,643
It's you again.

1061
01:11:18,844 --> 01:11:19,943
Yes.

1062
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:28,783
It's me again.

1063
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:31,653
I wanted to see you,

1064
01:11:35,794 --> 01:11:36,993
and here you are.

1065
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:41,434
I came to give you a hug.

1066
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:40,724
TRUE BEAUTY

1067
01:13:40,724 --> 01:13:43,323
<i>I poured out everything
that had built up,</i>

1068
01:13:43,323 --> 01:13:44,523
<i>but it's still heavy.</i>

1069
01:13:45,624 --> 01:13:47,893
<i>Tell them if you
can't sleep at night.</i>

1070
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,834
<i>All your sad thoughts,
worries, and everything.</i>

1071
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:54,103
<i>It's Ju Kyung.
She's my girlfriend.</i>

1072
01:13:54,703 --> 01:13:58,573
<i>How does it feel to turn the
world of social media upside down?</i>

1073
01:13:59,004 --> 01:14:00,344
<i>Ju Kyung!</i>

1074
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,203
<i>She transferred from Yongpa.</i>

1075
01:14:02,474 --> 01:14:05,443
<i>There was a girl named Lim Ju
Kyung in my old school too.</i>

1076
01:14:05,943 --> 01:14:08,483
<i>Are you really the same
Soo Jin that I know?</i>
