EPISODE 8

2
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:46,785
Excuse me.

3
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,128
Thank you.

4
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:58,499
It's my pleasure.

5
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,079
My lady!

6
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:09,779
Where on earth were you? I
looked for you everywhere.

7
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,419
We should go.

8
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:19,258
Young master!

9
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:22,658
Do you perhaps know her name?

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,729
Judging by her servant,

11
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,598
she must be the
daughter of Lord Lim.

12
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,098
The daughter of Lord Lim?

13
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,898
Someone with such
pretty hands...

14
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:35,238
must also have a beautiful face.

15
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,508
I should write a love letter.

16
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:41,378
A love letter?

17
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,158
Welcome.

18
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:59,829
I'd like to see everything
from here to here.

19
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,898
All of them?

20
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:03,628
Yes, all of them.

21
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:05,538
- Are you buying a birthday gift?
- No.

22
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:08,708
I'm going to confess
my love to her.

23
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:13,138
I will confess my love.

24
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:16,008
HE WILL CONFESS HIS LOVE.

25
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,989
Let me see. Those
two are friends,

26
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,888
but they like the same girl.

27
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,719
That's right, but
he liked her first.

28
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,828
He already said that she
was his and was off-limits.

29
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,228
Then why is he now being a jerk?

30
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:36,228
He only approached her to
get revenge on the other guy.

31
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:40,168
He's now being clingy after
falling in love with her.

32
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,739
What a jerk.

33
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,339
But falling in
love isn't a crime!

34
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,348
FALLING IN LOVE ISN'T A CRIME.

35
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,149
Shut it and take your
underwear to your room.

36
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,029
I need this and this.

37
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,128
Don't you have enough
makeup products?

38
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:07,228
Darn it.

39
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,568
By the way, if you
go on a school trip,

40
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:12,668
you'll have to show
your no-makeup face.

41
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,608
I'm planning to be the
last one to fall asleep.

42
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,209
Once everyone falls asleep,

43
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,108
I'll wash up and put
my makeup back on.

44
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:21,908
You'll do all that just not
to show your no-makeup face?

45
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,649
What was with you a
few days ago though?

46
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,049
Did Soo Ho reject you?

47
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,918
What are you talking
about? What rejection?

48
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,658
I thought you had
feelings for him.

49
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:34,288
We're just friends.

50
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:35,828
Whatever you say.

51
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,728
My female friends tend to
tell their feelings for me,

52
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,899
saying things like how they
see me more than just a friend.

53
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:46,239
Anyway, be careful not to
lose your friendship over it.

54
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,448
I could've taken
the bus, you know.

55
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:03,089
But your bags are heavy.

56
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,019
Thanks.

57
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,689
- I said, thanks.
- Oh, right.

58
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,489
- I'll get going then.
- Bye.

59
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,529
- Don't be a handful.
- Sure thing.

60
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:19,768
Joon Woo.

61
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:23,669
Joon Woo!

62
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,378
What's going on?

63
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,878
I currently am living in debt.

64
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,419
Debt? How much?

65
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,249
Is it from a loan shark?

66
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,818
It's a student loan.

67
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:40,218
A student loan?

68
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,989
How old are you?

69
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:46,499
I was born in 1990.

70
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:47,859
1990?

71
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,539
This is all I have saved up.

72
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,648
I bet you're disappointed.

73
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:13,218
This is why I never even
dreamed of dating...

74
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:16,789
The blood, sweat, and tears
you shed to save this up...

75
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,028
are evident in this money,

76
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,729
so the amount can
never be disappointing.

77
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:22,369
Hee Kyung...

78
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,739
Gosh. Come here for a second.

79
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,268
Joon Woo.

80
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,948
Sit right there.

81
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,018
You popped into my head, so I
bought it on my business trip.

82
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,588
They fit perfectly. You can
walk toward me in these.

83
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:54,499
I'll be good to you. So
be with me, Joon Woo.

84
00:05:58,768 --> 00:05:59,869
Hee Kyung!

85
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,109
My cell phone.

86
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:06,778
- Hi, Mr. Han.
- Hi.

87
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,409
- What now?
- I forgot to bring my cell phone.

88
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,718
Gosh, you klutz.

89
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:13,878
You left it in the car?

90
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,588
- Squat down properly!
- Left foot.

91
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:17,818
- Right foot. We're sorry.
- Right foot. We're sorry.

92
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,888
- Open the can.
- They're only potato chips.

93
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,729
As if.

94
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,989
Is this what they call
potato chips these days?

95
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:25,099
Join them!

96
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,729
- Would you like one?
- You must be thirsty.

97
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,369
Should I pour you a shot?

98
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,138
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Join them.

99
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,239
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Look at you. Open your jacket.

100
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:40,809
You've got to be
kidding me. Join them!

101
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:41,979
We're off to enjoy
a new scenic view.

102
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,249
Did you all get jobs as waiters?

103
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,349
- Mr. Han.
- What's with all the alcohol?

104
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,218
- Have a safe trip.
- Oh...

105
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,349
Thank you.

106
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:52,258
You guys look adorable.

107
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:53,888
Gosh, what an eyesore.

108
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:55,958
I should also get
myself a girlfriend.

109
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,328
If you had control over that,
you wouldn't still be single.

110
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:01,768
What's with that hat? Are
you Kim Sat Gat or what?

111
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,499
This is why you don't
have a girlfriend.

112
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:06,099
- Show me some hearts.
- Are you kidding me?

113
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,268
Are you guys also going out?

114
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,768
Did you guys wear
matching outfits...

115
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,508
to announce that you
guys are a couple?

116
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:14,948
No way.

117
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,309
Ju Kyung, I feel like
that's what you had in mind.

118
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:18,718
Did you want to be my
girlfriend that badly?

119
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,349
How about we just date?

120
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,919
What's the matter with you?

121
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,888
- Wear your jacket.
- No, it's hot.

122
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:26,489
- It's not hot. It's cold.
- It's really hot right now.

123
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,958
Should I draw stripes
on your shirt?

124
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,958
- I have a marker.
- Hey, Soo Ho.

125
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,669
Take that.

126
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,169
- Sit here.
- What?

127
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,809
Soo Ho, you're
sitting in the front.

128
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,039
Let me sit next to you.

129
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,648
007, bang!

130
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,018
007, bang!

131
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,388
Bang!

132
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,088
No, wait. Time out.

133
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,388
Are you sitting next to each
other because you're a couple?

134
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,729
- Go on a date! Go on a date!
- Go on a date! Go on a date!

135
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,559
- Go on a date! Go on a date!
- Go on a date! Go on a date!

136
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,669
There are tons of empty
seats out in the front.

137
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,568
I like sitting in the back.

138
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,378
SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL SCHOOL TRIP

139
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:26,849
You guys, look over here!

140
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:30,888
- Go to your tents and unpack.
- Okay.

141
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,559
Let's meet here
after 30 minutes.

142
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,659
- Okay.
- Okay.

143
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,228
- Go on.
- Let's go.

144
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,429
Come on.

145
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,498
Ju Kyung.

146
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,198
- 1, 2, 3.
- Soo Ah.

147
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,439
1, 2, 3.

148
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:48,238
1, 2, 3.

149
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:49,539
1, 2, 3.

150
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:50,868
1, 2, 3.

151
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:52,779
1, 2, 3.

152
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,338
- Okay. It all came out nice.
- Let's go.

153
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,848
- Nice.
- Come on.

154
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,608
This is so heavy.

155
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,818
My goodness, the mountain
feels so lively...

156
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,488
now that there are lots
of young people here.

157
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,218
- Hello.
- Hello.

158
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,259
It's nice to meet you.

159
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,728
I'm the manager here.

160
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,488
Let me know if
you need anything.

161
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,659
Thank you.

162
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,929
By the way, your bird
is really pretty.

163
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,029
What?

164
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,228
Your bird.

165
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:20,468
- What bird?
- That bird.

166
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,108
There's a bird...

167
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:33,519
What's that microphone for?

168
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,348
I brought it so we could
have fun all night.

169
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,318
Dating is a must.

170
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:39,519
But marriage is a choice.

171
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,318
Amor fati.

172
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:42,728
Look at you all excited.

173
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:46,059
No one will be able
to sleep tonight.

174
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,259
No one will get to sleep!

175
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,429
- Dating is a must.
- It's a must!

176
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,738
I've never slept
in a tent before.

177
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:53,899
I haven't done this
in a while either.

178
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,108
The last time I went camping
was with Soo Ho's family...

179
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,269
when I was little.

180
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,608
You and Soo Ho must've been very
close since you guys were young.

181
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,348
Oh, right.

182
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:07,019
This girl from class 6
apparently asked Soo Ho out.

183
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,588
But he rejected her saying
he likes someone else.

184
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:11,348
Really? Are you serious?
Soo Ho likes someone?

185
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:15,728
Do you think that
might be you, Soo Jin?

186
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:16,929
You actually believe that?

187
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,559
He probably just made it up.

188
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,328
Stop getting me
involved, Soo Ah.

189
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,728
Some people thought you guys were
a couple ever since freshman year.

190
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:26,039
I mean, you guys make
a really good couple.

191
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,468
It's hard to believe that you guys
were just friends for 10 years.

192
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,009
Be honest with me, Soo Jin.

193
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:33,379
Haven't you ever had
any feelings for Soo Ho?

194
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,409
Yes, tell us.

195
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:38,919
Stop being absurd.

196
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,748
Haven't you? Come on. Tell me.

197
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,988
- Haven't you? Really? Seriously?
- Gosh, stop it!

198
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:48,118
Guys, look over here.

199
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,728
- Over here.
- Let's take selfies.

200
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,088
- Make me look pretty.
- Got it.

201
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,828
1, 2, 3.

202
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,799
1, 2, 3.

203
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:56,998
Stop joking around.

204
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:58,169
- Gosh, seriously.
- Let's take a photo.

205
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:00,098
If you do it one more
time, I'll kill you.

206
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:02,368
- Stop fooling around.
- My gosh.

207
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,009
Let's turn this way.

208
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,909
- There. 1, 2, 3.
- You guys!

209
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,978
Gather together. Let
me take a group photo.

210
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,988
Don't get in my way.

211
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,118
Stop it.

212
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,289
Soo Ho, you should join.

213
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,818
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

214
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:23,958
You have no sociability.

215
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,858
Why don't you go and join?

216
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,659
No, I can't be bothered.

217
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,998
- I'll take the photo now.
- Cheese!

218
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:33,039
1, 2, 3, 4.

219
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:36,539
- Gosh, Mr. Han!
- What was that for?

220
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:37,738
This is how it
comes out natural.

221
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,879
Mr. Han, take a photo of
the couple right here.

222
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,748
Hey! Who's dating in school?

223
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:50,748
- These two!
- I'd better not catch you together.

224
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,289
- They're dating.
- Sir, you're in the way.

225
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,259
- Let's do the heart signal.
- I'll take the photo now.

226
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,659
- Okay.
- 1, 2.

227
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,899
There you go.

228
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,698
- Mr. Han, come on.
- What's going on?

229
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,039
Are you guys really dating?

230
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,098
You're dating, aren't you?

231
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,399
Listen up guys! They're dating!

232
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,468
No, we're not.

233
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,968
Hurry up and take
off your clothes.

234
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,509
Why are you trying to make
me take off my clothes?

235
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,108
You're so weird.

236
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,248
I meant you should get changed.

237
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,448
- Look at them!
- They're having a lovers' quarrel!

238
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,588
I'm MC Jae Rong,

239
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,948
the cutest recreation MC ever!
It's nice to meet you all!

240
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,358
- Do you know the newspaper game?
- Yes!

241
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,289
A team consists of four people.

242
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,289
Choose someone whom you think
is going to be really good.

243
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:32,799
Or someone you really like.

244
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,228
I want you to gather
in a group of four!

245
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:35,929
Get together. Go on.

246
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,269
Find someone you like.

247
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,198
- Someone you have a crush on.
- Ju Kyung!

248
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,439
- Come on.
- If you don't like the guy,

249
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:42,568
just kick him.

250
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,169
That's right. There
need to be four people.

251
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,179
You can't be in a
group of 3 or 5.

252
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,208
- Go on. Just go.
- If there's a group with five,

253
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,108
- you need to let go of one.
- Go on.

254
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:51,748
Why would you leave
your girlfriend behind?

255
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:54,019
- What's wrong with you?
- Gather in a group of four.

256
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,149
Is there anyone
who's not in a group?

257
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,618
- Come on.
- Is everyone in a group of four?

258
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,818
- Yes!
- Yes!

259
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,588
If you're in a group,
gather together.

260
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:03,728
Nice.

261
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,858
Did you see that?

262
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,899
Let me explain how
this game works.

263
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,728
Fold the newspaper...

264
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,198
and stand on top of it.

265
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:15,338
If you manage to stand on top
for five seconds, you succeed.

266
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,509
Stand on top of the
newspaper. Go on.

267
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:17,868
Stand on top of the newspaper.

268
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:19,208
We'd better win.

269
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,338
- Hang on tightly.
- Got it!

270
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,208
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

271
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,448
If you step out of the
newspaper, you're out.

272
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,009
Are you all standing on top?

273
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,748
- Don't step out of the newspaper.
- Hey.

274
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,019
- Hey.
- Do it properly.

275
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,988
Soo Ah, it hurts.

276
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,259
Good luck.

277
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,159
Now let's begin!

278
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,189
You're out!

279
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:39,399
- My gosh, careful.
- Hey, hold on tight.

280
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,929
Okay, there you go. You're out.

281
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,068
Let's give a round of applause
to the remaining three teams.

282
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,639
They're doing great.
They're so passionate.

283
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,108
Okay, now listen up.
This is important.

284
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,838
Concentrate. These three
teams are too good.

285
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:57,578
So let me upgrade
the game a little.

286
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:01,318
Fold the newspaper into one
fourths of the current size.

287
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,189
It's okay. Don't be scared.

288
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,559
Have some passion for the game.

289
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,559
- Okay then.
- Let's do this.

290
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,629
- What are you doing?
- Let's see who will...

291
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,159
This is what I'm talking about.

292
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,198
Where are you going?

293
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,208
Soo Ah, get on my back.

294
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,269
1, 2, 3.

295
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,309
No, no.

296
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,379
I'm so impressed.

297
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,948
You guys are doing great.

298
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,488
Let's count down.

299
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:49,368
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

300
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,429
The all guys team is out!

301
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,539
The remaining two
teams passed the game.

302
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,838
They're doing great, but
there has to be a winner.

303
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:58,468
So the team that fails this
time will be the loser.

304
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:01,078
Ready, guys? I want all
the guys to raise one leg.

305
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:02,179
I can't do that.

306
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,549
- I can't.
- Raise one leg.

307
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,049
- Raise it. Go on.
- My gosh.

308
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,478
I'll start counting down as
soon as you raise your legs.

309
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,718
Raise one leg. 5, 4...

310
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:11,218
- Gosh, your hair stinks!
- 3, 2,

311
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:12,789
One!

312
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,228
Unbelievable.

313
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,659
Will you please wash your hair?

314
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,529
We did it!

315
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:21,759
- We won!
- Congratulations.

316
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,129
You guys did great.

317
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,238
- Good job.
- My shoulder hurts.

318
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,568
Where does it hurt?

319
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:27,669
Right here.

320
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:33,639
Haven't you ever had
any feelings for Soo Ho?

321
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,818
This place is a restricted area.

322
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,748
- Hey, wait.
- Isn't this place a little creepy?

323
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,519
You're such a scaredy-cat
for someone so big.

324
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,488
- No, you can't go in there!
- My gosh.

325
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,159
Goodness.

326
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,588
- You're not allowed to go that way.
- Why not?

327
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,799
Is there something in the woods.

328
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,769
I can't afford to
lose anyone else.

329
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,338
- What?
- Lose what?

330
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,568
Over there...

331
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,439
Never mind.

332
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,338
Just forget about it. Anyway,

333
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,409
make sure you never go that way.

334
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,978
Okay? You understand?

335
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:12,419
- Okay.
- Okay.

336
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,348
- You got it?
- Yes, okay!

337
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,549
- Okay.
- Yes.

338
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,019
I wonder what's there.

339
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:22,389
I'm getting really curious.

340
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,389
- No, let's go.
- No.

341
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,998
- Come on.
- Let's just go.

342
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,240
No one will buy it! Get out!
Stop pressuring my clients!

343
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,510
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,780
Should I burn these
candles at your funeral?

345
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,350
Give them away or throw
them away. I don't care!

346
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,771
HELP WANTED ON WEEKENDS

347
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,040
PRINCE COMICS, HELP
WANTED ON WEEKENDS

348
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,721
Never have there been
candles like these.

349
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:18,221
- Are they candles or perfume?
- I'm not interested.

350
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:20,290
I'm giving them to you.

351
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,360
If you're going to talk about
hunting for treasure, just leave.

352
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,560
The proudest moment
of my life...

353
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,661
was when I didn't invest in
your search for buried treasure.

354
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:31,201
Why are you bringing
up the past?

355
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:34,501
Look. Hey, so...

356
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:39,211
Here. About that weekend job...

357
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,110
Can I do it?

358
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,550
That? I found someone already.

359
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,421
Already? Okay, then.

360
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,151
Is it good?

361
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,221
Then give me a bite.

362
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,691
Give me a bite.

363
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:59,201
Give me a bite.

364
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:00,231
Darn it.

365
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,931
Today, it's jjajangmyeon.

366
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,870
What are you doing?

367
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,310
- Just one bite!
- Darn it!

368
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,580
- Can I have this?
- Yes, have it.

369
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,151
It's yummy.

370
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,850
Hey, Shi Hyun.

371
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:21,820
What's this?

372
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,021
It smelled pretty bad earlier,
right? I just washed my hair.

373
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,761
- Enjoy.
- At least you have a conscience.

374
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,860
Hey, Hyun Kyu.

375
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,600
It wasn't that terrible.

376
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,201
- Don't lie.
- It was gross.

377
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,070
- It was not.
- What's wrong with you?

378
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,171
What?

379
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:40,501
What is that smell?

380
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,241
- Go.
- Have some mushrooms.

381
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,181
- Let me know if you need more.
- Okay. Thank you.

382
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:48,280
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

383
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,350
- You're red.
- It stank though.

384
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,751
Hey. Is Ju Kyung an
artifact in a museum?

385
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,191
Is she a Goryeo
celery or something?

386
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:01,360
Goryeo celadon.

387
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,890
Whatever. How long will you
just look at her from afar?

388
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,600
I'll set it up for you.
Find out how she feels.

389
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,201
I'll help you...

390
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,001
Hey.

391
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,610
- Is it cooked?
- Yes, it's perfect.

392
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,711
This is so good.

393
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,481
Are you a wild animal?

394
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,310
Let it cook first.

395
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,550
Don't eat like a pig just
because you're eating one.

396
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,120
- Eat like a person.
- Sir.

397
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,251
I am a person.

398
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,850
Are you enjoying the food?

399
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,191
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,890
Let me check the fire.

401
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:35,630
It's good.

402
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,830
Sir. What were you trying
to tell us earlier?

403
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,231
That? Just something
that happened long ago.

404
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,530
What was it? Tell us, please.

405
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,701
Why do you want to
know? It's nothing.

406
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,241
- Please!
- Please tell us.

407
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,911
Fine. You give me no choice.

408
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,911
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

409
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,320
A long time ago,
there was a well...

410
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,050
deep in the forest that way.

411
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,701
Wife. The wedding is over now.

412
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,560
Why do you not
show me your face?

413
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,600
I am embarrassed.

414
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,340
You are extremely shy.

415
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,271
The rooster will crow before
we consummate our marriage.

416
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,681
Then please tell me something.

417
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:33,951
Do you like bright-colored
wild apricots?

418
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,991
No matter how bright it is,
it is still a wild apricot.

419
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,751
That which is inside a pot is more
important than the pot itself.

420
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,461
Why do you ask?

421
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,060
Enough about wild
apricots. Come here.

422
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,671
Do not be why, and
lift up your head.

423
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,701
Then do you not be shocked.

424
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:05,151
- Husband!
- Is this why you hid your face?

425
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,280
You said it is what is
inside the pot that matters.

426
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,350
- Husband.
- Let go.

427
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,161
- Where are you going?
- Let go!

428
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,961
Soon Dol! Soon Dol!

429
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,030
- Husband!
- Let go.

430
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,090
Soon Dol!

431
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,771
I was never...

432
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,870
embraced by my own husband
because I was born ugly.

433
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,280
My life...

434
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,011
is worse than that
of a wild apricot.

435
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,130
What do you like
so much about me,

436
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,530
that you follow me
around like this?

437
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:54,961
I like your broad
chest, my lord.

438
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:56,501
No way.

439
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,401
I like these solid, long legs.

440
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,401
I like those too.
I like everything.

441
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:03,741
What a great night!

442
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,840
Let us have fun tonight...

443
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,540
until the sun rises.

444
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,850
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good.

445
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,021
That woman who died
carrying a deep grudge...

446
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,890
became an ugly spirit
and roamed the land,

447
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,130
and if she ran into
anyone, she'd...

448
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,231
steal their face.

449
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,931
That's why people don't go
anywhere near there at night.

450
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,570
People went missing before,

451
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,941
so they even held offering rituals
to the ugly spirit by the well.

452
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,840
An ugly spirit that steals
faces? That's so silly.

453
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,211
It's too hard to
pretend to be scared.

454
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:46,320
Is that why you told us
not to go into the woods?

455
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:49,951
She only takes pretty
and handsome faces,

456
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,991
so judge for yourself.

457
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,860
Don't walk around
alone, got that?

458
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,931
It'll be dark soon.

459
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,370
Don't worry. None of you will
have anything to worry about.

460
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,570
Don't worry.

461
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,600
What... No way.

462
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,471
All of you except me...

463
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,570
Hold hands, okay?

464
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,310
JEONG SE YEON
MEMORIAL ALBUM PROJECT

465
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,890
SE YEON AND LEO,
"MISSING LOVE"

466
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,060
It's nice to meet you.

467
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,961
I'm Lim Hee Kyung from
Move Entertainment.

468
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,231
Haven't we met before?

469
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,600
I doubt that.

470
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,501
Right? I must have
been mistaken.

471
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,370
What is it?

472
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,070
I'll get right to it.

473
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,640
We plan to release an album...

474
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,681
in Jeong Se Yeon's memory on
the anniversary of his passing.

475
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:50,451
But most of the songs
he left behind...

476
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,350
were collaborations
with a person named Leo.

477
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,691
Do you know how long
we've searched for you?

478
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,890
You're Leo, aren't you?

479
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:02,790
I am not.

480
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,030
Do you want to keep it a secret?

481
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:09,100
Don't believe me if
you don't want to.

482
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:11,870
This is laughable.

483
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,640
You kicked him out as soon as...

484
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,870
the school violence
scandal came out...

485
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,411
and made a kid kill himself.

486
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:17,941
But now, what?

487
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,550
Your company can never
produce a memorial album.

488
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:26,981
I will stop that
from happening...

489
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,850
no matter what.

490
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,401
How do I persuade him?

491
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,711
- Hey.
- Hi.

492
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,511
When are you coming
home? I'm home alone.

493
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,921
Let's start the game now.

494
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,151
You have 30 minutes.
Order the chicken.

495
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:06,120
Will you eat it or not?
The choice is yours.

496
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,390
Stop messing with me.

497
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:14,860
Hello, sir.

498
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,201
You must be tired
from working late.

499
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:18,401
Not at all. Have you had dinner?

500
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:19,671
No, not yet.

501
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,100
Mr. Oh. How about chicken?

502
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,870
The choice is yours.

503
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,340
Sounds good to me.

504
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,741
You seemed embarrassed.
Was that funny?

505
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,280
Yes, thank you.

506
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:33,050
That's right. Sir.
I met Han Seo Joon.

507
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:34,820
I see.

508
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,691
He denied he was Leo
and rejected me hared.

509
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:40,461
He was friends with Se Yeon,
so he isn't fond of us.

510
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:43,761
I think it would be a waste
to lose this opportunity.

511
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:46,860
And he's too good a songwriter
to let his talent go to waste.

512
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,360
I'll keep working on him.

513
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,130
I like your enthusiasm.

514
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,100
Please keep up that attitude as you
take care of our rookie artists.

515
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,171
Sure thing.

516
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,741
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir. Good night.

517
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,011
Fried chicken!

518
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,951
Is the memorial album
still being considered?

519
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,481
I thought the lack
of company support...

520
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:09,221
would make her do drop it,
but it looks like she hasn't.

521
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,390
I'll handle it though.

522
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,890
Good.

523
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:19,931
Yes, Hee Kyung. The other
teachers are sleeping now.

524
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,201
Why are you still up?

525
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,501
Were you thinking about me?

526
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
I have trouble sleeping
in foreign settings.

527
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,110
How about I sing a lullaby?

528
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,771
No, I'll just go to bed.

529
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:36,880
- Good night.
- Good night, my Joon Woo.

530
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,280
My adorable Joon Woo.

531
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,751
Come on. It's not like
I'm actually cute.

532
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:47,521
Was that a poor song choice?

533
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,590
I love you, I love you

534
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:54,001
I love you.

535
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,300
I love you, I love you.

536
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:58,771
- Love?
- Love?

537
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,040
She loves you?

538
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,671
Mom... I mean, Mother,
are you at a karaoke bar?

539
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:04,840
Mr. Han, are you
in a relationship?

540
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,441
No!

541
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,640
Sorry, guys.

542
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:11,110
- Good night.
- Good night.

543
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,590
I love you.

544
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,221
Now I've lost my appetite.

545
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,790
I love you, I love you

546
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,390
I love you

547
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,731
- I love you
- Enough!

548
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,271
Ahn Hyun Kyu, have you
pooped your pants before?

549
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,300
Are you kidding
me? Of course not.

550
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:32,840
- Nice!
- Come here.

551
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,100
Take that!

552
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,671
- Kim Shi Hyun.
- Gosh, he stinks.

553
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,211
Do you think of
yourself as a princess?

554
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,271
No way.

555
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:42,040
- Take that!
- Take that!

556
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,911
Lee Soo Ho, have
you kissed before?

557
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,021
3, 2, 1.

558
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:49,320
- Take that!
- Take that!

559
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,991
You should've answered
before your time was up.

560
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:52,350
I bet he's never played
this game before.

561
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:55,060
Love or friendship?

562
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,630
Love.

563
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:03,201
- Must he be that cheesy? Get him.
- Get him!

564
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:05,671
- Take that!
- But it's the truth.

565
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:06,741
Darn it.

566
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,070
- Am I handsome?
- Yes.

567
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:12,911
- Take that!
- Take that!

568
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:16,251
- Yoo Tae Hoon or Eighteen?
- Of course, it's my darling.

569
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:18,050
- Truth!
- Soo Ah!

570
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,820
- Get them both.
- Yes, get them both.

571
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,580
- Take that!
- Take that!

572
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,451
Is there someone you like?

573
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:25,221
Yes!

574
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,991
- You lied.
- What a liar!

575
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,931
- Take that!
- You liar.

576
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,271
Have you ever wanted to
break up with Soo Ah?

577
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,671
No.

578
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,610
Who's next?

579
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:48,511
Again.

580
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,110
Have you ever wanted
to break up with me?

581
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,110
No. No way.

582
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,221
- See? It's the truth.
- Again.

583
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,620
Have you ever wanted
to break up with me?

584
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,090
No. Never!

585
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,421
No?

586
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,961
The device says you're lying.

587
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,691
- No.
- I see.

588
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,330
So you wanted to
break up with me?

589
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,001
It's over!

590
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,530
- Soo Ah?
- Soo Ah!

591
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,241
- Soo Ah!
- Soo Ah!

592
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,741
Soo Ah!

593
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,540
I am a girl.

594
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,011
It's working just fine.

595
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:31,090
There's someone I like.

596
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,030
What? It worked
perfectly this time.

597
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,401
Soo Ho?

598
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:44,530
How long have you
been standing there?

599
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,241
You should've let me know.

600
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,241
Anyway, I'll get going.

601
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,181
- Ju Kyung.
- Yes?

602
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,151
- What is it?
- Can you...

603
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,421
- follow me?
- What?

604
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,651
Sure.

605
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,191
Is he mad about something?

606
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,931
I wonder what it's about.

607
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,471
Why were you avoiding me today?

608
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:25,011
What? That's hardly the case.

609
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,211
- Really?
- Of course not.

610
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:32,810
Should we ask the lie detector?

611
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,380
That device gives
random readings.

612
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,991
Whatever.

613
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,661
Gosh, it's prettier
out here at night.

614
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,060
There's not even a single bench.

615
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,431
Look at all the
stars in the sky.

616
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,501
Where?

617
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,241
I blame it on the clouds.

618
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,550
In movies,

619
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,251
zombies jump out of the woods.

620
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:17,890
What did you want to say? Why
did you bring me out here?

621
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,701
- Well...
- Look!

622
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,110
It's so pretty.

623
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,080
It's as if I'm
looking at a painting.

624
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,550
I know.

625
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:54,431
Why don't I turn on some music?

626
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:06,411
I'm low on battery.

627
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,941
I'll turn the
music on with mine.

628
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:18,091
"WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT" BY
CRASH, "FIRE" BY REAL BOYS

629
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,160
"MISSING YOU", UNKNOWN

630
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,681
I love the voice.

631
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,550
Whose song is it?

632
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,880
Se Yeon's.

633
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,090
It's nice.

634
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,790
I don't think I've ever
heard of this song.

635
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,030
It was never released.

636
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,600
You're the first one to hear it.

637
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,100
I see.

638
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,680
But I don't want to.

639
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,810
Let's go!

640
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,881
Where are you headed?

641
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,620
He's off to see the ghost.

642
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,290
A ghost is said to
appear at the well.

643
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,660
A video of us searching
for a ghost will go viral!

644
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,990
Come with us.

645
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,461
I can't be bothered,

646
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:33,100
so have fun.

647
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:37,001
Seo Jun, I see you're
scared of ghosts.

648
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,240
So where's this well?

649
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,841
- There.
- There!

650
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:46,580
- Let's go.
- Seo Jun is going with us!

651
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:58,450
Sorry about that. You hate
being on camera, right?

652
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,361
Why do you hate it?

653
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,870
I had a rough time growing
up because of the paparazzi.

654
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,100
I get it now.

655
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:15,870
It must've been tiring.

656
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,140
Why did you stop?

657
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,981
What?

658
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,160
Do you like taking photos?

659
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:39,830
I never used to before,

660
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,901
but makeup changed it all.

661
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,131
Now, I like it.

662
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,941
- You like it?
- Yes, I like it.

663
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:50,970
Do you like being on a boat?

664
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,281
Yes, I do.

665
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,950
Then,

666
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,450
do you like listening to music?

667
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,290
Of course, I do.

668
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,461
Would you like to
take a photo with me?

669
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,700
Ju Kyung!

670
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:55,344
Guys, it's not too
late to go back.

671
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:57,674
Will you stop it?

672
00:35:57,913 --> 00:35:59,344
- Cut it out.
- My gosh.

673
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:01,244
There's... There's nothing here.

674
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:02,813
I think we might find something.

675
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:04,913
- My gosh.
- This is freaky.

676
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,583
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

677
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,683
Gosh, there's nothing here.

678
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:12,793
I'm really sorry for making
you jump into the lake.

679
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:17,563
But by any chance, did
my makeup come off?

680
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:20,933
Yes.

681
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,273
Gosh, what should I do?

682
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:26,603
I can't let anyone
see me like this.

683
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:29,103
Should I go fetch your makeup?

684
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:32,543
But there's also my
underwear inside my bag.

685
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,983
No, it's okay. I'll
try to hide my face.

686
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,183
It's cold, isn't it?

687
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:45,094
No, it's not cold at all.

688
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:52,994
You don't want your body
temperature to fall.

689
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:56,634
Why is my heart beating so fast?

690
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:58,733
This isn't a scene
from a romance movie.

691
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,203
It's more like a scene
from a survival scene.

692
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,154
Soo Jin?

693
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:18,494
Soo Ho?

694
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,694
Why are you all wet? Did
you fall into the lake?

695
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,264
I accidentally tripped
and fell inside.

696
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,034
You should've been more careful.

697
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,804
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

698
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:32,933
I heard you were with Ju Kyung.

699
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:34,974
- No.
- Oh, really?

700
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:39,974
What was that sound?

701
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:44,313
- A wild boar.
- What?

702
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:46,784
- Let's go.
- Hey.

703
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:00,134
Go on inside.

704
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:02,233
- What about you?
- I need to go find something.

705
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:04,534
Soo Ho.

706
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,654
- Are you scared?
- This is creepy.

707
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:28,793
Look, guys. That over
there is the well.

708
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:30,733
Doesn't it give you goosebumps?

709
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,134
Look at him all scared.

710
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:37,534
Gosh, stop it.

711
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:39,904
Cut it out, okay?
It's not funny.

712
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:43,543
What was that sound?

713
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:46,114
- Let's go.
- I want to go back.

714
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:48,813
Guys, it's nothing.

715
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:52,554
We just heard a strange
sound coming from the well.

716
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,253
- Let me check it out.
- Oh, no...

717
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:13,974
I hope they didn't
recognize me. My goodness.

718
00:39:15,404 --> 00:39:16,643
Cheol Ho!

719
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:23,043
Hey, the well is right here.

720
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,554
Where did he go?

721
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:33,594
Where is he?

722
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:38,793
Why won't he just go away?

723
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:05,094
My gosh, that
startled me so much.

724
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,933
LEE SOO HO: WHERE ARE YOU?

725
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:19,674
Why aren't you picking
up? Where are you?

726
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:36,623
Hey, I just got back.

727
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:56,774
It got all wet.

728
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:15,993
It felt like a fairy tale.

729
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:21,433
But in reality,
my life is a mess.

730
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:48,663
Ju Kyung, are you up already?

731
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,163
Yes, of course, I'm up.

732
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,904
You're pretty even
in the morning.

733
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:13,783
Why did I suddenly get
transferred to the PR team?

734
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:15,553
It's not even time for
personnel appointments.

735
00:42:15,553 --> 00:42:18,754
I know, right? I also found
out after I saw the notice.

736
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:22,024
Then what about my projects?

737
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,864
Hee Kyung.

738
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:26,794
Did you do anything to cross
the CEO or anyone high up?

739
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:31,234
It's weird that you were the only
one who got sent to another team.

740
00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:33,074
I didn't do anything wrong.

741
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:36,473
And even if I did, they can't do
this without any prior notice.

742
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:40,643
Do you know what the best
part about a school trip is?

743
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:45,913
- Having fun with friends!
- Speaking without honorifics!

744
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:49,123
The highlight of a school
trip is doing a treasure hunt.

745
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,053
- My gosh.
- That's lame.

746
00:42:51,493 --> 00:42:53,594
I hid things here and there.

747
00:42:53,964 --> 00:42:56,364
So I want you guys to look
around and find what you can.

748
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,263
Mr. Han, we're not
elementary school kids.

749
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,634
Mr. Han, we're 18
years old, not 8.

750
00:43:01,134 --> 00:43:03,033
- Seriously.
- Mr. Han, I'm hungry!

751
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:04,303
- You ate not too long ago.
- This is boring!

752
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:07,743
The winner will get a gift
voucher worth 50 dollars.

753
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:09,774
- What? 50 dollars?
- 50 dollars?

754
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,444
- 50 dollars!
- Let's go!

755
00:43:11,444 --> 00:43:14,183
- Come on!
- Let's search!

756
00:43:14,643 --> 00:43:15,683
Let's go!

757
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,413
Mr. Han, I'm not
feeling very well.

758
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:22,324
- Go find something!
- Hurry!

759
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:23,754
Hurry up! 50 dollars!

760
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:25,424
- Come on!
- Run!

761
00:43:25,924 --> 00:43:27,223
Keep looking!

762
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:38,634
Ju Kyung, are you sick?

763
00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:48,114
You're burning hot. How
did you end up with a cold?

764
00:43:56,723 --> 00:43:59,123
- I found something!
- Me too!

765
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:02,864
What kind of treasure is this?

766
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:03,993
Knowing is power.

767
00:44:03,993 --> 00:44:05,634
- Nice! 50 dollars!
- Hey!

768
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,833
- It's my quote!
- I found it.

769
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:10,833
- Did you find it?
- Did you find something?

770
00:44:11,134 --> 00:44:12,404
- I found it.
- You found it?

771
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:13,703
- Let me see.
- What is it?

772
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:17,774
- You know the depth of love...
- "You know the depth of love..."

773
00:44:17,774 --> 00:44:19,544
- only in the pain of separation.
- "only in the pain of separation."

774
00:44:22,484 --> 00:44:23,544
It's okay.

775
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,553
- Get out of my way.
- Where are you going?

776
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:27,984
Hey, wait!

777
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:33,254
I won't let you go even if I die.
How do you expect me to let go?

778
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:37,493
If you wish to leave, fix
my heart before you go.

779
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,094
You're not going to die!

780
00:44:42,364 --> 00:44:44,373
Whoever loves Choi Soo
Ah, raise your hand.

781
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:51,143
Who can never forget Choi
Soo Ah? Raise your hand.

782
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:53,913
Who wants to stop Choi Soo Ah
from leaving? Raise your hand.

783
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:56,214
Honey.

784
00:44:57,453 --> 00:44:58,783
What are they doing?

785
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:09,163
Wake up.

786
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,833
I brought medicine for you.

787
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:24,714
How did you know?

788
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:34,353
Get some sleep.

789
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:36,123
Thanks.

790
00:45:36,623 --> 00:45:37,754
Don't get sick.

791
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:40,453
I hate it when people are sick.

792
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,234
Did you find one?

793
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:55,674
Hey, Soo Ho. I found
the first place prize.

794
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:56,803
Have you seen Ju Kyung?

795
00:45:58,444 --> 00:45:59,544
Ju Kyung?

796
00:46:55,864 --> 00:46:58,203
- You'll wake her.
- Let go.

797
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:00,743
What if I refuse?

798
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:03,803
Come out.

799
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,643
What is that? Are they fighting?

800
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:39,743
- Do you still call yourself human?
- Are you blinded?

801
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:41,243
What do you think I am?

802
00:47:42,614 --> 00:47:44,884
- You know I like her!
- Was it first come, first served?

803
00:47:44,884 --> 00:47:46,114
Who cares if you
liked her first?

804
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,353
Are they really fighting?

805
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,353
- Why does it have to be Ju Kyung?
- I don't know either!

806
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:52,594
Why does it have to be her?

807
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,163
- Give up on her!
- Why should I?

808
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,223
Her feelings are what matters.

809
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:04,504
I said to give up.

810
00:48:07,074 --> 00:48:08,344
It's beyond my control.

811
00:48:19,053 --> 00:48:22,484
Look at my eyebrows! What
will you do about these?

812
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,453
I told you yesterday...

813
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:27,623
that it would look awkward for
a week if you want it dark.

814
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,263
It'll be fine in a few days.

815
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:31,493
People are laughing
at me to my face!

816
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:33,864
Must I put up with
that at this age?

817
00:48:34,464 --> 00:48:35,833
I should've gotten
them done in Gangnam.

818
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:38,473
I came to this hick town
because they said you were good.

819
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:39,774
I want a refund,

820
00:48:39,774 --> 00:48:41,643
and put my brows back
to how they were!

821
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:43,203
Then go to Gangnam!

822
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:44,574
Why are you causing a
scene in this hick town?

823
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:45,973
Is that how you treat customers?

824
00:48:57,053 --> 00:48:59,553
What are you doing? This
is our place of business.

825
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:02,364
It's because she did
this to my eyebrows...

826
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:03,824
Sir.

827
00:49:05,364 --> 00:49:08,163
If you look funny a
week later, come then.

828
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:11,904
And if you mistreat my
Hyun Sook ever again,

829
00:49:12,973 --> 00:49:14,274
I will make you pay.

830
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,413
Are you okay?

831
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:29,754
What?

832
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,794
Thanks.

833
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:35,263
"Thanks"?

834
00:49:35,694 --> 00:49:37,464
That's right! Thanks!
What about it?

835
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:41,333
You just thanked me, right?

836
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:42,763
You thanked me!

837
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:55,083
Was it first come, first served?

838
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,413
Who cares if you
liked her first?

839
00:49:56,544 --> 00:49:58,283
Her feelings are what matters.

840
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:08,263
Soo Ho! My best friend!

841
00:50:08,663 --> 00:50:11,163
- Hey. What do you think?
- What?

842
00:50:11,763 --> 00:50:13,163
Did you and Soo Ah make up?

843
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:16,033
You must experience a breakup
to appreciate the depth of love.

844
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:18,134
Who knew my love was this deep?

845
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:19,873
It goes 3 levels
underground, no, 4 levels...

846
00:50:21,044 --> 00:50:22,404
You haven't asked her out?

847
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:24,243
You should do it today.

848
00:50:24,243 --> 00:50:26,643
You need to do it nonchalantly
in an unusual location...

849
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:29,643
for it to have a high
probability of success.

850
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:30,783
Understand, man?

851
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:33,884
Hey, Ju Kyung! I heard you were
sick and had to take medicine.

852
00:50:33,884 --> 00:50:34,984
Are you feeling better?

853
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:36,783
You're eating well, right?

854
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:39,194
I'm fine. I'm going to go.

855
00:50:39,723 --> 00:50:40,853
Stay healthy!

856
00:50:42,993 --> 00:50:44,024
Tae Hoon!

857
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:47,393
Are you bugging Soo Ho again?

858
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:48,933
He hates you.

859
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,603
Get a clue.

860
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:52,333
- What are you saying? Enunciate.
- What?

861
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,833
- "What"?
- What?

862
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,004
- "What"?
- Are you copying me?

863
00:50:55,004 --> 00:50:56,044
- "Are you copying me?"
- What?

864
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:05,953
Why did you set
a table out here?

865
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:08,723
The moon is nice tonight.

866
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,324
Ju Kyung isn't home,

867
00:51:10,524 --> 00:51:12,723
and Hee Kyung and Ju
Young will be late.

868
00:51:13,594 --> 00:51:15,623
So I thought we could have
a romantic dinner. Sit.

869
00:51:15,763 --> 00:51:19,163
My gosh. You must be giddy
you got a compliment...

870
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,364
instead of a scolding for once.

871
00:51:23,203 --> 00:51:24,404
Stir-fried kimchi with tofu?

872
00:51:25,574 --> 00:51:27,404
Do you remember our first date?

873
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:31,714
We had stir-fried kimchi with tofu
and makgeolli in Cheongpyeong.

874
00:51:32,243 --> 00:51:33,814
You remember everything.

875
00:51:34,913 --> 00:51:36,314
I should've run away.

876
00:51:36,314 --> 00:51:38,214
Why did I fall for you then...

877
00:51:38,214 --> 00:51:40,214
and make myself
suffer at this age?

878
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,723
I'm the fool for falling
for a pretty face.

879
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,694
Stop killing the mood.

880
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:54,533
Still, you used to be
really good-looking.

881
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:58,533
You even sang well too. How
could I not fall for you?

882
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,634
I haven't changed.

883
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:04,714
You came.

884
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:08,114
To me.

885
00:52:08,484 --> 00:52:11,083
With a rose.

886
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:14,314
Between your red lips

887
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:16,683
I fantasized.

888
00:52:16,683 --> 00:52:20,654
As I looked at you, so
pure and transparent.

889
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:25,163
Can I empty myself.

890
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:26,694
What has gotten into you?

891
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:28,634
I fantasized this.

892
00:52:28,634 --> 00:52:33,703
Can I dive into your eyes.

893
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:36,143
Tonight.

894
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:41,083
I'm home...

895
00:52:43,013 --> 00:52:44,714
Oh my eyes.

896
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:49,024
- Get out.
- Gross.

897
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:53,493
Darn it. Gross.

898
00:52:54,864 --> 00:52:56,464
Instant jjajang noodles please.

899
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:10,643
What about the radish?

900
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:11,844
That's self-service.

901
00:53:12,044 --> 00:53:13,743
Oh my gosh. Did you follow me?

902
00:53:14,413 --> 00:53:15,484
Freak.

903
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,723
She got a job here just
so she could see me.

904
00:53:22,223 --> 00:53:23,654
Her efforts are commendable.

905
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:31,533
Here. Go on.

906
00:53:32,763 --> 00:53:35,234
I don't usually
give out my number,

907
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:36,904
but I'll make an exception.

908
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,603
Freak. Why did you want
pictures of yourself?

909
00:53:48,243 --> 00:53:49,444
Go Woon, it's time to go, right?

910
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:51,353
Yes. I'll go now.

911
00:53:52,183 --> 00:53:55,583
Sure. She couldn't even imagine
that I'd ask her for her number.

912
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,223
Of course, not.

913
00:53:58,053 --> 00:54:00,853
My dear man. Why
are you so dashing?

914
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:03,263
What's wrong with you?

915
00:54:11,674 --> 00:54:12,734
Stop it.

916
00:54:13,203 --> 00:54:15,344
My heart raced a little.

917
00:54:20,944 --> 00:54:22,984
My heart raced a little.

918
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:42,364
Let's hear it for them.

919
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:43,833
Next up. The Rainbow Team...

920
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:46,734
will show their Super Strength Show.
Let's welcome them to the stage.

921
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:51,103
All right!

922
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:52,774
What is he pulling
with his teeth?

923
00:54:53,143 --> 00:54:55,544
It's a car. No, a bicycle!

924
00:54:56,944 --> 00:54:58,013
The show goes on.

925
00:54:58,683 --> 00:54:59,783
Nicely done.

926
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:01,453
Okay.

927
00:55:01,824 --> 00:55:03,384
Look at the size of that.

928
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:14,734
Did you see all those
balloons pop? He's so good.

929
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:20,004
Finish. Good job.

930
00:55:23,743 --> 00:55:24,873
Let's dance!

931
00:55:26,774 --> 00:55:28,643
Clap to the beat, everyone.

932
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:30,844
Looking fun.

933
00:55:41,594 --> 00:55:43,723
Shameless, aren't they?

934
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:53,074
I hear Saebom High
School has a celebrity.

935
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:57,774
Apparently, one student used
to be a K-pop idol trainee.

936
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:58,844
Where are you?

937
00:55:58,844 --> 00:56:01,683
- Here.
- So the rumor is true!

938
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:03,413
- All right!
- Seriously?

939
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:06,254
Handsome and charismatic.

940
00:56:06,453 --> 00:56:07,924
- Let's bring him up here.
- I can't believe it.

941
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:10,783
Just how far has
the rumor spread?

942
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:13,524
- Just sit down.
- Don't be a joke and sit down.

943
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:16,364
What else can we do but
bring him up on this stage?

944
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:17,464
You told him, didn't you?

945
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:20,094
You're a great singer,
so sing us a song.

946
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:21,734
- Just this once.
- No way.

947
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:23,203
You really won't?

948
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:26,234
I'd love to hear you sing.

949
00:56:26,504 --> 00:56:29,143
Han Seo Jun!

950
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,944
- Han Seo Jun!
- Han Seo Jun!

951
00:56:32,413 --> 00:56:34,243
- Han Seo Jun!
- Han Seo Jun.

952
00:56:34,243 --> 00:56:36,143
- Do you want to hear me sing?
- Of course.

953
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,154
- Don't tell me you're embarrassed.
- Han Seo Jun.

954
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:39,913
- Go on up there.
- Han Seo Jun.

955
00:56:40,154 --> 00:56:41,524
- Then grant me a wish.
- Han Seo Jun.

956
00:56:41,723 --> 00:56:44,254
- You're just like my brother.
- Han Seo Jun.

957
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:47,254
Sure. Sing a song
and you get one wish.

958
00:56:51,564 --> 00:56:53,663
- Nice!
- Seo Jun is so cool.

959
00:57:03,444 --> 00:57:04,944
How sweet.

960
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:09,944
You and me under
a starlit night.

961
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:15,484
Making me anew and
bringing me warmth.

962
00:57:16,053 --> 00:57:19,553
Is your gaze and your smile.

963
00:57:19,794 --> 00:57:23,094
That I'll forever
keep in my heart.

964
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:26,933
My heart is filled
with thoughts of you

965
00:57:26,933 --> 00:57:29,263
I become more like you.

966
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,404
A gift for you.

967
00:57:31,603 --> 00:57:34,904
More beautiful than a dream.

968
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:38,913
In our embrace.

969
00:57:38,944 --> 00:57:42,344
In which we'll walk
endlessly tonight.

970
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:47,913
I wish to give you
all the days I have.

971
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:52,754
I want you to know how I feel.

972
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:57,564
My feelings that
can never stay calm.

973
00:57:57,993 --> 00:58:02,163
Light up this night so brightly.

974
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:04,103
- Hey, where are you going?
- Enjoying.

975
00:58:04,103 --> 00:58:07,174
Everyday moments with you.

976
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:11,944
Do you know that brings
me my biggest joy?

977
00:58:12,473 --> 00:58:17,243
You become the
light of my world.

978
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,884
So stay as you are.

979
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:23,524
Just by my side.

980
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:35,234
Ju Kyung, wait.

981
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:39,774
Here. Can you take
this to Soo Ho?

982
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,643
What? Me?

983
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,103
Listen to me carefully.

984
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:46,013
Walk southeast and you'll
find Soo Ho on a walk.

985
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:49,044
Hold on a second.

986
00:58:49,344 --> 00:58:51,683
Gosh, nature's
calling. I'm sorry.

987
00:58:51,754 --> 00:58:53,314
What about the jacket?

988
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:54,824
Oh, right.

989
00:59:06,634 --> 00:59:07,794
Soo Ho!

990
00:59:08,404 --> 00:59:10,703
Walk southeast and... No, wait.

991
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:14,174
Walk northwest and Ju Kyung
will be by the stream.

992
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:17,404
Tell her how you
feel, my friend.

993
00:59:18,944 --> 00:59:21,344
Wait. I forbid you to be moved.

994
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:50,904
Hey, Soo Ho.

995
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:04,783
Ju Kyung?

996
01:00:05,723 --> 01:00:06,953
Why are you still out here?

997
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:09,594
- You see...
- Have you seen Soo Ho?

998
01:00:10,594 --> 01:00:12,833
- Soo Ho?
- You still didn't ask her out?

999
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,794
You should do it today.

1000
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:18,734
I saw him go that earlier.

1001
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,074
- Isn't that Soo Ho's?
- What?

1002
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:26,314
Yes, Tae Hoon wanted
me to give it to him.

1003
01:00:26,314 --> 01:00:28,283
Really? Then I'll get it to him.

1004
01:00:33,853 --> 01:00:37,123
Sure, I guess you could do it.

1005
01:00:38,254 --> 01:00:39,723
That's probably what's right.

1006
01:00:41,294 --> 01:00:42,564
I heard he's by the stream.

1007
01:00:42,564 --> 01:00:44,094
Really? Well, head
inside and get some rest.

1008
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:54,174
Lim Ju Kyung.

1009
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:01,944
Don't you forget that
you should grant my wish.

1010
01:01:05,714 --> 01:01:06,984
So how was it?

1011
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:09,754
You said you wanted
to hear me sing.

1012
01:01:12,993 --> 01:01:15,663
Why? Was it that touching?

1013
01:01:16,123 --> 01:01:19,094
My singing has been known
to bring many to tears,

1014
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:21,833
but don't you cry as well.

1015
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:30,243
Hey, what's wrong?

1016
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:38,083
- What is this?
- What do you mean?

1017
01:01:38,513 --> 01:01:40,214
Ju Kyung asked me
to get this to you.

1018
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,453
- She asked you?
- Yes.

1019
01:01:44,953 --> 01:01:47,424
Hey, wait. At least
take your jacket.

1020
01:01:52,194 --> 01:01:54,694
You dropped this.

1021
01:02:14,683 --> 01:02:15,884
What is it?

1022
01:02:18,294 --> 01:02:19,493
Is it because you're sick?

1023
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:22,763
I'm sorry, all right?

1024
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:25,833
Whatever it is, I'm sorry.

1025
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,404
Why?

1026
01:02:29,634 --> 01:02:31,904
Why doesn't Soo Ho like me?

1027
01:02:37,373 --> 01:02:39,044
- I...
- Don't say it.

1028
01:02:39,243 --> 01:02:41,513
- You see...
- Don't say it!

1029
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:44,044
I like Soo Ho.

1030
01:02:45,714 --> 01:02:47,453
I told you not to say it.

1031
01:02:47,754 --> 01:02:49,623
I thought I'd be okay with it,

1032
01:02:51,654 --> 01:02:53,154
but it hurts.

1033
01:03:02,263 --> 01:03:05,473
Keep this a secret though, okay?

1034
01:03:08,234 --> 01:03:10,473
Why couldn't you keep
it a secret from me too?

1035
01:03:12,473 --> 01:03:13,614
Let me see.

1036
01:03:17,783 --> 01:03:20,183
Crying makes you
look ugly, you know.

1037
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:22,223
Don't cry.

1038
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:47,743
Forget it. You'll only
rub my makeup off.

1039
01:04:15,274 --> 01:04:17,504
I can't believe I wailed
like some ugly duckling.

1040
01:04:18,643 --> 01:04:20,373
I hope the show-and-tell
isn't over.

1041
01:04:20,674 --> 01:04:22,743
I should touch up my face
before they come back.

1042
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:27,953
You said you
weren't avoiding me.

1043
01:04:30,484 --> 01:04:31,623
Did you cry?

1044
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:35,524
Why? Was it because of Seo Jun?

1045
01:04:37,824 --> 01:04:39,364
Why would you cry
because of him?

1046
01:04:41,064 --> 01:04:42,234
Do you like him?

1047
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,574
- What?
- Do you like Seo Jun?

1048
01:04:47,074 --> 01:04:48,774
- Why do you care?
- Answer me.

1049
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:50,973
What's the matter with you?

1050
01:04:51,873 --> 01:04:53,143
Why do you care that I cried?

1051
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:54,544
And why do you want
to know whom I like?

1052
01:04:55,913 --> 01:04:59,114
Why do you keep confusing me
when you like someone else?

1053
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:01,884
What do you mean?

1054
01:05:02,154 --> 01:05:03,553
I know you like Soo Jin.

1055
01:05:05,053 --> 01:05:07,553
So why do you keep being nice to
me and making my heart flutter...

1056
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:13,333
Ju Kyung.

1057
01:05:14,163 --> 01:05:16,103
I think there's a
misunderstanding.

1058
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:18,033
- Did you see that?
- I really rocked the show.

1059
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:20,574
- You didn't do it properly.
- I know.

1060
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,473
I have no makeup on. My gosh.

1061
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:32,754
It's the ugly spirit!

1062
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:34,114
My gosh, it's the ugly spirit!

1063
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:35,183
Oh, gosh!

1064
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:37,283
- It's that ghost!
- I caught you this time.

1065
01:05:37,424 --> 01:05:40,254
- Let's go catch the ugly spirit!
- Let's go!

1066
01:05:40,254 --> 01:05:42,064
- Go catch her!
- Wait for me!

1067
01:05:49,134 --> 01:05:52,274
- Catch the ugly spirit!
- Go!

1068
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:53,533
Let's catch her!

1069
01:05:59,844 --> 01:06:02,183
My gosh, why are they
chasing after me?

1070
01:06:02,243 --> 01:06:03,344
What am I going to do?

1071
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:26,433
She went that way!

1072
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:29,343
- Come on!
- Go down!

1073
01:06:31,543 --> 01:06:32,744
- Go!
- Run!

1074
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:39,454
- There she is!
- Over there!

1075
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:40,614
- Let's go!
- Come on!

1076
01:06:42,154 --> 01:06:43,284
Go get her!

1077
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:45,994
I don't like Soo Jin.

1078
01:06:48,723 --> 01:06:50,124
The person I like...

1079
01:06:50,124 --> 01:06:51,223
There she is!

1080
01:06:52,963 --> 01:06:54,034
It's you.

1081
01:07:54,846 --> 01:07:57,664
SPECIAL THANKS TO WOO HYUN
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1082
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:26,693
EPILOGUE

1083
01:08:29,463 --> 01:08:31,393
He must know that
what's inside a pot...

1084
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:33,263
is more important
than the pot itself.

1085
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:38,464
TRUE BEAUTY

1086
01:08:39,334 --> 01:08:40,973
<i>You don't see anyone
from school, do you?</i>

1087
01:08:41,173 --> 01:08:42,244
<i>Duck.</i>

1088
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:43,543
<i>Is this really necessary?</i>

1089
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,374
<i>I'm just a bit embarrassed.</i>

1090
01:08:45,814 --> 01:08:47,173
<i>Why do you want a part-time job?</i>

1091
01:08:47,314 --> 01:08:49,013
<i>So I can afford to pay
for the makeup academy.</i>

1092
01:08:49,383 --> 01:08:51,414
<i>Do you want me to help
you find a part-time job?</i>

1093
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:53,314
<i>- I'm really bad, aren't I?
- No.</i>

1094
01:08:53,883 --> 01:08:55,423
<i>You're unbelievably horrible.</i>

1095
01:08:55,984 --> 01:08:58,253
<i>I brought you here because I
want to show you something.</i>

1096
01:09:00,454 --> 01:09:01,753
<i>I like Soo Ho.</i>

1097
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:06,293
<i>Ju Kyung, let's break up.</i>
