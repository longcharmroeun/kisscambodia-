00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,018
LEE JOO HUN CONFESSES THE TRUTH
BEHIND JEONG SE YEON'S DEATH

3
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:41,198
Soo Ho.

4
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:53,008
It's you again.

5
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:55,308
Yes.

6
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:04,118
It's me again.

7
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:07,118
I wanted to see you,

8
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:12,297
and here you are.

9
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,868
I came to give you a hug.

10
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,047
Do you feel better?

11
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:45,987
I don't have a lot of
memories with my dad.

12
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,427
After my mom passed away,

13
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:51,528
he was mostly in the States.

14
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,528
I lived with my grandmother,

15
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:58,837
and I started living alone
once I entered middle school.

16
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:02,938
It must've been tough.

17
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:07,177
I hated him for a long time.

18
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:12,918
I had a lot of pent up anger toward him,

19
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,147
and I finally let it out.

20
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,957
I thought that would
make me feel better.

21
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,758
But I still feel uneasy.

22
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:40,478
I don't know if it's because
I still can't forgive him...

23
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,378
or if it's because I
feel bad for him now.

24
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:46,778
I'm still not sure...

25
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:51,718
what it is that I'm feeling right now.

26
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,677
What? You just ran out in
the middle of your lesson?

27
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:15,408
Honey, calm down. Just
talk it out with her.

28
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,207
Where is your mind at?

29
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,918
Don't you know that this is
an important period for you?

30
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,848
How dare you?

31
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,718
Don't you dare glare at me like that!

32
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,257
- That little...
- Honey, wait.

33
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,458
Honey, please. Calm down.

34
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,937
What do you think you're
doing? Open the door right now!

35
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,708
Honey, I'll talk to her, so please stop.

36
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,908
Open the door!

37
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:14,538
Mr. Kang, how are things at the office?

38
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:15,867
It's a complete mess.

39
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:19,437
The reporters and Black Soul fans
are in front of the building.

40
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:21,237
And it's caused serious
damage to the agency.

41
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,408
Your father probably has
a lot on his mind too.

42
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:48,437
"MISSING YOU"

43
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,547
DEAR SOO HO AND SEO JUN

44
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:33,778
I WASN'T GOING TO WRITE THIS
BECAUSE IT FELT SO CORNY.

45
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:34,817
Hey.

46
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,547
CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING
FIRST PLACE, SE YEON!

47
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,088
Here.

48
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,888
Gosh, it's loose.

49
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,427
- You're wearing the hat crooked.
- Wear this.

50
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,497
Dear Soo Ho and Seo Jun.

51
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,968
- How do I look?
- It looks nice on you.

52
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,737
I wasn't going to write this
because it felt so corny.

53
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,247
I wasn't able to thank you guys
when I won the first place...

54
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,047
because I was busy crying.

55
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:05,447
CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING
FIRST PLACE, SE YEON!

56
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:07,418
I'm writing a letter hoping
you guys won't feel upset.

57
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:15,057
I always had a lonely life,

58
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:17,158
but thanks to you guys,

59
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,757
the past three years of my
life were filled with warmth.

60
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,638
Thanks to our time together,
I was able to laugh a lot,

61
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,437
gain more confidence,

62
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,237
and finally achieve my dream.

63
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,888
Today's the best day of my entire life.

64
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,757
And I will always remember...

65
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,487
you guys were with me today.

66
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,828
My precious friends.

67
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:00,997
I love you guys.

68
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:07,007
I know I'll feel embarrassed
if you guys read this letter,

69
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,978
so I hope you never find it.

70
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:12,648
From Se Yeon.

71
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,268
Do you know what Se Yeon
said the day we bought this?

72
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:36,807
He hoped that our friendship
would last forever.

73
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,437
I told him to stop being so childish.

74
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:41,908
Yes, you did.

75
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:44,748
Back then, I took it for granted.

76
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,118
So I thought we'd always
be together forever.

77
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:53,057
But who knew he'd die so quickly?

78
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:55,927
I know.

79
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,187
It really didn't last long.

80
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,998
I wasn't there for him when
he was having a hard time.

81
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:04,168
And I regret it so much.

82
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:07,097
But he's no longer around.

83
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:11,337
So I ended up taking it out on you...

84
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,677
because it made me feel better.

85
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:18,977
I was so caught up
with how hurt I was...

86
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,317
that I didn't know that you
were hurting inside as well.

87
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:26,057
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:34,097
What's the matter with us?

89
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,878
MISSED CALL, DAD

90
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,378
How's your dad handling this?

91
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:55,047
I don't know.

92
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:59,187
In the past, I was so jealous
of you for having a rich dad.

93
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,158
But now I'm not jealous at all.

94
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,087
Why were you jealous?

95
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,727
You have a mom.

96
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,557
Are you trying to compete
with who has a sadder life?

97
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,368
Your family's rich.

98
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:11,628
I'm not sure that's true anymore.

99
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,238
Rich people don't have problems
eating three meals a day...

100
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:15,268
even if they go bankrupt.

101
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,408
You mean they're okay
for three generations.

102
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,638
- You idiot.
- What?

103
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,677
You really know nothing.

104
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:23,648
Gosh, who threw this cigarette bud?

105
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,347
Are you talking to me?

106
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,888
Did you just throw this
cigarette bud at us?

107
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,528
What kind of a gangster are you?

108
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,557
Look at this kid. He
just called us gangsters.

109
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:38,898
- Who is this kid?
- Who?

110
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:41,628
- Look at those kids.
- Who are you boys?

111
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:42,998
What's your problem?

112
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,467
What's your deal?

113
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,437
Hey, kid. Come over here.

114
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,368
Look at him.

115
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:51,408
Just hold your anger.

116
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,707
Hey. Run.

117
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,307
Hey.

118
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:57,648
- Hey... Hey.
- Catch them.

119
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:58,977
- Come over here.
- Hey!

120
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:02,047
- Hey! Get over here!
- Where do you think you're going?

121
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,148
- Catch them.
- Are you going to throw that?

122
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,118
What do you think you're doing?

123
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,227
Catch them!

124
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:10,687
- Go!
- Get over here!

125
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:12,597
- Hey!
- Come here!

126
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,097
- Get over here!
- Go get them!

127
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,668
- Hey, come here!
- Run!

128
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:18,868
Catch them!

129
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,797
- Get back here!
- Go get them!

130
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,608
Catch them!

131
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,077
- Run!
- Catch them!

132
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,577
- Run faster!
- Go get them!

133
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,618
Hey!

134
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:35,947
My gosh.

135
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:40,888
- My gosh.
- Darn it.

136
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,557
My gosh, what's this smell?

137
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:45,227
- Darn it.
- Come out here.

138
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,028
- What's this smell?
- They jumped into a pile of feces.

139
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,028
What did they use to
fertilize this place?

140
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:51,998
Consider yourselves lucky.

141
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,168
- Let's go.
- Okay, boss.

142
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,238
- My gosh.
- Seriously.

143
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:00,577
You and your temper!

144
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:01,878
I didn't know!

145
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:04,748
Hey. I carried you.

146
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:06,618
My arm hurts.

147
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,347
It stinks.

148
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:11,248
Get off of me.

149
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,967
Ju Kyung should see you now.

150
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,268
Because she'd be disappointed?

151
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,807
Do you think that would
make her go to you?

152
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,337
I never said that. Do
I make you nervous?

153
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,508
Obviously.

154
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,008
Are you over her yet or not?

155
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:37,508
It's not that easy.

156
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,778
Then what? Do you plan to
tell your feelings for her?

157
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:43,187
Are you stupid? She's
going out with you.

158
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,847
Get over it.

159
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:48,158
- It's not that easy.
- Then what do you plan to do?

160
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:50,528
I don't know. Get away from me.

161
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:52,628
- Don't touch me.
- I didn't.

162
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:56,268
You have poop all over
your face. You reek.

163
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:57,467
Look who's talking.

164
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:04,337
PERIOD MAKEUP

165
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,278
Are you finally registering?

166
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:11,608
Yes. I got paid today.

167
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,047
Will you be the next Selena?

168
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,118
WILL YOU BE THE NEXT SELENA?

169
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,618
Hello.

170
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,187
I came to register.

171
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,087
Okay. Please fill this out.

172
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,727
NAME: LIM JU KYUNG

173
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,268
Stop spilling.

174
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:17,878
- Should I add rice?
- Yes.

175
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,827
Thanks. Get me some water.

176
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:40,668
It's mine.

177
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:42,868
Don't show off that you're dating.

178
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:48,937
Did you two make up?

179
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,577
I said to stay out of it.

180
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:52,817
How can I?

181
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:55,547
Didn't you fight because of the
rumor that she and I are dating?

182
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:56,988
You petty loser.

183
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:01,217
There must be a reason why
she can't tell the others...

184
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:02,888
that you two are dating.

185
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:04,057
Like what?

186
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,498
I think it's because of Soo Jin.

187
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:10,197
Soo Jin?

188
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:14,738
How are you in a relationship
when you're this dense?

189
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:18,837
You've been on my mind these days.

190
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:22,477
GIRLFRIEND

191
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:38,587
Hi...

192
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,998
Don't laugh. How did it go today?

193
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,668
It almost went well.

194
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,837
The ending was quite the spectacle.

195
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,268
Why? What happened?

196
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,668
We rolled on a field of poop.

197
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,538
I didn't know you could make jokes.

198
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,378
How's your leg? Wasn't it
tiring walking with a crutch?

199
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,508
You should take it easy.

200
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:02,118
I read that bananas, spinach,
safflower, broccoli, and oranges...

201
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,317
are good for healing broken bones.

202
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,087
Remember that.

203
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,957
Bananas, spinach, safflower...

204
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:09,988
Why are you laughing?

205
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:12,557
I like hearing you nag. Keep going.

206
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:15,227
Stop that.

207
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,528
That's right. I have something for you.

208
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:20,197
What is it?

209
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:21,768
Hold on.

210
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,538
Where is it?

211
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:24,908
Ta-da!

212
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:27,337
Don't you have anything for me?

213
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:30,577
Me?

214
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:36,347
Ta-da!

215
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:39,717
Here's another one.

216
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,388
- Ju Kyung!
- I said to knock.

217
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,358
- Take this.
- What?

218
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,138
Gross.

219
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:56,608
I'm going to kill you! I'll kill you!

220
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,108
Hey.

221
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,977
Good night. I'll call you tomorrow.

222
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,217
Gross!

223
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:33,207
What's this? Hey, Seo
Jun. Open this door.

224
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,078
Hey! Hey!

225
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:36,477
Seo Jun!

226
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:49,628
I finally get to see
you. See you at school.

227
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:54,957
Come home early, will you?
You're just like your dad.

228
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:57,298
- See you later.
- That brat.

229
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,138
- I'm here.
- Already?

230
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,017
You must've left home early.

231
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,348
You should've gone straight to school.

232
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,957
We have to hide it at school though.

233
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:21,787
Let's walk like this to the bus stop.

234
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:26,927
Are you okay with it? You
wanted to tell the others.

235
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,168
I was blinded by jealousy, that was why.

236
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,168
Jealousy?

237
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,668
Why were you jealous?

238
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,568
Let's tell them once
you're comfortable with it.

239
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,537
- Did Soo Jin...
- What?

240
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:45,808
Never mind.

241
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,217
Hey.

242
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,348
Your zipper was open.

243
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,618
Thanks.

244
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:57,628
You transferred, right? I saw
you in the teachers' office.

245
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,358
Yes.

246
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:03,168
Joo Hye Min.

247
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:05,398
What a pretty name.

248
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,707
Ju Kyung. Lim Ju Kyung!

249
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,547
Lim Ju Kyung?

250
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:52,987
Let's go, Soo Jin.

251
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:07,066
Why is Hye Min here?

252
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,806
That was our uniform.

253
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,066
Did she transfer here? Why?

254
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,237
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

255
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:18,106
What? No, I'm fine.

256
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,846
Soo Ho! Is your dad retiring?

257
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,416
What's up, my friend?
Congratulations on your recovery.

258
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:28,316
Applause. Applause.

259
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:30,427
Congratulations for what?

260
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:35,626
Soo Ho.

261
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,326
Did you lose the cast?

262
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:40,497
- What about it?
- I did.

263
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,197
Are they going to fight?

264
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:43,636
Good.

265
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:47,136
Are you sleeping already?

266
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,977
- Yes.
- What's with this lukewarm mood?

267
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:52,247
It's good, but...

268
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,576
You should get along with your friends.

269
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:58,017
Ju Kyung! You're here. Check this out.

270
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,787
I entered you in the
Newstagram Queen Contest...

271
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:03,027
and you're in second place.

272
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,856
You're not trailing far behind,
so you might take the lead.

273
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:07,427
Oh, I see.

274
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:08,656
What does the winner get?

275
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,126
- Prize money?
- No.

276
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,596
It just feels good to win.

277
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,896
The leader of a girl group
that recently debuted...

278
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:17,366
was sought out by
entertainment agencies...

279
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,906
after winning first place.

280
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,376
What's so good about
getting that famous though?

281
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:25,346
Well, being famous just feels good.

282
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:27,747
Not for me though.

283
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:30,086
The schools' pride is on the line,

284
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:32,616
so everyone's trying to make
one from their school win.

285
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,386
I was eliminated from
the race earlier on,

286
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,927
but you should win and
maintain our dignity.

287
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:41,826
Annoyingly enough, the one currently
in first place goes to Yongpa High.

288
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,136
NEWSTAGRAM QUEEN CONTEST

289
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:47,636
Park Se Mi?

00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,507
200,710 LIKES

291
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:57,606
200,855 LIKES

292
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,047
- Here comes the Queen!
- Here comes the Queen!

293
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:01,977
She's right here.

294
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,346
Did you doubt me?

295
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:06,487
Didn't you force
everyone to vote for you?

296
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:07,556
Exactly.

297
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:16,497
Why did you upload my
photo? Please pull it down.

298
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:19,366
The voting has begun, so I can't.

299
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:20,636
What?

300
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,437
Guys, log onto Newstagram...

301
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:25,106
and vote for Ju Kyung. Come on.

302
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:31,677
- Just Ju Kyung, okay?
- Right.

303
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:34,076
- All right.
- Here it is.

304
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:51,396
LIM JU KYUNG

305
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:52,527
LITERATURES REVIEW

306
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,406
Oh my gosh. What is it?

307
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:03,146
Did you have something to say?

308
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,277
Nothing.

309
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:07,876
I see that Ju Kyung got an A plus.

310
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:10,687
- Sorry?
- That's a good grade.

311
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,886
A plus.

312
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:17,386
Is there a reason why
she can't get an A plus?

313
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,757
Her choice to write about
horror fiction was fresh...

314
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,697
and she logically criticized...

315
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:24,027
the prejudice that
divides different genres.

316
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,697
Her score was based accurately
on the score guidelines.

317
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,737
I wasn't showing favoritism.

318
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:31,306
The fact that you have to
explain yourself like a loser...

319
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:33,677
makes it seem more
like a pathetic excuse.

320
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,346
Now I'm really suspicious.

321
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:39,007
Explaining myself like a loser?

322
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:42,177
Me? When did I ever?

323
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:44,447
Sorry about that.

324
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:46,187
I'm sorry.

325
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:00,336
Soo Ho.

326
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,707
- Is your leg fully healed now?
- Yes.

327
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,037
That's great. I was worried, you know.

328
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:11,547
So what are you doing after
school? Could we talk?

329
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:14,247
Regarding what? You can say it here.

330
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,717
Well, this doesn't seem
like the right place.

331
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:18,816
- So maybe later...
- I have plans.

332
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,017
Is it important? Can't you cancel it?

333
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:25,626
This is something I can
only tell you about.

334
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,856
It's because of Kang Soo
Jin that she can't say it.

335
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,566
I have plans with my girlfriend.

336
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:35,336
Oh, I never told you, did I?

337
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:38,537
It's Ju Kyung. She's my girlfriend.

338
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:44,076
For some reason, she doesn't
want to tell the others yet,

339
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:45,507
so play dumb for a while.

340
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:49,177
Why did you just tell me though?

341
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:50,816
I thought you should know...

342
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:53,616
because you're my friend.

343
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,947
But everyone will see us.

344
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:25,646
I'll then do this.

345
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,886
What?

346
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,556
Soo Ho's leg must still hurt.

347
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:32,356
- I hope you get well soon.
- Thanks.

348
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,757
- Darn, he's tall.
- Get well soon.

349
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:36,096
See?

350
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,297
Is something up though?
You seem worried.

351
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,136
It's nothing. Come on.

352
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,836
Soo Jin saved us seats.

353
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,977
There she is.

354
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:49,947
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy your lunch.

355
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:52,346
- Hey.
- You're here.

356
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:54,316
- Hi, guys.
- I'm starving.

357
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,616
Soo Jin, who's she?

358
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:04,687
Oh, this is Hye Min.

359
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:07,356
We have a class together,
so I invited her to join us.

360
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,957
I see. Hi!

361
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:11,227
- Hi.
- Hi.

362
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:13,336
You don't seem familiar
though. Did you transfer?

363
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,566
From which school?

364
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,306
Yongpa High School.

365
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,437
Is that so?

366
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,177
What? Another student from Yongpa High?

367
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:23,106
Ju Kyung, the bullies
that dragged you away...

368
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:25,007
were from that school too.

369
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:26,146
Unbelievable.

370
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,947
Ju Kyung, you transferred
schools as well, right?

371
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:30,447
From which one?

372
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:35,386
- Wait. Did you never tell us?
- You're right.

373
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:37,457
I don't think I caught that either.

374
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:38,886
Which school did you transfer from?

375
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,656
Well...

376
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:44,366
My old school's quite
far away from here.

377
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:47,366
Hey.

378
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:50,136
Don't you know me?

379
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:57,076
There was a girl named Lim
Ju Kyung at my old school.

380
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:00,116
You look a lot like her.

381
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:04,217
Really?

382
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:07,017
Did you transfer here from Yongpa High?

383
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:08,916
No.

384
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,027
I don't know you.

385
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:14,297
I don't care how much we look alike.

386
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:16,626
I'm not from Yongpa High,
so don't be mistaken.

387
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:20,197
Oh, I see.

388
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:22,237
Sorry.

389
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:24,237
There's no need to be that harsh.

390
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,076
Excuse me. My stomach's acting up.

391
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:31,947
- Hey.
- Ju Kyung?

392
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:35,316
She must be really sick.

393
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:46,856
Do you not really know or
are you just playing dumb?

394
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,636
Can makeup really mask people...

395
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,267
to the point that
they're unrecognizable?

396
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:58,806
What?

397
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:06,277
PRINCE COMICS

398
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:08,076
She probably didn't recognize me.

399
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:11,416
I'm so glad we're not in the same class.

400
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:15,717
No one will find out
unless I interact with her.

401
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:20,727
Darn it!

402
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:24,697
What's the matter?

403
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:29,237
Oh, it's nothing.

404
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:37,747
Here. This is for you.

405
00:28:41,576 --> 00:28:43,487
It's only visible to
those that are kind.

406
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,047
Can't you see the watch in there?

407
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,217
It's expensive, you know.

408
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:49,886
Here. Let me.

409
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,396
If you find yourself
out of breath again,

410
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:54,856
take this to your mouth...

411
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:56,797
and breathe in and out.

412
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:59,366
Breathing into this
bag will calm you down.

413
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:00,997
Have it with you at all times.

414
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:05,666
Is there more?

415
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,806
These are worry dolls.

416
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:10,477
Tell them what's on your
mind if you can't sleep.

417
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:13,646
Anything that's making
you sad and worried.

418
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:15,547
Place them under your pillow...

419
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,547
and they'll take away all
your worries while you sleep.

420
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,616
I doubt that's true.

421
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:23,116
These are actually used
in therapy, you know.

422
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:24,427
I looked it up.

423
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:34,566
Knitting helps ease the mind.

424
00:29:34,997 --> 00:29:36,636
- Knitting?
- Yes.

425
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:40,037
Lastly.

426
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,477
Ta-da!

427
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:43,947
I bought these with the money I earned.

428
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:45,447
They're a matching set.

429
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,646
Open yours.

430
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:53,146
Cute, right?

431
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:58,027
Kids will figure it out if
we hang these on our bags.

432
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:59,356
I know.

433
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:02,727
So we'll do so when we're
able to go public...

434
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,066
with our relationship.

435
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,497
I'm to keep it unused then.

436
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,697
Just having it brings you joy.

437
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:16,906
So...

438
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:21,416
have you talked to your
father since that day?

439
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:26,287
No.

440
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:29,017
It may not be easy right now,

441
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:33,056
but I think it'll be
nice to talk it out.

442
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,566
I don't want you to regret anything.

443
00:30:41,136 --> 00:30:42,297
Got it.

444
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:45,507
These worry dolls though.

445
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:47,836
Don't you need them more?

446
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:49,336
You worry all the time.

447
00:30:52,606 --> 00:30:54,177
No, these are yours.

448
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:55,876
They're really cute.

449
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:57,217
They're cute, right?

450
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,386
They have different facial expressions.

451
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:03,626
NEWSTAGRAM QUEEN CONTEST

452
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:06,727
What? She's number one?

453
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:10,927
NEWSTAGRAM QUEEN CONTEST

454
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:12,727
Ju Kyung deserves to win.

455
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:19,666
Where is it?

456
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:22,876
What are you looking for?

457
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,247
My hoodie. I wonder
if Mom put it in here.

458
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:28,517
What's the matter?

459
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:31,187
- Are you okay?
- My gosh.

460
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,416
Gosh, it stinks. Why
didn't you throw this away?

461
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,957
Tiger energy boost. Roar!

462
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:38,027
Seo Jun.

463
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:42,896
This used to be my right arm.
I can't just throw it away.

464
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:45,427
Even so, why would you
keep it inside your closet?

465
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:46,737
It's a nice memory.

466
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,737
Later on, when I look back,
it'll remind me of what happened.

467
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,166
I'll reminisce on what
a turbulent life I had.

468
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,477
How can I just throw it away?

469
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,977
You're crazy. You really are.

470
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:59,806
Gosh, my toes hurt so much.

471
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:01,116
Are you okay?

472
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:09,416
She's right.

473
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:11,757
Let's throw it away.

474
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,467
TIGER ENERGY BOOST. ROAR!

475
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,096
Still, it was my right arm.

476
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:22,797
I can't just throw it out.

477
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:34,517
NEWSTAGRAM QUEEN CONTEST

478
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,447
What? When did I press like?

479
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:59,906
DAD

480
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:10,177
Like this?

481
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,547
I'm not sure if this really
helps me relax my mind.

482
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,547
- She's here.
- Look at her.

483
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:24,157
Let's all welcome Lim Ju Kyung,

484
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:27,226
the amazing winner of the 2020...

485
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:29,456
Newstagram Queen Contest!

486
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,027
- What?
- Ju Kyung.

487
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:33,067
You beat that girl from
Yongpa High School...

488
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,136
and came in first place!

489
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:38,567
Why? Why did I come in first place?

490
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:43,777
Why don't you tell us how
it feels to have caused...

491
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:44,976
a sensation on social media?

492
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,976
- How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

493
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,427
I'm just honored to be a
candidate for number one.

494
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:01,226
- What?
- What is this?

495
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:03,797
- Gosh, you came in second place.
- What?

496
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:06,527
Darn it. Who came in first place?

497
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,166
That hurt.

498
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,737
Ju Kyung, what if you
become a celebrity?

499
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:16,337
- She's right.
- Not everyone can be a celebrity.

500
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:19,576
Soo Ah, you drive me crazy.

501
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:24,016
Ju Kyung, just enjoy the moment.

502
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:25,786
I want to be her manager.

503
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,087
- I want to be her stylist.
- That's perfect!

504
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,786
- This is great.
- It'll suit you well.

505
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:34,956
What are you guys doing
in front of my class?

506
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:36,556
Get going already.

507
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,337
I asked Soo Ho, but he turned me down.

508
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:42,797
This isn't good. What should we do?

509
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:45,266
If everyone keeps refusing,
who's going to do it?

510
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:46,306
Exactly.

511
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,576
- Why are you all gathered here?
- What's going on?

512
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:50,576
The Newstagram Queen is from our school.

513
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,177
- It's Lim Ju Kyung.
- My gosh.

514
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,647
- Is she going to be a celebrity?
- What?

515
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:56,277
"Newstagram"?

516
00:35:56,547 --> 00:35:57,987
- There's a star in our school?
- My goodness.

517
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,286
Who is it?

518
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:01,386
It's her.

519
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:27,947
How long am I going to
keep living like this?

520
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:43,226
Here.

521
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:49,197
I can't believe you
tripped on your own foot.

522
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:53,166
Why? Were you worried because I fell?

523
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:55,136
Did it break your heart?

524
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:57,947
Were you worried sick about me?

525
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,916
Do you like me that much?

526
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,286
What?

527
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:09,657
Yes.

528
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:13,487
Ju Young, you're a smart guy,

529
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:15,326
so I'm sure you'll understand
what I'm about to say.

530
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:20,567
I guess you've finally noticed my charm.

531
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:23,297
Do you like flies, or do you hate them?

532
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,607
Flies? I don't like them.

533
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,607
How would you feel if a
fly keeps bothering you...

534
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:29,806
while you're sleeping?

535
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:31,547
It'd be really annoying.

536
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:34,416
That's exactly my point.

537
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,147
- What?
- So stop bothering me.

538
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:40,717
You're Ju Kyung's little brother,
so if you stop being annoying,

539
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,286
we can at least be friends.

540
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:48,956
A fly?

541
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:52,666
Are you going to go
straight to the academy?

542
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:53,936
Yes.

543
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:57,366
- Hey.
- Hey.

544
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:58,507
I'm Park Se Mi from Yongpa High School.

545
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,737
You know me, right?

546
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:06,864
Hey.

547
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:10,335
Unbelievable.

548
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:13,364
No, I don't know you.

549
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:16,404
I noticed you won the
Newstagram Queen Contest.

550
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:18,145
You managed to beat me.

551
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:22,815
You look better in your photos.

552
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:26,384
But you look way different
from the Lim Ju Kyung I know.

553
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:30,085
I see.

554
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,324
Why are you in a rush to leave?

555
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,694
It feels like you're avoiding me.

556
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,335
Why isn't Seo Jun coming out?

557
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:44,005
I don't know.

558
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,634
Let's go, Soo Jin.

559
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:49,710
I can't believe she's ignoring me.

560
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:52,904
- Hey, it's Joo Hye Min.
- Hye Min!

561
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,944
Where are you going?

562
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,074
Hye Min!

563
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,744
Come over here.

564
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,985
Smile for me. Smile.

565
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:06,985
Let's go.

566
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:15,694
Hey, who told you to ignore my
calls? Do you have a death wish?

567
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:19,165
I told you there's nothing going on.

568
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:23,275
There's nothing going on
between her and Seo Jun.

569
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:26,974
How can you say that even
after looking at this?

570
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:28,645
Are you kidding me?

571
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:31,645
Hey, I want you...

572
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:34,784
to keep an eye on Lim Ju Kyung
and find out everything about her.

573
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:37,585
I want to know if she's
flirting with anyone...

574
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:40,485
and if there's anything
bad about her personality.

575
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:43,755
That way, I'll be able
to split them apart.

576
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,525
Aren't you going to answer her?

577
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,735
Hye Min!

578
00:39:52,404 --> 00:39:54,105
Were you hitting her?

579
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,304
What are you talking about?

580
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:59,145
We were just having a chat. Why?

581
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:06,745
We're supposed to work on
our class project today.

582
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:09,915
Did you forget?

583
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:11,585
What?

584
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:13,654
Yes.

585
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:17,324
She's going somewhere with us today.

586
00:40:22,395 --> 00:40:23,935
The project is more important.

587
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:26,464
- Let's go.
- You're not going anywhere.

588
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:35,645
Hey. Why are you butting in?

589
00:40:36,174 --> 00:40:38,815
You're from Yongpa High
School, aren't you?

590
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:51,364
Thank you.

591
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:54,165
I'll go now.

592
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:55,634
Wait.

593
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:59,435
You're Ju Kyung, aren't you?

594
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:05,205
Thanks for helping me.

595
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:09,515
But you got a lot prettier.

596
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,415
- I didn't recognize...
- Just because I helped you,

597
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,955
it doesn't mean I forgave you.

598
00:41:20,524 --> 00:41:22,824
I'm sorry for back then.

599
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:27,864
I was afraid they'd bully me
too if I didn't do as they said.

600
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:30,535
I was too scared.

601
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:36,174
I shouldn't have done
that to you though.

602
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:37,844
I'm really sorry.

603
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:42,745
I don't want the others...

604
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,114
to know what I used to look like.

605
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,955
So don't act like you know me.

606
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,984
I won't.

607
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,154
I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

608
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:09,105
And...

609
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:13,745
What are you doing?

610
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:15,674
You're knitting?

611
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:17,685
It's supposed to be therapeutic.

612
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:19,585
Do something. Anything.

613
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:23,585
- Why did you want to see me?
- To ask you something.

614
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,955
What did you mean when you said
Ju Kyung can't tell the others...

615
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:30,495
that we're going out because of Soo Jin?

616
00:42:30,964 --> 00:42:32,065
Do you know anything about it?

617
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:33,294
Why?

618
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:35,134
Ju Kyung has been acting strange.

619
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:38,065
I think something's up.

620
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:41,035
Why are you asking me
about your girlfriend?

621
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,174
How is she acting strange?

622
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:48,444
She asked me before...

623
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:51,315
about a friend of a friend.

624
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:54,285
That a friend of a
friend got a boyfriend,

625
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:57,984
but that friend of a friend...
So, she likes her boyfriend.

626
00:42:57,984 --> 00:43:02,154
So the friend of a friend suddenly
said she liked the boyfriend...

627
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:06,225
So the friend of a friend and the
friend of a friend's friend...

628
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:08,935
Forget it if you don't get it.

629
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:13,504
What about you? Isn't
Soo Jin an old friend?

630
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:15,504
Will you not to anything
that I don't like?

631
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:17,674
Can you give up your friends for me?

632
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:19,504
When did she tell you that?

633
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:21,544
When we made dumplings and
clipped each other's...

634
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:23,844
Don't ask.

635
00:43:24,274 --> 00:43:25,645
I want to erase it from my memory.

636
00:43:29,055 --> 00:43:31,154
Hey. You dropped a stitch.

637
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:33,384
How can you tell?

638
00:43:33,555 --> 00:43:35,455
I used to knit a long time ago.

639
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,625
You have to undo it and redo it.

640
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:39,694
Really?

641
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,805
How?

642
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:49,134
Give it to me.

643
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:53,404
Can't you even do that right?

644
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:56,444
No, no. This isn't it.

645
00:43:58,944 --> 00:44:01,754
Soo Ho! I thought we were friends.

646
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:03,785
I kept begging you to go to
the internet cafe with me,

647
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:04,955
but you refused.

648
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,785
How could you do this to me
just because you made up?

649
00:44:07,185 --> 00:44:08,594
How can love... No.

650
00:44:09,455 --> 00:44:10,725
How can friendship change?

651
00:44:10,725 --> 00:44:11,924
What's his problem?

652
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:13,824
Darn it.

653
00:44:13,824 --> 00:44:15,495
- Do you know how to knit?
- Yes.

654
00:44:15,794 --> 00:44:17,535
I knitted a scarf for Doo Ah.

655
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:18,765
Were you knitting?

656
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:22,475
- Put this in.
- Put this in.

657
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:23,535
- Loop it.
- Loop it.

658
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,805
- And...
- Seo Jun!

659
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:26,705
How could you?

660
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:29,944
You refused to go singing
with me to do this?

661
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:33,285
How could friendship change?

662
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:38,055
I'm starved.

663
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:41,395
Sorry for making you wait.

664
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:43,654
- How was your class?
- Good.

665
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,065
Why did you come all this way?

666
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:47,294
To go home with you.

667
00:44:51,734 --> 00:44:54,065
- Ju Kyung.
- Yes?

668
00:44:54,265 --> 00:44:57,944
Do you feel good or bad?

669
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,645
Why do you ask?

670
00:44:59,774 --> 00:45:03,544
Just because. Do you feel good or bad?

671
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:07,815
Good.

672
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,754
Won't you tell me what it is?

673
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,125
Actually...

674
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:21,535
A kid from my old school transferred in.

675
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:23,535
What?

676
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:25,134
It wasn't because of Soo Jin?

677
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:29,004
I thought she wouldn't
recognize me, but she did.

678
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:30,935
Are you okay?

679
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:33,145
I'm nervous,

680
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:35,915
but she says she won't tell anyone.

681
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,515
You must've been scared.

682
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:40,585
A bit.

683
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:44,355
But I'm really okay now.

684
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:55,435
Aren't you hungry?

685
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:57,065
Should we get something to eat?

686
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:00,364
What should we get?

687
00:46:01,274 --> 00:46:02,435
Something you like.

688
00:46:10,475 --> 00:46:12,415
I didn't get prettier.

689
00:46:15,614 --> 00:46:17,955
I'm breaking out again.

690
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:29,035
It's so annoying.

691
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:32,165
Hee Kyung, do you want
to go on a blind date?

692
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,674
The pork trotter restaurant
owner's son's friend...

693
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:35,774
I have a boyfriend.

694
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:38,375
- You do?
- You do?

695
00:46:38,805 --> 00:46:40,875
Are you lying to avoid
going on a blind date?

696
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:42,915
It's true.

697
00:46:43,574 --> 00:46:46,444
Oh my gosh. How long has
it been? What does he do?

698
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:47,685
Is it good looking? How old is he?

699
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:51,285
It's a secret. I'll introduce
you when I think it's time.

700
00:46:51,384 --> 00:46:52,484
Do you have a picture?

701
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,955
I can tell what he's like
just by looking at his face.

702
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:57,754
I'm dying of curiosity.

703
00:46:57,754 --> 00:46:59,424
What is he like?

704
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:04,265
- My grapefruit.
- Grapefruit?

705
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:07,464
He gets cuter and cuter
the more I look at him.

706
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:10,504
His face is fruity.

707
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:12,975
Fruity?

708
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:14,574
I'm home.

709
00:47:14,574 --> 00:47:16,375
Welcome home. Come eat.

710
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:19,844
A fly has no right to eat.

711
00:47:25,424 --> 00:47:28,955
Lim Ju Kyung, please
come to the auditorium.

712
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,955
Ju Kyung!

713
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:33,324
She looks so pretty.

714
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:35,995
You're doing great, Ju Kyung!

715
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:37,335
You look so pretty!

716
00:47:37,335 --> 00:47:39,935
An angel has descended!

717
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:44,234
She is lighting up the stage.

718
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:45,944
Look at her perfect skin!

719
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,475
How did this happen to me?

720
00:47:50,774 --> 00:47:53,884
- She's the perfect school model.
- I know.

721
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:55,055
Hold on.

722
00:47:55,714 --> 00:47:58,225
Must I do this?

723
00:47:58,654 --> 00:48:02,594
Isn't the student body president or
the top student usually the model?

724
00:48:02,594 --> 00:48:06,125
Yes. But Ju Kyung, they
don't want to do it.

725
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,225
What?

726
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:09,734
But why me of all people...

727
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:10,895
What do you mean?

728
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:13,935
I hear you're our star.

729
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:17,435
You're the star among stars,
so you might as well do it.

730
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:19,904
The face of Saebom!

731
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:25,085
Let's try another pose.

732
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:27,085
You look so pretty!

733
00:48:30,484 --> 00:48:31,725
You look pretty!

734
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:34,654
Do it right. Check your form.

735
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:39,094
Will we see your face when
we go into your homepage?

736
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:43,065
The face of Saebom, Lim Ju Kyung.

737
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,605
Stop that. Please. I'm not the face.

738
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:48,475
Can't you do that right?

739
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:51,805
3, 4, 5.

740
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:54,944
Did they make up after
being hospitalized together?

741
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:56,844
Is it because they
shared each other's pain?

742
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:58,815
- Seven.
- You're pulling too hard.

743
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:00,085
Do it right.

744
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:01,484
- Do it already.
- Fine.

745
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:03,585
- Again.
- Darn it.

746
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:05,484
- One.
- Why is it one again?

747
00:49:07,384 --> 00:49:08,654
You guys will never finish at this rate.

748
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,955
FROM PARK SE MI, YOU'VE
GOT A NEW MESSAGE.

749
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:11,765
Who is it?

750
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:13,824
It's nothing.

751
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:16,294
Don't fool around. Do it right.

752
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:18,335
What are you doing?

753
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,404
What are you doing? Why
are you taking my pictures?

754
00:49:27,004 --> 00:49:28,174
Because you look cool.

755
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:31,444
Don't you like Soo Ho?

756
00:49:31,884 --> 00:49:33,285
I do. So?

757
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,785
Don't you know he's
going out with Ju Kyung?

758
00:49:35,785 --> 00:49:36,815
I do.

759
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:39,625
You like her although
you know. Am I wrong?

760
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:53,835
- GIVE ME JU KYUNG'S PICTURES.
- THEN GIVE ME SEO JUN'S.

761
00:49:58,344 --> 00:50:00,745
PARK SE MI

762
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:12,384
It's like one would take of
a real boyfriend. Thanks.

763
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:15,055
Why do you want her photos though?

764
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:32,044
Are these all you have?

765
00:50:33,475 --> 00:50:34,605
All that running made me hungry.

766
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:35,774
Let's get a snack.

767
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:37,444
What should we have?

768
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:39,915
Ju Kyung!

769
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:42,714
I'm sorry.

770
00:50:45,555 --> 00:50:46,725
Are you all right?

771
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:19,154
What's wrong? Are you
looking for something?

772
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:21,855
Gosh, I think I've lost my necklace.

773
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:24,355
Where did I put it? I
don't think I took it off.

774
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:26,265
- The one you have on every day?
- Yes.

775
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:28,065
When did you last see it?

776
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:30,035
I definitely had it on this morning.

777
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:32,435
Maybe it got loose during PE.

778
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:35,335
- You think?
- Come on. I'll help you.

779
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:36,875
Thanks.

780
00:51:51,315 --> 00:51:53,125
Where did it go?

781
00:51:58,924 --> 00:52:00,324
I told her not to look for it.

782
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:02,794
She'll be here all night.

783
00:52:09,074 --> 00:52:10,435
As if it would still be here.

784
00:52:12,274 --> 00:52:13,544
Someone probably took it.

785
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,815
It wasn't at Lost and Found.

786
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,815
Besides, I trust the students here.

787
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,815
Check out your pride for this school.

788
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:21,444
Because you're the face of it now?

789
00:52:21,714 --> 00:52:22,884
Of course not.

790
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:25,654
Now move over. You might step on it.

791
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:26,924
Want some help finding it?

792
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:28,654
What will I get in return?

793
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:31,794
I'll treat you to spicy tteokbokki.

794
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:34,395
Buy something else, will you?

795
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:37,395
You like it though.
Isn't it your favorite?

796
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:40,835
Whatever. If I find it for
you, you'll pay me big time.

797
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:42,375
Got it.

798
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:48,174
Found it!

799
00:52:48,844 --> 00:52:49,844
Really?

800
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:52,984
50 cents. Sweet, isn't it?

801
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:55,254
Seriously?

802
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:04,794
I mean it this time.
Is this your necklace?

803
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:06,324
Did you find it?

804
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:12,335
Just go home already.

805
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:14,864
Fine. I'll look for it seriously, okay?

806
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:16,935
I don't appreciate the teasing.

807
00:53:17,535 --> 00:53:20,145
Soo Ho gave it to me, so I must find it.

808
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:25,714
- I'm leaving.
- You promised to help me find it.

809
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:27,015
I'm a busy man.

810
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:29,285
Must you look for this
when it's this cold?

811
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:32,884
Is Soo Ho upset because you've lost it?

812
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,254
Of course not.

813
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:39,024
It's special to me which
is why I want to find it.

814
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:41,964
Then you should've
taken better care of it.

815
00:53:42,265 --> 00:53:44,565
I know. How stupid of me.

816
00:53:45,504 --> 00:53:48,035
I won't go home until I find it.

817
00:53:52,004 --> 00:53:54,674
Have fun searching then. Bye.

818
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:01,245
What's this?

819
00:54:03,515 --> 00:54:04,585
Whatever.

820
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:19,535
Where do I find it?

821
00:54:24,774 --> 00:54:25,875
Looking for this?

822
00:54:30,114 --> 00:54:31,114
Soo Jin.

823
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:38,924
What did you just do?

824
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:42,424
You know whose this is.

825
00:54:43,094 --> 00:54:44,395
Yes, I do.

826
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:46,725
So what's the meaning of this?

827
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,895
It's because I like you.

828
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:53,435
I see you're not surprised.
Were you aware of it?

829
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:56,035
Are you kidding me right now?

830
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,444
Aren't you and Ju Kyung friends?

831
00:54:58,774 --> 00:55:00,745
We will be if you don't like her.

832
00:55:01,574 --> 00:55:04,274
- What?
- She's sweet and warm-hearted.

833
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:06,044
It's why I like her too.

834
00:55:06,245 --> 00:55:09,254
But not as much as I like you though.

835
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:13,685
If I can't have you, then
I'll toss her to the side.

836
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:15,495
So break up with her
if you don't want...

837
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:16,995
to see her lose a friend and get hurt.

838
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:22,835
You don't seem like the
Kang Soo Jin I know.

839
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:24,435
Why her of all people?

840
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,705
You only just met her.

841
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:33,475
So why is it her when I've
been by your side for 10 years?

842
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:38,844
Can't you break up with
her and like me instead?

843
00:55:39,015 --> 00:55:40,384
You can do that.

844
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:44,614
If I had confessed to you first,
you would've chosen me anyway!

845
00:55:48,324 --> 00:55:49,625
No.

846
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,594
I wouldn't have.

847
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:25,094
Don't look for the necklace.

848
00:56:39,044 --> 00:56:40,404
Maybe I'll have another.

849
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:43,944
- It's getting late.
- Yes, you're right.

850
00:56:44,174 --> 00:56:45,384
I shouldn't.

851
00:56:46,815 --> 00:56:49,455
I need to slim down and go
back to my handsome self.

852
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:51,484
I doubt the quest will be a success.

853
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:53,855
What? Come on.

854
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,654
I won't be so bad to look
once I lose the weight.

855
00:57:00,424 --> 00:57:01,495
I'll see you.

856
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:03,794
But you're not done eating.
Where are you going?

857
00:57:06,404 --> 00:57:09,574
What a waste. You make me gain weight.

858
00:57:25,225 --> 00:57:27,555
Could someone have taken it?

859
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,935
- Ju Kyung.
- Oh my goodness.

860
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:44,105
I knew you'd still be here.

861
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:46,605
I couldn't give up
without looking for it.

862
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:47,805
Don't you know what time it is?

863
00:57:47,805 --> 00:57:50,714
I was going to search over
here and call it a night.

864
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:54,444
Then we'll do just that and
leave if we come up empty.

865
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,714
Sure.

866
00:57:57,455 --> 00:57:59,754
You look over there.
I'll look over here.

867
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:03,254
I just finished looking there.
You can help me over here.

868
00:58:03,694 --> 00:58:06,794
Still, it won't hurt to check again.

869
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:09,294
I checked down to the
last speck of dust.

870
00:58:09,294 --> 00:58:10,634
I know it's not there.

871
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:13,134
Are you sure? Like 100 percent?

872
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:14,835
100 percent?

873
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:18,305
Not to that extent, no.

874
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:21,174
Then go and take another look.

875
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,114
Sure.

876
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,645
I searched over here though.

877
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:42,794
Found it!

878
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,105
What a relief.

879
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:52,605
I'm glad.

880
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,004
Why did you come here?

881
00:58:57,415 --> 00:59:00,645
See? What would've happened
if I hadn't search for it?

882
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:03,085
I know. You did a good job.

883
00:59:05,924 --> 00:59:07,185
Let me.

884
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,395
Who's there?

885
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:47,125
Let's go.

886
01:00:00,705 --> 01:00:02,574
I'm sure I saw someone.

887
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:06,285
What are you doing here?

888
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:10,355
Who was that?

889
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:23,234
Maybe I was mistaken.

890
01:00:27,305 --> 01:00:28,404
Hee Kyung.

891
01:00:30,705 --> 01:00:33,305
- Hee Kyung, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

892
01:00:34,404 --> 01:00:35,515
Mr. Han?

893
01:00:37,674 --> 01:00:38,815
Hello.

894
01:00:41,085 --> 01:00:42,185
Hi.

895
01:00:50,924 --> 01:00:52,995
I'm so bored.

896
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:54,364
Should we go to a karaoke room?

897
01:00:54,464 --> 01:00:56,995
Hey, how do I look?

898
01:00:57,065 --> 01:00:59,205
- You don't look pretty.
- I don't?

899
01:00:59,904 --> 01:01:01,835
Gosh, something feels weird.

900
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:02,904
What feels weird?

901
01:01:03,174 --> 01:01:07,605
I wonder why Lim Ju Kyung's friend
asked for Lim Ju Kyung's photo.

902
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:09,415
What? What are you talking about?

903
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:10,975
Why couldn't she just
take a photo herself?

904
01:01:10,975 --> 01:01:13,344
Because they're different people.

905
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:16,285
What do you mean?

906
01:01:21,055 --> 01:01:23,294
I can't believe I was such an idiot.

907
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,024
KANG SOO JIN

908
01:01:27,165 --> 01:01:28,995
I can't believe her.

909
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:30,495
Kang Soo Jin.

910
01:01:33,705 --> 01:01:34,864
You came quick.

911
01:01:34,864 --> 01:01:36,074
You asked us to come here?

912
01:01:36,805 --> 01:01:38,205
Are we here to see her?

913
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:40,444
I actually have something to ask you.

914
01:01:41,245 --> 01:01:43,875
You'd better give me an honest answer.

915
01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:47,285
Is she really who I think she is?

916
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:55,085
I heard you guys didn't eat.

917
01:01:56,055 --> 01:01:59,324
- Let's eat first and...
- Ju Kyung.

918
01:01:59,765 --> 01:02:01,395
What were you doing at
school at such a late hour?

919
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:02,835
What about you?

920
01:02:03,234 --> 01:02:05,094
I asked you first.

921
01:02:05,265 --> 01:02:07,404
- Add the dumplings.
- I was looking for my necklace.

922
01:02:07,404 --> 01:02:09,105
"Necklace"? What necklace?

923
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:12,404
It's pretty.

924
01:02:12,404 --> 01:02:13,574
- Did you get it as a gift?
- Yes.

925
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:17,245
Why were you hiding under the
table with my homeroom teacher?

926
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:19,015
- Mr. Han, that goes in later.
- Okay.

927
01:02:19,384 --> 01:02:20,484
We're dating.

928
01:02:22,984 --> 01:02:24,315
So that boyfriend with a fruity face...

929
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:27,455
was my homeroom teacher?

930
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:28,685
Are you crazy, Hee Kyung?

931
01:02:28,685 --> 01:02:29,924
Yes, I'm crazy in love.

932
01:02:29,924 --> 01:02:31,225
We're two grown-ups with
a healthy body and mind,

933
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:32,495
so why can't we fall in love?

934
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:33,565
It's boiling.

935
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:38,294
So you were crazy enough to
fool around at my school?

936
01:02:38,294 --> 01:02:39,504
I wouldn't call it crazy.

937
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:41,904
I had to work overtime,
and my Hee Kyung...

938
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:44,805
I mean, Hee Kyung brought me food.

939
01:02:44,805 --> 01:02:47,605
Grapefruit was desperate
not to get caught by you...

940
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,415
- Grapefruit?
- I mean, Joon Woo.

941
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:51,815
Anyway, that's why we hid.

942
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:53,444
Why do you have to date
my homeroom teacher?

943
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:55,415
This is going to make my
school life so uncomfortable.

944
01:02:55,415 --> 01:02:58,685
Why do you have to date my boss' son?

945
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,524
Or maybe it's okay
now since he resigned.

946
01:03:00,955 --> 01:03:02,955
- Anyway!
- Couldn't you date anyone else?

947
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:05,424
Grapefruit is special to me!

948
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:08,194
I told you the glass
noodles need to wait.

949
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:10,395
It needs to boil a bit more.

950
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:12,535
- Are you going to eat fried rice?
- Of course.

951
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:13,935
- You want cheese on top?
- Let's eat two servings.

952
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:15,134
We'd like two servings of fried rice!

953
01:03:15,134 --> 01:03:16,234
Can we also have some soda?

954
01:03:16,234 --> 01:03:18,174
- Sure.
- My gosh.

955
01:03:19,044 --> 01:03:20,205
Isn't she picking up?

956
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:21,944
This is making me angry.

957
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:24,515
Where did Lim Ju Kyung live again?

958
01:03:32,455 --> 01:03:34,285
How did they even meet?

959
01:03:35,384 --> 01:03:38,194
How am I going to face
Mr. Han tomorrow at school?

960
01:03:38,794 --> 01:03:40,294
Does it make you feel
that uncomfortable?

961
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:41,794
Of course.

962
01:03:42,535 --> 01:03:44,435
Now I'll have to be careful
of how I behave at school.

963
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:46,765
He'll tell my sister everything.

964
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:52,245
Does Mr. Han look like
grapefruit to you?

965
01:03:52,975 --> 01:03:54,004
No.

966
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:57,015
She must be blinded by love.

967
01:03:57,574 --> 01:03:59,015
PRINCE COMICS

968
01:04:01,844 --> 01:04:03,984
- Bye, sir.
- Bye, sir.

969
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:09,424
- Is this it?
- Is this it?

970
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:10,694
It's this way.

971
01:04:10,694 --> 01:04:12,324
- It's this way.
- This way?

972
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,165
Are you done with your part-time job?

973
01:04:33,544 --> 01:04:34,614
Gosh, it stinks.

974
01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:37,154
- Where is it?
- Is it over there?

975
01:04:37,614 --> 01:04:39,555
- What a filthy neighborhood.
- Seriously.

976
01:04:39,555 --> 01:04:40,654
Se Mi.

977
01:04:42,185 --> 01:04:43,254
Seo Jun?

978
01:04:44,524 --> 01:04:45,665
What are you doing here?

979
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,305
We're here.

980
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,475
We're here.

981
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:09,455
My gosh. Seo Jun!

982
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:11,114
Why do you want to meet Ju Kyung?

983
01:05:11,114 --> 01:05:13,625
I haven't seen her in a while,
so I wanted to catch up.

984
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:17,455
- You wanted to catch up?
- It turns out I know her.

985
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:24,335
- What about it?
- Can't you tell?

986
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:27,165
She's Lim Ju Kyung.

987
01:05:30,904 --> 01:05:32,174
I guess he doesn't recognize her.

988
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:35,645
What's wrong? Are you shocked?

989
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:38,444
She totally fooled me too.

990
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:40,444
Why are you showing me this?

991
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,555
Because I was worried about you.

992
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:45,884
If you knew about her past,
you never would've dated her.

993
01:05:46,324 --> 01:05:49,694
She used to buy dumplings
for me back at our school.

994
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:50,955
She was a complete loser.

995
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:53,924
She doesn't deserve to
date a guy like you.

996
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:57,165
I personally think she's
prettier than a brat like you.

997
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:00,734
What? Are you defending her
because she's your girlfriend?

998
01:06:01,705 --> 01:06:03,134
Are you blind?

999
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:05,574
- She's pretty thanks to her makeup.
- Is that okay with you?

1000
01:06:05,574 --> 01:06:07,975
Come on. She looks so ugly with
no makeup on. What is wrong...

1001
01:06:10,214 --> 01:06:11,674
Seo Jun!

1002
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:15,645
I can't control my anger
whenever I see school bullies...

1003
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:17,985
because it reminds me of my friend.

1004
01:06:18,384 --> 01:06:19,424
You made her buy you dumplings?

1005
01:06:20,155 --> 01:06:22,895
If I ever catch you
bullying other students,

1006
01:06:23,825 --> 01:06:24,994
I swear things won't be pretty.

1007
01:06:33,164 --> 01:06:34,204
That little jerk.

1008
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:39,445
You should go now.

1009
01:06:40,844 --> 01:06:42,275
I'll leave once I see you go inside.

1010
01:06:43,615 --> 01:06:45,844
Okay, I'll go inside now.

1011
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:47,844
See you tomorrow.

1012
01:07:45,534 --> 01:07:46,805
We forgot to do this earlier.

1013
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:56,645
WELCOME TO SEBOM HIGH SCHOOL'S
ADMISSION INFORMATION SESSION.

1014
01:08:57,244 --> 01:08:59,985
What is all this? It's so embarrassing.

1015
01:09:08,325 --> 01:09:13,025
WELCOME TO SEBOM HIGH SCHOOL'S
ADMISSION INFORMATION SESSION.

1016
01:09:13,025 --> 01:09:14,664
Mom, look at this.

1017
01:09:14,765 --> 01:09:16,195
I'm a school model.

1018
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:20,034
So she's the queen of Sebom High School?

1019
01:09:21,235 --> 01:09:24,075
- Hey.
- She's the face of our school?

1020
01:09:24,935 --> 01:09:26,075
Let's go.

1021
01:09:33,115 --> 01:09:36,315
SEBOM HIGH SCHOOL'S BRIGHT
FUTURE AND CHEERFUL TOMORROW

1022
01:09:42,424 --> 01:09:44,494
Come here. Look at this.

1023
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:46,225
It's unbelievable.

1024
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:49,065
It's crazy. Look at this.

1025
01:09:49,765 --> 01:09:54,204
RECRUITING NEW STUDENTS FOR
THE 1ST SEMESTER OF 2021

1026
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:01,275
That's her.

1027
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:04,575
My gosh.

1028
01:10:05,544 --> 01:10:06,714
That's her.

1029
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:09,855
Angel? What a joke.

1030
01:10:16,325 --> 01:10:17,325
She's an angel?

1031
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:31,975
No way.

1032
01:10:32,435 --> 01:10:33,744
It's very different.

1033
01:10:36,015 --> 01:10:38,544
Ju Kyung. Is this really you?

1034
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:43,454
The real face of Saebom
High's Lim Ju Kyung.

1035
01:10:43,855 --> 01:10:46,225
She was the dumpling girl
before she transferred.

1036
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:47,985
You guys will faint when you see this.

1037
01:10:48,155 --> 01:10:50,225
She's mad ugly. It's all makeup.

1038
01:10:56,265 --> 01:10:59,065
- She's too ugly.
- Unbelievable.

1039
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:00,504
- I doubt it.
- I don't know.

1040
01:11:03,605 --> 01:11:06,305
Because you're ugly.

1041
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:15,315
This is too much.

1042
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:30,195
I can't believe it.

1043
01:11:42,605 --> 01:11:45,344
Look at this. My gosh.

1044
01:11:54,624 --> 01:11:55,624
Ju Kyung.

1045
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:05,695
Ju Kyung.

1046
01:12:11,905 --> 01:12:13,044
Ju Kyung.

1047
01:12:33,664 --> 01:12:35,664
WE'D LIKE TO THANK CHANI
FOR HIS GUEST APPEARANCE.

1048
01:12:58,685 --> 01:13:01,325
TRUE BEAUTY

1049
01:13:01,985 --> 01:13:04,924
<i>The kids know what I
really look like now.</i>

1050
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:07,025
<i>So I can't face you.</i>

1051
01:13:08,294 --> 01:13:09,664
<i>Take it down.</i>

1052
01:13:09,895 --> 01:13:11,895
<i>No one else would do
that garbage but you.</i>

1053
01:13:12,164 --> 01:13:13,204
<i>That's not true.</i>

1054
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:16,334
<i>You really didn't know? You
and Ju Kyung were best friends.</i>

1055
01:13:16,874 --> 01:13:19,945
<i>Whatever you look like...
Whether or not you wear makeup,</i>

1056
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,605
<i>you're always you.</i>

1057
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:26,515
<i>Run as far as you can and
hide so no one finds you.</i>

1058
01:13:26,515 --> 01:13:29,754
<i>Don't worry. You can transfer to
a school where no one knows you.</i>
