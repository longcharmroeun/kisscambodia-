00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,292
EPISODE 10

2
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:33,723
Do you want to eat this
while watching a movie?

3
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:35,793
Sure.

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,833
- It smells delicious.
- What should we watch?

5
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:44,873
I don't know. How
about a horror film?

6
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:47,002
No, something else.

7
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,473
Why? Don't you like horror?

8
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,882
No, it rained, so why don't we
watch a movie related to music?

9
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:56,483
Gosh, you love horror comic books,
but you can't watch horror films?

10
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:58,252
I'm just not interested...

11
00:00:58,252 --> 00:00:59,983
because I already read
horror comic books every day.

12
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,223
It's okay. If it gets scary,
I'll cover your eyes for you.

13
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,392
I don't get that scared.

14
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:06,923
Turn the lights off. That's
how you watch horror films.

15
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:08,333
How about something else?

16
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,232
- I can't believe I'm here...
- Let me choose.

17
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:12,163
when he's on a date
with his girlfriend.

18
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:19,503
- Here.
- Thanks.

19
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:56,943
Soo Ho is a real man.

20
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,953
I guess you really don't
watch horror films.

21
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:09,292
Ghosts don't show up in
these kinds of scenes.

22
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,962
You said there
won't be any ghosts.

23
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,293
Dad?

24
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:36,113
You silly girl.

25
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:38,212
Following a boy home
when he lives alone?

26
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,812
I needed to dry my clothes.

27
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,812
I told you not to trust
any man that isn't me.

28
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:46,423
Mom told me this.

29
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:49,252
She was pregnant with Hee Kyung
when she walked down the aisle.

30
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:52,763
Exactly. That proves my point.

31
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,363
Men are all the same.

32
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:56,363
As if that matters.

33
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:59,103
I'm too embarrassed
to see Soo Ho now.

34
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,633
You humiliated me!

35
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,472
Don't tell your mom
about this though.

36
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,603
About me staying
at Soo Ho's house.

37
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:09,842
Only if you don't tell anyone
that I'm dating Soo Ho.

38
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,682
You know I'm good
at keeping secrets.

39
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:17,852
You know I take after you.

40
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,662
- I bet your mom will be asleep.
- Probably.

41
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:30,833
She usually is at this hour.

42
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,683
- Your mom must be asleep.
- Come on.

43
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:54,823
Long time no see.

44
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:57,292
Parade rest.

45
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:58,962
Attention.

46
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:03,563
Did you successfully
capture Columbus Park?

47
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:06,532
No.

48
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,102
You have some nerve
crawling back in there!

49
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,402
- Honey, please.
- Mom!

50
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,873
- Honey, please calm down.
- Mom, come on.

51
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:16,212
- Mom, calm down.
- Please hear me out.

52
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:18,612
- Mom, no!
- I'm a victim too, you know.

53
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,943
- You're just as bad.
- Honey, please.

54
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,893
- Hey.
- Did your dad give you an earful?

55
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,292
He got an earful from my mom.

56
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:39,203
I'm sorry. My dad only
caused you trouble.

57
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:41,462
Not really. I actually liked it.

58
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,933
You must be tired, so go to bed.

59
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,902
All right. Good night.

60
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:48,672
Good night.

61
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,212
Why haven't you hung up?

62
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,513
You can hang up first.

63
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:00,623
Okay.

64
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:06,922
Why aren't you hanging up?

65
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:09,532
I miss you.

66
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,592
Me too.

67
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,532
We might not get any
sleep at this rate.

68
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:18,842
I don't mind.

69
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,993
- I'm serious about it.
- Soo Ho.

70
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:43,133
- No.
- It's fine.

71
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,402
Look at you all relaxed.

72
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,133
You're so frustrating.

73
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,743
I wonder if this
is how Soo Ho felt.

74
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,412
We should hurry up
and tell our friends.

75
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:59,412
Good morning.

76
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:11,422
Mr. Han, here you go.

77
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:13,193
Okay.

78
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:14,493
HANGUK UNIVERSITY,
MAKEUP DEPARTMENT

79
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:16,162
SEOYEON UNIVERSITY, BEAUTY
AND COSMETICS DEPARTMENT

80
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,763
Do you study makeup, Ju Kyung?

81
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,102
It's what I want to do.

82
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,003
It's my desired career.

83
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:23,633
Good luck.

84
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,643
Thank you.

85
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,542
Mr. Han, was that woman
really your girlfriend?

86
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:34,482
No, I'm not seeing anyone.

87
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:35,683
I don't understand
what you mean.

88
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,253
But you said she's
your girlfriend.

89
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:40,953
She works at Move Entertainment.
Her name was Lim...

90
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:42,123
This bread.

91
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,222
Eat up.

92
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,032
Sorry.

93
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,063
- It just tasted so nice.
- But...

94
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:56,232
Eat it. You can take it.

95
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:03,943
Thanks.

96
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,712
How's your headache?

97
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:07,412
I feel a lot better now that
I'm out getting some air.

98
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:09,352
The weather's really nice today.

99
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,852
Yes, the clouds are beautiful.

100
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:18,393
Hey, I have...

101
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,633
something to tell you today.

102
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:24,493
You have something to tell me?

103
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:27,633
I wanted to tell you
before I told anyone else.

104
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:32,902
Well...

105
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,042
- This...
- I also have something to tell you.

106
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:37,843
What?

107
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,182
You know how you told me...

108
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:42,682
that you're scared to show your
bare face to our friends...

109
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,812
because you're worried they
might not like you anymore?

110
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:48,082
I couldn't tell
you this that day,

111
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:50,452
but I also have
something similar.

112
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,692
Is there something wrong?

113
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:53,993
To be honest,

114
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,402
my dad hits me sometimes
when he gets angry.

115
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:01,733
What?

116
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:03,233
You didn't know, did you?

117
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:06,843
It's because I
act like I'm fine.

118
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,503
I'm good at that.

119
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:10,942
Soo Jin.

120
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,843
I thought I had done a
good job of hiding it,

121
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,143
but Soo Ho turned out
to know everything.

122
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:16,853
Soo Ho?

123
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,922
And now that he's seen
me without my mask,

124
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:23,353
I don't think I can
keep pretending.

125
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:27,023
Pretending not to like
him and to be his friend.

126
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,503
I like Soo Ho.

127
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,273
So I'm having a hard time
treating him like before.

128
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:40,942
I'm telling you this
because I feel frustrated...

129
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,243
and because you're
my best friend.

130
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:50,383
Why do you look so startled?

131
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,483
Let's go inside.

132
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,023
Okay.

133
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:08,932
Soo Jin.

134
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:10,633
To be honest,

135
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,072
I'm dating Soo Ho.

136
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,213
- What?
- I felt like I should tell you.

137
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:20,843
Are you seriously dating him?

138
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:24,812
So you just kept everything
a secret from me?

139
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:26,422
I guess I was the only one who
thought we were best friends.

140
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:27,552
How could you do this to me?

141
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,552
If you had told me earlier,
I wouldn't have liked him.

142
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,422
I never meant to
fool you. I'm sorry.

143
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,523
I'm really sorry.

144
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,863
If you're sorry, will
you break up with him?

145
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,133
I can't do that.

146
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,233
Soo Jin, can't you
try to understand me?

147
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:43,802
"Understand"?

148
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,373
From now on, we're
no longer friends.

149
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,643
- Soo Jin!
- Are you Soo Ho's girlfriend?

150
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,412
Take her to the rooftop.

151
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,213
No! No!

152
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,812
No!

153
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:00,023
Soo Jin!

154
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:01,753
Don't cry.

155
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,322
Soo Jin, are you okay?

156
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,662
You told me you didn't have a
boyfriend. You're such a liar.

157
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,263
- She's so mean.
- How could she do this to her?

158
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:09,763
- What a mean brat.
- Seriously.

159
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:10,963
That's enough, you guys.

160
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,432
It's my fault for not confessing
my feelings to Soo Ho.

161
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,532
- My gosh.
- Don't say that.

162
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:19,202
What did you just say?

163
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,912
Soo Jin, you had
feelings for me?

164
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:25,713
Since when? Why
didn't you tell me?

165
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:27,743
How could I tell you? We've
been friends for 10 years.

166
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:30,353
How could I suddenly tell you
that I had feelings for you?

167
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,182
If I'd known about this, I
would never have dated Ju Kyung.

168
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:36,353
What's the point? You're
her boyfriend now.

169
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,393
I'll turn things back
to how they were.

170
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:41,723
Ju Kyung, let's break up.

171
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,332
No!

172
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,373
PAGES TO STUDY
FOR THE FINAL EXAM

173
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,213
Okay, fine. Since Ju Kyung
seems to be so against it,

174
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,542
I won't make you guys study
more for the final exam.

175
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,182
- Nice!
- Great!

176
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:13,523
Ju Kyung.

177
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:17,192
- What?
- Why are you going alone?

178
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:19,133
- What?
- We have a group study today.

179
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,202
So we can leave together.

180
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:27,643
Soo Ho.

181
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:30,442
Are you heading
to the study room?

182
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:35,412
I don't think I can go today.

183
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,253
Why not? What's wrong?

184
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:40,952
I don't feel so well.

185
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:42,952
I should go.

186
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:45,662
Bye.

187
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:49,363
I wonder if it's bad.

188
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:07,983
What should I do?

189
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,753
I'm secretly dating
a guy at school.

190
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,713
And it turns out my best
friend likes my boyfriend.

191
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:14,623
If you guys were me, would you
be honest with your best friend?

192
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,652
No way. Never tell her.

193
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:17,922
It's coming from
someone who's lost both.

194
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:19,723
If she's really your best
friend, she should understand.

195
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:20,922
You can always get
yourself a new boyfriend.

196
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,662
How can she break up
just because of a friend?

197
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,633
What am I going to do?

198
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,402
Do you want to meet
me at Prince Comics?

199
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,143
Go Woon isn't here,
so don't worry.

200
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:45,182
PRINCE COMICS

201
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:46,952
Did you take medicine?

202
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:49,322
I bought different types of medicine
because I didn't know your symptoms.

203
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:52,152
No, I don't need
to take medicine.

204
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,422
I'll be fine after
I get some rest.

205
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:55,593
Still, you should take medicine.

206
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:56,932
You should eat the
porridge first.

207
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:58,893
Here.

208
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,473
What's wrong? Is it that bad?

209
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:10,613
No, it's not that.

210
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:12,843
I'm just so grateful.

211
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,613
Yesterday, you did a part-time
job and even worked out.

212
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,182
You must've
overstrained yourself.

213
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:22,552
Maybe I shouldn't have
asked you to come here.

214
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,922
What's with you?

215
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:28,393
Why are you so kind?

216
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,733
You're not only handsome,
but you even get good grades.

217
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,532
Your only flaw was that you
were really arrogant and rude.

218
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:37,402
But why are you so kind now?

219
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:39,442
How would anyone not fall
for you if you're this kind?

220
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:41,373
Any girl would fall for you
if you're being like this.

221
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,213
Who are you talking to?

222
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:58,822
- What's the matter?
- My dad was right.

223
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:03,463
He said good looking guys
will cause heartache.

224
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:09,503
- It's hot.
- Right.

225
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:11,603
You need to cool it first.

226
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,182
Eat the meat.

227
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:33,593
Seriously? Are you
going to stay so sullen?

228
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:37,432
Are you not going to
talk to me? Joon Woo.

229
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,133
Joon Woo.

230
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:40,963
Honey.

231
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:53,383
I mean, well... I know...

232
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:56,513
I know I suddenly lost it
and got the wrong idea.

233
00:15:56,983 --> 00:16:00,223
But who wouldn't lose her mind when
her boyfriend is with another woman?

234
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:03,692
Those teachers are all Ju
Kyung's teachers as well.

235
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:07,093
Didn't you think about how
awkward it might become for me?

236
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:11,993
I didn't... Sorry.

237
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,503
If you had told me, I wouldn't
have jumped to conclusions.

238
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:17,072
Why should I? You
never tell me anything.

239
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,733
You've been drinking a lot.

240
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,672
It's obvious something is going
on at work, but you won't tell me.

241
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:26,343
Why do you want to see me weak?
What? Do you want me to cry?

242
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:33,023
You and I aren't strangers.
We're a "we" now.

243
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:36,493
When things are tough,
we should hurt...

244
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:38,652
together.

245
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:47,503
Oh no.

246
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:50,572
I want to kiss you again.

247
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,873
You're insane. Seriously.

248
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:56,613
I'll tell you everything...

249
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,912
down to what I had for lunch.

250
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:07,352
COSMETOLOGY PRACTICE EXAMS

251
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,993
COMPARING WARM TONES
AND COOL TONES...

252
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:17,862
Hey.

253
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:19,302
I said to knock!

254
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:21,532
Sorry. Don't you have any
comic books to return?

255
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,602
No.

256
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,903
- Any to rent?
- No.

257
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,542
Why not?

258
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,342
- You used to rent 10 at a time.
- You little...

259
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:32,983
Are you dying to go to
the comic book store?

260
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:35,953
Dying? Dying?

261
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:39,253
I don't want to go anywhere
near Prince Comics.

262
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,822
I'm down already. Why
is he adding to it?

263
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:51,763
MY FRIEND SOO JIN

264
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,673
Hi, Soo Jin.

265
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:12,552
- What?
- What else?

266
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:13,983
I'm here to rent a comic book.

267
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:22,993
"A NIGHT WITH A ROUGH WOLF"

268
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:24,963
Wait. Why is that...

269
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:28,332
I understand how you feel,
but wait for three years.

270
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,102
Hey. I grabbed the wrong book.

271
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,173
Don't get the wrong idea.

272
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:38,473
I may have looks that can kill,

273
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:39,782
but I have a pure heart.

274
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,382
Move. You're in my way.

275
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:47,352
I don't care, but I ask
since I have time to kill.

276
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:49,082
Tell me why.

277
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,453
There he goes again.

278
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,923
I'm good looking, I'm fit,

279
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:57,493
and I'm smart. Why are you
rejecting the perfect guy?

280
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:58,993
Because I dislike you.

281
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:01,933
But why? You have no
reason to dislike me.

282
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,503
Tell me 10 things you hate
about me. I'll drop it then.

283
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,243
You're so annoying.

284
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:09,003
One. You're not my type.

285
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,572
Two. You're too scrawny.

286
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,243
Three. Your narcissism
makes me want to barf.

287
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:13,542
Four. Your voice is gross.

288
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,082
Five. Your personality stinks.

289
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,713
- Six. You're boring. Seven...
- Stop.

290
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:19,183
Leave before I get to 100.

291
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,552
Go Woon, guess who?

292
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,993
Hey. What are you doing here?

293
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,352
I was in the area.

294
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:28,362
I thought you'd be hungry.

295
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,862
- Yes.
- She's going out with Seo Jun?

296
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,642
Yes. I finally get it.

297
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,542
The reason she rejected me.

298
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:50,253
Who's that freak?

299
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:51,753
A total freak.

300
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,753
Tell me if he harasses you.

301
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:58,392
See? I told you not to work.
Why are you being so stubborn?

302
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,193
- You're so young.
- You're one year older.

303
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:02,423
Stop talking like an old man.

304
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:03,933
What did you bring me?

305
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,163
I was starving.

306
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,663
- You're the best.
- I know you so well.

307
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:18,743
- Oh my... Look at her.
- She's so pretty.

308
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,653
She really is pretty.

309
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,953
Soo Jin!

310
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:32,193
Ju Kyung.

311
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:36,352
Did you wait long?

312
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,282
No, not long. Let's go.

313
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,592
Let's check out this store.

314
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,352
Do you want to buy a cap?

315
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:47,822
Yes. Which one would be good?

316
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:52,393
How about this? It'll
look good on you.

317
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,963
It's not for me. I want
to give it to Soo Ho.

318
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,302
To Soo Ho?

319
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:01,943
Yes. His family and
mine ate together...

320
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,842
a few days ago,

321
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:05,512
and he saved me.

322
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:08,913
What do you mean, he saved you?

323
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:12,082
Well, I felt suffocated because
of my dad, he suddenly goes,

324
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:14,322
"We have to get to a study
group. Soo Jin, let's go."

325
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,352
And he got me out of there.

326
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:18,193
He's so cool.

327
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,463
I see.

328
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,592
How about this? Do you think
it'll look good on him?

329
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:27,032
You have a brother, so you
must know what guys like.

330
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:30,733
Yes. It looks nice.

331
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,633
Really? I'll get this then.

332
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:34,643
He'll like it, right?

333
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:36,943
Yes.

334
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,572
Ju Kyung.

335
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:41,183
Should I ask him out
when I give this to him?

336
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:44,953
What?

337
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:48,852
I wonder if he'll be shocked. But
we've been friends for 10 years,

338
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,592
so he wouldn't disown me, right?

339
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:56,893
I really don't know...

340
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,992
whether or not to
tell him how I feel.

341
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:01,733
Regardless, you'll
cheer me on, right?

342
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:09,572
BOYFRIEND

343
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:13,312
Who is it? Answer it.

344
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:14,512
Oh...

345
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:16,883
It's okay.

346
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:19,983
The person you've dialed
isn't available now.

347
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,883
GIRLFRIEND

348
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:26,762
I'm helping my dad right
now, so I can't talk.

349
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:29,393
She can't even
talk on the phone?

350
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:33,633
My dad was right.

351
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:37,403
He said good looking guys
will cause heartache.

352
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,643
My girlfriend's dad
caught us kissing.

353
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:50,282
- I'd want to kill him.
- Wait until you have a daughter.

354
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:52,183
You can't even hold hands in
front of your girlfriend's dad.

355
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:04,562
Soo Ho. You dog.

356
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:08,133
I won't forgive anyone
who touches my daughter!

357
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,203
I'm dead.

358
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:15,042
Are you going to work?

359
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:17,943
Yes. It's near here.

360
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:19,213
It must be tiring.

361
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:23,352
I thought it was cute, so I
got it when I bought the cap.

362
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,252
- What do you think?
- It's cute.

363
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,623
Look. I got one for myself too.

364
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,223
It's really pretty. Thank you.

365
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,032
No. Thank you.

366
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:40,363
You couldn't rest, and hung out
with me before going to work.

367
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,633
You'll be late. You should go.

368
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:43,903
Okay.

369
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,242
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Bye.

370
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,463
What are you doing here?

371
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:16,502
One of the staff
can't make it today,

372
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:19,203
so I had to fill
in. What a pain.

373
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,002
Really?

374
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,002
I'll change and come right out.

375
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:37,292
Hey!

376
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:39,223
Why are you tying your hair?

377
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:42,193
Why are you tying your hair in
front of your friend and stuff?

378
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:44,893
I have to put it up to
work. What's wrong with you?

379
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:48,863
Okay, tie it then.

380
00:24:58,272 --> 00:24:59,413
Here you go.

381
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,312
Welcome!

382
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:04,213
- One Americano and...
- One Americano.

383
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:05,983
- And one latte.
- One latte.

384
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,123
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

385
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,832
- Let me.
- No, I got this.

386
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,082
Go and take a break.

387
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:44,223
Why are you still wiping...

388
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:46,322
a glass window that's
completely spotless?

389
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:48,123
Oh... Was I?

390
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:50,693
Where's your head at?

391
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,602
Nothing much.

392
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:56,572
Did you and Soo Ho argue?

393
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,203
Why would we argue?

394
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,572
You did, didn't you?
You absolutely did.

395
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:04,873
We didn't, all right?

396
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:07,012
You're arguing already when
you just started dating?

397
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,082
Just break up, why don't you?

398
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,183
Hold on. Are you crying again?

399
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:20,792
Did you two really break up?

400
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:24,893
No, we didn't.

401
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:27,663
Get back to work.

402
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,032
Unbelievable.

403
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,643
Mr. Lim.

404
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,113
Have you been well?

405
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,683
Soo Ho, are you here
to see Ju Kyung?

406
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:52,492
That's too bad. She
isn't home at the moment.

407
00:26:52,492 --> 00:26:53,562
Really?

408
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,133
I thought she'd be home.

409
00:26:57,893 --> 00:26:59,032
Get going then.

410
00:27:00,863 --> 00:27:01,933
Just a second.

411
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,802
I wanted to give you this.

412
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:23,522
SAEBOM STATION

413
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:33,663
Your house is in the
opposite direction.

414
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:36,832
I wanted to take Go Woon home
from the comic book store.

415
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:44,413
You've been sighing all day.

416
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,483
Hey,

417
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:52,183
have you ever liked the
person that your friend liked?

418
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:54,123
What?

419
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,153
Did Soo Ho say that?

420
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:57,453
What did he say?

421
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:58,953
How much did he tell you?

422
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:01,092
Why are you acting like
I'm talking about you?

423
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,532
- Is there someone you like?
- No!

424
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,633
That's not it.

425
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:10,272
I've had two girls show
their affection for me.

426
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,002
I'm that popular, you know.

427
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,502
You just love showing
off, don't you?

428
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:17,473
Anyway, why do you ask?

429
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,183
Well...

430
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:24,213
It's about a friend of a friend.

431
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:27,852
The friend of a friend
is seeing someone,

432
00:28:27,852 --> 00:28:29,883
but the friend of this
friend of a friend...

433
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:31,923
told her that she likes him.

434
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:33,822
But the friend of a friend...

435
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,933
doesn't know that her friend
is dating the boy she likes.

436
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,393
It's been eating away at her.

437
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:42,002
She doesn't know if she
should tell her friend...

438
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,832
that she's dating the guy.

439
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:46,403
I see. Say that again?

440
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:51,842
To put it simply,
it's like this.

441
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:55,782
Soo Ho and I are dating.
But we're friends, right?

442
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:57,812
It's as if you like Soo Ho too.

443
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,522
Are you kidding me?

444
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:04,223
Was I a bit off
with the analogy?

445
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,492
So what I'm saying is that...

446
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:09,163
You and Soo Ho are dating,

447
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,832
but Kang Soo Jin likes him too.

448
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,032
She doesn't know that you
and Soo Ho are dating though.

449
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,602
That's what's going on.

450
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:18,873
Right. Exactly.

451
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:22,272
For instance, I
mean. For instance.

452
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:25,213
You're worried that
telling Soo Jin...

453
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,542
will end your friendship,

454
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:29,012
which is why you don't know
what to choose between...

455
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:30,183
love and friendship.

456
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:34,782
I don't even know if this
even requires a choice.

457
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:38,492
Anyway, a friend of a friend is
having a hard time over that.

458
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:41,592
I thought girls
valued sisterhood?

459
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:43,193
Love doesn't last forever.

460
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,363
Tell your friend to
break up with the guy...

461
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,762
and strengthen her
friendship with her friend.

462
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,832
How can my friend break
up with the guy she likes?

463
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:51,233
I don't know who this jerk is,

464
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:54,203
but it's his fault for
creating this situation.

465
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,873
A man who string girls along
isn't worth the trouble.

466
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,812
Just break up with him.

467
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:01,512
He doesn't string girls along.

468
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:07,082
I mean, according to
the friend of a friend.

469
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:10,693
Don't worry.

470
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,923
Lee Soo Ho isn't the
type to break your heart.

471
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,463
I didn't say it was about me.

472
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:19,762
Whatever then.

473
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:30,473
When will you be home? Can
you pick up some ramyeon?

474
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:36,613
Your shoelaces are untied.

475
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:38,713
Whatever. I couldn't care less.

476
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,383
You'll scrape your
face if you trip over.

477
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:42,653
Tie them already.

478
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,522
Why's that? Are you worried
that I'd ruin my handsome face?

479
00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:49,863
Everything looks cool
when it's done by me.

480
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:53,332
You're just as childish
as my little brother.

481
00:30:55,032 --> 00:30:56,363
Come on. Lift your foot.

482
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,032
You require a lot
of care, don't you?

483
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:05,542
All done.

484
00:31:09,842 --> 00:31:10,953
Lim Ju Kyung!

485
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,522
They got loose again.

486
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:15,022
Tie them properly this time.

487
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:16,822
Do it yourself.

488
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,092
But what if I fall
and ruin my face?

489
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:22,963
- Here...
- You'll trip!

490
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:24,963
I'm bad at tying shoelaces.

491
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,693
Just tie them, will you?

492
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:27,963
I don't know how.

493
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:29,863
- You can't tie them?
- No.

494
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:33,332
PRINCE COMICS

495
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:34,703
Go Woon's not here.

496
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,913
Really? She must've
headed home early.

497
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,713
You should've
checked in advance.

498
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:41,613
Anyway, I'll get going. Bye.

499
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,953
- Bye.
- Are you just getting home?

500
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,782
Seo Jun!

501
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:49,383
Oh. Hello.

502
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:51,953
It's been so long.

503
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,393
You two must've gotten closer.

504
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,832
I've been looking out
for her at school.

505
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:58,762
Since when?

506
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:00,863
Have you had dinner?

507
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:03,673
We're making dumplings
at home. Stay for some...

508
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,032
and take some home to your mom.

509
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:06,873
Why would you invite
him to dinner?

510
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:08,272
Just get going. Let's go, Mom.

511
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:09,342
Why's that?

512
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:12,873
- Ms. Hong, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

513
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,183
You must love dumplings.

514
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,512
- I love them!
- My goodness.

515
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:19,713
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on.

516
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:22,153
Come on in. Please don't
mind the mess, okay?

517
00:32:24,153 --> 00:32:25,153
Oh, that's right.

518
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,123
I forgot to mention that
our darling Ho was here too.

519
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:35,663
All of Ju Kyung's friends
will be joining us.

520
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,133
Our darling Ho?

521
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:41,002
What are you doing here?

522
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,072
I ran into Soo Ho
outside the front gate.

523
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:46,542
I invited him in for dinner.

524
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,983
How is it that you're
coming in together?

525
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,252
At the cafe...

526
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:52,653
I thought your part-time
job was a secret.

527
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:55,883
We just hung out.

528
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:57,352
You said you had an errand
to run for your family.

529
00:32:57,653 --> 00:32:58,822
You were with him instead?

530
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:01,262
- Well...
- Are you keeping a check on her?

531
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,663
Just because you're dating...

532
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,693
My mom doesn't know
that we're dating!

533
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,203
Is that a secret too?

534
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:11,372
The dumplings will
be made in a flash...

535
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:12,702
now that you guys
are helping us.

536
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:15,073
Hold on. You haven't
even started yet?

537
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,113
Why are you making
them make dumplings?

538
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:21,312
Dumplings taste the best when they
are made and steamed on the spot.

539
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:22,343
You don't know that?

540
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:23,412
Don't you agree, Soo Ho?

541
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:24,783
Sure.

542
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:30,923
Han Go Woon's
boyfriend, Han Seo Jun.

543
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,093
So this is where
I meet my rival.

544
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:38,832
Soo Ho,

545
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:41,702
these need more flour
or they'll stick.

546
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:43,303
Thank you.

547
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:47,472
Goodness. Seo Jun, your
dumplings are pretty.

548
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:48,602
I've made them before at home.

549
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:50,943
My mom said, if I
make pretty dumplings,

550
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:52,642
I'll end up with
a pretty daughter.

551
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:54,682
It's why I let her teach me.

552
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,883
Mi Hyang must make
pretty dumplings...

553
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:59,013
to have given birth to
such a handsome son.

554
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,213
Oh, please.

555
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:02,582
- You must be popular in school.
- Slightly.

556
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,323
Popular? As if.

557
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:07,392
You're nothing
compared to Soo Ho.

558
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:11,033
He's practically
glowing, isn't he?

559
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:14,233
My gosh. Check out
those bulging biceps.

560
00:34:16,602 --> 00:34:18,173
By the way, Mr. Han,

561
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:21,142
why were you out with my
sister and not your girlfriend?

562
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:22,372
Me?

563
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:24,272
Since when do I
have a girlfriend?

564
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,073
What a jerk.

565
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:30,682
All right. Take a break
and have some water.

566
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,383
My gosh. Oh, dear.

567
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:37,053
I can't believe I almost
spilled it across the floor.

568
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:38,693
What's with him today?

569
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,022
You should've been more careful.

570
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:41,093
Thank you.

571
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:43,122
My Ju Kyung sure is lucky...

572
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,332
to have two handsome friends.

573
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,502
Stay friends with them both...

574
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,662
and choose one to date
once you get into college.

575
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:51,432
Why would I need to choose?

576
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:57,412
I vote for Soo Ho.

577
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:03,182
Gosh, why are you
suddenly voting?

578
00:35:03,182 --> 00:35:05,283
My vote also goes to Soo Ho.

579
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:08,483
I love you, Soo Ho.

580
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:11,892
To be honest, I
wanted Seo Jun...

581
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:15,093
to be Ju Kyung's
future boyfriend.

582
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:17,363
Let me know if you want to
attend my dad's meet-and-greet.

583
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,332
My goodness, are you serious?

584
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:23,832
You never even talk to your dad.

585
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,002
- What are you looking at?
- I don't know whom to choose.

586
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,772
This is really hard.

587
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:30,443
Why are you struggling to
choose between the two?

588
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:32,642
Let's just be quiet
and make dumplings.

589
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:34,182
It's fun.

590
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:39,182
My vote will go to the one
who makes better dumplings.

591
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:22,682
The dumplings look so
professional. It's like...

592
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:23,912
It's a neck and neck match.

593
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:25,812
No, it's a dragon
and crane match.

594
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,452
I still think the one on
the right is a bit better.

595
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,792
But what did you make this with?

596
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,662
Dad.

597
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:47,443
Seo Jun wins.

598
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:50,102
Yes!

599
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,573
Honey, it was my mistake.

600
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:11,263
Why are they making such a
big deal out of dumplings?

601
00:39:12,062 --> 00:39:13,892
I already have
enough on my mind.

602
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:19,702
Can I go inside?

603
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:25,642
Oh, just a second.

604
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,582
Come in.

605
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:37,323
I was just about to go outside.

606
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:38,553
What's up?

607
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,332
So this is what your
room looks like.

608
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:48,202
That's right. It's lame like me.
You're done, right? Let's go.

609
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:53,733
If we go back outside, I won't
get a chance to talk to you.

610
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:59,042
So tell me. What did
you do with Seo Jun?

611
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,443
We just worked
part-time together.

612
00:40:02,743 --> 00:40:05,053
He introduced me to the job.

613
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,383
He came in as a substitute,
so we worked together today.

614
00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:10,352
But my parents don't know I work,
so I couldn't tell you earlier.

615
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:13,892
Then why did you lie to me that
you were helping your dad out?

616
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:20,593
Don't lie to me next time.

617
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:25,602
Okay, I'm sorry.

618
00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:30,843
When a boyfriend comes over,

619
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:32,943
don't girls normally show their
boyfriends their photo album?

620
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:35,582
I will never show you my photos.

621
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:37,243
Why would I want to
show you how ugly I was?

622
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,053
But there are photos right here.

623
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,022
This isn't me.

624
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:48,763
"Saesak Kindergarten, Lim Ju
Kyung". Your name's right there.

625
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:51,932
Gosh, why did I put this here?

626
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:02,202
What's wrong? Are you startled
because I look so ugly?

627
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,613
Are you...

628
00:41:06,343 --> 00:41:07,412
What?

629
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:12,513
Never mind. Can I have this?

630
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:15,383
Why would you take that?

631
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:17,522
- Give it back.
- Let me take one.

632
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,292
- Why would you want that?
- Just let me take it.

633
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:21,463
- Give it back. Why do you want it?
- Let me just take this one.

634
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:31,131
Ju Kyung, is Soo Ho...

635
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:33,322
There he is.

636
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,940
You should be more careful.

637
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,781
We just fell.

638
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,051
I know you fell.

639
00:41:46,681 --> 00:41:47,750
Soo Ho.

640
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,520
You remember what
I told you, right?

641
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,890
- Keep a healthy what?
- Keep a healthy relationship.

642
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,221
- And stay what?
- Stay innocent.

643
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,951
Always remember that.

644
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,560
I was told to bring
down the table.

645
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,870
Where's the table?

646
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:10,071
It's over there.

647
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:11,910
It's like you live here.

648
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,410
By the way, why are you
guys fighting already?

649
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:17,910
What are you talking
about? We didn't fight.

650
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,181
If you didn't fight, then why
was she sighing all day...

651
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,790
worrying about whether to
choose love or friendship?

652
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:29,190
Why are you even care about
us? Don't cross the line.

653
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,290
It's none of your business.

654
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,091
Then don't make her worry...

655
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,531
and come to me
for dating advice.

656
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,600
It makes me want to
take her from you.

657
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:41,341
Cut the nonsense.

658
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,870
It's not like I
said anything wrong.

659
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:51,381
- I'll take this to the kitchen.
- Okay.

660
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:03,991
Come here.

661
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,830
Cut it out. I'll just
pull out all your hair.

662
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,250
Store them in your freezer and
heat them up with a steamer.

663
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,781
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

664
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:30,951
And don't fight.

665
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:34,051
I don't know what
happened between you two.

666
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:35,721
But talk it out.

667
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,531
If you keep it all pent up
inside, it'll only make it worse.

668
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,660
Let them deal with it on their
own. Let's go inside now.

669
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:43,301
Come on.

670
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,940
I love you.

671
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,651
I love you.

672
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,120
How dare you fight?
You're not children.

673
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,060
- I love you.
- All kids fight at that age.

674
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:15,201
The dumplings smell good.

675
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,361
I love you.

676
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:34,421
Can you guess what side dishes
they served at the restaurant?

677
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Soy sauce beans,
shishito peppers,

678
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,451
stir-fried squid...

679
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:40,551
You can stop.

680
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,960
You don't have to
tell me that much.

681
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,060
I called often, reported
everything I did,

682
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,361
and canceled my team
dinner. I want a reward.

683
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:51,171
- A reward?
- You know.

684
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,471
I do not.

685
00:44:54,471 --> 00:44:57,171
Hey. I won't hang
up until you do it.

686
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:12,020
No girlfriend, my foot.

687
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,330
What was that?

688
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,270
The music video looks good.

689
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,971
Right? It's nice.

690
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:29,100
It's catchy.

691
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,440
I was worried that his
debut song was a ballad,

692
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,810
but it's good.

693
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,741
- Oh my gosh.
- What is this?

694
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,151
Ms. Lim.

695
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,511
Is this Black Soul's debut song?

696
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,421
Isn't this Leo's song?

697
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,951
What? What do you mean?

698
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,520
The memorial album was canceled.
So how was this song recorded?

699
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:50,390
Did you buy the song from Leo?

700
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:51,560
Did you get permission?

701
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:01,801
LIM JU KYUNG'S SPOT. SIT WITHOUT
PERMISSION, AND GET A HAIRY BUTT!

702
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,790
Hey, crybaby. You're back.

703
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,031
I'm not a crybaby.

704
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:31,301
You were crying here last
time. Meow. I'm a cat.

705
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:33,671
I cried that one
time, that's all.

706
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,210
Hey. That's the
book I came to read.

707
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,540
You can rent it once I'm done.

708
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,111
- The first person to read it...
- Yes, I know.

709
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,310
Meanie.

710
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,361
So he was a ghost.

711
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:04,431
Wait. I'm not done.

712
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:06,330
I am.

713
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,801
I'm not done.

714
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,910
Mr. Prince! This...

715
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,381
It's a secret.

716
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:33,091
I can't believe
that was Ju Kyung.

717
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:03,591
It's really mean to mess
around with someone's pain.

718
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,390
Sorry. I'm sorry.

719
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,201
It's okay now.

720
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,221
The person I like...

721
00:48:38,031 --> 00:48:39,131
It's you.

722
00:49:16,531 --> 00:49:18,500
Hey! Ju Kyung!

723
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,071
What is it this time?

724
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:22,201
- Congratulations!
- How long have you been going out?

725
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:23,540
Why didn't you tell me?

726
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,910
Do we have two couples
in our class now?

727
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:27,910
Is it true?

728
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:29,341
I wasn't trying...

729
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,480
to keep it from you.

730
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:37,080
Ta-da!

731
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:40,491
I heard you and Seo Jun
were secretly dating.

732
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,160
I heard you took pictures
together and stuff!

733
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,290
- Right!
- What?

734
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,560
Me and Seo Jun?

735
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,261
What are you doing here?

736
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:51,801
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

737
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,140
You frustrating idiot. I told you
I thought Ju Kyung got a boyfriend.

738
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:06,781
Look at this pose.

739
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:09,951
They look good together.

740
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:11,890
Should we steal her away?

741
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,390
No. That's messed up.

742
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:15,020
What will you do now?

743
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,830
- Tell us!
- Tell us!

744
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,500
- Tell us!
- Stop it.

745
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,431
Hey! I have a question
from "Hyun Kyu Facts".

746
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:28,201
Was the man you were on a
secret date with at K Mall...

747
00:50:28,301 --> 00:50:29,770
Han Seo Jun?

748
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,611
- Was it?
- Tell us!

749
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,611
COUPLE FOREVER

750
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:35,440
Okay, guys!

751
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:39,850
We are just friends.
Nothing more, nothing less.

752
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,681
So please stop spreading rumors
based purely on speculation.

753
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,091
Is this a press conference?

754
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:46,390
It's so obvious.

755
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,160
Say something. Don't let them
jump to conclusions like that.

756
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,960
- Tell us!
- Please tell us the truth!

757
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:54,031
Guys!

758
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:57,100
If I hear you talk
nonsense, you're dead.

759
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:00,031
Happy?

760
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:03,901
I knew it.

761
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,741
- Be honest.
- Did you kiss her or not?

762
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:11,111
Man Shik!

763
00:51:11,881 --> 00:51:12,980
I'm getting angry.

764
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:14,381
- He did.
- He did.

765
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,750
- He did.
- He totally did.

766
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:18,821
Hey. Sorry, man.

767
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,361
- He totally did it.
- He did.

768
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,931
Why do rumors keep spreading
about me and Seo Jun?

769
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,560
You should just go out with him.

770
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,301
How many times is this already?

771
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,531
It means you two
were meant to be.

772
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,770
We're just friends.

773
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,540
You could start off as friends
and grow to like each other.

774
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,870
Feelings don't stay
the same forever.

775
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:41,310
Soo Jin, you should go
out with Soo Ho too.

776
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,241
You could suddenly like each other
after being friends too. Right?

777
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,350
Ju Kyung and Seo Jun.

778
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,980
Soo Jin and Soo Ho.

779
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,020
I can just see it. I can
totally see it happening.

780
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:52,821
Should I?

781
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,221
What? Do you mean it?

782
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:56,460
No way.

783
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,560
You're being suspicious.

784
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,560
Forget that. I'm going
to dig into this today.

785
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,761
Are you free after school today?

786
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:05,270
The three of us should hang out.

787
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,971
I can't. I have plans
with Soo Ho today.

788
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:11,471
- What?
- Just the two of you? Why?

789
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:13,171
Just because. I'll
tell you later.

790
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,111
What's going on?

791
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:16,611
Is something really going
on between you and Soo Ho?

792
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:18,350
Tell me. Come on.

793
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,381
Come to the roof.

794
00:52:20,381 --> 00:52:22,051
- Who is it?
- What?

795
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,890
No one. It's nothing.

796
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,531
Don't you have something to say?

797
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,971
About what?

798
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,870
What was that picture about?

799
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:44,071
You sound angry.

800
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,870
Yes, I am angry.

801
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,381
It was a coincidence. We ended
up doing a gig job together.

802
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,951
At the cafe, he happened
to fill in for someone.

803
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:54,881
And this was a coincidence?

804
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,951
- Yes.
- Then why didn't you tell me?

805
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,151
I wanted to tell you right
away, but you hung up on me...

806
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:07,160
What about you?

807
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,230
Do you tell me every
time you meet someone?

808
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,160
- What?
- I posed as they said...

809
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,730
because they were paying me.

810
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,730
I don't like you and Seo Jun
being associated together...

811
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,341
or rumors like this spreading.

812
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,940
- You know we're just friends.
- How do you know how he feels...

813
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,341
Guys and girls can't be friends.

814
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:28,011
What about you?

815
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,181
Isn't Soo Jin an old friend?

816
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:33,091
Why are you bringing her up?

817
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,741
You can carry heavy things
like this in front of me,

818
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:57,440
but that won't make
me lend you a hand.

819
00:53:57,741 --> 00:54:01,151
Why? Because I'm done
having any feelings for you.

820
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,551
Whatever.

821
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:05,250
Okay, fine.

822
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,560
I can't turn a blind
eye when you struggle.

823
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,620
Let me help.

824
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:13,131
- I'm good. These are heavy.
- Which is why I'll help.

825
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:14,660
They're really heavy.

826
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,131
This is my final
offer. Let me help.

827
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,781
You see...

828
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,980
What you just heard...

829
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,051
Good for you.

830
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,190
Holding in farts can
lead to something bad.

831
00:54:54,631 --> 00:54:56,241
Why would you...

832
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,741
flash that pretty smile
when I'm trying to move on?

833
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:05,480
From the conversation
of these two friends,

834
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,051
find the distance from
minus a comma a...

835
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:11,181
using the continuous function...

836
00:55:11,181 --> 00:55:13,151
of y equals fx.

837
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,850
From the y-axis...

838
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,580
Mr. Han Seo Jun!

839
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:44,051
Oh, you're Ju Kyung's
little brother.

840
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,051
Punch me. I'll let
you do so in advance.

841
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,890
What's this nonsense?

842
00:55:50,361 --> 00:55:53,160
I'm going to make it my
mission to steal her from you.

843
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:56,861
Hello?

844
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,330
If you're not going
to hit me right now,

845
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,100
I'll let you once I
manage to steal her.

846
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,440
That moron.

847
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,011
Who did you say you were?

848
00:56:09,111 --> 00:56:10,480
This is Lim Hee Kyung
from Move Entertainment.

849
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,651
We met before.

850
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:16,721
So you never met with
one of our employees?

851
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:18,290
I said I didn't!

852
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:34,401
Sir.

853
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,870
I'm actually in a hurry.

854
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,171
I have something to ask.

855
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:39,571
Sure. What is it?

856
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:42,011
Black Soul's debut single
was switched up recently.

857
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,381
Funnily enough, it was done
right around the time...

858
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:47,281
I was transferred and
the project was scrapped.

859
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:50,451
Why are you telling me about
it? I don't have time for this.

860
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,591
That song belongs
to Se Yeon and Leo.

861
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,620
I already checked
with the producer.

862
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,761
He said the order
came from CEO Lee.

863
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,591
Why are you making it this far?

864
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:02,160
Is there another reason
why you don't want...

865
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,701
Se Yeon's memorial
album to be released?

866
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:08,940
A stolen song?

867
00:57:09,571 --> 00:57:12,341
What's there to steal when the
song isn't even copyrighted.

868
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,881
Even if Jung Se Yeon's family
or Leo accused us of plagiarism,

869
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:17,580
no one would believe them.

870
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:20,781
- What?
- If you want to keep your job,

871
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:23,221
you'll keep quiet...

872
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,721
and do the tasks that
are handed to you.

873
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,591
Don't cause unwanted trouble.

874
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,460
You've got to be kidding me!

875
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:43,540
Yes, Reporter Choi.

876
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,440
I already emailed you
the press release.

877
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,971
Wait. Just a second.

878
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:51,980
I have something to ask. It's
about the article that...

879
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:54,381
said Jung Se Yeon was
a bully in school.

880
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:07,631
Should I ask him out
when I give this to him?

881
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,000
I have plans with Soo Ho today.

882
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,770
What on earth is this?

883
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,511
MILD CLEANSING FOAM

884
00:58:22,611 --> 00:58:26,750
JU KYUNG...

885
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:30,580
Don't I have a
right to be angry?

886
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:42,960
Who is it?

887
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:46,770
What brings you by at this hour?

888
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,071
Gosh, it's freezing in here.
Don't you turn on the heater?

889
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,040
I told you that you should.

890
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,241
Gosh, these are heavy.

891
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:57,480
- What are these?
- I asked my mom...

892
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,511
for some side dishes.

893
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:00,850
I couldn't turn a blind eye...

894
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,281
when your dad asked me
to look out for you.

895
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,750
It wasn't necessary. I
barely eat at home anyway.

896
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,350
This is what I get
for being generous?

897
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,861
Throw them out if you want.

898
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:12,091
Aren't you leaving?

899
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,500
Heartless jerk. Don't I
even get a glass of water?

900
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:19,830
Unbelievable.

901
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,770
Nothing's changed around here.

902
00:59:25,741 --> 00:59:27,540
I see you still
have this up here.

903
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,080
GIRLFRIEND

904
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,660
GIRLFRIEND

905
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:48,801
- Soo Ho...
- Hello?

906
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,111
Drink your water and get going.

907
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:07,151
I wouldn't stay
forever, you know.

908
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,921
Here.

909
01:00:12,721 --> 01:00:14,421
- What's this?
- A gift.

910
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:15,890
I hope you like it.

911
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:18,591
- A gift? What for?
- I wanted to thank you.

912
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:19,730
Just take it, all right?

913
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,531
What's wrong about me
getting you a gift?

914
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:31,971
When have we ever
exchanged gifts?

915
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:35,281
You came all this way to
give me this, at this hour?

916
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,910
That wasn't the only reason.

917
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:40,310
I wanted to see you, okay?

918
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,290
You've been on my
mind these days.

919
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:49,960
I can't accept this.

920
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,730
- Wear it yourself.
- Why's that?

921
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:55,401
Don't you like it?
Should I get you another?

922
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,861
I have a girlfriend.

923
01:00:58,801 --> 01:00:59,870
So?

924
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:01,971
What about it?

925
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,940
Well...

926
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:07,611
Seriously?

927
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,241
One might think I just
confessed my love for you.

928
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,881
Why are you overreacting?

929
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,350
So you have a
girlfriend. Who is it?

930
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:15,821
I'll tell you some other time.

931
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,750
It's late. You should go home.

932
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,051
KANG.S.J UPLOADED A NEW PHOTO.

933
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,270
BOYFRIEND

934
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,710
Hello?

935
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,881
Hey, it's me.

936
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,250
Right.

937
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,020
Were you asleep?

938
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:29,221
No.

939
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,560
What were you up to?

940
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:36,531
Nothing much. I've been home.

941
01:02:43,071 --> 01:02:44,971
- Earlier today at school...
- I'm exhausted,

942
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,341
so let's talk tomorrow.

943
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,410
Bye.

944
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:06,160
GIRLFRIEND

945
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:08,560
Good night.

946
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,301
Here's your coffee.

947
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,991
Lim Ju Kyung!

948
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:36,660
Don't mess with me.

949
01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:38,290
Sorry.

950
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:45,500
- I warned you.
- "I warned you".

951
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:48,701
- I told you to stop.
- "I told you to stop".

952
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:52,810
- What's with you today?
- Smile a little.

953
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:04,480
- What are you doing here?
- Am I not allowed to be here?

954
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:09,491
I thought he was a substitute,
but he's here again.

955
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:13,031
The owner asked him to work here
because the other part-timer quit.

956
01:04:13,131 --> 01:04:14,690
Your boyfriend is scary.

957
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:16,761
It's like he's
interrogating you.

958
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:17,901
Can we talk?

959
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:20,171
- I'm working right now.
- Then I'll wait.

960
01:04:21,701 --> 01:04:22,841
Just give me a cold drink.

961
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,870
Are you going to
keep an eye on her?

962
01:04:24,971 --> 01:04:27,241
- You're being obsessive.
- This is between us.

963
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:28,410
Stay out of it.

964
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,210
I'll call you once I'm done.

965
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,051
- Am I a bother to you?
- No, it's not that.

966
01:04:36,551 --> 01:04:39,091
Okay, fine. I'll wait outside.

967
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:41,120
Call me when you're done.

968
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:53,000
You should go.

969
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,940
What? I can't do that.

970
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,671
There aren't a lot of customers,
so I can work by myself.

971
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,241
So just go and deal with it.

972
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:02,810
This is only making
me feel uncomfortable.

973
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,040
I'm sorry.

974
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,230
I want to get double
eyelid surgery.

975
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,031
No way. Then you
won't look sexy.

976
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:28,971
- I'm sexy?
- Yes, you are.

977
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:30,741
Then should I do something
about my cheekbones?

978
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:31,971
No, then you won't look so cute.

979
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:32,971
Are you serious?

980
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,370
Then what can I do?

981
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,080
Welcome.

982
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,810
- Hey, Seo Jun.
- Hey.

983
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,681
Oh, you're Lee Seong
Yong's girlfriend.

984
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:47,190
- We broke up ages ago.
- They broke up.

985
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,790
- Just make an order.
- I want a low-calorie drink.

986
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,290
Then get an avocado.

987
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,230
I came to give you this.

988
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,901
Gosh, I thought I lost it.

989
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,901
Why do you have this?

990
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:03,100
Shouldn't you thank me for it?

991
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,841
By the way, the girl
that left just now...

992
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:09,241
She's Lim Ju Kyung from
Saebom High School, right?

993
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:10,841
Lim Ju Kyung?

994
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,910
What if she is?

995
01:06:13,951 --> 01:06:16,151
I'm just asking.

996
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,421
Does she work here with you?

997
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:19,490
Aren't you going
to order anything?

998
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:22,051
- I'll have an affokato.
- She means "avocado".

999
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,620
It's affogato.

1000
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,631
- Affokato.
- It's avocado.

1001
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,141
Hey, you're here.

1002
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,641
What is it that you want to say?

1003
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:43,381
Let's tell the kids
that we're going out.

1004
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,551
- I want to tell them.
- Why all of a sudden?

1005
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,250
I don't want to hide it anymore.

1006
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:49,851
I thought you were okay with it.

1007
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:51,820
Why?

1008
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,851
Don't you want to tell anyone?

1009
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,021
I still feel uneasy about it.

1010
01:06:58,561 --> 01:07:00,391
You feel uneasy about
telling people we're dating,

1011
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:02,960
but you're okay with people
saying you're dating Seo Jun?

1012
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,360
That's not what I meant.

1013
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,900
If you guys have to
keep working together,

1014
01:07:06,801 --> 01:07:08,301
I want you to quit
your part-time job.

1015
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:09,740
Why should I quit?

1016
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,740
Because it bothers me.

1017
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,410
I don't like seeing
you talking to him...

1018
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,370
or even looking at him.

1019
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:16,610
You're the one who isn't on
good terms with him, not me.

1020
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:19,051
Why do you keep spending
time with him...

1021
01:07:19,051 --> 01:07:20,351
when you know we're
not on good terms?

1022
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:22,780
Without your permission, I'm not
allowed to work or meet friends?

1023
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,450
Then if I'm not okay with something,
would you be able to give it up?

1024
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,750
Can you stop being
friends with someone?

1025
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,851
What if I tell you I can?

1026
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,120
I envy how everything
is so easy for you.

1027
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,131
Then what if I tell you that I don't
want to tell people about us...

1028
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,400
and also refuse to
quit the part-time job?

1029
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,040
What?

1030
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,070
Does that mean we won't be
able to see each other anymore?

1031
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:51,040
What's that supposed to mean?

1032
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:58,051
Ju Kyung!

1033
01:08:39,131 --> 01:08:40,330
Hey, Ju Kyung.

Hey, this group
made a debut today.

1036
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,080
But they changed
their title song.

1037
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,421
It's completely different from the
highlight scenes they uploaded.

1038
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,381
Really? Let's hear it.

you're doing great.

Okay.

What is this?

01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:58,030
- Darn it.
- What? Where are you going?

1056
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:59,330
Seo Jun!

- Is Mr. Lee inside?

1058
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:08,341
CEO'S OFFICE

1059
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,540
Okay, sir.

1060
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,650
- Sir.
- What's going on?

1061
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,410
Was this really necessary?

1062
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,981
Ms. Lim, what are you doing?

1063
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,120
I get that you didn't want...

1064
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:21,450
Se Yeon's name to
become an issue again.

1065
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:24,591
But how could you
even steal his song...

1066
01:11:24,591 --> 01:11:26,061
to cover up your mistake?

1067
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,101
- What is she talking about?
- It's nothing, sir.

1068
01:11:33,801 --> 01:11:36,271
He doesn't care
about the rookies.

1069
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:38,200
Let's go. Let's talk outside.

1070
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,311
Let go. I said, let go!

1071
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,950
You had a reporter
publish an article...

1072
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,320
about Se Yeon being
a bully in school...

1073
01:11:54,421 --> 01:11:56,421
to prevent this photo of you and
the actress from becoming an issue.

1074
01:11:57,261 --> 01:12:00,131
If you felt even the slightest bit
of responsibility about his death,

1075
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:01,860
you shouldn't have done this.

1076
01:12:02,561 --> 01:12:05,971
Even if this song has no copyright,
this is still plagiarism.

1077
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:11,400
How dare you barge in here
and talk all that nonsense?

1078
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:13,671
Take her outside right now.

1079
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:15,981
Just come outside!

1080
01:12:15,981 --> 01:12:18,841
Se Yeon and Leo are only 18.

1081
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:21,011
You also have a son yourself.

1082
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:22,681
If you feel bad for doing
this to these kids...

1083
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:24,250
who are young enough
to be your son,

1084
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,290
you should set things straight.

1085
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,860
It's better for you to take
care of this yourself...

1086
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,021
rather than to have me
blow the whistle on you.

1087
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,801
Are you threatening
me right now?

1088
01:12:41,171 --> 01:12:42,841
Think whatever you want.

1089
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:45,801
I came to tell you this
knowing I could get fired.

1090
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:47,710
Have you lost your mind?

1091
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,580
I'll leave on my own.

1092
01:13:06,891 --> 01:13:08,061
Soo Ho.

1093
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:13,200
Soo Ho.

1094
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:45,460
Soo Ho! Did you hear the song?

1095
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,171
The song that was released
by Move Entertainment.

1096
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:49,771
That jerk.

1097
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:52,070
Hey! Soo Ho!

1098
01:14:58,471 --> 01:15:01,210
TRUE BEAUTY

1099
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,941
<i>What is wrong with me?</i>

1100
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:07,181
<i>Things always go wrong.</i>

1101
01:15:08,011 --> 01:15:10,051
<i>I hurt innocent people.</i>

1102
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,990
<i>There's a girl named Lim
Ju Kyung at your school.</i>

1103
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,490
<i>- Why did you do it? Just for that?
- Soo Ho!</i>

1104
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:19,761
<i>Do you know how painful
it was for Soo Ho?</i>

1105
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:21,490
<i>I came to give you a hug.</i>

1106
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:25,061
<i>Why didn't you
tell me back then?</i>

1107
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,671
<i>Ju Kyung! She
transferred from Yongpa.</i>
