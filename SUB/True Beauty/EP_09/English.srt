1
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:15,777
I don't like Soo Jin.

2
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:19,147
The person I like...

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,187
It's you.

4
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,527
Lim Ju Kyung!

5
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:12,367
Why are you running away?

6
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:16,777
I don't know. I just did.

7
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:21,477
But... Is it really me?

8
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:24,216
Yes, it's you.

9
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,287
That's absurd.

10
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:29,216
This is a joke, isn't it?

11
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,587
Is this a prank? Are
the others watching?

12
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:33,427
Maybe it's out of pity.

13
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,856
- Wait, is it a dream?
- It's not.

14
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:37,856
Then...

15
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:41,027
you really like me?

16
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:43,167
Are you saying I can't?

17
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:52,376
How...

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,277
My heart's pounding so
hard that I can hardly...

19
00:01:58,246 --> 00:01:59,287
form words.

20
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,686
I'm just as nervous.

21
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,996
I was going to give you
this and then tell you.

22
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,207
Unbelievable.

23
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,737
I'm going backward.

24
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:38,756
What do you think of me?

25
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:41,457
What?

26
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:50,696
Why else would my
heart be fluttering?

27
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:53,237
- What does it mean?
- It means that I like you.

28
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,036
I like you a lot actually.

29
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:57,307
I dream of you at night
and even during the day.

30
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,906
Despite being lazy, I get
up before my alarm rings...

31
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:01,246
to hurry to school to see you.

32
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,876
And then when I see you...

33
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:12,887
Anyway,

34
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,156
that's how I feel.

35
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:26,006
Lim Ju Kyung...

36
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,246
I still can't believe it.

37
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,376
Could it be a dream?

38
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,647
Darn, that hurts.

39
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,126
Soo Jin!

40
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,797
- Who's there?
- It's me.

41
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,196
Ju Kyung!

42
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,777
Oh, no. I don't
have any makeup on.

43
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:14,647
Ju Kyung?

44
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,796
Why have you been
desperately hiding it?

45
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,666
I...

46
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:31,767
once asked those
who bullied me...

47
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,466
why they hated me so much.

48
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:39,747
Because you're ugly.

49
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:42,976
It was because I'm ugly.

50
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,387
They just hated how I looked.

51
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,986
But with makeup,

52
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,726
people started seeing
me differently.

53
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,127
Kids approached me first...

54
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,137
and I easily got
to make friends.

55
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,437
It made me realize...

56
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,406
that I should...

57
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,346
never take off this mask.

58
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:20,317
It must've been difficult for you
trying to keep the truth hidden.

59
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,887
I'm scared that...

60
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:28,687
the kids will turn against me
once they see my real face.

61
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,897
What a loser, right?

62
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:40,106
Those who make you feel
this way are the losers.

63
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,837
So don't ever think
that again. Got it?

64
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,546
You still don't want
to get caught though,

65
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,147
so what should we do?

66
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:55,216
On your feet.

67
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,216
What?

68
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:02,087
Come here.

69
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,096
Let's go.

70
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:10,697
Let's go.

71
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,507
- Like this?
- Yes.

72
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,627
I went from being in paradise
straight into a pit of fire.

73
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,067
I'm glad it was Soo Jin
who caught me though.

74
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:50,637
Good night.

75
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:53,176
LEE SOO HO

76
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:58,777
LIM JU KYUNG

77
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,017
I sent the wrong one.

78
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,957
LIM JU KYUNG

79
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,497
You too.

80
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,426
LIM JU KYUNG

81
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:04,577
- What's up with Soo Ho today?
- Was that a smile?

82
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,317
I've never seen
him smile before.

83
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,786
Gosh, he's handsome!

84
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:14,127
You are going to
get me infected.

85
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:18,596
Throw it away.

86
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,466
Since when were you close enough
to give me something like this?

87
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,666
Throw it away. Do
you not hear me?

88
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:29,837
Unbelievable.

89
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,906
She should know how
precious this is.

90
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,517
Haven't you asked her out yet?

91
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:39,347
You're so frustrating.

92
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:44,887
My gosh.

93
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,426
Seo Jun, aren't you going
to go back to your class?

94
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:51,956
- No.
- Oh, I see.

95
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:53,666
Then where am I supposed to sit?

96
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,196
Gosh, get out of here.

97
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,397
No, you should go.

98
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:59,637
I don't have the power
to switch classes.

99
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:01,666
- Leave. Get out. Go.
- Here.

100
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,877
Aren't you going to help
me? Drag him out of here.

101
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:09,517
Hey, guys. Let's go to a dry
sauna this weekend after we study.

102
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:11,816
- A dry sauna?
- Yes.

103
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,247
I don't think I can go.

104
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:17,086
Why not? Let's go.
It'll be fun. Please?

105
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,217
Let's go.

106
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:20,186
I don't think...

107
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:25,926
Why would you want to go to
a dry sauna? I hate the heat.

108
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:26,997
Forget it then.

109
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:28,196
My gosh.

110
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,576
Gosh, what's going on?

111
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:41,377
What's with him? He
normally eats alone.

112
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:42,847
Maybe he's close with her.

113
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,747
What's going on? Why is
he eating with Ju Kyung?

114
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,857
My gosh, I lost my appetite.

115
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,757
You only had one bite.

116
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:53,556
She must be on a diet.

117
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:55,257
That traitor. She must want
to become even prettier.

118
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,796
Did Ju Kyung just avoid you?

119
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:01,867
I think she knows you like her
and is avoiding you on purpose.

120
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,406
I can't believe you got rejected
even before you asked her out.

121
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,377
Is it Ju Kyung?
What did she say?

122
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:14,706
I HONESTLY FIND YOU
REALLY ANNOYING.

123
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:17,617
"I find you annoying.
You get on my nerves."

124
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,217
My gosh, you poor guy.

125
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,717
This is my favorite menu,
but you can have it.

126
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:27,326
WASTE PIT

127
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,196
- My gosh, it's Divine Soo Ho.
- He's so tall.

128
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,627
- He's so handsome.
- My goodness.

129
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,877
Duck.

130
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:47,676
Is this really necessary?

131
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,017
- Of course.
- Why?

132
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,617
Why do you think? Haven't
you heard the rumors?

133
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,316
After you told a girl
that you like someone,

134
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:57,556
the school bullies have been
keeping an eye on you...

135
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,656
so they could mess with whomever
it is you're close with.

136
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,097
If they find out
I'm dating you...

137
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,767
Hey, you.

138
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,607
Are you the brat who
hit on Divine Soo Ho?

139
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:18,137
No, it wasn't me.

140
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:19,777
Look at that tail of hers.

141
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,046
Bring me that witch!

142
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,747
No! It's not me!

143
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:36,296
That's absurd.

144
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:41,767
- It's not absurd.
- So you want to keep this up?

145
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,566
We should tell Soo
Jin and Soo Ah.

146
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,706
But I'm still a bit embarrassed.

147
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,647
How can I tell them...

148
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,946
that you're my boyfriend?

149
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,217
But I am your boyfriend.

150
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:04,416
It feels so weird. That word
just feels so new to me.

151
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:17,436
You know I'll be counseling you
guys for your college entrance...

152
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,737
starting from next week, right?

153
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,007
- Yes.
- Yes.

154
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:27,076
DESIRED CAREER

155
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,786
She's like a spy.

156
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,196
No one from our
school is here, right?

157
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:53,306
This place is an hour away from
school. They won't come here.

158
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,406
You never know.

159
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,107
Goodbye.

160
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,347
Hello. Let me grab you a table.

161
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,377
Do you mind sitting
in an open space?

162
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,946
We'd like a table that's
located in a CCTV blind spot...

163
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,517
and extremely secluded
where no one can see us.

164
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:11,357
Okay. Come this way.

165
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,987
Someone needs to teach
those kids a lesson.

166
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,166
I'll give you some time
to look through the menu.

167
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,296
We'll order a couples set.

168
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,367
A set for couples.

169
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:28,767
We're a couple.

170
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:32,477
Right. A couples
set. You got it.

171
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:35,647
"A couple"?

172
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,916
Can't we be open about it
since there's no one around?

173
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:42,847
You won't even let me
talk to you at school.

174
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,416
It doesn't feel
like we're dating.

175
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,326
It feels real to me.

176
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,826
It felt real when I saw this.

177
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:50,956
What did you save me
as on your cell phone?

178
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,627
- I saved you as...
- Lim Ju Kyung.

179
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,097
- That's my name.
- Yes.

180
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,137
What about your name?

181
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:00,967
My name...

182
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:03,637
It's pretty.

183
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,877
BOYFRIEND

184
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:11,877
Enjoy.

185
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,556
Do they only give one
fork for each couples set?

186
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:26,826
Why?

187
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,007
You're so cute.

188
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,867
So we can eat like that?

189
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:43,247
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

190
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,456
Here.

191
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:00,397
I'm sorry. I forgot...

192
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,196
Enjoy.

193
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:17,717
It looks nice.

194
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,117
Ju Kyung?

195
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:25,871
Duck.

196
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,241
Hyun Kyu, what brings
you to this neighborhood?

197
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,582
This place is pretty popular.

198
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,312
- We go to places like this.
- That's right.

199
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:37,251
What about you? Who
did you come with?

200
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,082
I... I came alone.

201
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:44,121
You ordered a couples
set when you came alone?

202
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,192
I really liked the
composition of the menus.

203
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:47,192
The couples set does have
some pretty nice menus.

204
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:49,832
Okay, I didn't know
you could eat so much.

205
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:50,961
Enjoy.

206
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,961
- Halt.
- No.

207
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,832
- Excuse me for doing this.
- Hey, wait.

208
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,702
- What?
- Let's respect her privacy.

209
00:15:58,702 --> 00:15:59,971
You're a gentleman.

210
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:03,141
Hey, Ju Kyung's boyfriend.
You must be really shy.

211
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,412
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Should I just see who he is?

212
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,411
It was nice to meet you,
Ju Kyung's boyfriend.

213
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:12,681
Next time, I hope we get
to say hello face to face.

214
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,151
Have fun with your boyfriend.

215
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,522
- Ju Kyung, good luck.
- Good luck.

216
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,431
Let's go.

217
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,881
You know what? This
place isn't safe either.

218
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:44,512
We might meet someone from
school again, so I'm going to go.

219
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:51,691
I brought you here to
show you something.

220
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:53,322
Let's leave after we see that.

221
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,121
Aren't you...

222
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:58,631
a big fan of hers?

223
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,572
It's Selena.

224
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,472
Selena!

225
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:11,641
Do you normally use items
with strong coverage...

226
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,681
when your face breaks out?

227
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:14,681
- Yes.
- Yes.

228
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,552
But you should use a mild
tone up cream like this one.

229
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:21,151
It's much better
for your complexion.

230
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,222
Don't forget that.

231
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:23,492
She's so cool.

232
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,891
Okay. I have a question for you.

233
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,522
There's a prize,
so pay attention.

234
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:30,931
What can you apply under foundation
to make your skin look smoother...

235
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,431
if you do not have concealer?

236
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,832
Me! Me!

237
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,701
The girl in the beige jacket.

238
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:40,101
A primer.

239
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:43,101
A primer? A primer.

240
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:44,841
Correct!

241
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:50,282
Come up and get your prize.

242
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,252
Look what I got.

243
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,272
Selena. I'm a huge fan.

244
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:13,742
May I get your autograph? I
want to remember this day.

245
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,441
Just a minute. Here.

246
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:19,312
It's a long story, but
you let me be reborn.

247
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:22,742
Kids say I'm good with makeup,
and I learned from your videos.

248
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:24,681
Thank you.

249
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:30,421
Gross.

250
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:32,552
What?

251
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,562
Gross.

252
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:40,262
If you learned from my videos,
how could you wear this color?

253
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:44,401
Even if they're all warm tones,
the shade makes a big difference.

254
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:48,941
A subtle difference in shades can
destroy the balance of the makeup.

255
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:56,181
Look. What do you think?

256
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,151
If you're going do
it halfheartedly,

257
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,181
don't tell people you learned
how to apply makeup from me.

258
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:07,022
Thank you. I'll work hard.

259
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:12,492
You're still better than when
I first started wearing makeup.

260
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,601
Don't be discouraged,
and keep at it.

261
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,651
Are you that happy?

262
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,361
Yes. I'm super happy.

263
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:43,361
I couldn't tell the difference.

264
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,492
I think you're better at it.

265
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:50,472
Hey. What I do doesn't come
close to Selena's skills.

266
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:52,671
I can never be that
good even if I try.

267
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:57,242
Why not? I'm sure she
wasn't good from the get-go.

268
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:00,681
You're still better than when
I first started wearing makeup.

269
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,012
Still.

270
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,121
Looks like you're happier about
seeing Selena than our first date.

271
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,022
What?

272
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:13,822
Never mind.

273
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:19,161
You're still open. Did you
have a client until now?

274
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:20,232
My daughter.

275
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,631
Who said you could
come home this late?

276
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,131
Did you have dinner?

277
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:25,502
I did.

278
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,272
Guess whom I met
today. I met Selena.

279
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:29,472
Selena? Who's that?

280
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:32,472
- A super famous makeup artist.
- She does makeup for celebrities?

281
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,542
She has a tiring job like I do.

282
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,782
We have no money coming in,
but it's always going out.

283
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:43,121
It's exhausting providing
for a family of five.

284
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:45,722
If only we didn't
lose the apartment...

285
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,332
Is business slow?

286
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,431
It's not how it used to be.

287
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:55,901
It needs to hang on until
you guys finish college.

288
00:20:58,101 --> 00:20:59,171
I'll go home.

289
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,502
Hey. Throw this away
on your way out.

290
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:04,772
It smells.

291
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,941
And do the dishes
when you get home.

292
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:11,611
I forgot to do them after breakfast.
It'll get gross if we leave them.

293
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:14,022
Ju Young's home. Why didn't
you have him do them?

294
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:20,121
I really wanted this.

295
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,201
So soft.

296
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:36,201
DESIRED CAREER

297
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,512
What's the use in desiring it?

298
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,312
It's not like I can get in
just because I want to go.

299
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,411
What should I put down?

300
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,601
COSMETOLOGY LICENSE

301
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:06,332
1,500 dollars?

302
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:09,072
It's too expensive
to even desire.

303
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,312
Gosh.

304
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,012
Did you drink again?

305
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,111
No, no.

306
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:21,982
The alcohol swallowed me whole.

307
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:25,651
Is something going on lately?

308
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:28,691
- Couldn't you take off your shoes?
- Come off.

309
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:30,762
Hello?

310
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:34,701
Hee Kyung. Where are you? I
haven't been able to reach you.

311
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:37,732
My sister's asleep. Who's this?

312
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:40,972
I'm... I was his junior
soldier from the army.

313
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:43,441
Have a lovely evening!

314
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,312
Salute!

315
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:51,351
- A junior soldier from the army?
- Salute.

316
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,982
That voice sounds so familiar.

317
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:27,651
My hair...

318
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,082
- Dad, where's my uniform?
- It's here.

319
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:31,492
Honey. Water.

320
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:33,091
Dad.

321
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,722
Honey?

322
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:37,062
- I'm hungry.
- Did you guys see your dad?

323
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:38,361
No.

324
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:40,701
Where did he go?

325
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,332
What's this?

326
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:44,972
MY FAMILY, WHOM I LOVE

327
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:46,401
Why, that jerk!

328
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:48,272
- What?
- What?

329
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:50,841
My family, whom I
love. Sook. Kids.

330
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:54,742
I'm going to Jeju to
catch Columbus Park.

331
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:57,752
I will not come back until
I get back the money...

332
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:00,151
that jerk scammed me out of.

333
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,822
So don't worry about me.

334
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:05,121
You've got to be kidding me!

335
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:11,631
What a life.

336
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:21,371
Hey. The bus will be
here soon. Wake up.

337
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:43,492
Hey, Seo Jun.

338
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:46,492
Hey. How could you
sleep just anywhere?

339
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,732
What if someone
carried you away?

340
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,371
I'm too heavy to
be carried away.

341
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:56,802
Sorry about that.

342
00:24:58,072 --> 00:24:59,242
Gross.

343
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:03,512
What's wrong with me? I should've
ignored her and kept walking.

344
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:04,911
What?

345
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:08,681
I don't see you on
your bike anymore.

346
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:10,851
Is it because I told
you not to ride it?

347
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:13,091
What?

348
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:23,161
You shouldn't ride it if
your mom tells you not to.

349
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:26,502
Sorry, but I have a soft
spot for sick people,

350
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:28,242
so I'm on your mom's side.

351
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:33,542
Your mom is so worried. Why must
you ride something so dangerous?

352
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:47,722
Do you think I'd stop
just because you said so?

353
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:50,022
Everyone knows I'm a good son.

354
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,661
I'm not riding it because
my mom said not to.

355
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:55,532
The bus is approaching.

356
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:57,401
Where are you going?
The bus is here.

357
00:25:58,302 --> 00:26:00,401
I'm going to run there
for exercise. So what?

358
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:02,201
See you later.

359
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:07,482
What in the world...

360
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:10,341
What is wrong with you?

361
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,822
Sorry. I can't meet you tonight.

362
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,421
Is something wrong?

363
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:21,762
Mr. Han. If you're free tonight,
will you help me shop...

364
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:24,492
for the vice principal's
birthday gift?

365
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:27,431
- Sorry?
- I'm supposed to pick it up,

366
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,262
but it would be nice to
have a man's opinion.

367
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:33,032
I'm not good at picking
out presents either.

368
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:34,272
I can go with you.

369
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,171
I have to shop for a
gift for my wife anyway.

370
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,411
Hello?

371
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:43,951
I'll see you later, Mr. Han.

372
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,982
No, I...

373
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:55,322
I totally saw.

374
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:56,992
She's here.

375
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,462
Hey, Jjoo. You got a boyfriend?
Why didn't you tell me?

376
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:03,462
Where does he go? He
doesn't go here, does he?

377
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,732
- Tell me.
- Who said that?

378
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,611
I saw them at K Mall.

379
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:14,012
She was hiding him so
we wouldn't see him.

380
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:16,441
Hey! I told you that wasn't it.

381
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:20,012
Why be embarrassed
about dating someone?

382
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:22,151
You're overreacting a bit.

383
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:24,121
One might think you're
dating a celebrity.

384
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:27,292
- Really?
- Is that so?

385
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:33,262
Tell me who it is. Are
you seeing someone?

386
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,861
- That's not the case.
- Then what's he on about?

387
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:37,371
Darn it.

388
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:41,972
This is why I told you to tell
her how you feel, you moron.

389
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,341
Gosh.

390
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,381
What am I going to do with you?

391
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:51,851
- Don't you think?
- Totally.

392
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:52,951
Hey!

393
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,722
Go back to your seats.

394
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:57,691
Let's go, guys.

395
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:08,101
Should we go to
Prince Comics later?

396
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:11,072
Sure. Let's have
ramyeon with eggs.

397
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:13,772
That reminds me.
Send me the photo.

398
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:15,272
What photo?

399
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,441
The one we took
together on the boat.

400
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,252
BOYFRIEND

401
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:27,322
AHN HYUN KYU

402
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:39,931
Aren't you going
to send it to me?

403
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,962
AHN HYUN KYU

404
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,171
Ahn Hyun Kyu?

405
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:50,141
Darn it. Why him of all people?

406
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:02,951
- Bring it on.
- You first.

407
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,351
AHN HYUN KYU

408
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:06,151
He hasn't seen it yet.

409
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:10,262
That's right. All I
need to do is delete it.

410
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:12,292
I can do this.

411
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:13,732
Shall we go again?

412
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:14,802
Nice!

413
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:16,232
- Move forward.
- Come on.

414
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:25,671
Lim Ju Kyung!

415
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:29,111
- Sorry about that.
- Good job.

416
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:30,441
Okay!

417
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:32,111
But that's not fair.

418
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:34,482
- What's done is done.
- Hold on.

419
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:36,522
- Seriously?
- That's not fair.

420
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:44,832
ENTER PIN NUMBER OR
SCAN FINGERPRINT.

421
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,832
PRESS DOWN LONGER.

422
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:50,671
All right. It's time
for Korean history!

423
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,302
Okay. Please take your seats.

424
00:29:56,302 --> 00:30:00,242
Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592.
How can one memorize the year?

425
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:02,542
I need to delete the photo...

426
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,582
before he figures out
his phone is missing.

427
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,911
Wouldn't that be a clever way?

428
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,881
His fingerprint.
His fingerprint...

429
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:10,621
How do I get his fingerprint?

430
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,252
The politics of the
early Joseon Dynasty...

431
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:16,262
Is Soo Ah currently learning
the science behind sleep?

432
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:17,532
She's completely out of it.

433
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,591
- How adorable.
- 1592.

434
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:21,962
That's it. I'll get
it while he naps.

435
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:23,931
Anyway, focus.

436
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,201
Go to sleep.

437
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:28,171
Get sleeping like a baby.

438
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:31,641
Why are you being
a book worm today?

439
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,671
Go to sleep!

440
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,651
What on earth?

441
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,962
Go to sleep. Sleep
will come and find you.

442
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:55,832
In the 15th and
16th centuries...

443
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:57,732
- You're now sleepy.
- Early Joseon Dynasty...

444
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:02,302
Go to sleep.

445
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,012
Red sun!

446
00:31:06,812 --> 00:31:09,712
Make sure to revise what I
pointed out as important.

447
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:10,881
Nice!

448
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,512
I'll see you in our next class.

449
00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:30,562
AHN HYUN KYU

450
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:32,332
Wait. Why do you have my phone?

451
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:33,572
Why do you have my phone...

452
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:35,371
What's this about?

453
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:36,802
AHN HYUN KYU

454
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:40,072
Oh, it's nothing.

455
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:43,742
Sorry about that.

456
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:49,022
What's with her today?

457
00:31:59,691 --> 00:32:01,701
If Ahn Hyun Kyu had found out,

458
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,631
the news would've spread
across our school...

459
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,232
and the one nearby
in a matter of hours.

460
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:09,802
You must be terrified of
being dragged to the rooftop.

461
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,171
That's not the only reason.

462
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:17,082
Once kids find out, they'll
only say nasty things...

463
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:21,082
about why you're
dating someone like me.

464
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,052
And how are you exactly?

465
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:26,691
You know.

466
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:31,462
I'm not pretty, and I
don't get good grades.

467
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,802
You're way out of my league.

468
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,431
You're not.

469
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:41,671
I like you just the way you are.

470
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,411
So don't say things like that.

471
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:03,691
This is our secret place
safe from the kids at school.

472
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:05,691
Why don't we always
come here for our dates?

473
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:06,992
Sure.

474
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:13,172
PRINCE COMICS

475
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:19,712
What... Why?

476
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:23,442
PRINCE COMICS

477
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,382
Look who it is?

478
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,681
- Go Woon, is that you?
- Ju Kyung!

479
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,862
PRINCE COMICS

480
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:37,462
PRINCE COMICS

481
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:40,062
This place is also a no-go.

482
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,261
I'll call you later.

483
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:48,272
PRINCE COMICS

484
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:51,141
- Have a good night, then.
- Sure.

485
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:11,192
It seems too young for
him, don't you think?

486
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:12,261
Maybe I should exchange
it for another.

487
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:15,601
They all look the same to me.

488
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:20,172
Could you please stand up?

489
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:21,241
How...

490
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:22,971
Stand up.

491
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,181
Do you know her?

492
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:31,781
Who is she?

493
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:34,382
I'm Lim Hee Kyung.

494
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:35,522
Who may you be?

495
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:39,792
- I'm Lee Ye Rim.
- That's right.

496
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:42,292
I'm his colleague.
For now, at least.

497
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:44,092
Will that change in the future?

498
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:47,801
I didn't know that work colleagues
were so intimate these days.

499
00:34:48,132 --> 00:34:51,101
You're close enough to help
him tie that around his neck.

500
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:53,301
That's not it.

501
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,712
- This is a misunderstanding...
- Then, who may you be to him?

502
00:34:57,712 --> 00:34:59,172
- She's...
- I'm his lover.

503
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:01,011
- What?
- Sorry?

504
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:04,712
We're dating.

505
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,482
- My hearing has been poor...
- We're dating!

506
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:13,522
- I didn't quite get that.
- We should talk outside.

507
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:17,462
We're dating. This man is mine.

508
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:18,732
Did you still not get that?

509
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,592
Why you...

510
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,161
My gosh. You must be
Mr. Han's girlfriend.

511
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:25,902
It's good to see you.

512
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:28,442
I'm sorry,

513
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,442
but I should get going.

514
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,641
Why?

515
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:33,272
I'm sorry too. Excuse me.

516
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,411
What's going on?

517
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,152
Joon Woo.

518
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:46,792
But...

519
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:56,632
DESIRED CAREER

520
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,571
HANGUK UNIVERSITY,
SCHOOL OF MAKEUP

521
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:11,511
Seriously. Why has she
been sleeping all day?

522
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,752
She stayed up late looking
for a part-time job.

523
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,821
What? A part-time job?

524
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,752
Gosh, she must be tired.

525
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:31,371
You dropped this.

526
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,511
Soo, want to go to
the cafeteria first?

527
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:44,882
Soo?

528
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,792
That's the spirit.

529
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:00,161
So the boys...

530
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,701
Isn't that Soo Ho's?
Then I'll get it to him.

531
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,832
Have you seen Ju Kyung?

532
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:06,902
Ju Kyung asked me
to get this to you.

533
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,301
She asked you?

534
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:20,731
RESUME

535
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,588
- Haven't you ever worked before?
- No.

536
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:25,418
I want to hire someone
with experience.

537
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:27,659
If you teach me, I
promise I'll work hard.

538
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:30,128
Lots of people are
willing to work hard.

539
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,758
But I need someone who
knows what to do. Sorry.

540
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,128
Got it.

541
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:39,438
I'm sorry. We already hired.

542
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,708
Finding a part-time
job isn't easy.

543
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:49,008
BOYFRIEND

544
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:55,019
The receiver cannot be reached.

545
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:56,588
Is he busy?

546
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:11,239
You pervert! You pervert!

547
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,469
What's your problem?

548
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:18,778
- Seo Jun?
- What are you doing in here?

549
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:20,679
That's what I should
be asking you.

550
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:23,179
Why are you taking your clothes
off in the ladies' room?

551
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,659
You look like a model.

552
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,228
Are you doing a
photo shoot today?

553
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,628
Yes. See you.

554
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:45,099
What? Really?

555
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:46,639
Seo Jun.

556
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,478
A million dollars?

557
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,208
Mr. Lee made a
really big donation.

558
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,918
So the hospital director
called the press...

559
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:01,749
and gave him an
appreciation plaque.

560
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,588
People might think Lee
Joo Hun was the one...

561
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:06,418
who established the cancer
center at our hospital.

562
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,059
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

563
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:14,798
Don't be sorry. I was
the one who called.

564
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,969
Soo Ho, long time no see.

565
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:19,599
Hello.

566
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:24,309
Okay, you're doing great.
Fantastic. Turn around. Good.

567
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,739
I want you to look cool.
Look cool for me. 1, 2.

568
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,148
Show me your best
pose. 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2.

569
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,179
Okay, that looks great. Seo
Jun, give me a smile. 1, 2.

570
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:35,989
Look down here. Over here. Okay.

571
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:38,918
1, 2, 3, 2. Okay.
Let's keep that pose.

572
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,989
1, 2. Okay.

573
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:42,188
You came out great.

574
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:45,228
Seo Jun, go get changed.
You did an excellent job.

575
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,398
What are you still doing here?

576
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:51,398
It looked so cool, so
I stayed and watched.

577
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:53,969
Wait a minute. Are you
Seo Jun's girlfriend?

578
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:56,608
- No, she's not.
- Hello.

579
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,639
Why didn't you tell me you
had such a pretty friend?

580
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,079
She's not pretty.

581
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,309
Get out of here.

582
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:04,849
- Fine.
- Wait. Wait.

583
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,679
Why are you kicking her out?

584
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:10,449
Are you Seo Jun's friend?

585
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:12,918
How would you like
to do a shoot today?

586
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:17,929
The female model didn't show up,
so I'm kind of in a pickle here.

587
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:20,528
- Me?
- Hey.

588
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,969
Not everyone can be a model.

589
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,099
Hey, just leave already.

590
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:29,568
We need to update the
newly released product,

591
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:30,838
so it's kind of urgent.

592
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,639
What do you say?
Are you interested?

593
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,679
I've never tried this before.

594
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,749
That's why you can
do even better.

595
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,849
And I'll pay you more since
you're Seo Jun's friend.

596
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:43,688
You're going to pay me?
Then I'll give it a try.

597
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,358
- Hey.
- Deal.

598
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,088
I heard you guys are in
the same class this year.

599
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:53,898
Soo Jin, please take good care
of Soo Ho for me at school.

600
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:57,398
I want him to move in with
me, but he keeps refusing.

601
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,298
We don't live together, so it's
hard for me to take care of him.

602
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,508
- Okay, I will.
- No one needs to take care of me.

603
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:05,239
Don't worry.

604
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,548
I have to say, Soo Ho
looks more like you...

605
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:10,409
as he starts to grow older.

606
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:12,278
Why don't you let him
debut as a celebrity?

607
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:14,648
His grades are too good
for him to be a celebrity.

608
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:18,389
- I guess you're right.
- I'm willing to support him with...

609
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:20,258
whatever he wants to do.

610
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:23,028
That's because you know he'll
get good grades no matter what.

611
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:25,958
Soo Jin's different. She
needs someone to pressure her.

612
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,798
Otherwise, her grades
will hit rock bottom.

613
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,369
Women aren't as persistent
and competitive...

614
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,699
as men.

615
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:35,309
That's why she's never able
to beat Soo Ho's grades.

616
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,539
I know some people are
just born smart but...

617
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,878
We have to go study.

618
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:45,219
- You're leaving already?
- Excuse us.

619
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:47,949
Let's go.

620
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:51,389
Goodbye.

621
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:52,789
Oh, okay.

622
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:58,028
That's a bit awkward.
No, don't do that.

623
00:41:58,028 --> 00:42:01,829
Don't point at that. Let's
just keep it natural. 1, 2.

624
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:03,469
That's not good either.

625
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:05,568
- Try being natural.
- How about this?

626
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:07,168
That's really bad. 1, 2.

627
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:08,969
- No, no. Don't do that.
- Hey.

628
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,438
Are you seriously going to
let her keep doing this?

629
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,749
I'm not used to doing
this. I'm really sorry.

630
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,849
It's normal to be awkward at first.
He was no different. Right, Seo Jun?

631
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:21,489
Seo Jun, why don't you
try being more friendly?

632
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:25,088
Pose like you guys are really
close friends. Let's do this.

633
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,059
1, 2, 3. That's it.

634
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,889
Put your arms around his
shoulder. Great. Seo Jun, smile.

635
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:32,528
Seo Jun, you just need to
smile. Come on, Seo Jun.

636
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:35,199
Seo Jun, why are you
acting like an amateur?

637
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,999
You've done couple
shoots before.

638
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,599
Then just call it a day.

639
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:41,269
You must be irritated
because you're hungry.

640
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:43,539
I'll buy you something delicious.
Let's take a 10-minute break.

641
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,639
- Let's take a break for 10 minutes.
- Okay.

642
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,378
I'm really bad, aren't I?

643
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:52,778
No, you're horrible.

644
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,918
So tell him you can't
do it and just leave.

645
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,219
Why are you being so mean?

646
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:00,059
Can't you just teach me?

647
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:02,429
- No.
- My gosh.

648
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,099
It's really hot in here
because of all the lights.

649
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,099
- What are you doing?
- What?

650
00:43:13,398 --> 00:43:15,469
This is new, so I don't
want it to get dirty.

651
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,708
- Gosh, it's so hot.
- My gosh.

652
00:43:22,548 --> 00:43:23,778
Look at all this sweat.

653
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:31,088
Do you want me to wipe
off your sweat too?

654
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:38,599
- What are you doing?
- You look a little sweaty.

655
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:41,869
Forget it. Go away.

656
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:44,298
Why? It's so you'll
look nice in the photos.

657
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:47,398
I said stop.

658
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:51,978
Is this that easy for you?

659
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:54,679
What do you mean?

660
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,418
I'm a man too.

661
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,429
Of course, you're a
man. You're not a woman.

662
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:17,798
What am I seeing? Now that's
what I'm talking about.

663
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:20,068
Great, you guys. Let's do
the shoot. Look over here.

664
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:22,508
Just stay right
there. 1, 2. Okay.

665
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,208
I want to make this
quick, so just cooperate.

666
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,978
You're just reading.

667
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:09,918
Didn't you tell them we
need to study as an excuse?

668
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,418
No.

669
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,758
Thank you though. I almost
got an upset stomach.

670
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:18,329
By the way, are you not going
to move in with your dad?

671
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,528
He seems to want
to live with you.

672
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:23,699
We lived apart most of our
lives. It'll only be awkward.

673
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:25,838
I like it better now.

674
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,008
I wonder what's wrong
with both our dads.

675
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:32,438
By any chance, did anything
happen again after that day?

676
00:45:33,278 --> 00:45:35,809
- Did he hit you again or...
- No, nothing happened.

677
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:38,619
Nothing much will happen
until I get my report card.

678
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,889
But what's gotten into you?
I'm surprised you're worried.

679
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:45,159
- What do you mean?
- You're a lot more talkative...

680
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,958
- and humane these days.
- Don't be absurd.

681
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,929
MISSED CALL, LIM JU KYUNG

682
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:56,028
I didn't know she called.

683
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:03,309
I was able to work part-time
thanks to you, so this is on me.

684
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:05,039
Why do you want
to work part-time?

685
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,608
So I can go to a makeup academy.

686
00:46:06,778 --> 00:46:07,878
"A makeup academy"?

687
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:09,708
I was thinking about what to
write on the desired career form.

688
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:12,918
I thought about what I
enjoyed doing the most.

689
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,989
And putting makeup on was
what popped into my head.

690
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:17,418
That day, when I put
makeup on for Go Woon,

691
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:18,889
it made my heart race.

692
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:22,688
You did transform my sister
into a different person.

693
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:23,989
- Here you are.
- It's here.

694
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,909
You've had lots of
girlfriends, right?

695
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:40,708
Why do you ask?

696
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,349
What do you save them
as on your phone?

697
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,019
Do guys not care about
things like that?

698
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:47,619
We do care.

699
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:50,789
When I get a girlfriend, I save
them as something mad sweet,

700
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:53,159
like "my love, my baby, princess",
things like that. With hearts too.

701
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:56,228
I see.

702
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:00,059
That's right. Remember what I
told you on the school trip?

703
00:47:00,228 --> 00:47:02,469
I don't want to hear
it, so don't say it.

704
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:03,728
I'm going out with Soo Ho.

705
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:06,769
You never listen. I
said not to tell me.

706
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:08,409
I don't want to either.

707
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,008
But I bawled my eyes out in
front of you about liking him.

708
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,179
How could I not tell you?

709
00:47:12,278 --> 00:47:13,608
I won't congratulate you.

710
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:18,208
You're eating well. Should
I get another order?

711
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,378
Forget it!

712
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:22,519
The others don't seem to know.

713
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,119
- It this a secret too?
- Yes.

714
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:27,088
We need to keep it
a secret for now.

715
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,458
Did Soo Ho agree?

716
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,128
Why?

717
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:34,358
If I had a girlfriend, I'd
want to brag about her...

718
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:35,869
and tell everyone.

719
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:38,668
That's how I'd feel.

720
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:43,469
Duck.

721
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:44,969
Is this really necessary?

722
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,039
I wonder if he was hurt.

723
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:53,219
- Is it too spicy?
- No!

724
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:55,789
It's perfect. It's
exactly how I like it.

725
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:58,019
Are you going home?

726
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:00,958
Hey. They're from
our middle school.

727
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:03,728
You're right.

728
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:09,369
You look like you grew taller.

729
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:12,338
You used to be shorter than I
was and got beat up all the time.

730
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:13,398
When did you get so big?

731
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:15,438
Are you still talking
about kindergarten?

732
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:25,219
Get home safely.

733
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:26,378
Okay. Thanks.

734
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:34,918
That was delicious.

735
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:36,958
- I'll take you home...
- Hello?

736
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:38,458
See you tomorrow.

737
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:41,028
We kept playing phone tag.

738
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,269
My stomach hurts.

739
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:47,199
Why were you eating so much
spicy food that you can't handle?

740
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:49,969
Eat.

741
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:52,739
There.

742
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:02,548
What did you do today?

743
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:05,088
I went for job interviews, but
I was rejected by them all.

744
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,059
But I made money for
the first time today.

745
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:17,869
- I ran into Seo Jun, and...
- Sir?

746
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:20,438
Soo Ho?

747
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,739
"Sir"?

748
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:25,679
Who?

749
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:28,749
Your father...

750
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:30,849
LIM JU KYUNG

751
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:31,978
No.

752
00:49:31,978 --> 00:49:33,579
LIM JU KYUNG

753
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,978
No. You can't...

754
00:49:38,418 --> 00:49:41,119
How could they scam the
victims of a con artist?

755
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:43,528
They said let's go
together to catch the jerk,

756
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:46,858
then they took off with the
money for our flights and hotels.

757
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:49,999
They're intelligent
and meticulous.

758
00:49:51,398 --> 00:49:53,599
Sounds like you fell for
a very amateur scheme.

759
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,099
It was not.

760
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:56,568
Anyway,

761
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:01,108
I swore I wouldn't go home
until I found that jerk.

762
00:50:01,108 --> 00:50:02,349
So how can I go home?

763
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:06,019
So you can't tell
Ju Kyung, okay?

764
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:08,789
But she'll worry.

765
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,148
- I should call her now...
- No! You can't.

766
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:12,858
If you tell her now,

767
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:15,258
I'll run away and
never come back.

768
00:50:15,258 --> 00:50:16,458
What do you plan to do then?

769
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:18,499
You said you were out of money.

770
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,869
I'll sleep on this
freezing cold floor...

771
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:26,199
and freeze to death
before I go home.

772
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,708
Not to my home, at least.

773
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,369
- Okay, sir.
- What?

774
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:33,438
Good night, then.

775
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:35,349
- But...
- Goodbye.

776
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:37,108
Hey, Soo Ho. Wait.

777
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:42,318
- You're name is Soo Ho, right?
- Yes, it is.

778
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:46,219
Hey. Your name means "guardian".
You should protect me.

779
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:54,528
You live in this huge
place by yourself?

780
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:56,969
I guess Lee Joo
Hun is very busy.

781
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:58,228
You can wash up in here.

782
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,648
Soo Ho!

783
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:17,889
Are you okay?

784
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,719
I think I threw out
my back. I can't move.

785
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:22,159
Help me up.

786
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:31,898
Sleep here. I'll
sleep on the couch.

787
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:33,869
I can't do that.

788
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:36,239
How could I do this to
my daughter's friend?

789
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:38,208
I'll sleep outside.

790
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,539
Pretend I'm not
here and sleep here.

791
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:42,679
Good night.

792
00:51:43,778 --> 00:51:45,648
Soo Ho. Thanks.

793
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:47,278
Thanks, Soo Ho.

794
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:52,458
The house is a
pigsty without Dad.

795
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,728
While you're at it,
clean my room too.

796
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:59,298
- I should get rid of you first.
- Gross!

797
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:00,958
Give it rest, will you?

798
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:04,728
I'll clean, so come
have some fruit.

799
00:52:05,128 --> 00:52:07,269
It's okay. You must
be tired from working.

800
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:08,568
I'm almost done.

801
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:11,769
In the vast plain.

802
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:14,008
A flower bloomed.

803
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:18,508
All by itself.

804
00:52:18,508 --> 00:52:20,778
And in my heart.

805
00:52:20,778 --> 00:52:25,119
Guarded the feeling
of emptiness.

806
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,489
Deep within my heart.

807
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:29,628
Just as after.

808
00:52:29,628 --> 00:52:31,999
Strong winds pass.

809
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:36,298
- The sun shines brightly above
- And in my heart.

810
00:52:37,398 --> 00:52:39,769
- Guarded the feeling...
- Hey, hey, hey!

811
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:41,699
Don't sing that song.

812
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:43,108
- Don't sing it!
- What?

813
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:47,608
What's his problem?

814
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:51,949
I hope your dad isn't starving.

815
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:54,579
I'm sure he's eating
and sleeping well.

816
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:57,648
The first half of the
fierce match has ended...

817
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:02,059
with a missed goal chance
eight minutes into the game.

818
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,588
Sir?

819
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:07,528
My gosh. Hey. You're up. Sorry.

820
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:10,269
What are you doing in
the middle of the night?

821
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:13,068
Son Heung Min is playing.

822
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:16,039
That's right. I
had set my alarm.

823
00:53:17,438 --> 00:53:18,838
Are you Heung Min's fan?

824
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:20,639
Want to watch the
second half together?

825
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:21,878
Sir.

826
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:24,148
After I watch the highlights
for the first half.

827
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:33,059
He should've shot the
ball right at this moment.

828
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:36,128
Have some.

829
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:39,128
I don't eat at this hour.

830
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:41,258
It's different when you
eat while watching soccer.

831
00:53:41,258 --> 00:53:43,168
You'll regret not eating
it. Go on. Try some.

832
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:45,668
I'll feed myself.

833
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:47,298
Okay.

834
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:51,068
- It's so good.
- He's just like Ju Kyung.

835
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,108
It looks so good.

836
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,148
Hot. It's so hot.

837
00:53:57,278 --> 00:53:58,349
Hot.

838
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:00,418
- I burned my tongue.
- Here.

839
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:02,548
You should eat slowly.

840
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:04,289
They should play
more aggressively.

841
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:07,489
- You're surprisingly sweet.
- Son Heung Min's kick-off...

842
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:09,228
- starts the second half.
- Son Heung Min.

843
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,699
Who will win the ticket
to the championship?

844
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:17,728
They're taking the ball to the
goal to even out the score.

845
00:54:17,728 --> 00:54:19,068
And an early cross...

846
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:21,338
- Darn it.
- And he misses.

847
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:22,708
And Son Heung Min takes it!

848
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,909
He is dribbling toward the
goal and he shoots! Goal!

849
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:27,679
Son Heung Min!

850
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,309
Yes!

851
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,809
Soo Ho! Soo Ho.

852
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:39,418
You hardly had breakfast.
Drink this on the way.

853
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,048
Study hard and have fun
at school. See you later.

854
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:45,119
Correction. I'll be gone.

855
00:55:46,088 --> 00:55:48,489
- Thanks for last night.
- You'll go home, right?

856
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:50,758
I'll keep your secret
only until today.

857
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:52,958
Okay. I'll go after
I do the dishes.

858
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:55,298
I needed time to prepare myself.

859
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,369
To prepare to get
beat up by my wifey.

860
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:04,409
Gosh. That young kid is
all grown up like an adult.

861
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:07,179
Is it because he lived
alone without a mom?

862
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,949
Watch out for cars.

863
00:56:12,418 --> 00:56:13,818
- Have a nice day.
- I'll get going now.

864
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:17,418
Okay. Let's go.

865
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:20,219
- What's for PE today?
- Soccer!

866
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:22,458
Really? Sounds like fun.

867
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:49,188
What's with you? Where's
your sense of direction?

868
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:51,619
- What do you mean?
- Why do you keep...

869
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:53,219
popping up in my head?

870
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:58,289
Fine. I'll give you the
chance to keep doing so.

871
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:05,168
Let's go out. You and me.

872
00:57:08,568 --> 00:57:12,409
Why? Are you touched to the
point that you're lost for words?

873
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,978
You're super boring.

874
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,019
Super boring?

875
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:24,088
Here. The cafe I worked
at is looking to hire.

876
00:57:24,389 --> 00:57:25,719
I called in advance,
so swing by later.

877
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,489
My gosh. You managed
this in one day?

878
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:31,188
Thank you so much.

879
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:32,999
Han Seo Jun, you have a gift.

880
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:35,228
This is definitely
worth a compliment.

881
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:38,028
You're the best. Thanks.

882
00:57:38,528 --> 00:57:40,298
- Ju Kyung.
- Yes?

883
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:46,338
Let's go.

884
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,818
Memorize the items on the
menu as soon as possible.

885
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,258
The recipes are
all written down,

886
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:05,659
but stick to taking orders
and washing dishes...

887
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:06,798
until you get used
to the work here.

888
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,628
- Got it.
- Welcome.

889
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,499
I forgot to wash the cups.

890
00:58:11,028 --> 00:58:13,499
- Could you start with those?
- Sure thing.

891
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,108
- May I take your order?
- What should we have?

892
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:38,889
My gosh. Are you all right?

893
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:41,628
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Oh, dear.

894
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:45,628
These are the photos I'll post.
They came out great, didn't they?

895
00:58:45,628 --> 00:58:47,568
THESE ARE THE PHOTOS I'LL POST.
THEY CAME OUT GREAT, DIDN'T THEY?

896
00:58:58,648 --> 00:58:59,918
Why send me these too?

897
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:02,278
What a waste of space.

898
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:04,588
DELETE IMAGE?

899
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:11,458
DELETE IMAGE?

900
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,028
COFFEESHOP OWNER

901
00:59:14,128 --> 00:59:15,258
Yes, ma'am.

902
00:59:16,668 --> 00:59:18,199
Ju Kyung took the job?

903
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:21,568
Yes. Thanks for introducing her.

904
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:24,239
She's currently
learning the ropes.

905
00:59:27,508 --> 00:59:28,809
Ju Kyung, are you hurt?

906
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:30,978
What? She's hurt?

907
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:34,619
It's a minor contact
burn. Honestly, I'm fine.

908
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,289
Thank you.

909
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:49,329
- Seo Jun?
- Where's Ju Kyung?

910
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:52,269
- She left earlier.
- What?

911
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:54,039
Did you run over here?

912
00:59:55,499 --> 00:59:56,969
I must be going insane.

913
00:59:57,809 --> 00:59:59,508
Why did I run over here?

914
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,978
Where did you buy
that eyelash curler?

915
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,389
What a jerk. I can't
believe he didn't apologize.

916
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:11,148
Are you okay?

917
01:00:19,228 --> 01:00:20,298
Han Seo Jun?

918
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:29,909
Hee Kyung's running late.
What about Ju Young?

919
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:32,108
Ju Young? He's with
his math tutor.

920
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,778
What? You got him
a private tutor?

921
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:38,008
He wanted extra classes
to get better grades.

922
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:39,978
I thought you barely
had enough money.

923
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:43,389
Things are tight with the
salon having fewer customers.

924
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,418
How can I not give my
child what he needs though?

925
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,088
Tell me if you want
extra math classes too.

926
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:51,188
I'll take out a
loan to pay for it.

927
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:53,829
Give me 1,500 dollars then.

928
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:56,298
1,500 dollars?

929
01:00:56,298 --> 01:00:57,599
Whatever.

930
01:00:58,628 --> 01:01:00,499
I'm the only one who looks
out for you, you know.

931
01:01:00,499 --> 01:01:01,999
Have Ju Young do this instead!

932
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:04,208
Ju Kyung, where do you
think you're going?

933
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:10,778
Yes. How was the part-time job?

934
01:01:11,249 --> 01:01:12,719
I barely managed.

935
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:16,519
I'll work harder to
do better though.

936
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:18,519
You sound disheartened.

937
01:01:19,188 --> 01:01:21,119
- Are you outside?
- Yes.

938
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,989
I needed some fresh air.

939
01:01:24,528 --> 01:01:25,588
Then how about you come over?

940
01:01:29,028 --> 01:01:31,469
Working out makes
me feel better.

941
01:01:31,469 --> 01:01:33,838
Really? So how is it done?

942
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:35,539
Grab my collar.

943
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:40,409
I'll grab your sleeve,
and here, and then...

944
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,148
Hey. What the...

945
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:45,679
Gosh.

946
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:47,818
Take that.

947
01:01:52,818 --> 01:01:55,789
Good job. Now use the skills
I taught you to flip me over.

948
01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:57,228
How could I possibly do that?

949
01:01:57,228 --> 01:01:59,699
Manage to do so, and
I'll grant you a wish.

950
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:02,728
- Really? You'd better not be lying.
- Why would I lie?

951
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:03,898
Nice.

952
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:30,528
Get over here.

953
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:35,969
Nice. I flipped you over!

954
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:39,398
- But you cheated.
- But also a beginner.

955
01:02:39,499 --> 01:02:40,639
Fine, you win.

956
01:02:41,068 --> 01:02:42,608
- So what's your wish?
- My wish?

957
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:46,208
You can ask me to pay...

958
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,539
- for your makeup classes.
- What?

959
01:02:47,978 --> 01:02:49,608
But they're expensive.

960
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:50,648
Still.

961
01:02:51,148 --> 01:02:52,719
Are you showing off your wealth?

962
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:55,519
- Just tell me what you want.
- You think you're so cool.

963
01:02:55,749 --> 01:02:57,188
Forget it though.

964
01:02:59,858 --> 01:03:01,059
I know what I want.

965
01:03:01,918 --> 01:03:03,228
What is it?

966
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:05,329
Well...

967
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,559
It's kind of
embarrassing to say.

968
01:03:20,778 --> 01:03:24,108
You know what? Just forget about
it. I'll go and get changed.

969
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:46,298
LEE SOO HO

970
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:53,608
The person you have
reached is not available.

971
01:03:59,478 --> 01:04:00,679
Why did he just text me?

972
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:04,418
BOYFRIEND

973
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:06,519
GIRLFRIEND

974
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:13,599
I changed your name on
my phone to "Boyfriend".

975
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:26,309
It must've rained earlier.

976
01:04:27,338 --> 01:04:28,478
Seems like it.

977
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,349
Neither of us has umbrellas,
so I'm glad it stopped.

978
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:33,278
Lucky us, right?

979
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:50,599
- Are you okay?
- Lucky, my foot.

980
01:05:10,648 --> 01:05:11,688
What's wrong?

981
01:05:12,148 --> 01:05:13,188
What?

982
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:14,358
Aren't you coming?

983
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:16,688
Right...

984
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:31,608
Hold on. I'll get
you some dry clothes.

985
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:33,409
Right.

986
01:05:47,588 --> 01:05:48,818
- Should we eat...
- Should we watch TV?

987
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:50,958
- Let's eat.
- Want to watch TV?

988
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:54,298
Let's eat. You haven't
had dinner yet, right?

989
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,869
Let me make you something...
Why don't we just order in?

990
01:05:57,929 --> 01:06:00,898
Sure thing. I'm up for anything.

991
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,599
- How does pizza sound?
- Good.

992
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:29,729
What's this?

993
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:31,929
What's in this room?

994
01:06:32,528 --> 01:06:35,099
- What?
- It's locked.

995
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:37,139
Are you hiding
something in here?

996
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,168
No.

997
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:40,609
Do you keep dead bodies in here
like those killers do in movies?

998
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:46,649
Do you want to see inside?

999
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:48,849
Correct passcode.

1000
01:06:59,998 --> 01:07:01,299
You play music?

1001
01:07:03,168 --> 01:07:04,269
I wanted to.

1002
01:07:05,528 --> 01:07:06,668
What about now?

1003
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:10,868
After what happened to Se Yeon,

1004
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,179
I couldn't bring
myself to do it again.

1005
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:17,549
Se Yeon was the one who
taught me how to write songs.

1006
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:24,248
It was hard for me to
look at this photo,

1007
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:27,059
so I rarely came into this room.

1008
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:30,288
I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have asked.

1009
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:31,988
But I feel okay now.

1010
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:35,328
Maybe it's because I'm with you.

1011
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:42,299
Should we tell our friends
that we're a couple?

1012
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:44,568
Why all of a sudden? You
wanted to keep it a secret.

1013
01:07:44,568 --> 01:07:48,208
I feel bad for not even
discussing it with you.

1014
01:07:48,538 --> 01:07:51,479
- What if the bullies pick on you?
- Just let them pick on me.

1015
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:54,318
I don't mind what we do.

1016
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:57,988
The fact that you're my girlfriend
will always stay the same.

1017
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:05,458
Remember that song you
played for me last time?

1018
01:08:06,189 --> 01:08:08,128
The song that
never got released.

1019
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:10,628
Did you compose it?

1020
01:08:11,668 --> 01:08:12,729
Yes.

1021
01:08:13,668 --> 01:08:14,769
Se Yeon...

1022
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:18,538
wrote the lyrics.

1023
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:20,538
I see.

1024
01:08:21,979 --> 01:08:23,748
It was a really nice song.

1025
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:31,189
Should I play it for you?

1026
01:08:32,248 --> 01:08:33,359
Yes.

1027
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:39,389
I quit playing the piano
after Beyer number one.

1028
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:41,399
I haven't played
in a while either.

1029
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:43,568
So don't expect too much.

1030
01:09:09,889 --> 01:09:11,828
It came from outside the window.

1031
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:22,538
Do you think it's going to
rain? Why do I hear the thunder?

1032
01:09:22,538 --> 01:09:23,639
I wonder what's wrong.

1033
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:35,349
This piano sounds great. I
bet it's really expensive.

1034
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:43,488
I'll go bring the food.

1035
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:46,498
Just wait a little bit.

1036
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,368
My gosh, seriously.

1037
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:55,799
Thank you. Enjoy.

1038
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:57,139
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1039
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:16,118
I wanted to clean
the place for him,

1040
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:18,288
but his house is super clean.

1041
01:10:18,788 --> 01:10:20,729
There's nothing to clean.

1042
01:10:22,328 --> 01:10:24,969
Why does a student keep
alcohol in his house?

1043
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:27,969
Gosh, this is expensive stuff.

1044
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,939
This might've gone bad.

1045
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:37,609
I should taste it just in case.

1046
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:41,748
Soo Ho, let me
just have a taste.

1047
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:43,889
Just a little so it won't show.

1048
01:11:26,389 --> 01:11:27,628
Do you want to eat this
while watching a movie?

1049
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:34,738
It smells delicious.

1050
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:37,238
- What should we watch?
- I don't know.

1051
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:38,738
How about a horror film?

1052
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,439
- No, something else.
- Why? Don't you like horror?

1053
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:46,849
No, it rained, so why don't we
watch a movie related to music?

1054
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:50,488
Gosh, you love horror comic books,
but you can't watch horror films?

1055
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:52,149
I'm just not interested...

1056
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:53,859
because I already read
horror comic books every day.

1057
01:11:54,318 --> 01:11:57,128
It's okay. If it gets scary,
I'll cover your eyes for you.

1058
01:11:57,128 --> 01:11:58,288
I don't get that scared.

1059
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,859
Turn the lights off. That's
how you watch horror films.

1060
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,198
How about something else?

1061
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:04,168
- I can't believe I'm here...
- Let me choose.

1062
01:12:04,168 --> 01:12:05,769
when he's on a date
with his girlfriend.

1063
01:12:11,738 --> 01:12:13,168
- Here.
- Thanks.

1064
01:12:48,738 --> 01:12:50,908
Soo Ho is a real man.

1065
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:00,759
I guess you really don't
watch horror films.

1066
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:03,059
Ghosts don't show up in
these kinds of scenes.

1067
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:13,868
You said there
won't be any ghosts.

1068
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:12,059
Dad?

1069
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,229
TRUE BEAUTY

1070
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:55,269
<i>- I miss you.
- Me too.</i>

1071
01:14:55,998 --> 01:14:59,038
<i>When did you guys start
dating? Why didn't you tell me?</i>

1072
01:14:59,269 --> 01:15:00,578
<i>Is that me and Seo Jun?</i>

1073
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,748
<i>Ju Kyung, should I give
him this and ask him out?</i>

1074
01:15:05,049 --> 01:15:08,318
<i>Have you ever liked the same
girl that your friend likes?</i>

1075
01:15:08,318 --> 01:15:09,318
<i>No.</i>

1076
01:15:09,519 --> 01:15:10,849
<i>Why are you guys
coming here together?</i>

1077
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:13,248
<i>When a boyfriend comes over,</i>

1078
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:15,559
<i>don't girls normally show their
boyfriends their photo album?</i>

1079
01:15:16,618 --> 01:15:18,458
<i>I don't like seeing
you talking to him...</i>

1080
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:19,958
<i>or even looking at him.</i>

1081
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:21,698
<i>- Then I can't keep dating you.
- Soo Ho!</i>
