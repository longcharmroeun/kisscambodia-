<b><font color="#0000ff">Episode 9</font></b>
I don't like Kang Su Jin.

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,010
The person I like...

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,840
It's you.

5
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,130
Im Ju Gyeong!

6
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,110
Why are you running away?

7
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,620
I don't know. Without meaning to...

8
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,900
But... it's really me?

9
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,090
Yeah. It's you.

10
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,070
No way.

11
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,440
You...! You're joking around, aren't you? Is this a prank?

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Are they hiding behind? Or are you liking me out of pity?

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,570
- If it's not that, then is this a dream?
- It's not like that.

14
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,080
Then...

15
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,920
You really...

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,960
Can't I like you?

17
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,140
What to do...?

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm really nervous right now, so I can't speak well...

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,330
I'm also nervous.

20
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,890
I was originally supposed to tell you while giving you this.

21
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,610
See. The order is all wrong.

22
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,680
What do you think about me?

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,100
It must mean I like you! I like you. I like you a lot.

24
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,410
I even dream about you, and there are times where I think about you all day!

25
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,930
I'm usually really lazy, but these days I wake up before my alarm.

26
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,580
Because I want to go to school quickly to meet you. And then when I meet you, my heart—

27
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,390
Anyway...

28
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm saying my response is that.

29
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,720
Im Ju Gyeong.

30
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,050
I still can't believe this.

31
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,190
It's not a dream, right?

32
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,690
It hurts!

33
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,810
Su Jin!

34
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,690
Who is it?

35
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,980
Who do you think? It's Ju Gyeong!

36
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,880
 Oh, right. I'm barefaced, aren't I?

37
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,230
It's cold.

38
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,580
But why do you have to go that far to hide this?

39
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,420
Before, to the kids that bullied me...

40
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,620
I asked them.

41
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,150
Why they hated me so much.

42
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,670
 Because you're ugly.

43
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,510
They said it's because I'm ugly.

44
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,260
They don't like my face. Just cause.

45
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,930
But after I put on makeup,

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,530
the looks that I get from people are different.

47
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,210
They talk to me first.

48
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,060
And I made friends quickly.

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,260
That's when I thought of it.

50
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:16,530
That I should never take off this mask.

51
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,820
It was probably hard for you too.

52
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,970
Anxious in case you got caught.

53
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,650
If they know my bare face...

54
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,470
I'm scared they'll curse and turn their backs on me.

55
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,860
I'm seriously a loser, right?

56
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,640
You're being an even bigger loser by harboring these types of feelings.

57
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,700
Don't think like that again, okay?

58
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,520
But you said you didn't want to get caught.

59
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,090
How do we get you inside?

60
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,690
Get up.

61
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,490
Come inside.

62
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,770
Let's go.

63
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,880
But it's a relief the person I got caught from was Su Jin.

64
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,300
Lee Su Ho: Sleep well.

65
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,970
 I pressed wrongly.

66
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,030
 You too.

67
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,970
- What's with Lee Su Ho?
- Did he just smile?

68
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,910
This is my first time seeing him smile.

69
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,950
He's so handsome!

70
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,290
Throw it away.

71
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,740
I said to throw it away! Did you not hear me?

72
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,510
Hey, Han Seo Jun. Are you not going to your classroom?

73
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,030
- I'm not going.
- Oh, I see.

74
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,150
Then where should I sit?

75
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,810
- Hurry up and go!
- I don't want to.

76
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,580
Hurry and go!

77
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,900
Oh, right. On the weekend, after we study, let's go to the sauna.

78
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,570
How's that?

79
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,960
Sauna?

80
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,050
Why? Let's go together. It's fun.

81
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,190
- Let's go together.
- I'm a bit...

82
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,890
Hey. What sauna? I hate hot things.

83
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,580
He always ate alone, but what's this?

84
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,230
Is he close with that girl?

85
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,610
I lost my appetite!

86
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,840
- Hey! After one bite?
- She must be on a diet.

87
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,160
That traitor. She's trying to get prettier.

88
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,410
Wow. It looks like God Su Ho is going to get rejected even without confessing.

89
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,850
Im Ju Gyeong? What is she saying?

90
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,380
You pitiful boy.

91
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,470
Bend down! Shh!

92
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,010
Why?

93
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,320
What do you mean why? Have you not heard the rumors?

94
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,140
But if it gets known that I'm dating you...

95
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,450
No! I'm not!

96
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,780
Look at her tail.

97
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,090
Catch this fox!

98
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,090
It's not me!

99
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,150
Does that make sense?

100
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,380
Of course, I should tell Su Jin and Su Ah.

101
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,490
But... I'm still embarrassed right now.

102
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,220
I am your boyfriend.

103
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,400
It's weird.

104
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,310
It's such a word that doesn't fit me.

105
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,110
Okay.

106
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,560
Career Aspiration Survey

107
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,790
Have you seen anyone from our school around here?

108
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,380
This place is an hour away from school, do you think they'd come this far?

109
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,310
But still...

110
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,420
Goodbye!

111
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,620
Welcome, I'll be your hostess. Would you like a table in the open area?

112
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,860
Somewhere covert with no CCTV and out of people's attention.

113
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,450
Oh, sure. Right this way, then.

114
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,520
These young little punks are already messing around at their age.

115
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,360
Take your time to look at the menu and then order.

116
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,180
Give us a couple set, please.

117
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,510
Something that only couples eat.

118
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,170
Since we are a couple, you see?

119
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,840
Yes, a couple set.

120
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,850
Couple...

121
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,240
No one can see us here, so we can be a little more obvious now.

122
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,980
Since I can't even talk to you at school, I barely feel like we're dating.

123
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,090
I can feel it, though.

124
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,310
It really hit me when I was changing this thing.

125
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,530
How did you save my contact information in your phone?

126
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,930
- I did—
 - Im Ju Gyeong.

127
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,250
- My name?
 - Yup.

128
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,940
What about it?

129
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,000
M-My name... It's pretty, yeah!

130
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,330
♡ Boyfriend♡

131
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,280
Enjoy your meal!

132
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,850
Do they usually only give you one fork for a couple set?

133
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,900
I wonder why?

134
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,840
Cutie pie.

135
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,020
They want us to act like that..?

136
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,350
Let's eat.

137
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,680
Here.

138
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,790
Oh! I'm sorry, I forgot—

139
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,820
Enjoy your food!

140
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,970
What should we eat?

141
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,890
Oh! Im Ju Gyeong?

142
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,630
Hide!

143
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,140
An Hyeong Gyu, what are you doing all the way out here?

144
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,700
- This is a trendy place!
- We come here pretty often.

145
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Speaking of, who did you come here with?

146
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,060
- B-b-by myself.
 - You came b-b-by yourself and ordered a couple set?

147
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,590
- Because the menu is really substantial.
 - That's true.

148
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,950
I see, you eat a lot more than I would have assumed. Enjoy your meal!

149
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,850
-  Gotcha!
 - No!

150
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,580
- Oh, excuse us.
 - Hey, hey. Let's give them some privacy.

151
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
Excuse me, Mr. Boyfriend? You shy guy.

152
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,850
- What do you mean b-boyfriend?
 - I should just expose—!

153
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,200
Nice to meet you, Im Ju Gyeong's boyfriend. I hope I can see your face next time.

154
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,630
Have a good time with your boyfriend.

155
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,890
Ju Gyeong, good luck!

156
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,130
I don't think this'll do. It's still dangerous when we travel an hour away.

157
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,080
We might run into another person from school, so I'm going to get going—!

158
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,740
Ah!

159
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,090
I brought you here because I wanted to show you something. Let's just see that before we go.

160
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,870
Aren't... you a fan of that person?

161
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,530
It's Selena!

162
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,760
OMG!

163
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,590
- Do you tend to use high-coverage products on your troubled skin areas?
 - Yes!

164
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:21,070
Actually, it's much better on your skin to use a gentle product like this one to color correct.

165
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,350
Please keep that in mind!

166
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,890
Now, I have a question for you all.

167
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,720
There is a prize, so focus!

168
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,990
When you are doing a foundation-free makeup look,

169
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,500
How can you make your skin look smooth without using concealer?

170
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,080
Me! Pick me!

171
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,930
Yes, the student in brown?

172
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,860
Using primer!

173
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,920
Primer? Primer... Correct!

174
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,590
You answered correctly, so come get your prize.

175
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,450
I won this!

176
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,290
I.. I-I'm a huge, mega fan of yours!

177
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,840
Can you sign this for me? To memorialize today.

178
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,460
One second,

179
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,300
It's a long story, but you gave me a new lease on life.

180
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,280
All of my friends compliment my makeup, and I learned everything from your videos!

181
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,890
Thank you!

182
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,220
This looks like shit.

183
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,000
I said, it looks like shit.

184
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,400
You say that you learned from my videos, but you chose this lip color?

185
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,930
Warm-toned colors all vary based on the vibrancy of the color.

186
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,870
Just one slight difference in tone with completely ruin your entire look.

187
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,220
Here, what do you think?

188
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,100
If you're going to half-ass your makeup like this,

189
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,960
Don't go around telling people that you learned from me.

190
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,980
Thank you, I'll try my best!

191
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,970
But still, you're doing way better than I did when I started wearing makeup.

192
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,590
Don't be discouraged, and keep working hard.

193
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,790
- Are you that happy?
 Yes! I'm so happy.

194
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,690
I don't really get it.

195
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,820
To me, it seems like you're better at makeup.

196
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,620
Hey, compared to Selena, I'm like a speck of dust in the wind.

197
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,160
I couldn't be on her level even if I tried.

198
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,940
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,200
That person had to start off somewhere, too.

200
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,300
But still, you're doing way better than I did when I started wearing makeup.

201
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,890
No way.

202
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,130
So when Mom said don't ride it, you shouldn't ride it.

203
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm sorry but I'm soft-hearted for sick people, so I have to side with her.

204
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,070
I'm known to be a filial son.

205
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,440
I'm not riding it because my mom told me so.

206
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,320
The bus will arrive momentarily.

207
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,200
Where are you going? The bus is here.

208
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,050
I'm going to run for my workout. Why?

209
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,070
See you later.

210
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,210
What the...?

211
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,810
Seriously what am I doing?

212
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,910
I'm sorry. I don't think I could meet you tonight.

213
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,920
- I wonder what's wrong.
- Mr. Jin Woo.

214
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,260
- If you're not busy tonight, will you come with me to buy a birthday present for the vice principal?
 - Pardon?

215
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm in charge of it but I don't think I can pick a man's present well by myself.

216
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,030
I'm not very good at picking presents either.

217
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:38,010
Should I come with you? I have to go get my wife a present at the department store.

218
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,020
Hello?

219
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,610
Mr. Jin Woo, I'll see you later.

220
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,650
No, I...

221
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,760
Im Ju, Im Ju! You got a boyfriend? Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,930
What school does he go to? Not our school, right?

223
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,950
Who says so?

224
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:13,930
I saw you at K-mall. You were trying so hard to hide him.

225
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,480
Hey! I told you it's not like that.

226
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,350
W-why are you so embarrassed? What's such a big deal to have a boyfriend?

227
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,620
You're really overreacting. Others might think you're dating a celebrity.

228
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,420
Tell me. Who is it? You got a boyfriend?

229
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,180
- That's not true.
- Then what is he talking about?

230
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,660
Jeez!

231
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,170
So I told you to confess, you dork.

232
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,250
What should I do with him?

233
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,460
Hey!

234
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,880
Go back to your seats.

235
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,740
Should we go to Prince Comics later?

236
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,840
Okay. Let's eat egg ramyun, too.

237
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,690
- Right! Send me the pic.
 - What picture?

238
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,590
The picture of us from the boat.

239
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,880
Why aren't you sending the picture?

240
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,360
Ahn Hyeon Gyu?

241
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,930
Why him?

242
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,910
He didn't see it yet.

243
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,100
Yes, I just have to get rid of the evidence.

244
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,910
I can do it.

245
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,310
- Sorry.
 - It's okay.

246
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,180
Okay!

247
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,130
Korean History teacher is present!

248
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,680
Take seat. How do you memorize the Japanese invasion of 1592?

249
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,550
I need to erase it before he realizes his phone is gone.

250
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,410
It would be nice to memorize it like this, right?

251
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:12,220
Fingerprint... Fingerprint... How do I get his fingerprint?

252
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,770
Is our Su Ah lecturing the science of sleep? She won't even notice when she's carried away.

253
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,920
She's so cute!

254
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,100
- Right! Fall asleep.
- Rest of you, focus.

255
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,960
Sleep. Sleep till you won't notice anything.

256
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,430
Why is he suddenly  so studious?

257
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,990
Go to sleep!

258
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,360
What the heck?

259
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,910
Sleep, you will fall asleep.

260
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,860
Fall asleep.

261
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,590
Fall asleep.

262
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,780
Abracadabra!

263
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,700
Check all the important points that I told you.

264
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,360
- Great!
- That's it for today. See you next time!

265
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,360
Why do you have my phone?

266
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,490
What is it?

267
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,810
Oh, it's nothing.

268
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,860
Excuse me.

269
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,220
What's wrong with her?

270
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,270
Wow, if Ahn Hyeon Gyu found out, it would've took few hours, no...

271
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,590
even other schools would've heard.

272
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,320
- You must be really scared that you might be dragged to the rooftop.
- That too.

273
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,340
But if others found out us dating, they'll be cursing.

274
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,890
Saying how could a guy like you date a girl like me.

275
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,320
What's wrong with you?

276
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,570
My face is so so, my grades are bad.

277
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,860
I fall very short compared to you.

278
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,180
You're enough.

279
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,490
You as yourself if enough for me.

280
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,200
So don't say such things.

281
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,030
Still, no one from our school come here except us two.

282
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,380
- Should we meet here all the time from now on?
 - Yes.

283
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,540
- Oh, who is this? It's Go Woon!
 - Unnie!

284
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:43,260
This place won't do either. I'll call you later.

285
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,930
Then good bye.

286
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,170
I think this is too young for his age. Should we exchange it?

287
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,470
I think they're all about the same.

288
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,060
Oh!

289
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,480
- Could you stand up for a sec?
- How did you get here?

290
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,170
Stand up.

291
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,430
Do you know her? Who is she?

292
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,300
I'm Im Hui Gyeong. Who are you?

293
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,030
- I'm Lee Hye Rim.
 - Right.

294
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,420
We're colleagues. For now.

295
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,610
Would that change in the future?

296
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,100
So you guys must be pretty close?

297
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,310
Like meeting separately and helping with the tie and stuff.

298
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,260
No, that's not it.

299
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,760
No no, forget it, forget it.

300
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,290
I'm going to go change my clothes.

301
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,730
 Lee Su Ho

302
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:54,550
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable at this time.

303
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,530
Why did you send me a message?

304
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,730
 Girlfriend

305
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:14,800
 I saved you as my boyfriend on my phone.

306
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,350
There was a shower earlier.

307
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:32,160
I know. We almost got rained on since we don't have an umbrella.

308
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,330
We are lucky.

309
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,520
Are you okay?

310
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,810
I guess we were unlucky.

311
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,090
What are you doing?

312
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,240
Huh?

313
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,380
Are you not coming up?

314
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,450
Oh, right.

315
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,310
Wait a moment. I will bring you clothes.

316
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:34,050
Okay.

317
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,880
- Do you want to eat?
- Should we watch TV?

318
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,190
- Do you want to watch TV?
- Let's eat!

319
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,780
Let's eat, you didn't eat dinner yet right?

320
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,870
I will make you something delicious- or should we order something so it comes quick?

321
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:00,980
I'm fine with anything.

322
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,260
You are okay with pizza, right?

323
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,410
What is this?

324
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,510
What is this room?

325
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:35,390
- Huh?
- It seems like you closed it tightly.

326
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,130
Did you hide something weird?

327
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:37,990
It's not that.

328
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:41,840
Is there like a corpse in there, like in the movies?

329
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,350
Are you curious?

330
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,890
 The door is unlocked.

331
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:03,020
You do music?

332
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,520
I wanted to.

333
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,720
Then how about now?

334
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:14,210
But after what happened to  Se Yeon, I couldn't anymore.

335
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:18,570
She taught me how to compose for the first time.

336
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:27,570
It was too hard to come into this room and see her, so I didn't come in here often.

337
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,890
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have.

338
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,990
But it's okay.

339
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,500
Maybe because you're in here with me.

340
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,120
Should we tell other kids that we're dating?

341
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,460
Why all of the sudden? You wanted to keep it a secret.

342
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,490
It seems like I just decided that on my own without asking you.

343
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,350
If you are dragged to the rooftop?

344
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,780
I'll just be dragged, I guess!

345
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,660
I don't care either way.

346
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:59,120
It doesn't change the fact that you are my girlfriend.

347
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:09,210
You know the song you let me listen to before, you said it isn't released right?

348
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,620
Did you compose that song?

349
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,650
Yeah.

350
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:19,330
Se Yeon made the lyrics.

351
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,990
I see.

352
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,790
The song was really good.

353
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,280
Do you want me to play?

354
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,930
Yeah!

355
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,690
I quit piano after playing Beyer's first book when I was younger.

356
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:44,550
It's been a while for me too, so don't have high expectations.

357
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,900
It's a sound coming from outside the window!

358
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,360
Is it about to rain? I hear thunder.

359
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,530
The piano sounds so good! It's an expensive one, right?

360
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,510
I'll go get it real quick.

361
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,280
Wait.

362
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,690
Thank you, eat it well!

363
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,050
Thank you.

364
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,620
I was going to clean up.

365
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,160
But the house is already clean. There's nothing to put away.

366
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,240
Why is there alcohol in a house that a student lives alone in?

367
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,960
This expensive thing...

368
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:39,100
I don't know if this has gone bad. I should try it.

369
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,770
Su Ho, this ahjussi is just going to have a taste.

370
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,800
So it's not obvious.

371
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,680
Do you want to eat while watching the movie?

372
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,790
Delicious smell!

373
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,380
What should we watch?

374
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:39,430
Hm, do you want to watch a horror movie?

375
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,840
Something else.

376
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,650
Why? Can you not watch something scary?

377
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:48,080
It rained earlier, so there's good music movies that are good.

378
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,380
You are a total fan of horror comic books, yet you can't watch horror movies?

379
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,340
We already read comic books everyday, so we don't have to watch horror movies too.

380
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,090
It's okay, it's okay. If it's scary, I will cover your eyes for you.

381
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,590
It's not that bad!

382
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,730
Turn off the light! We have to watch horror movies in the dark.

383
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,080
How about something more fun?

384
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,090
 He is on a date with his girlfriend.

385
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:06,910
 You're such a nuisance!

386
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,580
Here you go.

387
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,890
 Our Su Ho is a man.

388
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,180
You really haven't watched horror movies, huh?

389
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:04,260
Ghosts don't come out in scenes like this.

390
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,920
You said they don't come out!

391
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,820
Dad?

392
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:22,910

01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:31,630
♫ Love so fine ♫

394
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:36,580
♫ Come closer to me and lean in my embrace ♫

395

♫ You're always on my heart, I think I'm in love with you  ♫

396
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:50,690
♫ Every moment with you ♫

397
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,410
<font color="#ff80ff"><b>TRUE BEAUTY</b></font>
♫ seems like a dream  ♫

398
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,420
 I miss you.

399
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,990
 Me too.

400
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:59,270
Since when were you guys dating? Why didn't you tell me?

401
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,990
 Me and Han Seo Jun?

402
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:04,990
 Ju Gyeong, should I confess after giving this to him?

403
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:08,160
 Have you ever liked the same girl as your close friend?

404
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,480
 No!

405
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,400
 Why are you guys coming in together?

406
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,980
 I don't like seeing you guys talk or even meet eyes.

407
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,600
 Then we can't see each other?
