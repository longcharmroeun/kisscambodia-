1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,640
You're here.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,600
I don't know why.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,740
But it just happened.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,970
That day after school

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,510
I saw Xiaodong sitting on his chair, alone.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,000
So I was thinking.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,970
Shall I go there and talk to him?

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,010
Pretend that it was quite normal.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,890
And it has to be like I was just passing by.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,080
Then I saw there's a mug

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,020
on the top right corner of his desk.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,920
Then suddenly I sprained my ankle.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,750
And accidentally knocked his mug down on the floor.

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,710
So I can pretend to apologize to him.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,110
And acted like

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm so sorry, Xiaodong.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,080
Like I was very shocked.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,340
And also, our hands touched accidentally.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,000
My hand got cut by the mug pieces.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Xiaodong put this band-aid for me.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,640
I want this on my finger forever.

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,040
Then I apologized to Xiaodong.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,000
And asked him

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,030
if we can drink tea together later.

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,440
I would buy a new mug for him.

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,450
How about this, I'll buy you a new one.

27
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,240
No, no, it's okay.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,220
No, no. I insist.

29
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,160
I broke this one, I must compensate for this.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,610
What deep down, I was thinking.

31
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,670
So I can date Xiaodong.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,890
In fact, Shaoqi was not quite a good actress.

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,370
Because I can see her motive before she came.

34
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,240
Sitting on her chair, she kept
looking at me with smile on her face.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,550
If she wanted to talk with me,

36
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,180
she didn't need to break my mug.

37
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,950
Cause that is a limited edition.

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,380
It is quite expensive.

39
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,390
How about this, I'll buy you a new one.

40
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,420
No, no, It's okay.

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,520
No, no. I insist.

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,320
I broke it, I must buy you a new one.

43
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,380
But since she asked me
to have tea later, so sincere.

44
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,200
Then I'll go.

45
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,710
But all of those are not important.

46
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,850
So expensive!

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,060
I'm so screwed.

48
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,020
My heart was like a prairie with
ten thousand mythical creatures just ran over.

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,050
Why it has to be that expensive?!

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,280
It's like crazy.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
It's just a counterfeit.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,580
A counterfeit of a cup.

53
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,390
It's my allowance for a month.

54
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,010
I feel I was completely a psycho.

55
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,680
Gosh.

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,060
Why is that so expensive!

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,130
Xiaodong, you're away too far!

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm the one who sold the counterfeit mug online.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,430
When I saw it happen.

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,100
I knew Shaoqi will buy it.

61
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,370
Don't ask me why.

62
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,140
Heaven's secret must not be divulged.

63
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,350
And I defined it as relationship tragedy.

64
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,420
Once it's broken.

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,520
You'll get attention of the one you love

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,170
And win his/her heart.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,830
I still have two more.

68
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,660
Not expensive.

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,880
Just around one thousand.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,470
Do you want one?

71
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,400
It's quite a bargain.

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,380
Buy a mug, I'll give you a match bracelet.

73
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,330
Quite a bargain.

74
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,300
What mug accident?

75
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,620
I don't know.

76
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,700
I went to do my own business yesterday.

77
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,250
I was not there.

78
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,750
What did I do yesterday?

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,330
Can you cover me with mosaics?

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,310
I went to Director Yan's office to scrawl.

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,930
He doesn't know it yet.

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,460
About the mug accident.

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,930
We were there.

84
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,710
We saw the whole thing.

85
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,550
We saw business opportunity at once.

86
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,600
Can a mug make you rich?

87
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,850
Of course not.

88
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,600
So we decided to lead a mug fashion.

89
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,310
If you want to chat with the one you love.

90
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,550
Break his/her mug!

91
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,660
It's alright.

93
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Sorry, sorry.

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,950
What? Meijing. Want to chat with me?

95
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,580
There's a very good movie on show.

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,720
This Is Not What I Expected. Have you watched it?

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,240
I have

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,820
I love the song in it.

100
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,000
Now all the mug sellers are our employees.

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,250
We'll spread the "mug chat" to every corner of our school.

102
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,510
of our country.

103
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,290
of our whole world.

104
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,650
Miss Xinyi.

105
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,610
I broke your mug accidently.

106
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,120
Why did you break mug?

107
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,300
I...I slipped.

108
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,530
You slipped?

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,910
As a man,

110
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,140
are you spineless?

111
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,420
You slipped?

112
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,880
I...I will buy you a new one.

113
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,590
No.

114
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,950
I like this very mug.

115
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
Pick it up.

116
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,370
But it's broken.

117
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,320
Stick it up.

118
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,740
So about mug.

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,750
This is mine.

120
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,270
If you're no more single.

121
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,080
Remember, come and break my mug.

122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,510
If you're still single.

123
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,970
Remind me first.

124
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,310
So I can hide this to avoid misunderstandings.

125
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,860
And my mug is made of stainless steel.

126
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,040
You must do your best to throw it on the ground.

127
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,480
Smash it.

128
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,120
Otherwise, I won't know your motive.

129

Episode 08

159
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,860
What're you doing?

160
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,830
I want you to stay by my side, okay?

161
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,470
Aren't you always so arrogant in front of me?

162
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,900
How many times have I told you?

163
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,300
Don't say anything happened at home in school!

164
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,340
Answer my question.

165
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,850
Stay with me, will you?

166
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,430
No.

167
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,250
You know what?

168
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,230
Now, with you by my side.

169
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,120
I feel so happy.

170
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,120
So stay with me, by my side.

171
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,810
Be closer to me.

172
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,460
No.

173
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,770
Just a little closer. Please.

174
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,220
No.

175
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,860
Just a little closer, a tiny little closer.

176
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,640
So I can copy your answer.

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,850
Why won't you let me see it?!

178
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,420
I didn't review!

179
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,300
How is that?

180
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,310
Sorry, I failed.

181
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,110
Then what shall we do?

182
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,540
We'll fail English.

183
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,270
Xiaodong. What about you?

184
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,650
Completely blank.

185
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,370
Aren't you an all-around idol?

186
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,450
I devoted all my time to singing and dancing.

187
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,600
My study is my broker's job.

188
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,050
So we're on our own.

189
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
On our own?

190
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,800
Are you gonna start to study now?

191
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,040
There's not much time left.

192
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,810
We'll challenge the limit of tiny-mini cheat sheet.

193
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,950
Interesting. Never done that. I'll try that too.

194
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,360
Fine, seems it's my only way.

195
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,830
It's the smallest I can write.

196
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,210
Yes, it's quite small.

197
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,910
Then where shall we hide it?

198
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,760
What're you doing?

199
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,100
Nothing, monitor. Don't take us wrong.

200
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,180
Are you cheating?

201
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,950
I'm in.

202
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,150
Me too.

203
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,010
And me.

204
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,640
The most important thing is, how will you take it in?

205
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,620
Well, first, stuff it in the water tag.

206
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,690
Second, in the towel.

207
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,030
Third, in the pencil box.

208
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,570
Then I'll hide it between my arms.

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,070
Mine is on my fan.

210
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,840
Then I'll hide it in my clothes.

211
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,360
You know how important the English exam is, right?

212
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,920
Of course.

213
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,330
So, as the monitor.

214
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,730
I will not give up on anyone.

215
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,770
Until the last minute.

216
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,680
Hands.

217
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,220
Three. Two. One.

218
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,600
May the cheat win.

219
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,040
Okay, examination begins.

220
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,790
Put away your pencil box.

221
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,190
No food or drink.

222
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,650
Put away your drinks.

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,410

It's not just wrong answers.

234
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,400
Wrong answers

235
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,420
and beyond my imagination.

236
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,050
How can you face your textbooks?

237
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,380
If your textbooks can sue you,

238
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,100
you'll all be in the court
and sentenced to death, you know?

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,630
Me and Yezi

254
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,090
have been nice friends since kindergarten.

255
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,660
The way I thought,

256
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,920
I thought we're good friends.

257
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,800
We've known each other for so long.

258
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,850
We share so many hobbies.

259
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,350
But this Yezi, she is too naughty.

260
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,460
She is away too far, your honor!

261
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,440
Here is what she did.

262

Who is the famous four in Tang Dynasty?

Harry Potter and Hermione.

265
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,340
Do you call it your answer?

266
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,700
Who is Du Fu, which kind of poetry did he write?

267
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,480
She wrote. Egg pie.

268
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,220
Are you kidding me?

269
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,700
You're crazy!

270
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,710
Sorry, honor.

Hello, everyone.

Who?

284

A hundred years.

285
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,160
You never succeed. Yet you're still trying!

286
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,400
Stop! No more apples.

287
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,750

How many times shall I say it? silence!

289
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,270
You're in court.

290
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,910
Show some respect to the court.

291
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,140
To the judge, will you?

292
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,530
Back to the point.

293
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm the Math, Physics and Chemistry representative.

294
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,710
I always the modern science is the greatest!

295
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,440
But since I met them,

296
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,900
Zhu Shanqi's answer of Biology.

297

What will happen when you put starch and iodine together?

298
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,260
Her answer, bread.

299
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,460
How hungry are you?!

300
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,910
Chemistry. Zhu Shanqi's answer.

301
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,740
How to tell nitrite from salt?

302
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,350
Try it. The nitrite is toxic.

303
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,550
Your honor. It's pure pseudoscience!

304
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,170
I want justice!

305
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,870
Silence. Silence.

306
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,370
Look, Newton is so pissed.

307
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,630
Any other prosecutors?

308
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,550

Hi, I'm Han Meimei.

310
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,280
We're not fine!

311
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,690
Yezi's translation for "Warm in winter and cool in summer"

312
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,810
is "East warm summer cool"

313
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,060
English question, what will happen in earthquake?

314

316
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,490
What?!

317
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,680
Your honor.

318
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,220
I'm always by Yezi's side.

319
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,340
I spent all my time on her.

320
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,410
Hope she can carry out my master's lifework.

321
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,650
To lead us through Jurassic Period and Cretaceous period.

322
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,040
I devoted my life to her.

323
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,100
But she...

324
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,300
History exam.

325
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,190

Snow White.

327
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,470
You've seen too many cartoons.

328
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,060
How could that be?

329
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,640
So miserable.

330
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,270
I couldn't stand it.

331
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,880
The statement part is so clear.

332
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,160
Anything else you want to say?

333
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,520
Defendants.

334
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,320
You will not get away today.

335
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
Now, I announce that...

336
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,060
Wait.

337
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,910
Your honor.

338
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm the defense lawyer.

339
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,590
I know they are all sinned.

340
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,730
But I'd like to say something.

341
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,900
Although they acted so poorly,

342
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,480
they have their reasons.

343
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,290
That's my statement.

344
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,180
I beg your honor to give them
another chance to correct their wrongs.

345
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,000
A chance?

346
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,790
Why should we give you any chance?

347
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,240
Look at you, class ten.

348
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,640
How many students failed in the mid-term examination?

349
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,280
Look, in class one.

350
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,420
I'm the only one who failed.

351
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,750
Your honor.

352
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,270
Please give me another chance!

353
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,990
My belly didn't feel well in examination, so I failed.

354
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,610
Please give me another chance to make up for it!

355
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,820
Our school regulation.

356
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,090
Student who fails over four courses

357
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,750
will be suspended for surveillance.

358
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,690
Suspended for surveillance...

359
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,950
How many did I fail?

360
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,670
No need to ask.

361
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,680
You failed all seven courses.

362
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,680
But the headmaster have mercy on you all.

363
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,750
He gave you another chance.

364
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,090
There's a make-up examination in three days.

365
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,070
All the students who failed your examination.

366
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,080
Do cherish your last chance, okay?

367
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
Otherwise...

368
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,900
It's very hard to imagine.

369
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,590
You can get such a score.

370
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,890
Wu sir and me begged headmaster
so hard and got you one chance.

371
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,340
All of you, go to this moron's home tonight to study.

372
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,340
Who is that moron?

373
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,870
You think you're that indispensable?

374
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,410
We can study by ourselves!

375
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,720
Man up! Come with me!

376
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,420
God! We need you!

377
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,020
Help us!

378
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,590
If we fail again, we're to be dismissed!

379
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,820
You can't leave.

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,190
You can't leave us! You can't!

381
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,700
Master! You can't leave!

382
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,860
God. Don't leave!

383
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,510
Me and brother Yihan will help you
with this make-up examination.

384
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,490
I know you will, but why my brother?

385
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,920
You're his sister.

386
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,890
How could you not know

387
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,470
he was the top score in our city years ago?

388
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,690
The best among all the greatest students.

389
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
Danyi. Low profile. Low profile.

390
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,710
Let bygones be bygones.

391
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,320
That's all some rumors. Rumors.

392
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,050
Brother, I didn't know you're so good.

393
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,730
Of course.

394
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,590
Brother Yihan. Since they don't believe it.

395
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Show them.

396
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,740
Since that,

397
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,540
I will not hide it anymore.

398
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,950
I'll show you some problem solving methods.

399
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,380
What's the most important thing?

400
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,890
Tell me.

401
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,710
Diligent!

402
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,380
Use your heart to feel every topic.

403
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,650
Of course. When you solve those problems

404
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,370
there're some secret methods.

405
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,620
Since you're all sitting here sincerely.

406
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,110
I'll show you a little.

407
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,900
Sorry, haven't done it for many years.

408
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,770
It became a little rusty.

409
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,300
Correct.

410
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,980
Correct.

411
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,150
Correct.

412
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,000
Correct.

413
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,030
Last one.

414
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,630
All correct.

415
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,320
Brother, you're awesome!

416
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,800
Let us try it.

417
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,270
Use my heart. Yeah!

418
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,030
No.

419
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,650
Go.

420
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,640
Use my heart to feel.

421
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,940
You go.

422
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,090
Brother Yihan.

423
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,460
I don't think they can win by this.

424
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,110
Let's start from the foundation.

425
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,910
Am I right?

426
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,760
Students.

427
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,160
Danyi and I discussed a little.

428
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,900
That move is too complicated for you.

429
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,230
Not easy to perform.

430
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,410
But, now I have a simple version for you.

431
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,870
What's the secret about the examination?

432
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,820
Do it quick!

433
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Attention, attention.

434
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,890
Before it turns pink.

435
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,090
You must pick it up, up, up!

436
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,800
Then add all the dishes in.

437
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,290
Here, here,here.

438
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,920
-Fill them all.
-Good.

439
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,950
Until you see all of them under the water.

440
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,790
Then stir it, stir, stir.

441
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,980
Use your sauce.

442
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,570
Stir it, stir, stir!

443
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,590
Speed, speed, speed.

444
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,380
Am I doing it right?

445
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,050
Yes, yes, yes.

446
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,110
What're you guys doing?

447
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,620
What do you see? What's in it?

448
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,910
There's sesame paste. Peanut oil.

449
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,160
My oyster sauce and lettuce.

450
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,180
All kinds of things.

451
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,090
Hurry, pick them up. Pick up.

452
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,900
Stir, stir.

453
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,350
Speed, speed, speed.

454
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,810
Okay, done.

455
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,430
Now it's time to feel your heart.

456
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,810
Begin.

457
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,630
How do you feel?

458
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,230
Why my tears are coming out?

459
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,420
Because I added onion in it.

460
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,390
Brother, you're the best.

461
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,610
I really feel I'm improving!

462
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,390
So delicious.

463
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,710
Shouldn't we be doing exercises?

464
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,680
Now let's begin to study.

465
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,300
Lad Danyi.

466
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,600
Actually, I can help them read the topics.

467
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,910
Brother, you've helped us a lot.

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
You can go back to rest now.

469
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,980
Page one.

470
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,080
I can help them...

471
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,250
Question one.

472
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,530
There're many questions...

473
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,640
Our state system is people's democratic dictatorship.

474
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,610
- People's
- Students

475
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,550
- its authenticity...
- Study hard, but also rest well.

476
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,340
What are our citizens' political rights and obligations?

477
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,350
The right to vote and to be voted,

478
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,370
political liberty, right of supervision.

479
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,170
The right to vote and to be voted
are citizens' democratic rights.

480
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,130
Look, M equals X, which is greater than minus one.

481
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,030
Then which is the right answer?

482
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,150
A. O contained in M.

483
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,620
B. O contained in M, but M doesn't contain in O.

484
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,000
C. Null set contained in M

485
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,530
D. O equals or contained in M

486
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,450
Which one will you choose?

487
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,700
M.

488
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,040
A. B. C. or D.?

489
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,020
M.

490
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,850
Choose one from the four options.

491
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,230
So difficult. M.

492
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,990
Let's draw a number axis.

493
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,730
This is Zero, this is minus one, this is X.

494
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,890
You did it!

495
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,470
I didn't know which one shall I choose.

496
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,130
- You're great!
- Ye Muxi!

497
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,520
Listen to me.

498
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,980
Don't play with your pen, listen carefully.

499
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,870
M.

500
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,460
Choose A.

501
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,290
Zero is contained in this!

502
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,140
So the answer is three plus two equals X

503
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,180
Then this...

504
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,480
This is the final answer.

505
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,280
Got it?

506
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,310
Did you feel some cold air?

507
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,230
I felt it.

508
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,170
So gross.

509
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,520
I agree.

510
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,700
Let's back on this.

511
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,230
I've checked it.

512
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,260
The god of examination

513
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,610
will come to the third house at 3 p.m.

514
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,890
Good fortune!

515
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,170
Nice state today. I'm ready.

516
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,580
Full red, full blue, full benefit.

517
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,650
I'm ready, let's rock!

518
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,780
We're ready to become the superstar!

519
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,600
Doraemon with ten fingers.

520
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,100
After a whole night's special training.

521
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,120
We will definite score.

522
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,790
Because we have cheat sheet.

523
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,600
Wipe it now.

524
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,800
I'm not ready, what shall I do?

525
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,330
Anyway.

526
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,300
We all studied in my home.

527
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,710
And the results.

528
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,360
Let me put it this way.

529
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,230
The world is fair.

530
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,040
As you sow so shall you reap.

531
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,950
Actions speak louder than words.

532
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,390
Do the best if you're gonna do it.

533
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,000
And...

534
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,060
Whatever.

535
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,960
Me?

536
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,030
Do you think I will tell you
I got the lowest criterion of all seven examinations?

537
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,480
It's not luck.

538
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,450
It's my ability. Ability.

539
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,810
We were so happy.

540
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,710
We had no idea what kind of dangerous thing was waiting for us.
