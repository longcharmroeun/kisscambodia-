Episode 12

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,180
Lian Danyi.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,790
You really don't want to know what I'm gonna tell you?

33
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,810
Did you already know?

34
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,330
Are you pretending you don't know or you really don't?

35
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,140
It's the first time someone expresses her love to me.

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,490
Can't fall asleep.

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,130
What should I do?

38
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,590
I love you.

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,200
So distressing.

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,150
[Once upon a time...]

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,580
The deadline is closing.

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,510
I haven't finished it.

43
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,670
So distressing.

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,900
How could this be helpful?!

45
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,700
[Hello, Word.doc. My head is full of complicated thoughts.]

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,780
[Can't sleep....]

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,090
[So I want to write it to you. I... A girl ... She...]

49
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,810
What am I doing here?!

50
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,390
No textbook has written anything about this.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,420
Forget it. Just ignore it.

52
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,080
Welcome to come into the secret man's live room.

53
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,240
Today, your secret man is gonna show you...

54
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,010
Weight lifting.

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,100
Another side.

56
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,330
Friendly reminder:

57
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,210
Keep working out.

58
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,350
Because there's always someone
stronger than you in the world.

59
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,370
And they're also practicing hard.

60
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,210
Like me.

61
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,100
Don't give up.

62
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,220
Thank you for your gift.

63
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,850
Sister.

64
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,250
I...I...

65
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,180
It's live.

66
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,810
Look, look, so many fans.

67
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,150
They sent me so many things.

68
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,470
Here, allow me to introduce.

69
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,500
She is our wonder girl, Yezi.

70
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,160
My most beautiful, most lovely sister.

71
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,890
What're you looking at?

72
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,300
This...

73
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,310
Brother, do you know your deadline is in three days?

74
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,120
I know.

75
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Don't say it.

76
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,320
It's live.

77
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
What if the producer saw this?

78
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,210
Sorry, every body.

79
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,440
This is your secret man.

80
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,460
Although my sister is very beautiful.

81
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,620
But lately, she is a little delusional.

82
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,900
How many have you written?

83
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,630
They will see this.

84
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,150
Of course I wrote some.

85
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,890
I'm working very hard.

86
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,150
You know what...

87
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,210
I'm your sister. You think I don't know you?

88
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,330
You haven't written any, right?

89
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,110
How is that possible?!

90
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,660
Last night, you don't know.

91
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,630
That speed is like flying.

92
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,040
Like a ghost hand.

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,700
No, no, don't touch it. Don't...

94
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,980
It's blank.

95
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,430
Well...

96
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,190
I've got to go now.

97
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,320
Have fun.

98
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,550
Live forever. More gifts.

99
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,030
Don't forget to send more gifts.

100
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,930
Now I'm running away from my delusional sister

101
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,600
And turning to a quiet place.

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,580
Let's continue.

103
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,500
Next is called sword swallowing.

104
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,720
Sword, okay?

105
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
Awesome, right?

106
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,770
Must be a long night yesterday.

107
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,120
Who...

108
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,030
Don't, don't...

109
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,340
Brother!

110
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,410
You've been watching SNH48's concert for a whole night?!

111
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,870
No, I...

112
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,810
It popped out. I don't know when.

113
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,450
Look... You have been watching it for a whole night!

114
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,580
Look, I...

115
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,810
I really did work last night.

116
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,190
I'll show you if you don't believe me.

117
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,550
Look.
[Once upon...]

118
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,560
Two words?

119
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,250
Yes, but.

120
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,270
You know it's hard right?

121
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,940
Once I started.

122
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,230
I will finish it right away.

123
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,940
Anyway, before I come back.

124
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,390
You must finish it.

125
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay, okay, okay.

126
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Don't worry. I promise.

127
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,110
Before you come back tonight.

128
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,390
I will finish it.

129
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,470
To create a beautiful tomorrow for myself.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,980
I'm... I'm on it. Thinking.

131
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,750
Please, do me a favor.

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,810
Then don't forget to tell Wu Sir about

133
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,670
the first mysticism conference in our class.

134
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,490
Okay.

135
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,420
Deal.

136
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,480
Guan Xinyi.

137
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,370
You're waiting.

138
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,060
Yes.

139
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,000
No, no, I'm not waiting.

140
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,200
You're waiting for your destiny.

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,660
I saw fire in your eyes.

142
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,110
You must be a Virgo.

143
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,260
Yeah. How can you tell?

144
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,250
Virgos are all sensitive and sharp.

145
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,830
Very powerful among women.

146
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,500
I'm a Capricornus.

147
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,880
I know you Virgos the best!

148
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,670
Capricornus? Capricornus and Virgo are the best!

149
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,420
But...

150
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,100
Lately, Virgos are not quite lucky in love affairs.

151
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,020
What is that?

152
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,230
Follow me.

153
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,880
What is that?

154
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,790
Lately, Venus is retrograding.

155
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,880
Venus retrograding?

156
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,490
Yes.

157
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,380
Once upon a time,

158
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,490
there's a restaurant.

159
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,990
They're very strict with the food material selecting.

160
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,080
Chef is quite skillful with his knife.

161
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,980
They way he performs his knife is amazing.

162
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,990
Right.

163
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,950
Yezi seems quite busy lately.

164
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,300
I should make something nice for her.

165
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,620
Make two big dishes.

166
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,600
Seems this won't be enough for any big dish.

167
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:13,990
No.

168
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,740
I must make something delicious for Yezi.

169
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,240
Need to go out shopping.

170
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:07,440
Hi, Guan Xinyi.

171
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,430
You...

172
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,290
You are too direct.

173
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,150
[I decline.]

174
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,190
No. Too official.

175
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,250
What am I writing here?!

176
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,250
Look, what's that?

177
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,560
What's that?

178
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,420
It's a mouse.

179
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,180
One more place to run into Guan Xinyi easily.

180
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,190
After this one, I will be safe today.

181
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,390
One more place to run into Director Yan easily.

182
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,960
After this one, I will be safe today.

183
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,250
What're you doing here?

184
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,540
We sold director Yan's bike by accident yesterday.

185
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
So we're hiding here.

186
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,470
You two are so bold.

187
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,580
What're you doing here?

188
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,200
Right.

189
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't know why I am hiding here, either.

190
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,370
I'm home.

191
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,210
You're home.

192
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,410
Come, come on.

193
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,260
See what I have made for you.

194
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,000
Here, sit.

195
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,790
So many delicious things.

196
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,800
This is your favorite tomato chicken eggs.

197
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,230
A salad.

198
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,540
And fried chicken.

199
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,630
Hurry, eat.

200
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,880
You did these to celebrate your finished work?

201
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,620
Not yet.

202
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,820
But close.

203
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,270
Today, I'll watch you finish it.

204
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,130
No story, no sleep.

205
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,530
Okay.

206
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,540
Let's eat.

207
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,470
Go ahead.

208
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,930
Brother, how to cook this?

209
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,660
This one? Golden fried rice.

210
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,120
This is your brother's special dish.

211
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,770
First, rice.

212
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,360
Need to be the rice one night before.

213
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,870
Put two thirds egg into the rice and mingle it.

214
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,750
Then keep it in the fridge for fifteen minutes.

215
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,520
As for the one third egg,

216
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,690
leave it for the fried rice while you cook it.

217
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,370
Take it out, it will be
a wonderful golden fired rice.

218
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,650
Just like that,

219
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,730
Brother Ye and Yezi watched TV while eating snacks

220
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,980
and fell into asleep.

221
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,830
His story?

222
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,030
Not a single word.

223
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,620
The biggest problem since I was born.

224
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,820
Shall I discuss it with a girl? Will it help?

225
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,640
Speaking of that,

226
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,170
do I have any female friends?

227
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,000
Come here.

228
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,670
What for?

229
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,250
Shoot, what do you need me for?

230
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,390
I'm worrying about my brother.

231
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,640
He won't turn in his story on time. Shoot.

232
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,840
Shoot.

233
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,710
Begin.

234
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,520
I have to ask you something....

235
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,850
This thing...

236
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,570
Will you say it or not?

237
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,720
When did you become such a coward?

238
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,130
Shoot. Shoot.

239
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,530
You...

240
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,950
Has anyone told you they love you?

241
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,120
No.

242
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,620
Thanks.

243
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,500
Come back.

244
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,210
Tell me.

245
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,290
What's going on?

246
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,190
Tell me, what is that?

247
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,730
Nothing.

248
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,740
It's just...

249
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,080
I have a friend.

250
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,730
I have a friend, a girl told him she loves him.

251
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,920
Then he is quite distressing.

252
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,540
Didn't know what to do.

253
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,050
That friend.

254
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,710
He is a very good student.

255
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,960
Someone told you she loves you.

256
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,770
Usually that friend is yourself.

257
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,190
So, who confessed her love to you?

258
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,920
Hurry, no one is around, tell me.

259
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,270
I won't tell anyone.

260
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,750
Which blind girl told you she loves you?

261
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,150
The girl who confessed her love to my friend

262
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,890
is Guan Xinyi.

263
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,630
- Voice down!
- Guan!... Xinyi.

264
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,280
You?

265
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,190
And Guan Xinyi?

266
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,150
Well, Class One.

267
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,700
The most annoying one.

268
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,890
How did that happen?

269
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,300
Liao Danyi.

270
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,990
Let's date.

271
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,690
As from today,

272
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,320
I will do my homework with you.

273
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll stop laughing.

274
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,590
It's okay.

275
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,740
My friend didn't know what to do.

276
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,560
It's okay. Girls, you know.

277
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,970
I can understand her feeling.

278
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,890
So I really can help you.

279
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,070
We're classmates.

280
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,560
We should help each other.

281
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,450
But, before that...

282
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,040
You must do something for me.

283
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,650
What is that?

284
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,260
Your brother...

285
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,210
Life is just a journey.

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,850
Let go of things.

287
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,960
Things start from your heart.

288
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,190
Laugh will heal all the worries.

289
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,650
Words

290
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,230
They will come when it's time.

291
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,550
Is he gonna be immortal?

292
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,280
He is seriously ill.

293
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,270
Two heroes are back.

294
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,390
Please sit.

295
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,390
I'll tell you what I've realized lately.

296
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,300
Writing.

297
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,440
It needs to wait for the Muse.

298
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,210
When Muse comes, you'll write swiftly.

299
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,420
But...

300
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,720
Brother Yihan. Your job, are you doing well?

301
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,890
Don't mention my job.

302
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,020
My Muse hasn't come,

303
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,060
I need to wait for the wind.

304
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,700
God has his plan on me.

305
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,980
I can't stand it.

306
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,610
What're you doing?

307
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,160
I'm waiting for the wind.

308
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,090
Let's go.

309
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,950
- God is on his way
- Come

310
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,470
I'm waiting for the wind.

311
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,850
Why're you dragging me here?

312
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,150
My Muse is on the way.

313
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,880
Brother, look at that.

314
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,390
What is that?

315
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,220
Look at there.

316
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,620
At last, here.

317
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,000
What did you see?

318
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,170
-This is your sister's room.
-Nothing.

319
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,150
This indicates her future.

320
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,770
This...

321
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,540
Understand?

322
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,580
What do you mean?

323
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,430
Look at this.

324
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,160
These garbage, means she can't live by herself.

325
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,410
Then there.

326
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,260
A bunch of toys.

327
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,070
She is playing toys still?

328
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,840
You can call her innocent.

329
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,120
But in a hard way,

330
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,370
It indicates she is a moron! Brother.

331
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,570
Right.

332
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,700
At last, here.

333
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,790
Those textbooks.

334
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,940
What did she draw on those textbooks!

335
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,090
Think about it.

336
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,330
When she enters into the society later,

337
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,150
when she has a meeting with her boss.

338
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,420
She still draws things on the book? Then...

339
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,410
So, brother.

340
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,670
You're not working just for yourself.

341
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,080
You did it for your sister.

342
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,370
You need to earn more money

343
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,610
to raise her up.

344
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,710
Otherwise, she will die!

345
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,400
Right , right

346
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,490
The worst possibility is that

347
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,530
she might smoke,

348
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,190
drink, fight.

349
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,130
Or even become a hooligan in the gang!

350
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,890
Do you understand? Brother?

351
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,440
Yes. I do

352
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,860
No, no!

353
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,130
Brother, calm down.

354
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,050
Right. calm down.

355
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,600
Right.

356
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,520
Danyi lad, you're very right.

357
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,200
I'm doing his for my sister.

358
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,580
Work hard.

359
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,780
For my sister.

360
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,470
For my sister.

361
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,790
I need to write.

362
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,740
I need to work hard.

363
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,750
Sister, brother was wrong!

364
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,820
I didn't think for you.

365
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,280
You're my stupid younger sister.

366
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,310
Don't say anything.

367
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,120
I'll go to work.

368
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,170
To fight for my sister.

369
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,560
Ye Muxi.

370
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,510
Ye Muxi.

371
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,050
To fight for my sister. Ye Muxi.

372
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,560
For my sister. For my sister.

373
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,750
Ye Muxi.

374
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,780
What did you tell him?

375
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,410
He has been fixed.

376
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,510
Nothing.

377
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,380
Just some statement about facts.

378
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,320
Finally, done!

379
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,360
Lad Danyi, sister.

380
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,510
Thank you both.

381
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,850
Brother, you changed quite fast.

382
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,600
Why?

383
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,330
Life is fragile.

384
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,680
But sometimes

385
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,670
To protect something more fragile.

386
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,880
We'll become strong.

387
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,860
You two go on chatting.

388
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,970
I'll go back to sleep.

389
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,150
Thank you.

390
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,590
Bye.

391
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,510
It's normal that you don't understand.

392
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,960
I didn't overestimate you.

393
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,960
Don't underestimate me. Listen to me.

394
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,080
I'm very smart.

395
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,970
Your friend's thing is on me.

396
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,350
Why do I feel it quite unrealistic?

397
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,740
Mr. dinosaur.

398
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,500
Please call me Mr. Wolong.

399
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,870
A little respect, please.

400
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,660
Mr. Wolong.

401
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,230
Long time no see.

402
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,110
Your hands are still so cute.

403
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,390
What can I do?!

404
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,920
I don't like this, either.

405
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,540
Why can't you give me a pair of strong hands to work?

406
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,850
Mine, too.

407
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,170
I think it's quite cute.

408
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,530
Look. You both look so serious.

409
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,190
But with such cute hands.

410
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,440
I think that makes you quite friendly.

411
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,960
Wonder girl is quite good at quibbling.

412
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,780
What is the matter today?

413
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,530
I want to ask you that...

414
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,240
How to refuse someone you dislike very much?

415
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:35,400
That, you have to ask Zhu Zhiwu.

416
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,640
Dead Horse magic, summon Zhu Zhiwu!

417
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,630
I'm Zhu Zhiwu.

418
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,610
Shoot.

419
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,420
Although I'm old, I know,

420
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,940
Love is like a battle.

421
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,710
It's always like this.

422
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,830
Why?

423
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,250
One country goes attack another.

424
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,690
It's like one person goes chase another.

425
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,700
Not only needs to call their force

426
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,600
To show their strength.

427
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,890
To make the other surrender.

428
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,020
Of course, when one country is weak.

429
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,390
The other country will ignore them.

430
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,450
Then it will go make ally with another country.

431
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,160
It's always like this

432
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,000
But what if this country wants to make ally with another

433
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,970
which doesn't want the same.

434
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,910
Then what?

435
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,900
Allow me to explain it to you.

436
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,880
What're you gonna do?

437
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,040
You asked her here.

438
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,600
What're you gonna tell her?

439
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,090
You don't need to know.

440
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,360
Since you helped my brother.

441
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Now I'll help you.

442
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,580
What you need to do is to be quiet,
cooperate with me, okay?

443
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,780
Hush. Come.

444
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,140
What're you doing here?

445
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,990
Guan Xinyi.

446
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,700
Do you love Liao Danyi?

447
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,410
It's none of your business.

448
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,100
Today, I called you here to tell you that.

449
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,870
You two are not possible.

450
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,080
Because, Liao Danyi...

451
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,010
He loves me!

452
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,360
- What?!
- What?!

453
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,050
Since we were young, one year old.

454
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,740
Before my mom worked overtime,

455
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,310
she would send me to his home.

456
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,440
He fell in love with me at the first sight.

457
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,990
It's quite miserable.

458
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,020
Over these ten years.

459
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,180
He is always chasing me.

460
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
First thing in the morning,

461
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,310
he will come knock on my door.

462
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,490
To pick me up to school.

463
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,810
But I keep refusing him.

464
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,840
I said no, we're not possible. No.

465
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,000
I didn't expect that made him changed to another way.

466
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,890
He started to cook for me.

467
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,300
I mean. bento?!

468
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,560
So I said, fine. You do it.

469
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,630
I won't eat.

470
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,250
But he keeps making that.

471
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,000
Now the bento even has his figure in it.

472
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,140
The whole school will see it.

473
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,920
I really...

474
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,690
Tell her, you tell her, tell her.

475
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,480
How much do you love me. Say it

476
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,410
And he also said,

477
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,590
if I won't accept him,

478
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,580
he will never accept any other girls.

479
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,650
So I say,

480
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,050
you two are not possible.

481
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,390
Just give it up.

482
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,880
So gross.

483
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,460
You tell her, you explain it to her.

484
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
Tell her, tell her.

485
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,450
Tell her.

486
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,080
Tell Guan Xinyi

487
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,800
how much you love me. Say it.

488
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,930
Or do you want she to accept you?

489
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,300
I love you.

490
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,210
But, why do you love me?

491
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,560
Cute.

492
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,610
Nonsense.

493
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
It's because I'm pretty.

494
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,630
I love you.

495
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,880
Pretty.

496
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,830
Damn it!

497
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,180
Problem solved.

498
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,020
Why did I trust you?

499
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,130
It's right to trust me.

500
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,300
I solved your problem.

501
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,770
So it's right to let me handle it.

502
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,850
Now problem solved.
